        <p>Cornelia watched smugly as I laid Helga on her bed, to allow her to catch her breath after the spectacular orgasm she had just experienced, her mind further strained by leveling up. As Helga leaned against her pillow, Cornelia coughed, which sounded suspiciously like the word weak. But I was convinced that it was just my misconception. </p><p>Definitely. </p><p>Still, when I turned to Cornelia, I was just smirking in amusement rather than feeling the anger that I would doubtlessly feel. But despite her habitual bitchiness, she somehow gained a place in my growing area of influence. Admittedly, her current mode of dress —a sexy corset, and nothing else, not even panties— made it much easier to convert what might have been annoying disobedience into sexy playfulness. </p><p>Taming Cornelia was still not a completed task. </p><p>“So,” she murmured as she took a step forward, not bothering to hide her arousal. “Your warm-up is over. Are you ready for the real fun?” </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said even as I watched her close the distance, still amused by the great change Cornelia was displaying. It wasn’t long ago that the only thing she felt against me was burning anger, and barely a couple of weeks ago, she didn’t even see me worthy enough to lick her shoes. A month ago, before I get a glimpse of her beautiful body on that fateful night at the library, I actually wasn’t worthy to lick those shoes. </p><p>Life was interesting. </p><p>My introspection didn’t last long, abandoned when I felt a pair of lips pressing against mine, initiating a searing kiss. Cornelia was showing a surprising level of initiative, as while she had clearly enjoyed the previous times we shared together, she wasn’t always as enthusiastic in the beginning. Though, it wasn’t particularly difficult to realize it was still about proving herself better than Helga, as any good woman from a proper lineage should be compared to one from a merchant family. </p><p>I grabbed her ass when she jumped, her legs wrapping around my waist. “You’re already hard,” she whispered into my ear as she stopped kissing for a moment. </p><p>“My physical prowess shouldn’t be surprising at this point,” I whispered back, making her shiver in anticipation. After all, just because she was trying to prove herself to be better than Helga didn’t mean that she wasn’t enjoying the treatment she started to receive. I slid my hand down her corset, using magic to untie the strings until it fell on the ground as well, finally revealing her deliciously lithe body. She might not have Helga’s curves, but no one could argue that she was any less sexy because of it. </p><p>She grabbed my hand and gently led me toward the empty bed in the room, her hips swaying excessively with each step. I sat on the bed, my legs parted, and she crouched in front of me, without the slightest prompting. “Delicious,” she murmured as she grabbed the crown between her lips, her hands gently dancing on my thighs. As a reward for her initiative, I sent a flood of mana through our erotic connection, rewarding her with another level. </p><p> [-916 Mana]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 18/25 - 2%] </p><p>She moaned in appreciation even as her movements froze, processing her level, while I made eye contact with Helga, who was slowly awakening from her explosive orgasm. The anal assault had been decisive enough without the addition of Cornelia’s fingers, which were rather skilled around the private parts of other women —an expected development considering the general direction of her taste. </p><p>I shared a conspiratorial smile with Helga while Cornelia impaled herself deeper onto my shaft, her lips swallowing enough of my shaft to trigger a little jump of anticipation. Still, Helga continued to lay as she tried to catch her breath, so I turned my focus back to Cornelia, letting my fingers slip through her flaming red hair. She moaned in genuine joy as she continued to swallow more of my length, showing that she had learned quite a bit from our earlier encounters. </p><p>She might have a poor personality, but still, she was really fitting to be my personal maid. And if I could simultaneously make the head of her noble family, even better. </p><p>A groan escaped my mouth as her tongue wrapped around my girth, and I pushed my hips forward in desire, finally penetrating into the tight grip of her throat. Despite my girth stretching her lips, I could see the twitch of a satisfied smile on her lips. It stayed there even as I started to thrust harder and harder, her tits jiggling under the constant rhythm. </p><p> Cornelia’s moans of joy started to echo louder, once again making me glad for the silencing ward, signaling that her lust had grown to an uncontrollable degree. Her hips started to move mindlessly even as she sucked, seeking stimulation, more than her silken lips could gain from my rock-hard shaft. Luckily, I saw Helga standing up in her bed, suggesting that Cornelia’s desires were not too far away. </p><p>At my level, multitasking was not a problem, which was why it was extremely easy to conjure a craft a strap-on for Helga from a distance, using more magic than material, while also allowing Cornelia to gain more experience. </p><p>[-1619 Mana]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 18/25 - 11%] </p><p>The redheaded beauty moaned in appreciation as she climbed toward another climax, her body giving in completely for the pleasure, alternating between providing an excellent suction and taking my girth to her throat, wondrous enough to make me moan. Even better, she didn’t show the slightest hesitation as I finally put my hand through her red hair, stealing the control from her in favor of furiously fucking her face.  </p><p>She just accepted my furious assault, enjoying the impact. </p><p>But as I saw Helga walking toward us, the crafted strap-on firmly affixed to her waist, and nothing else. Her curvy body looked delicious as always, her tits jiggling with each step as if they were begging me to abandon Cornelia and bury into their comfortable depth. However, the most important thing was her expression. colored with the excitement of revenge, enough to convince me to move onto the next step of our fun activities. I pulled out, which earned a disappointed hiss. “I wasn’t finished,” she slurred, her tongue addled with pleasure. </p><p>“No worries, sweetie, I have better things in mind,” I answered even as I grabbed her waist and raised her to her feet, only to bend her down from her waist and force her to turn toward Helga. </p><p>“W-what-” Cornelia tried to comment, only for me to slide into her wetness, losing the rest of her sentence in a moan of pleasure. More importantly, Helga used the opportunity to slide her strap-on into her mouth, neatly preventing any other argument. </p><p>She tried to moan in protest, of course, but I just chuckled as I caressed her back. “Come on, honey, Helga is just being a sweetheart and helping you climax, just like you have helped her to reach there many times. Don’t be an ingrate. It doesn’t fit your noble bearing.” </p><p>She didn’t say anything, mostly because she couldn’t say anything. Unless she started using spells, of course, but she was smart enough to realize I wouldn’t appreciate such an activity. Instead, she twisted and moaned, trying to protest —which, surprisingly, did little to actually push Helga away, or stop the furious dance of her hips as she was invaded by Helga’s toy —the only saving grace was I didn’t craft it to be particularly large, a bit thinner and shorter than my own, which meant proven ability to handle it without complications. </p><p>I tried to make eye contact with Helga, but her eyes were locked on Cornelia’s struggling face, her face contorted with dark satisfaction. An understandable reaction. She was not an aggressive person, but she wasn’t naturally meek like Marianne as well, and the only reason she acted passively against all the abuse she had received was the —justified— fear of being targeted by the more established nobles. </p><p>And while it could be argued that Cornelia offered her a fair deal before dragged her into the role of a sadistic release, logic was rarely a tool that could be used to handle resentment. Helga needed a release, and despite the underlying shift in roles and the implied insults, Cornelia was clearly enjoying being double-teamed, so all was well. </p><p>Realizing I wasn’t facing a fragile situation that forced me to maintain a constant observation, I shifted my focus back on Cornelia’s delicious body, impaling her aggressively, every push accompanied by another moan. </p><p>[-916 Mana]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 18/25 - 17%]</p><p>I decided to up the ante just as Cornelia started to tighten around my girth, trying to extract my seed, but failing to do so. I kept pumping without skipping a beat, but a simple cleaning spell ensured that her backdoor entrance was properly cleaned. I slipped a finger, earning a grunt, which would have been a bunch of words if it wasn’t for Helga’s toy, still invading her throat mercilessly.</p><p>I pushed forward, enjoying the way her tightness closed around my finger, getting even snugger as I added a second finger in short order. As usual, Cornelia’s tightness was spectacular, resisting my attempts to loosen her up successfully with an impressive resistance. Too bad that ultimately, it was doomed for failure, as the longer it continued, the more passionate Cornelia’s moans become, her red hair desperately sticking to her sweaty body. </p><p>Her moans of pleasure contrasted greatly with the gasp of disappointment when I pulled out of her, which was immediately followed by a louder moan of joy when I impaled her tight hole, especially as at the same time, I conjured a buzzing toy to plug her wet tunnel. With all three of her holes plugged in, Cornelia’s moans turned into a string of mindless gasps, her hips moving back and forth under the combined assault of me and Helga, picking up more and more speed. </p><p>Then, I watched as Helga pulled back and removed her strap-on, surprised by the sudden change. I hadn’t been expecting her to show mercy at this point. Then, she pushed her crotch against Cornelia’s lips as she grabbed her hair in a painful manner, replacing earlier shock with understanding. “Lick it, you smug bitch,” Helga exclaimed in a surprising manner, ignoring Cornelia’s shocked cry as her treatment got even rougher. </p><p>Still, much to my surprise, Cornelia actually followed Helga’s rude request, her tongue jumping out to caress Helga’s wetness. I couldn’t help but speed up even further, the collusion of flesh filling the room. Cornelia managed to achieve the impossible, and continued to get tighter and tighter as she moved toward another climax, while Helga’s unobstructed moans filled the room. </p><p>“Oh, yeah, just like that, bitch,” Helga continued, cursing in a very uncharacteristic manner as she tapped deeper into the frustration she accumulated as she tried to survive in Silver Spires, no doubt enhanced by the fact that her life was being targeted in a plot, and not even because anything she had done, but because she was a convenient target that wouldn’t be missed. Her free hand trawled down and arrived at Cornelia’s tits, slapping them mercilessly while tugging her hair even harder. </p><p>“Damn, girl,” I murmured in amusement, though my voice was also strained by a climax that was about to arrive. I transferred even more mana to Cornelia as she was proving to be an excellent sport, which deserved a special award. </p><p>[-2188 Mana]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 18/25 - 32%]</p><p>Her reaction to the flood of experience was another joyful moan that didn’t particularly stand up amongst the chain she was continuously letting out, enjoying the fragile balance that was established. Her expression was not visible, unfortunately, but Helga’s was, her usually stoic face contorted with pleasure as her long-time opponent’s tongue let loose over her most sensitive spot, displaying her breadth of experience. </p><p>Since Cornelia was enjoying spankings too much, I decided to join in. My hand landed on her perky ass, the clap echoing hard enough to suppress their moans. Cornelia clenched harder, while Helga’s attention finally turned back to me —which didn’t stop her hair pulling or tit slapping activities— her eyes shining with mirth. She was clearly enjoying her reward immensely. </p><p>“Lick faster,” Helga ordered as she maintained eye contact with me, her expression quirked deliciously. However, Cornelia failed to follow that particular order. Not because she suddenly decided to rebel, however. No, instead, she finally toppled over the cliff, the impact of her climax hitting her like a tackle of a rabid dragon, draining every single scrap of energy from her body as the pleasure replaced every single thought she possessed. </p><p>“Such a weakling,” Helga commented as she pulled back, merciless enough to make Cornelia hit the floor painfully if it wasn’t for my reflexes, immediately grabbing her from the waist, even as I started spraying insides. I would have liked to say that I disapproved of Helga’s sudden meanness, but that would have been a lie. It was extremely arousing to discover another facet of my blonde beauty, despite the extreme conditions it required to extract. </p><p>I was barely able to put Cornelia on her bed when Helga pushed me on the same bed and sat on my lap, managing to impale herself to my half-erect shaft —which didn’t take long to return back to full life thanks to my endurance. Just a searing kiss from Helga had been enough to complete the task. “Don’t be rude,” I said to her after the kiss, though failed to hide the mirth from my tone. It was more or less a fair payback considering their relationship up to this point. </p><p>“Hey, we’re still going to have a talk about hiding important information,” Helga countered, though she failed to add an angry tone to her words as her wet tunnel was finally impaled with something other than Cornelia’s adventurous fingers, her wetness spectacular. </p><p>“Really, what’s going to be my punishment, then?” I asked even as I grabbed her hips and pushed my shaft inside her to the hilt, forcing a delicious cry off her lips which killed her argument before she could even verbalize it. A few strokes into her core, and her entrance was wide open, sucking me deep into her presence. </p><p>“I - I don’t know,” she managed to stammer after a minute of uninterrupted moans, finding it hard to speak as my fingers dug into her generous chest, while her hips rose instinctively to meet my strokes. “J-just make me cum,” she ultimately requested. </p><p>“As you wish, milady,” I said with a wide smirk as I grabbed her waist and threw her on Cornelia’s body, creating a delicious mixture of red and blonde before I slipped inside her once more. We still had a few hours until the arranged mission time, and I wanted to help them level up as much as possible. </p><p>After all, assisting others to level up was the selfless thing to do. And I certainly felt like a saint as I penetrated Helga on top of the exhausted figure of Cornelia… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 443000 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 39    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 32      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 5070 / 5070	Mana: 2168 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 18/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 14/19] </p>
