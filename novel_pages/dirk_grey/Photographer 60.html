        <p>Carol felt encouraged by Amy’s challenging gaze and stuffed her panties into her mouth, but she was too distracted by the action itself to realize the helpless shiver Amy let out was one of pure desire. </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I leaned forward, picking a perfect angle to put both of their bodies on display. “Now, why don’t you give me a smug smile. After all, you have just captured your enemy,” I said. </p><p>Carol followed that order easily, her smile bright, unaware of the expression of desire Amy wore behind her, her reaction making it obvious that she had a kink for being tied up. Interestingly, she was not a pure submissive like Nicole, which was very easy to pick up. </p><p>My guess, it was the way her desire for Carol reflected through her poor self-perception. </p><p>“Now, grab her arms and force them behind her,” I ordered Carol, and she did so enthusiastically, somehow still missing the sexual context of the moment. Amy whimpered, which was suppressed by the panties in her mouth, while I took another amazing picture. </p><p>“Sorry about it. Was I too hard,” Carol asked, panicked, but Amy was quick to shake her head in protest. Amy shook her head rapidly, desperate to convince Carol to continue. </p><p>At that moment, I was a little disappointed that I had asked them to undress that much. They would have generated an amazing set of pictures, worth of an art gallery. Unfortunately, their nudity made that impossible. </p><p>And, since these photos were destined for my private vault, there was no harm escalating it even further. First, I reached and pulled off my belt, which made Carol look excited, and Amy disappointed … and their expressions shifted once I passed it to Carol with an order. “Tie her hands behind her.”</p><p>“I don’t know … isn’t a bit much,” Carol murmured. </p><p>I could have handled her concern in a lot of different ways. I could have slowly explained to her that it was just a part of the game, talked about our business potential, or pointed out that Amy clearly enjoyed it. </p><p>I chose a more direct route. “Do it,” I ordered, using my best command voice that I saved exclusively for my most disobedient models. Carol’s hands immediately moved, wrapping the belt around Amy’s wrists, immobilizing her. </p><p>However, despite the amazing vision, I focused on Amy’s expression. Her sudden frustration was simply too beautiful. She clearly hated the fact that I ordered Carol around … but not enough to actually spit out her primitive gag and speak out. Not when it would mean her dream scenario would be over. </p><p>I stayed focused on her face as I took several masterful photos. That expression needed to be immortalized. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I looked at Carol, who shivered under the sudden sharpness of my tone, not mentally ready to lose the playful competition. I realized she wouldn’t react to that tone too much. </p><p>Luckily, I had a better lever. I returned my fun tone. “Why don’t you come here and we can see just how long your brave roommate can resist the temptation,” I suggested before I looked at Amy. “The signal is nod, shake, nod. Do it, and we’ll stop,” I said. </p><p>Amy’s eyes widened as Carol reached to my side and pushed my pants down, realizing exactly what her next challenge would be. Her expression was beautiful, wistfulness, frustration, desire, loss… I took another picture of her expression, confident that it would earn me at least one reward if I could convince Amy to sign the release. </p><p>What an unexpected benefit. </p><p>“Now, start the show,” I whispered to Carol. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she whispered excitedly as she fell onto her knees, her fingers already around my shaft, and her lips not too far behind. Her eyes stayed closed, but that didn’t hide the expression of bliss as she finally started. </p><p>After taking a few photos of Carol — which was definitely not destined for any competition — before I took two more photos of Amy, both focused on her face to catch her emotional conflict. The realization that her precious roommate had feelings for giving a man an excellent blowjob, and the pain of her thinking that would be the closest she could get. </p><p>I would have pitied her, if it was anything but her personal hang-ups that were keeping her back. Carol loved her as a friend, and was comfortable enough to get undressed once her buttons pressed — as I was seeing the second time in the same day.  </p><p>All she needed was to take a modest risk, and I wouldn’t have been in the picture. And, now, she had to limit herself to watching her crush blow me while she stayed on the couch, immobilized. </p><p>“Deeper,” I ordered, and Carol gripped my thighs tighter. Her sexy obedience was already enough to put a smile on my face without Amy’s frustrated wiggle, her gaze locked to the view. She was focused on watching it enough not to pay attention to anything else, which included where my camera was pointing. </p><p>As Carol picked up speed, Amy was starting to look frustrated and horny. With her complicated expression of despair gone, along with my hope of getting award-bait photos. Luckily, that didn’t mean she suddenly became boring.</p><p>No, picturing her horny state as she absentmindedly forced her restraints looked amazing on the camera — though, once again, destined for my private vault. </p><p>I decided that she deserved a better view. “On all fours,” I ordered Carol, and she followed it immediately. She was about to look away from Amy, but I corrected her position, not only making her look toward her, but also pushing her closer enough that her face almost touched Amy’s knees. </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit…” Carol whispered, not completing her sentence. </p><p>“Well, if you don’t want to win…” I said, deliberately responding with another fragment, but my amusement was the desperate way Amy kept her legs closed. Not due to a sudden modesty, but because she didn’t want to show just how wet she had gotten to her crush. </p><p>“I didn’t say that—” Carol said, which was all she was able to say before I moved forward, invading her wetness aggressively.  </p><p>Amy whimpered desperately as she watched the show in front of her, so close to what she dreamed, yet so far. I decided to take pity on her. I was not a mean person. </p><p>I was actually a nice man … well, for a given value. </p><p>“Carol, why don’t you help your friend a bit,” I said between pushes. “It’s rude to keep her from participating just because her hands are bound.” </p><p>“No,” Carol gasped immediately, which put a sad expression on Amy’s face, which she took as a sign of rejection. </p><p>“Why not?” I asked even as I slapped her ass, enjoying the way she tightened around me. </p><p>“It’s getting too much. I don’t want to push her to something she isn’t comfortable with,” Carol answered. “Not when she can’t even speak.” </p><p>“Well, there’s an easy way for that,” I responded. “Miss contractor, why don’t you open your beautiful thighs if you’re feeling frustrated and want Carol to help you a bit,” I said. </p><p>Her expression of hope and desire was beautiful enough to make me glad I kept my camera hanging on my chest. A few more photos as Amy tried to ascertain whether I was teasing her … then, her legs parted open, revealing her sopping wetness. </p><p>“Enough as an answer?”  I asked. </p><p>“Well, you’re right,” Carol said, ready to reach with her fingers. I had a better idea. I easily lifted Carol and put her closer. “Maybe that’s too much—” Carol said, which was all she was able to say before I pushed her head down. </p><p>“Lick,” I ordered. She did.</p><p>I looked at Amy, catching her expression of desire. Suddenly, she didn’t seem to mind me ordering Carol around. </p><p>What a complicated girl. </p><p>I said nothing as I reached forward and grabbed her breasts. Her eyes jolted open, showing that she didn’t expect that to happen, but she made no move to stop me either. Which didn’t surprise me, as while she had deep feelings for Carol, she was clearly not a lesbian. </p><p>Oh, she wasn’t exactly a fan of mine, and if the situation was different, she would have kicked me out to stay alone with Carol. Amusingly, if she actually tried to do that by having an honest conversation, she probably would have succeeded. </p><p>Pity that, for all her trappings of strength, she was too cowardly where it counted. She rather be a reluctant participant in a threesome than have an honest conversation with Carol. </p><p>Well, not so much pity, I corrected as I twisted her nipple, watching the way her back arched. She might have been unhappy about my general presence, but the same clearly didn’t apply to my touch. </p><p>We continued a little while more … with Carol working hard on both sides, before she started shivering. Amy followed that despite her late inclusion, the emotional involvement was enough to trigger her orgasm as well. </p><p>“I … I think I need to catch my breath a bit,” Carol whispered as she pulled back. </p><p>“Why don’t you go get a quick shower before we start having real fun,” I suggested. She was too dazed to question the reason. </p><p>Leaving me alone with her bound roommate. </p>
