        <p>I stayed at the safe house for an hour, searching the place from top to bottom, but unfortunately, failed to find anything other than the cage itself and the unique nature of the wards. So, I dismantled them while taking notes about the way they came together, and destroyed the cage after taking some pieces as the sample. It was the only clue about their origin. </p><p>As a bonus, it finally completed my arcana skill. </p><p>[+3 Arcana]</p><p>Also, Helga would appreciate the gift of another magical project, especially it was based on a completely novel theoretical base. </p><p>Slipping the defensive guards Titania posted around the inn she had chosen as the temporary base for herself was completely trivial, making me shook my head at their incompetence. One of those days, I really needed to develop a solution to that, to defend the girls, if for nothing else. </p><p>When I arrived at Titania’s room, I met with a pleasant surprise. She wasn’t alone, but being tended by a healer for her wounds, her shirt removed for the ease of access. And to make things even more fun, the healer was extremely familiar as well. </p><p>“Hello, girls,” I said as I slipped in from a window and established a ward behind myself. </p><p>“Caesar,” Titania said stiffly while Marianne looked just shocked at my sudden presence. Then, she turned to Marianne. “You can go,” she said as she reached for her shirt, trying to hide her blush while trying to make it look like my intrusion was normal. </p><p>I turned to Titania. “Don’t worry, we’re good friends with Marianne. Aren’t we, sweetie?”</p><p>“Y-yes,” Marianne stammered, shocked by the way I had been speaking to Titania, while Titania’s face twisted with a sudden surge of jealousy, smart enough to realize the implications of my words, especially since I had previously taken Helga in front of her when she was still struggling with her emotional blocking. Now that she was free from it, she was struggling with the emotional aspects of it. </p><p>“Why are you here?” Titania said testily, her distaste clear as she struggled with the unfamiliar tinge of jealousy.  </p><p>I walked closer, amused by her reaction. “To help you recover from the great exertion you displayed before you left for another battle, of course,” I said even as I leaned forward and captured her lips. Despite her frustration, she lacked the willpower to reject my lips, moaning as I slipped my tongue into her mouth, moaning as I let my mana fill her mouth. </p><p>[-381 Mana]</p><p>Lost in the kiss, she realized too late that I used her distraction to sit next to her and pull her on my lap. Only when our lips were separated, she realized the trick I had pulled, and looked at me with a cute frustration that would have left others in disbelief, that the famous librarian of Silver Spires could display an expression fit to a teenager. </p><p>Marianne was definitely one of those shocked ones, her blue eyes wide.</p><p>“So,” I said even as I hugged Titania’s naked waist. “What do you think about the sudden change of strategy?” </p><p>“Caesar,” she gasped as one of my hands slipped down. “What are you doing!” </p><p>“Hugging you, of course,” I said with a smirk as I turned my gaze to Marianne, who was watching us in shock, though a small smile was also worming itself on her face. She was too meek to feel jealous, especially after everything we had done together, giving me the chance  </p><p>“Not in front of her,” Titania gasped. </p><p>“Well, you didn’t mind a lot when I was …hugging… my other blonde friend in your room,” I said, reminding her of the time I took Helga together. “And we don’t have a lot of time to waste. Marianne, please continue healing her.” </p><p>“Of course,” Marianne said, managing to speak without a stammer, though that didn’t prevent her from blushing. She didn’t argue the slightest, which wasn’t surprising. She was the most submissive of my growing group of intimate friends by far, and the fact that she was in front of Titania, one of the scariest figures she had ever known —especially after watching her decimating two monster armies— made it much easier for her to accept it without the slightest complaint. She pressed her hands on Titania’s arm, flooding her body with the healing energies. Titania was mostly cured, with only a couple of bruises remaining, and even they were disappearing rather rapidly.</p><p>“So,” I whispered to Titania’s ear even as my hand slipped under her skirt, making her shuffle in discomfort, and with no little amount of arousal. “What’s your opinion about the sudden increase in monster attacks.” </p><p>“Clearly planned, and if your sudden appearance is any indicator, they are targeting us directly. But I don’t know who. Maybe me, maybe you through me.” </p><p>“Not a bad assumption,” I said. Targeting Titania through me was the only viable strategy if they were after me. “However, even if that was the case, I’m a target of opportunity at best. After all, my presence is nothing more than a last-minute addition ruining their well-prepared plan. There’s still the question of what they want.” </p><p>“Any clues from the attackers?” Titania asked even as Marianne finished curing her. </p><p>“A few, but they raise more questions than they answered,” I said before turning to Marianne. “By the way, do you mind rubbing my shoulders, I’m feeling exhausted,” I said. Marianne said nothing, but she was quick to follow my request,  her hands landing on my shoulders. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured even as I felt Marianne’s mana infusing my shoulders, forcing the tension off. Meanwhile, my hands climbed upward as Titania’s hips tilted upwards, accepting my intrusion in good humor.  </p><p>My hand slid along her inner thigh, climbing upward, fingers massaging sensually. Without watching, my hand crept upward slowly, closer and closer to the hip crease until my little finger found her panties. At that point, I slid my hand up, trailing my little finger along the hem until I discovered her wetness, making her moan. Her own reaction made her blush, especially when she turned and saw a knowing smile on Marianne’s face. “About the attackers?” she reminded me in an effort to distract us from her reaction. </p><p>“That’s a bit complicated,” I said even as my hands continued their dance. “They are a complete unknown, and considering their strength, it’s really surprising. Three people over level twenty, with no clue about their identity,” I said. I undersold their strength a bit, not wanting to alarm them too much before I could discover the identity of the attackers. More importantly, I didn’t mention anything about the true nature of their power, keeping it silent until I could discover more. I trusted Titania, but I didn’t trust the headmistress. </p><p>“Who has the strength to deploy that kind of force,” Titania murmured. </p><p>“That’s the question, sweetheart,” I said. “It’s clearly a part of a much bigger organization. Not only they have clearly had the manpower to throw around, but also their coffers are quite full. Mana gems are not something to throw around the way they had been doing,” I said. </p><p>“Not to mention their ability to manipulate monsters,” Titania commented, though her tone was strained as my erection buried in her ass. And my fingers, dancing over her slit made it even more difficult to keep her voice down. “They are displaying a worrying power trend. It’s intimidating.”</p><p>“No doubt,” I said. “Does your boss have any idea about their identity?” </p><p>“She has some suspicions, but she’s yet to mention them to me. Apparently, their involvement is only incidental,” Titania said. </p><p>“I see,” I murmured. What Titania had mentioned seemed unimportant, but it suggested some stuff. First of all, it meant that our mysterious organization didn’t appear from nowhere. The headmistress was clearly aware of their presence enough to assume she was successfully predicting their objectives. </p><p>Well, considering they were targeting Titania, she clearly misread their objective, but that in itself was another clue. It was clear, I needed a detailed talk with the headmistress, to learn what she had in mind. </p><p>After I finish helping Titania and Marianne recover their mana, of course. </p><p>Titania continued to share her assumptions about the possible identity of the organization, and I listened, but I was more interested in the way my hands were exploring the surface of her panties, while her voice got strained. She blushed as I hiked her skirt around her hips, revealing her hips to my gaze. </p><p>She shivered as I dragged down her panties. “Marianne, do you mind helping me get rid of my shirt,” I said even as I removed Titania’s bra after letting her panties fall on the floor. </p><p>“We can’t,” Titania murmured gently, throwing a panicked glare to Marianne, acting even shyer. “Not with her in place.” </p><p>“You’re not thinking of the advantages,” I whispered even as I gestured Marianne to stop what she had been doing. Instead, I grabbed Titania’s legs and parted them, giving Marianne the perfect angle to show the abilities she had developed during the heated evenings she had spent playing with Cornelia. </p><p>“But-” Titania started, panicking as Marianne positioned between her legs, only to be interrupted as I caught her lips with another searing kiss, flooding her with another flash of mana.</p><p>[-284 Mana] </p><p>Even after I stopped kissing her, Titania failed to say anything, though it was more about Marianne’s finger disappearing into her wetness while her tongue dashed out, caressing her clit. Titania let out a shocking moan. </p><p>Meanwhile, I allowed my hands to move, landing on her breasts, massaging them gently to push her arousal further. </p><p>“It feels…” Titania murmured, only to let herself fade halfway. Meanwhile, she missed one very important detail. One of Marianne’s hands was busy with her entrance, but the other one was working aggressively to free my shaft from its confines. Then, after freeing my shaft and giving one long lick, she pulled back. </p><p>“You’re overdressed,” I said to Marianne even as I grabbed Titania’s hips once more, and lifted her directly to my shaft. She gasped in shock as my shaft disappeared inside her. </p><p>Meanwhile, Marianne took a step back, shrugging off her clothes in a rapid manner. Since she was here for a mission, neither her clothes nor her underwear was particularly attractive, so she was quick the shed them. The same, however, didn’t apply to the amazing curvy body that was hidden underneath, once again tempting me to take a bite to leave another mark. </p><p>Marianne smiled with pride as my eyes were inexorably drawn to her tits. “Anything you like?" she murmured as she took a step to dwindle the distance between us while she pressed her tits together. Meanwhile, I was moving Titania repeatedly, making her moan. Dumping a lot of mana in the process as well. </p><p>[-513 Mana]</p><p>"Definitely," I answered, kissing enthusiastically as she leaned forward to offer them to my hungry lips. I suckled her plump, juicy nipples between my lips, relishing every delicious second of it. </p><p>I continued to work Titania toward the climax, while I reached Marianne’s poor, neglected pussy. I slipped a couple of fingers inside, and her walls clamped around aggressively, suggesting that she had missed my touch since our last adventure. “Someone is enthusiastic,” I murmured. </p><p>“That’s what happens when someone is neglected,” Marianne murmured with a cute pout even as she continued to squirm around my fingers. Still, she was feeling adventurous enough to put her hands on Titania’s tits, her earlier fear disappearing quickly. The sight of her naked body, jumping up and down on my shaft, was hardly intimidating. </p><p> Meanwhile, Titania continued to clench around my shaft, doing her best to bring me to a climax. Luckily, I had more than enough willpower to delay my explosion. The same didn’t apply to Titania, who was busy crying with ecstasy. </p><p>Things were warming up…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370 Mana: 5132  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>
