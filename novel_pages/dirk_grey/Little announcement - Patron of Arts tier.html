        <p>Hi everyone, after a few people actively requested me, I decided to create a new, 25$ tier. </p><p><strong>However, let me make it clear. There will not be any exclusive story for that tier.</strong></p><p><strong>Essentially, it's just extra support from anyone that is willing, and has the personal means to do so.  </strong></p><p>Any that is interested in supporting me more can check the detailed explanation, but essentially, I'll funnel that money to commission artists and programmers. However the resulting visuals will not be fully exclusive to that tier. They'll have a one-month access before I start sharing them with other tiers.<strong> </strong></p>
