        <p>Once we arrived at the nearest mall, we met with a familiar surprise.</p><p>Umi was here as well, next to her fiancee. “Oh, how interesting,” I murmured to Tiffany as I chuckled at the show. Unlike their earlier attitude, Umi wasn’t looking at him with a shy expression but pure annoyance while Charlie tried his best to apologize for his mistakes with Brenda, trying to blame it on drinks…</p><p>Admittedly, he looked well for a guy who had just drunk himself to a stupor, which didn’t help Umi’s mood any, lessening the weight of his excuse about being drunk. He handled the hangover far better than his drink. </p><p>Of course, under her annoyance, I could see thick guilt on Umi’s face, self-conscious about her great betrayal as well. However, she was simply too shy to actually admit what had happened, and too passive to just come out and break her engagement. </p><p>A nicer man would have walked away, but I just walked toward them with Tiffany in tow. </p><p>There were many ways I could mess with them, but in the end, I decided on the option that would continue playing on the persona of a desperate old man being strung along by the sexy young woman. </p><p>Which had the added benefit of freeing Tiffany from trying to hide her purchases from her husband. </p><p>“Let’s put on a show,” I said.</p><p>“Same story?” she asked.</p><p>“Yes, and I would love it if you could distract the fiancee once in a while, but only after the initial talk,” I said. </p><p>“Naughty,” Tiffany said, then giggled loudly enough to get their attention while she dragged me toward the shopping area, where they could see us. “Oh, Umi, what a surprise,” she said with a giggle as she approached. </p><p>Umi’s sheer expression of shock and panic was enough to reveal everything that had been going on … luckily, the poor fiancee — whose name I didn’t bother to remember — was more interested in our sudden appearance than her expression, missing that. “And Charlie it also here.” </p><p>“Oh, Tiffany,” the poor guy said with a surprised tone, unaware of the crisis his fiancee was going through. “What a surprise. What are you doing here?” </p><p>“Nothing much, Nathan here mentioned that he needed my help, and since my hubby is busy, I decided to join him.” As she said that, she patted my shoulder very a patronizing manner delivered perfectly with a quirk of her ruby lips.</p><p>I would have believed myself firmly stuck in the friend zone if it wasn’t for the same lips wrapped around my girth for an hour.   </p><p>“Oh,” Charlie said, thinking that he understood the situation. “What’s the occasion?” </p><p>“I need a secretary, but since I’m an old-fashioned employer, I want my secretary to have a uniform. Tiffany is here to help me pick one.” </p><p>“Oh, really, a secretary?” he asked, quick to understand the implications of such a position … although, it might have been about the longing gaze I had sent toward Umi, giving a pining expression, it was fleeting enough that he felt smart for catching it. He turned at Umi. “Honey, you’re looking for work as well. What a coincidence. </p><p>Umi’s expression of shock was impossible to hide, but he misread the source, and instead of talking with her, he poked her side pointedly. “You have just graduated from college, it’ll be a good opportunity.” </p><p>“Oh, what a good idea, and that way, we don’t need to pick clothes for an unknown, and pick them perfectly. What a good idea!” </p><p>I did my best to look reluctant yet excited at the same time. “It’s a good idea, but I don’t know if Natalie would go for it. I can’t really hire someone without her approval…” I started, giving another hint of weakness. </p><p>Tiffany hugged my arm. “Oh, nonsense,” she said as she massaged my arm with her tits, one that ‘broke’ my resistance. </p><p>“Alright,” I whispered. Tiffany giggled happily, Charlie smiled victoriously like he had just got a promotion as he looked at Umi, completely misreading her widened eyes and shocked expression. And, Umi was too shocked to actually speak. </p><p>“Actually, why don’t you go and talk with Natalie while I pick an outfit,” Tiffany said with a wink. “I promise that you’ll love it.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said and turned, but she grabbed my arm, opening her hand. </p><p>With a chuckle, I dropped a card in her hand, then gestured her a three, and a zero. The card had a thirty-thousand-dollar limit. I liked Tiffany, but not enough to actually give her a card with no limit. </p><p>And, while Tiffany dragged Umi and Charlie away, I went to find a sales clerk, and let my charm — and a little bribe — do the talking until he led me to a VIP changing room, with the promise to make sure not letting anyone in the corridor except the three. </p><p>I went into the dressing room, which consisted of not only a large mirror, but also a comfortable couch, large enough for a fun adventure. I didn’t have to wait for long before I heard Umi’s voice. “… I don’t know. Isn’t it too short for office wear,” she whispered. </p><p>“Not at all, especially not with a pantyhose underneath … or a fishnet if you’re trying to get a raise. Don’t you think so, Charlie,,” Tiffany cut in.  </p><p>“I don’t know…” Charlie murmured. “Maybe Umi is right.” </p><p>Tiffany was quick to attack his hesitation. “Come on, Charlie. What’s the harm in flashing the old guy with a flash of legs if it gives you the promotion you’re trying to get. Imagine the house you’ll be able to afford with double income, especially with a nice promotion once Umi could whisper some suggestions.” </p><p>“… maybe she’s right,” Charlie said after a long pause. “And, you’ll look sexy. I can imagine that old asshole pining after you, while I’m the only one that can touch you.” </p><p>I barely held back a laugh. I had to admit, the line he delivered was amazing, conveying confidence and flattering his fiancee while also staking his claim. A nice balance between freedom and jealousy. </p><p>Too bad for him that he used it at the worst possible time, right after losing Umi, making it an incredible self-burn, his fake confidence only damaging his standing in Umi’s eyes. </p><p>I was sure Tiffany fed him the line for that exact purpose. </p><p>“Really, that’s what you want. For me to parade myself s you can get unearned promotions,” Umi growled in sudden anger. “Okay, let’s see how you’ll like it. Maybe I shouldn’t even wear a bra while going office.” With that, footsteps started to get closer to the room. </p><p>A shocked gasp escaped Charlie, but before he could speak, Tiffany spoke. I had no idea what she had said as she spoke softly, but her amusement was clear, clearly enjoying the prospect of what was about to happen. </p><p>The moment Umi entered the dressing room, she gasped, freezing. “What happened,” Charlie asked,, worried. </p><p>I pushed the door. “Tell him you stubbed your toe,” I whispered. </p><p>She looked reluctant. Understandable, as she was a little sheep taking a turn, only to come face to face with a wolf searching for a meal … another meal. “Oh, I …” she started, pausing for a moment as she looked at the door. </p><p>I deliberately took a step back, letting her know that, if she wished, she could turn and leave. At that moment, Tiffany helped me as well. She giggled playfully, Charlie laughed with a hint of guilt, no doubt a joke at Umi’s expense. </p><p>She was already tethering on the edge, and that pushed to one side … right under me. “I just stubbed my toe,” she declared heatedly as she took a step forward, standing next to me. </p><p>I let my smile widen as I caressed her cheek gently,, whispering. “An excellent choice,” I whispered. “Now, why don’t you change. I want to see the beauty of my secretary.” </p><p>She blushed, her anger quick to fuel her enthusiasm as the memories of our first time flashed through her mind. But along with that, there was some hesitation. “You can use the curtain to change,” I whispered as I pointed to the curtain that could be used to part the room. </p><p>She checked the clothes in her hand, then nodded shyly. As much as I wanted to see her strip, I wasn’t in a hurry, so I let her. </p><p>She disappeared behind the curtain, and when it opened again, I met with a heavenly sight. </p><p>Umi was a beautiful woman, but she was always hampered by her choice of clothing. The clothing she wore last night was sexy, but not beautiful as they were picked for Tiffany’s style and hair color … which contrasted greatly with Umi. </p><p>My first mental comment as I took in her beauty, Tiffany really knew how to shop. </p><p>Umi was wearing a nice white blouse that hugged her body perfectly while giving a nice dip into her cleavage. The pencil skirt was tight enough to hug her ass, yet long. Enough to be office-appropriate … barely. </p><p>Or, it would have without the thigh-high stockings she wore, somehow managing to add an erotic quality that begged her boss — an honor that I owned — to bend her and teach her about the risks of dressing dangerously. </p><p>Yet, it was somehow still innocent, her head, dipped low to hide her shy blush, enhancing its impact even more. Dressed as a classical secretary with a sexy twist, she looked like a perfect sacrificial secretary, prepared to sate the lust of the boss for the sake of the company. </p>
