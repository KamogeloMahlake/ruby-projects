        <p>Xia’s mouth parted open in shock as she accidentally took a monumental step, clearly for the first time, but I leaned forward to capture her lips before she could moan in shock. </p><p>Purely to make sure she wouldn’t moan in shock and alert the soldiers to our presence, of course. </p><p>The battle continued to rage around us, with explosions ongoing, but after the initial surprise, the captain was able to deflect the attacks. And, since he was doing such a good job, there was no need for me to walk out and help. </p><p>It was what the professional respect from one sorcerer to other looked like. </p><p>And, speaking of professional respect between sorcerers, I turned my attention fully to the other sorcerer, one that was firmly attached to my lap as she tried to manage her shock. I tightened my grip on her hips. “Since it already happened, what do you say about making it memorable,” I whispered. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she whispered back, doing her best to sound annoyed. However, under the circumstances, her best proved insufficient. The forced arousal was barely a hint in her voice, filled with desire.</p><p>Not that I could blame her for that, of course.</p><p> “Try to stay silent,” I warned her even as I directed her hips, depriving myself of an interesting communication as the movement gave her a challenge. She pressed her lips tightly, trying to contain her moan, leaving me to do nothing but enjoy her exotic beauty. </p><p>Soon, her hips started to rise and fall in her volution, picking up speed. Her eyes stayed closed as she lost herself in the enjoyment of the moment, turning herself to everything but the enjoyment. </p><p>As much as I would have loved to do the same, I didn’t have that luxury, and continued to pay attention to the battle that was going on around us. As the enemy ships continued to draw close, I started to feel the presence of three sorcerers in the other ships, sieging our ships from a distance. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the weapons of the secret hold, it would have been a desperate battle, but the constant rain of the ballista arrows managed to balance the issue. </p><p>Of course, it was only temporary. Ballistas and their enchanted arrows were valuable, but not enough to flip the balance of a one-to-three sorcerer fight, especially when the lone sorcerer was already exhausted by enhancing the speed of the ship. </p><p>However, it was the fact that it was a naval battle that changed the balance. The rain of siege arrows didn’t create a big threat to the Sorcerers at a distance, but the same didn’t apply to their ships, forcing them to stay defensive despite their desire to capture our ship. </p><p>After all, they couldn’t capture it with their ship was taken down. </p><p>Amusingly, if all three had moved to one ship, they would have had a much easier time, without one focusing on the defense while the other two were dedicated to offense, but they didn’t do so. I wondered about the reason, but considering their identity, it could be anything from a blood feud between their families to a desire not to share the credit. </p><p>A risky strategy, but they clearly assumed that their victory was inevitable — which proved that they still didn’t know about the true origin of the ship, their neighboring Empire. Of course, they might also realize that, yet rightfully assumed the Empire wouldn’t interfere.</p><p>If they intervened, it would be a declaration of war. And, unlike Republic, the Empire had no idea the treasures the ship carrying, maybe enough to risk a war. </p><p>Ultimately, however, it wasn’t what I cared about. I had long received what I wanted, which was to get away from Rome, enough not to fear the enemy. I could easily throw myself in the water and swim away without getting any notice — especially since Xia was already awake, which meant she would be great assistance rather than a hindrance. </p><p>And, with that assessment complete, I turned most of my attention to the exotic beauty on my lap, rocking back and forth. </p><p>I still allowed her to set the pace, despite my desire to flip her and invade her core recklessly, afraid that she would lose her ability to hold back her moans, especially since the situation didn’t allow casting silencing spell — I couldn’t cast, period, and I didn’t trust her ability to hide the flare. </p><p>Admittedly, it wasn’t a huge chore for me to allow her to take the lead, not when her hips dance with a spectacular passion. </p><p>She maintained her silence with determination even as she gave all the signs of being overwhelmed with pleasure, which was impressive. But maybe I shouldn’t be too surprised. After all, she was still a sorceress, which was not a position that one could easily attain by being weak, no matter how many resources one could access. </p><p>I let myself enjoy her tightness as she moved up and down with a beautiful silence, the environment making it even more delicious. Soon, however, I proved just how much of a nice, helpful man I was by shifting higher and catching her lips in a burning kiss, helping her to stay silent. </p><p>And, I was sure the passionate dance of her tongue was purely about conveying her casual thanks and nothing more. </p><p>Yet, as that dance continued, I was getting more and more confident of her ability to keep her voice down, tempting me to adjust my merciful attitude. </p><p>“That’s enough warm-up,” I whispered as I tightened my grip around her hips, and flipped her, so that she was locked under me.  “Let’s see if you can maintain that silence,” I added, my hips pushing deep into her core. </p><p>She managed to do so, but it was a close call, her trembling lips staying connected. Her body, on the other hand, was much freer to tremble recklessly under my body, each second enhancing the sensation of pleasure even more. </p><p>Yet, suddenly I found myself getting irked with her silence as I pushed my hips even harder, our hips exploding loudly along with a moan from her. </p><p>It was pure luck that it coincided with another fireball, preventing us from revealing our position. I leaned down to capture her lips, helping her to suppress her panic. </p><p>Though, my mind was occupied with that sudden, reflexive action, ordering me to dominate her completely, leaving no doubt that she was mine, body and soul. It seemed that my new instincts would be even more trouble than I expected.</p><p>Suppressing the more violent, animalistic tendencies, I was able to do with ease, at least relative ease, because I was able to recognize them quickly. However, the problem came when those instincts worked like my normal thoughts, only even more intense. </p><p>Having sex while a battle was going on, it was me, but somehow taking her ability to keep her voice down in our risky position was outside that.</p><p>A point to be discussed with Xia once we were on the land once more, I thought as I put my hands on both sides of her as I trapped her against the deck, pushing back and forth as her body continued to quiver with overwhelming pleasure.</p><p>With my lips firmly on hers, and with the constant sound of the battle around us, the risk of being heard was minimal, so I started impaling her recklessly, doing my best to make her first time spectacular. </p><p>It was the least she deserved.  </p><p>I pushed repeatedly, each push making her moan even louder, challenging my lips to maintain her silence. It was still risky even with that, as even the slightest lull would be enough to reveal our presence, but I found myself unable to reject the reckless temptation. </p><p>The sound of her muffled cries, mixing with the constant battle, was simply beautiful. </p><p>The smart thing would have been to slow down to prevent an accident, but at this point, I felt unable to take that choice. I continued pushing forward, each push making her cries louder as we risked a very heated disaster — to my defense, one that I was confident to solve at this point, as we were almost at the point we needed to leave the ship.</p><p>I continued pushing, alternating between enjoying her lips and paying attention to the killer's body on full display. </p><p>Only after she started trembling desperately, I pulled back as a compromise, giving her a moment to recover, curious whether she could handle a second round, one that would bring me to completion. </p><p>However, a development happened at that point, one that suggested that I had to adjust my plans. The sound of the battle suddenly dropped down. </p><p>Not disappeared, which would have been surprising enough. No, the battle sounds started to disperse to a distance, showing that our ship suddenly had allies. Allies that I didn’t expect to appear, because the Empire shouldn’t be willing to sacrifice the ship. </p><p>Interesting, I thought. That meant that they were aware of our presence and importance — which wasn’t likely. </p><p>Or, there was something else on the ship that was precious enough to risk a war breaking out…</p>
