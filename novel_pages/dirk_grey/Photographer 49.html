        <p>“What an excellent idea,” I said, doing my best to hide the fact that Laura wasn’t the only one that was feeling nervous at the suggestion. </p><p>Penny had many good qualities, but unfortunately, a good balance was not one of them. I still remembered the small string of disasters she created during our first mission, when she tried to help me set up a temporary studio in her living room, only to create considerable chaos in the process. </p><p>“But use this,” I said as I passed my phone to her. “The camera is running low, and I need to charge it.” I wasn’t entirely confident as I gave her my phone as well, especially after seeing her trembling fingers, but it was better than risking my camera. The phone was both harder to break, and easier to replace. </p><p>I didn’t ask her to use her own phone, because I didn’t trust her to leak them. Not intentionally, certainly, but it was for the best to be on the safe side when dealing with Penny. </p><p>The short walk between my bag and the plug gave everyone some time to process the next step. Penny slowly overcame the effects of her recent climax enough to stand up on her feet, displaying her amazing curves freely. It allowed me to put a new plan on how to handle Laura, to teach her that her earlier aggression was not free. </p><p>Laura decided to use that little time panicking about what was to come, her brown eyes widening beautifully as she realized her earlier moves, done in a momentary excitement, were more dangerous than she realized at the moment, escalating the situation with no benefit to her other than momentary satisfaction. </p><p>Her gaze, locked to my midsection as I walked back to her, my robe a poor barrier to hide my raging arousal, showed her the exact risk she was dealing with. </p><p>As I closed in the distance, I expected her to open her mouth and ask me to stop, but Penny chose to speak at that moment. “We can stop if you can’t handle working,” Penny said, her tone gleefully smug, clearly hoping that Laura would fail to take that step. </p><p>“Nonsense,” Laura answered, showing that Penny wasn’t the only one that was fueled by vindictiveness. She even put her hands on her waist as she said so, displaying her body perfectly. </p><p>Penny just smirked as she took a step, closing the distance. “Let’s see if you can handle it,” she said as she grabbed the strings of Laura’s bottom, and pulled them free. It would have been a charismatic move if doing so didn’t send my phone away flying, but the floor was luckily covered with a thick, decadent carpet, preventing it from breaking. “Sorry,” Penny said, her blush cute.</p><p>“Not a problem, sweetie,” I said, but I was certainly glad that it was my phone that she flung away. Even with the recent windfall, I doubted I would react well if it was my camera that experienced that unfortunate experience. </p><p>Laura chuckled derisively as she watched Penny dashing back to pick up the phone, which died halfway as she felt me hugging her from behind. </p><p>With nothing in between our bodies, I removed my robe while she was busy paying attention to other objects. </p><p>“M-maybe—“ she started, only for her words to die as I pressed my finger to her lips. A touch daring, I had to admit, but not as daring as my shaft lodged between her tight asscheeks. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie. Don’t change your mind on things that we already agreed upon,” I said. While nowhere in our discussion we had discussed that I would be naked as well, I had no problem blurring the lines a bit. </p><p>And with Penny returning, already taking pictures with her camera, Laura failed to clarify that point as well. And then, I used my hands to help her cover, one on her breasts, the other between her legs, the resulting moan enough to prevent her words. </p><p>A touch excessive, maybe. Entirely deserved, certainly. </p><p>“Try not to look so shocked, it looks horrible,” Penny commented as she continued to take photos, showing that her surprising modeling talent certainly didn’t carry over backstage. </p><p>“She’s right,” I whispered to Laura’s ear as my hips moved, rubbing against her ass. “You need to be ready to take if you’re ready to dish out,” I whispered, teasing her much more than I had been initially planning to, even after she had shown her naked pictures as audition photos. “Being my exclusive model is not an easy job.” </p><p>Fingering one of my favorite models — not the most favorite yet, as Penny was yet to take that position from Nicole — in front of me was certainly an interesting move. </p><p>I let my fingers dance over her surprisingly tight body, suggesting that a busy exercise regimen was a constant part of her attempts to be an actress, my fingers finding her nipples, twisting, and teasing. </p><p>“Exclusive model?” she whispered, her voice shocked. “Really?” </p><p>Yesterday, it would have been a cruel statement, but considering the great amount of cash I had received and the urgent need to find new models to further leverage that popularity, it was just a reality. </p><p>And I would certainly prefer to build my business over exclusivity agreements both in terms of the models and terms of the client. It was the way to build a proper business, even though it often came with lengthy legal battles. </p><p>“As long as you’re hard-working enough,” I said. I wasn’t trying to use any kind of innuendo, and was just trying to say that I was actually very demanding when it came to real business aspects. </p><p>Laura clearly misunderstood what I was trying to say, a fact that I realized when she pulled her hips away, only to grab my shaft before pushing herself back, enveloping me inside her warmth. </p><p>“Is this —“ she gasped, interrupted by a moan as her wetness strained around my shaft, “hard-working enough?” </p><p>I just chuckled even as I put one of my hands over her hips, while I grabbed her hair with the other, pushing her against the nearest surface, which was the dining table. “Let’s see if you’re hard-working enough,” I said as I pushed deeper into her, entering her core properly. </p><p>“I am,” she gasped, but the intensity of the pleasure in her tone suggested that it might be something more primal than her dreams of becoming an actress, the unfamiliar situation enhancing her arousal to a ridiculous degree. </p><p>It might have been an interesting discussion, but as I invaded her core aggressively, her ability to speak was temporarily lost, her mouth occupied by a loud string of moans, one that made me glad that the penthouse suite came with a very impressive autistic insulation. </p><p>Insulation that didn’t work just as well between the rooms, as evidenced by the sight of Nancy bursting out, carrying a modified bed cover in front of her, the only thing she had to hide her still naked body.  </p><p>“Really?” she growled as she looked at me, bending Laura over the dining table. “Again?” </p><p>I chuckled as I caught her gaze, anger, and jealousy created a beautiful mixture. “Well, you’re not the only model I work with that enjoys a proper warm-up,” I answered as I picked up speed. “By the way, this is Laura.” </p><p>“Yes, I can see her,” she answered drolly, while Penny didn’t even acknowledge her presence as she moved around us — though, considering she was just holding her finger on the screen, it suggested that she started recording the show. </p><p>“Don’t be rude and say hi,” I said to Laura as I slapped her ass, the clap echoing in the room. Penny’s satisfied smirk was understandable considering their earlier scuffle, but Nancy had an even bigger one, considering the anal adventure of the night before only intensified her rough edge. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. She had earned herself a lot of leeway after accidentally giving me the flicker I needed to trigger my career’s resurrection, to blaze even stronger than before. </p><p>“H-hi, I’m Laura,” she managed to say, though, between moans, it took three attempts to utter that beautiful sentence. </p><p>Nancy just nodded before turning toward me. “How long you’re going to … warm up?” she asked. </p><p>“Have you finished with the costume?” I countered. </p><p>“Almost, maybe five more minutes,” she answered doing her best to keep her gaze on my face. Her forced casualness might trick the girls, but I could see that it was just posturing, trying to act superior. </p><p>“Good, I’ll speed up then,” I said as I picked up speed, only for Laura to tighten even more, signaling she was not exactly far away from a climax. “Assuming she could last for that much,” I added with a chuckle…</p>
