        <p>Isolde’s departure left me feeling dissatisfied despite my climax, mostly due to how it was attained. It felt good to finally set up some kind of accord with Isolde, the last remaining member of my immediate captors —the ones relevant to my pleasure. </p><p>I spent my time free of my chains, using magic to clean up the mess I created, as well as practicing a couple of difficult wards. Setting up wards was one of my weaker areas. I had the knowledge, and I had the skills, but I lacked the practice, because most of the time, the wards I used required a team to establish, and in such cases, I naturally observed from afar to make sure it worked correctly, but usually not involving magically. </p><p>My lack of practical experience wouldn’t be too back if it wasn’t for my relative lack of mobility, and my need to stay concealed, which removed a great number of my preferred actions from the list. It was boring to practice, though necessary. </p><p>I was barely able to practice for half an hour, when I felt the alarm ward at the entrance trigger once more. I chained myself once more, not knowing the identity of the visitor. Being caught by Lancelot of the Queen out of the chains was a complication I didn’t need right now. </p><p>Luckily, the door opened, and revealed a much more welcome figure. “Good morning, Princess,” I called, smiling widely. </p><p>“G-good morning,” Aria answered, but she froze at the entrance, unable to walk forward. She was wearing a cute green dress today, which, unfortunately, was bulky enough to cover any hint of skin, even more conservative than her usual way of dressing. </p><p>“Please, come in,” I finally called after she spent a minute, frozen at the entrance, no doubt still overwhelmed by what had happened the day before. She followed my invitation, but rejected my following wordless invitation when I patted my lap. </p><p>“Byron,” she whispered, using my name, which barely a few people had used. “We need to talk,” she continued, but words struggled to leave her mouth, straining the limits of her willpower. </p><p>“Sure, Princess,” I said even as I once again got rid of my chains and stood up, using my height advantage to overwhelm her, which was all I needed to silence her. She was already a bundle of nerves, no doubt as a result of what had just happened. She took a step back as I did so, trying to maintain the distance. I repeated it, and the distance stayed the same, but the third repeat left her back pressing against the walls of my cell. I closed in the distance with slow and deliberate steps, until I was standing in front of her shivering body. “Please tell me your concerns,” I whispered even as I caressed her face, as a lover would. </p><p>From a certain perspective, I did count as one. </p><p>“W-what we did,” she managed to stammer as she tried to stand upright, overwhelmed by our proximity. </p><p>“Be more specific, Princess,” I said as I caressed her cheek, leaning forward like I was about to kiss, but not making connect, just chuckling at her parted lips. Despite her discomfort, she was clearly yearning for another touch. </p><p>“W-what had happened in the bed,” she stammered again, her blush climbing upward. </p><p>I was tempted to repeat the question, but I doubted she would be able to keep herself upright if she was forced to go more into detail. Without the effects of her arousal, she seemed to be struggling even thinking about it. “I see,” I murmured. “Are you unhappy with what had just happened, because I remember you enjoying my teachings quite a bit?” I whispered. </p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” she said. “What we did was wrong! We can’t do that again?” </p><p>“Why?” I asked. </p><p>“Because I’m going to be married,” she said. </p><p>“But you’re not married yet,” I countered, which silenced her immediately. It wasn’t a proper answer, of course. It was barely an answer, but she was too overwhelmed by our closeness to properly answer that. </p><p>“It shouldn’t -” she tried to counter, only to fell silent when I leaned forward for a kiss, my chest pressing against hers, feeling her heartbeat through the tightness. </p><p>I didn’t kiss her yet, just hovering close. “So, you’re saying that you don’t want to this anymore…” I whispered before I completed the distance, enjoying the warmth of her lips through a soft kiss, then pulled back. “Or this…” I added, this time teasing her neck. “Or this…” I said, followed by another kiss, this time aggressive enough for my tongue to invade her pretty little mouth, leaving her gasping as I pulled back. </p><p>She didn’t answer, nor that I expected her to answer. Instead, I grabbed her hand and dragged her toward my chains. I sat down and pulled her on my lap, and she complied without the slightest resistance, too confused by her own reaction. “But…” she finally murmured as she felt my hardness underneath her, and realizing her compromised position. “This is wrong.” </p><p>“Are you sure,” I whispered as I grabbed her pert ass over the skirt of her dress, squeezing gently, making her shiver once more. “Where exactly is the harm? I’m helping you to learn, we both enjoyed it immensely,” I explained, then smirked suggestively, “and you could easily heal any pesky evidence before your wedding night. It’s nothing but positives.” </p><p>“I don’t know…” she murmured, but despite her apparent reluctance, her already weak will to deny the call of pleasure was fading away decisively, leaving a passive toy behind. So, when I grabbed her chin and leaned for another kiss, she was completely obedient under the assault of my tongue. </p><p>“Excellent decision,” I whispered. “Then, why don’t you be a good girl show me you have learned your lesson well,” I said, dragging her hand to my bulge to remove any ambiguity about what I had been talking about. </p><p>“W-with my lips?” she asked, her cute blue eyes shining with shock and desire. </p><p>“Well, that’s one option, but certainly not the only one,” I reminded her, squeezing her breast at the same time, making her let out another beautiful gasp that begged me to stop our little game and push her against the wall. </p><p>Still, despite her scandalized expression, she didn’t lose much time before standing up and pulling down my pants and underwear at the same time, revealing my shaft, which was already more than half-erect thanks to the soft presence of her ass that had been pressing until a moment ago. Even more excitingly, her hands went to the chest of her dress, where a complicated knot was hiding the treasure that was her tits. </p><p>Unfortunately, after sending a hesitant gaze to the door, she let her arms fall to the side, no doubt remembering the previous time, where Emma had burst in without a warning, catching us in the middle of things. All told, a reasonable concern, so, I let her crouch down without releasing her glorious tits, even though I wanted their softness wrapped around, sharing their warmth. </p><p>However, when she leaned down to capture my length without any further prompting, it was easy to ignore that particular detail. Her fingers were soft as always as they wrapped around my length, like high-quality velvet. She was still hesitant as she leaned down and her lips touched my skin, making her shiver. When she looked up to catch my gaze in the blue depth of her eyes, I actually had to rely on my experience to keep myself from exploding. </p><p>The willing touch of the innocent Princess was simply too incredible. </p><p>She slowly caressed the base, unsure of her movements like a student that was trying to solve a problem after a long break. Still, her tongue darted out as she hesitantly started her task, walking around the ridge. “Not bad,” I murmured, moaning exaggeratedly, more to encourage her than the overwhelming pleasure from her technique.</p><p>She murmured something unintelligible. Then, her beautiful ruby lips parted, swallowing a third of my length, surprising me with her initiative. “Good girl,” I said, patting her head. </p><p>The positive reinforcement worked better than I expected. Her eyes brightened at the compliment before she pushed herself deeper on my shaft, managing to swallow almost two-thirds of it despite her gagging. The resulting pleasure was spectacular, her lips caressing the base while the crown starting to experience the tight grip of her throat. The sensation wasn’t as tight as what I had experienced the last time, where I had deep-throated her in front of Emma, but the resulting pleasure was made better by the simple fact that she was moving based on her own will. </p><p>Receiving a blowjob from her, I decided, was a spectacular experience. The way she looked up at me with her pretty blue eyes as she moved her head back and forth was certainly played a role in that, almost as much as the way her pretty little mouth felt when her lips tightened around my girth, my length disappearing in her depths. Then, it got even better. Without even prompting, she started alternating her pacing, her lips tightening further as she pulled out, creating a tightness that rivaled her virgin entrance. </p><p>“Nice instincts, you’re getting better at this,” I murmured in approval, which made her blush shyly. An interesting reaction to my words, considering she was doing her best to swallow the entirety of my length. </p><p>“You’re enjoying this as well, aren’t you?” I added, which turned her blush into an inferno. She tried to mumble an answer without removing my cock from her mouth, treating it as an excuse not to answer it, but I had no intention of letting it slide. “Answer me,” I whispered, and she shivered, but still freed her mouth. </p><p>“Maybe,” she mumbled indecisively, which, under my sharp gaze, immediately changed. “A bit,” she corrected herself, her hand still wrapped around my shaft, dancing up and down methodically. </p><p>“Come on, Princess,” I said. “There’s nothing to be ashamed of. It’s only natural to enjoy these kinds of things. As a healer, you should know that.” </p><p>She nodded, but rather than answering, she returned her task of sucking my cock, which was the tastiest method of avoidance. I chuckled, but this time, I let her get away without answering my question, not wanting to push her too much. Not that I was afraid of her pushing back, of course. My worries ran in the opposite direction, actually, that she might revert to her passive state, not wanting to push herself too much. </p><p>So, I leaned against the wall, enjoying as her blonde hair spilled on my lap as she repeatedly swallowed my shaft, getting quicker and quicker even with her swollen lips and her struggling breaths. Though, the way she was rubbing her legs against each other made the situation even sexier. </p><p>I decided to add a touch of variance, and pulled the strings of her dress, widening the front of it, finally creating a window with the view of her amazing breasts, the vision even better thanks to the beautiful angle. “You’re getting much better,” I whispered. “Trying to hold back myself from exploding is certainly difficult.” </p><p>She said nothing, as it was pointless to speak with her mouth full. Instead, she surprised me by grabbing the same strings I had loosened earlier, and pushed her dress to her waist, leaving her corset responsible for covering her modesty —and doing a bad job it. Unlike her dress, which was extremely conservative, her corset was a much more interesting piece of clothing. </p><p>It was a red and white piece that barely covered her nipples, giving me a delicious view of her areolas. It was tight, which made the top of her breasts pop out deliciously. Moreover, it looked like that a snap would have dealt with it easily, leaving her top bereft of any protection. </p><p>“Someone came prepared,” I murmured even as I reached and grabbed her breasts, mauling them over the fabric of her corset, which was surprisingly soft to touch. “You wanted this to happen, right?” </p><p>I didn’t expect, or required, an answer, as watching her gobbling my length was much more entertaining. Under her determined assault, I finally hit the limit, and my cock started throbbing. “I’m about to explode,” I warned her, yet she stayed in position, even as the first big viscous gob landed on her tongue. </p><p>Despite the humiliation it implied when factoring her position and my prisoner status, she didn’t seem too broken as she savored my seed, managing to swallow the most of it, and the little piece she failed to get slowly sliding down her lip, adding to her eroticism. </p><p>Watching as she swallowed my load without any prompting left me with one last question. What should be my next move?</p>
