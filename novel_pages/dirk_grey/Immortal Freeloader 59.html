        <p>“That’s enough for today,” she called when a servant barged in, interrupting the class long enough for the System to accept it. While we waited for her to receive an answer from her contact, she reached me about medicine and massage techniques. </p><p>Luckily, she was happy to watch as I applied those techniques to myself. Massaging an old woman pushing to a hundred and fifty — and that had been a shocking revelation — wouldn’t have been fun. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pity Bonus - 60 (Capped)]</p><p>[110x Return - Essence Massage Technique Lesson, Minor Immersion, Major Immersion]</p><p>[110x Return - Ordinary Massage Technique Lesson, Minor Immersion, Major Immersion]</p><p>[110x Return - Medicine Lesson, Minor Immersion]</p><p>Adding another lesson I didn’t dare to touch, afraid of the commotion. “Should I leave?” I said as I noticed the servant came carrying a letter. </p><p>“No, it’s about you as well, stay,” she said. She read the note a couple times, then looked at me. “You told me that you can move far faster than a caravan in the wilderness,” she said. </p><p>“Yes, great cultivator,” I said, deliberately avoiding to refer her as master, afraid that it would block the System. I wasn’t sure that was the case, but I rather practice with a less valuable source of information. </p><p>“Good,” she said, and paused for a moment. “And, you are willing to risk your life for my little niece?” </p><p>“Without a doubt,” I said, exaggerating my passion as I answered. But, her smile was enough to confirm that. </p><p>“Good, good,” she repeated. “I received the news from the Pavilion. They have the pill required, but someone needs to go and pick it up. But, you need to be careful. The cultivator marketplace is a dangerous place even for the mid-stage Qi Gathering cultivators, let alone a martial artist. If you ever reveal that you are carrying a pill with you, they will kill you instantly. Are you still willing?” </p><p>I nodded with a sharp determination, which, admittedly, was more than I felt, but accessing the cultivation market was not debatable. </p><p>I didn’t ask her why she didn’t go herself, as it was clear that she had long passed the time she could fight. A momentary explosion of power was all she could manage. </p><p>I needed to take the risk alone. </p><p>Of course, considering the threat of the place was more about forcing an early breakthrough than actually risking my life, it wasn’t exactly very important. With my unique abilities and my talismans, I was confident to resist a Third of Fourth Stage cultivator for a while … enough to force a breakthrough of my own. </p><p>“I can send a few Connate Realm artists to help,” she offered. </p><p>“No, they will only slow me down,” I disagreed. During these three days, I showed off some of my martial skills, enough to convince her that I could fight across martial realms if necessary. She had no trouble believing it because she ‘discovered’ my fate as an injured cultivator. And, from her perspective, an injured cultivator was still leagues better than any martial artist. </p><p>It had been an interesting experience. The more I showed my martial talent, the more she pitied me. Perspective was truly important. </p><p>Too bad that it didn’t come freely. Since she had known about my supposed past as a cultivator, she was far more careful about cultivation secrets. She shared martial arts secrets freely, but she didn’t let even the slightest cultivation secret slip out of her mouth. </p><p>It was a pity. I would have loved to have another cultivation combat technique. Currently, I only had a palm technique, which I had no idea how it rated against the others. </p><p>“Good. It’s the courage of the young that will set the future,” she said in approval. </p><p>She pulled out a small box, which had been sealed with Qi. “Give that to pavilion master, and he’ll give you the pill that silly girl needs,” she said. As she passed the box, I could see her reluctance. Clearly, it was precious. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was not a gift they had for me, which meant no return. </p><p>“Of course, you need to stop polishing your realm and breakthrough if you want to return on time,” she said. I looked at her questioningly. After all, I wasn’t supposed to know the time limit I mentioned in the fake letter. “Just to be on the safe side. I suspect someone might target her,” she suggested. </p><p>“Then, I’ll make sure to break through while running. If I do that, I’ll get even faster,” I said, giving her an excuse. </p><p>Then, she passed me a map that showed the location of the cultivator market, and a token to give me access, which was apparently required to even enter the Pavilion. They didn’t trigger any return either. I checked the map, and saw that there were three kingdoms between me and the market. Even with my speed, it would take at least two weeks under ideal conditions. </p><p>Meaning, that she expected me to spend four months back and forth based on what I had shown her. No wonder she asked me to increase my martial realm. </p><p>“I’ll ask the guards to allow you to leave at midnight. Leave then, and avoid the notice of the observers,” she ordered. </p><p>I nodded, and made a show of turning, but pausing just a bit, like I wanted to ask for something, but changed my mind at the last minute. I took a few steps before she called from behind. “What do you want?” she asked. Her tone made it clear that she expected something like that. </p><p>I faced her again. “I … I wouldn’t dare,” I said, looking shy. “You have already helped me so much.” </p><p>“Spill boy. I’m already about to die. I don’t have time to waste with such nonsense,” she said, slightly dissatisfied. </p><p>“I … May I ask you to teach me how to care for spirit plants,” I asked shyly. “Aisnam loves flowers, and if I can…” I said, pushing a deep blush on my face, doing my best to look like I was asking her help to look like I was just trying to find a way to court Aisnam rather than asking for a highly strategic logistic tool that would probably prove critical for me. </p><p>Especially since, my experience with Apothecary showed that, while the System was very strict when it came to using the rewards directly on others, as long as there was a process, it didn’t matter. I couldn’t just give my Qi Strands to Aisnam, but as long as I used the same Qi to tend to the spirit plants, it would be different. </p><p>Luckily, with the whole story of my presence, it had been enough. “Come here. I’ll teach you the basics, so at least you’ll know how to keep them alive,” she said. “The first thing you need to find is some remains of spirit beasts, something that could be turned to make compost. The spirit plants require a lot of Qi, especially during their early growth phase, and it needs to be gentle. Of course, the plants that could be raised like that are almost useless other than decoration. Anything worthwhile requires the support of a Qi vein.” She cackled. “I doubt you’ll be able to find one.” </p><p>With that, she launched a detailed lesson on how to grow and maintain spirit plants in an environment with limited Qi to support, how to tend them, and how to grow them. </p><p>I asked several questions, doing my best to look like I understood more than I actually did. “You have a talent for it,” she said, not bothering to hide her pity. After all, with my cultivation broken, having more talent meant wasting more talent. </p><p>However, once I managed to convince her I had some kind of instinctual comprehension of plant raising, her explanations got more detailed, turning completely incomprehensible. I had a feeling that, if I actually tried to understand her words, I would have developed a horrible headache, like the first time I tried to understand the meditation technique from the scrap. </p><p>Luckily, since she had no reason to believe I was faking it, whenever I responded with nonsensical poetry that seemed to be fitting, she chuckled, and her explanation turned even more incomprehensible. </p><p>Several times, she actually used her Qi to actively show what she had been trying to explain, each attempt exhausting her further. I must have really impressed her. That was why, toward the end, I started keeping my mouth shut, not wanting to ruin her good intent. </p><p>It was the cardinal rule of being a freeloader. Always knew where to stop. </p><p>“That’s enough for me, young man. I’m an old lady, and I need my sleep,” she said, finally ending the lesson as the sun was setting. </p><p> [Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pity Bonus - 60 (Capped)]</p><p>[110x Return - Gardening, Major Accomplishment, Minor Immersion]</p><p>[110x Return - Spirit Plant Care Lesson, Beginner, Perfection]</p><p>I smiled as I saw the result. Just a condensed class and I already reached Perfection. It once again showed that, the knowledge level of the teacher, and the detail level of the lesson played an important role in the final reward. Spirit plant care was no less complicated than the meditation lesson, yet I had reached Perfection in one class. </p><p>An incredible result. </p><p>“Thank you for your help, great cultivator,” I said. “Should I return here once I made the purchase?” </p><p>Her answer was quick, her expression tight. “No, and never reveal it to anyone. A pill to nourish damaged gates is valuable enough to start a mortal war. It’s better not to take any risk. Just use the token to access the market, make the exchange, and leave.” </p><p>I nodded in false acceptance. Naturally, I had many plans for the cultivator market. </p>
