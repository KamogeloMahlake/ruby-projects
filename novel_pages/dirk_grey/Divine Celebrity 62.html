        <p>“Oh, don’t worry about it, I have a really impressive plan,” Megan whispered as she led me through the party crowd, clearly frustrated as I enjoyed the treatment of the cheerleaders far more than I was supposed to, clearly under the impression that she had substantial control over our relationship. </p><p>One that I would have a great enjoyment disabusing her.  </p><p>I shared a glance with Kim, showing that she had the exact same amusement I felt at Megan’s words. But, since we were going through the party — with more than one gossiping and pointing excitedly as I walked through the crowd in full mast — I decided not to rain on her parade before we arrived in a private room. </p><p>She certainly earned that much consideration from me. </p><p>I climbed up the stairs, a crafty blonde on my right arm, and a sexy redhead wearing leather on the left. </p><p>It took a while for us to climb the stairs, mostly because of Megan’s deliberate slowness, intent on showing me off to the party just to highlight her victory against the allure of the cheerleaders — albeit, the fact that she required the very visible assistance of her friend to turn the situation into a threesome to win lessened the impressiveness of her victory. </p><p>Of course, I knew Megan to know that wasn’t what she intended to do but it was just something that she was dangling in front of the crowd, but the crowd was eating that up if their amused cheers and gossipy whispers were any indicators. </p><p>Then, she decided to give one last show to the crowd as we arrived at the top of the stairs, and I felt her hands on my shirt and she pulled me to a kiss. One that was supposed to be a fake one, but her tongue was suspiciously active in my mouth during her ‘fake’ kiss, showing that she wasn’t as unaffected by the collaborative show between me and the cheerleaders as she wanted me to think. </p><p>The intensity was enough to leave me slightly lightheaded once she pulled back, which was an even bigger achievement than before considering my recent physical improvements. </p><p>I didn’t have any time to catch my breath, not when another pair of lips clamped over mine, a leather-clad body pressing against mine, a tongue invading my mouth as a set of fragile fingers grabbed my hair, tight enough to actually hurt.  </p><p>“Not bad,” Kim murmured after pulling back, though as she pulled back her breath quickened considerably as well. Then, she turned to Megan and repeated louder. “Not bad, he might actually last until morning.” </p><p>“We’ll see,” Megan answered, once again loud enough to be heard by our onlookers, earning another set of cheers. </p><p>Cheers, that the offensive players in the crowd clearly didn’t appreciate. </p><p>Vicious of Megan, which I needed to take as a lesson before I decided to cross her. Not enough to actually stop me if I decided to do something like that, of course, but enough to give me second thoughts. </p><p>And, since I wanted to keep her in a good mood, I decided to give her a little gift in the process. I looked around to see Thad was still around — busy enjoying the attention of two cheerleaders at the same time. </p><p>Clearly, it wasn’t the of his meeting with the coach yet. </p><p>“Hey, Thad,” I shouted. And since I was the celebrity of the day, it actually made the people get silenced. </p><p>“Yes, Terry?” Thad asked, stopping kissing a buxom lady that seemed determined enough to destroy his pants through rubbing. </p><p>“Do you think Kevin would mind if I used his room?” I asked even as I tightened my arm around Megan’s waist, leaving no doubt what I was driving at. </p><p>“Not at all,” he said with a cheerful laugh. “He would be ecstatic helping his ex-girlfriend get laid. The second floor, at the end of the corridor.” Then, among the snickers of the crowd, he returned his attention back to the sexy cheerleaders. </p><p>We disappeared into the corridor even as the rest of the crowd exploded into mocking cheers, enjoying the scandal only a rich college student with absolutely no responsibility in their life could. </p><p>When we finally arrived at the room, Megan tightened in my arms, signaling that she was preparing to reject me the moment I pushed for more. </p><p>And, it would be a lie if I said I wasn’t tempted to push for more, especially after the combined show of the six cheerleaders really drove my arousal to the limit. Yet, if there was one thing that increased Seduction gave me, it was the ability to predict the results of her attitude and giving me the ability to counter it. </p><p>Since she was waiting for the excuse to shut the door on me, I decided not to give her that. Instead, I leaned to my left side, and captured Kim’s lips, enjoying a kiss that went long enough to make Megan shuffle in discomfort. </p><p>Her expression of frustration was beautiful as I pulled away without even bothering to repeat the attempt on her. “No kiss for me?” she asked, unable to help herself despite her intention. </p><p>“Well, since today is my date with Kim, one that you had gone all that trouble to arrange, I thought it would be unfair to pay attention to you,” I said. </p><p>“Right, he’s mine tonight,” Kim interjected smugly, more than happy to join me to make her friend back. Just because she enjoyed Megan’s favor-enforced date didn’t mean she would miss the opportunity to mess with her. </p><p>Such good friends. </p><p>“Do you girls mind if I take a quick shower,” I said. </p><p>“Not at all,” Kim answered. </p><p>Megan was more vocal. “Go ahead, and make sure you use a lot of soap, who knows just how many diseases those whores have,” she said, not bothering to conceal her distaste toward the cheerleaders. </p><p>What an amusing dynamic. </p><p>I was about to take a step toward the en-suite bathroom — another evidence of the luxury the quarterback, even a backup, got by default — when Kim grabbed my arm, her grip tight, preventing me from walking. </p><p>“Don’t be in such a rush,” she said with a chuckle, looking at her friend. “I’m sure Terry wouldn’t mind giving us a little show, to pay back for allowing us to get the earlier reward.” </p><p>There were a lot of things I could say, from asking for a service in return, to mention I was the one that was helping them by allowing their kisses. But since I wasn’t a total moron, I said nothing, and let Megan decide. </p><p>Kim’s expression, was clearly about teasing her friend as much as it was about having me strip. After all, if she wanted to see me, she could have just stepped into the shower ‘to help'. </p><p>“I’m sure his fragile male ego can’t handle being objectified by our gaze. Could it, Terry?” she asked, the last word pronounced tight enough to convey her threat perfectly. </p><p>“Well, if you say so,” I said with a smirk even as I grabbed my shirt, amused by her word choice. She clearly wanted to see me strip, but instead of admitting that, she chose to goad me in a belligerent manner. </p><p>If it wasn’t for Kim’s presence, I would have denied her implicit request, but luckily, Kim’s presence gave me many different ways to mess with her, and an early illusion of victory for her wouldn’t hurt much. </p><p>I pulled off my shirt with smooth, exaggerated movement, one that went surprisingly smooth. I wasn’t exactly a spectacular dancer, but exaggerating my movements, combined with my most recent Agility boost, helped me to replicate a sexy dancer’s attitude decently enough. </p><p>Though, my muscles certainly helped. </p><p>“You definitely know how to pick them, he’s even dishier than I remember,” Kim whispered to Megan while I continued to pull the shirt higher, giving them an even better glimpse of my body. </p><p>Luckily, despite the very intimate glance she had gotten onto my body the week before, the Traits worked slowly on the way I looked, turning what might have been a panicked call for medical assistance into an aroused gaze instead. </p><p>After getting rid of my shirt, I stood in front of them and gave an exaggerated muscle pose, and pushed down my pants, displaying my length with all its glory, thick and tall enough to steal their words. </p><p>Kim’s interest was rather predictable. She hadn’t hidden her interest since the day we met — rather directly, I might add —  but the way Megan’s eyes widened was a surprise. </p><p>Yes, she had been aware of its size thanks to the number of times I had pushed against her, but it was the first time she was getting such an unfettered view. Even during the strip show, she had not got a good glimpse because of the others in the way. </p><p>“And that’s the end of the show,” I said as I turned my back and started walking into the showers. </p><p>“That’s it?” Kim asked, her smirk hungry. </p><p>“Yes, unless you’re willing to follow me to the shower,” I said, not bothering to stop my walk. Footsteps followed me. </p><p>“Kim, what are you doing,” Megan said with a sudden shock, revealing who was the one that was following me. </p><p>“Hey, you’re the one that forced me to a date, I’m just working on it to not to make a liar out of you,” Kim answered as I disappeared into the bathroom, aware that she would follow me. </p><p>The day was developing truly excellently. </p>
