        <p>I woke up to the sound of footsteps, walking down the stairs. </p><p>I was happy, which was the natural consequence of waking up wrapped with the deliciously naked body of a busty blonde, still carrying several marks from the night of debauchery we shared. Especially since not all of them were her work. </p><p>Some of them were the work of the person who was busy walking down the stairs, my blonde paramour’s brunette friend, trying to do the walk of shame before she got caught. Just another reason to have a big smile. </p><p>I was tempted to let her succeed in her aim of getting away while I stayed in Carrie’s arms for a long sleep, but I decided against it. The last night was hardly the casual evening three friends could have, and making sure she wasn’t plagued by negative emotions was the decent thing to do. </p><p>Also, she was too cute to escape without a morning kiss. </p><p>Slipping out of the bed without waking up Carrie was a challenge, but her exhaustion made it easier. She was extremely aroused after watching me take her friend’s first time, enough to make me work hard for almost two hours before she finally crashed into a hazy collapse, a big smile on her lips.</p><p>I considered leaving the room naked, but decided against it. It was better to check her mood before teasing her in such a spectacular manner. Instead, I wrapped a towel around my waist, leaving my muscular chest naked. </p><p>A nice balance between modesty and teasing. </p><p>When I left the room, I was more focused on being fast than being silent, not wanting Sarah to slip away before I could catch her. But when I stood at the top of the stairs, I realized it was a pointless rush. </p><p>The reason, Sarah was trying to find her underwear, the ones she had discarded during our naughty game the night before, where she had pushed far more than she had planned in a pointless attempt to surpass Carrie, unaware of the lengths her shy blonde friend had gone beforehand. </p><p>So, as I moved down the stairs, I focused more on not making a noise, enjoying the view as she bent over the couch, trying to find her clothes in the messiness of the couch. Pity that she had come with an overnight bag, meaning the ones she was trying to find wasn’t her only clothes. </p><p>She was wearing a skirt that would have been modest if she wasn’t fully bending over, riding it high enough to reveal her panties. And unlike her skirt, those red lace panties were nothing that could be classified as modest, hinting at the beauty of her core. </p><p>The same beautiful world I had invaded last night, with a spectacular outcome for both of us. </p><p>A tent appeared in front of me as I closed the distance, the towel failing to contain my reaction. Understandable even after a night of sensual fun. If there was one thing good about trying to be a professional sportsman, it was the endless libido as a result of equally endless training. </p><p>Especially with the presence of some sexy ladies appreciating that feature. </p><p>“Good morning,” I said, a smile coloring my face as Sarah turned in panic, failing to realize the impact of such a sharp move would have on her flowing skirt, providing a full range display of her panties before she could put her hands on the hem and push it down. </p><p>“G-good morning,” she stammered, her usual sharp speech replaced with a shy stutter more fitting her formerly-shy friend. </p><p>I sent a pointed gaze to her bag, before shifting back to her blushing face. “You’re not thinking of leaving without a breakfast, right?” I said. </p><p>“I have some stuff to do,” she answered, this time managing not to stutter, but still escaped my gaze. </p><p>“Nonsense, it’s Saturday. Whatever you have can wait until you have a good breakfast, even if you don’t want to wait until Carrie wakes up.” </p><p>The mention of her friend only intensified her blush, along with a great deal of guilt. After all, in her mind, she had betrayed her friend by stealing me while her friend was sleeping, unaware that the said friend had been watching us all along, with more enthusiasm than she could ever imagine. </p><p>Too bad that her misplaced guilt just made it easier to play with her. And Carrie’s actions, especially the last part in the bedroom where she actually sneaked in, showed that she was more than happy about pushing it forward. </p><p>“Maybe a quick coffee,” she relented after a failed attempt to exert her will. </p><p>“Excellent, do you mind helping me in the kitchen?” </p><p>Her gaze dipped down to my towel, and the tent in the front. “Aren’t you going to change first?” she asked. </p><p>“Why?” I whispered, shifting my tone into a dark, throaty grunt, an excellent method to trigger a shiver on my target. Sarah reacted just as I expected, and I used the opportunity to take a step closer. “Don’t tell me you’re feeling shy after the last night?” Her eyes grew in panic. </p><p>“Don’t talk about that. It never happened,” she gasped. </p><p>“What, swimming together in the pool?” I said, acting confused. Her sudden freeze was beautiful. “I was talking about the towel covering more than the swimsuit.” A short pause for impact as my lips twisted into a smirk. ‘Why? Are you talking about something different?” </p><p>She was a smart girl, fully aware that I was mocking her. But that didn’t mean she had a response for it. “T-that’s swimming,” she managed to answer. </p><p>“Nonsense, I wouldn’t say anything if you put on that delicious black swimsuit again.” </p><p>Sarah said nothing as I walked toward the kitchen, and she followed. “I just don’t want Carrie to misunderstand anything,” she said. </p><p>I was tempted to tease her about her word choice, in particular using misunderstanding, but the sudden tightness of her voice suggested that I had stepped into dangerous territory, and pushing more was not the smartest idea. </p><p>Instead, I moved to the fridge, and pulled a small carton of eggs. I broke eight in quick succession, before noticing Sarah’s gaze. “Sorry, forgot to ask. Do you want eggs, or are you more of a cereal person?” </p><p>“Normally I would prefer a lighter breakfast, but since you already prepared…” she said. </p><p>I chuckled. “Oh, no, those are just for me. I’ll add some more if you want,” I said even as I started whisking them rapidly, even as I started to heat a pan, then pulled some pre-sliced potatoes and onions from the freezer. </p><p>“Then no,” she murmured.</p><p>“Are you sure?” I said. “Because I make a mean Spanish omelet,” I said. And it wasn’t even an empty brag. Taking enough protein was always a big part of professional sports, so any aspiring amateur worth his salt would have a decent number of protein-heavy dishes that could be prepared easily. </p><p>“Maybe I can try,” she said, unable to reject my enthusiasm. I added two more eggs, one for Carrie, one for her, before putting the mixture on the pan, creating a thick layer that looked like a pie from a distance. </p><p>“How can you eat that much for breakfast?” Sarah asked, though it was not only about her shock, but also her desperate attempt to pull the discussion away from any thorny subject. like the interesting game we had played on the couch, or our private time in the pool. </p><p>… or, me pushing inside her in my bedroom, again and again. </p><p>“Hey, those muscles need a lot of food,” I said with a goofy tone. I give her an exaggerated strongman pose, a silly smile on my face. If I was dressed normally, it would have been a simple joke pose. But wearing nothing but a towel, with my whole body in display, it was a different deal. I heard her beautiful gasp as I stretched my muscles, enjoying the way a fresh blush crept up her neck. </p><p>I didn’t actually intend for my towel to loosen and slip, but when it happened, I wasn’t particularly fast as I reached down, giving her enough time to enjoy the full view as I grabbed it, stretching various muscles to the best effect. </p><p>And despite the disapproving gasp she let out when it first happened, she didn’t look particularly torn-up as I moved slowly to grab it up. </p><p>“Do you mind making the coffee,” I had to say to make her pull her gaze away from my midsection. </p><p>“Where’s it?” she asked after filling the drip machine. </p><p>“The second one on the right,” I said, and she was quick to turn — though, this time, she remembered holding her skirt — and open the cabinet, interested in the opportunity of looking away. </p><p>How amusing, I thought. </p><p>She rose to her tiptoes, but still failed to reach it. “Let me help,” I whispered as I stood behind her. And my erection pushing against her amazing hips was a complete coincidence. Just as my other hand slipped under her skirt to caress the texture of her panties. </p><p>I put the box in her hands, but stayed in place. “Are you going to let me go?” she gasped, her voice tense with arousal. </p><p>Leaning forward even more, my naked chest pressing against her back, I whispered into her ear. “Do you want me to let you go?” I asked. </p><p>Her silence was perfect to convey her conflict. “W-we can’t,” she finally whispered. “I can’t do that to my friend.” </p><p>I could have reminded her that she had already betrayed her friend — at least from her own perspective — but despite the slow response, she sounded pretty determined. And I still have an omelet to finish cooking, so I decided to let her have that victory. </p><p>Carrie picked that moment to stroll down the stairs, wearing only a bathrobe. And since it was a normal-sized one I kept for any nighttime guests, it didn’t properly fit her, strained especially on the chest area and around the hips. </p><p>She was just wearing a carelessly-tied bathrobe, providing an amazing show. </p><p>Normally, it was to be expected to cease any kind of flirting going on between me and Sarah, but the sudden angry expression on Sarah’s face, tinged with jealousy… </p>
