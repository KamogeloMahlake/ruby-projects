        <p>The silence that stretched as Carrie slowly slipped in the pool gently without breaking the water, while Sarah watched her with shock, and no small amount of jealously —though clearly unaware of the latter. It wasn’t that she was a bad girl, but clearly, she was having trouble processing the amazing display Carrie was putting with her red bikini —one that was supposed to be modest, but failed to contain Carrie’s boundless curves. </p><p>The silence reigned as Carrie swam toward us. I was mesmerized as I watched her voluptuous body slice across the water. And from what I could decipher from Sarah’s expression, I wasn’t the only one that was mesmerized by her movement. The way she wore her bikini was already amazing before her action pushed the already strained capacity to the limit, stretching beautifully. The cups of her bikini top barely held her large breasts, and as her ass floated, the bottom clung to her ass very tightly. </p><p>There was an unusual smirk on her lips as she finally came to a stop next to us. “So, what were you guys talking about?” she asked with a smooth casualness that had to be intentional. Her confidence was clearly being fueled by Sarah’s attitude. </p><p>It would be a lie to say that I was unhappy about that. It wouldn’t be the first time I enjoy the fruits of two good friends feeling trying to outdo each other. </p><p>“Nothing much, we were just chatting about the classes,” Sarah answered, but only after a noticeable delay. </p><p>“Yeah, just chitchatting,” I added, before making a comment about today’s cafeteria lunch, launching casual chitchat as we chilled on the pool for the next half an hour. Sarah lost her hesitation after her initial shock, but her tenseness didn’t evaporate completely even after a few minutes. I noticed her low-key jealousy simmering underneath her calm response. </p><p>Carrie noticed that as well, and decided to fuel it further, which was our plan in the first place. As we spoke, she slid closer to me, touching my arm and shoulder for one than once. “So, any thoughts about college life?” Carrie asked. “Do you think it’ll be better than high school?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” I answered with a smirk as I let my gaze dip down slowly, enjoying the sight of her enticing cleavage for an extended time before turning my gaze to Sarah and repeated the action, not bothering to hide the glint in my gaze. “College needs to be pretty damn good to surpass my high school experience.” </p><p>The way they both blushed under my hungry gaze was beautiful. However, since Carrie was much more familiar with my flirting —and much more— she recovered from her blush quicker. She made a show of checking my muscular shoulders before responding. “Well, I can see the logic,” she gasped. </p><p>Sarah’s expression of shock as Carrie flirted me openly shocked her even more than her choice of swimsuit. She staggered as I put my arm on Carrie’s bare shoulder, enjoying the warmth of her skin as we had a flirtatious pool chat. </p><p>As we talked, her body started to react to my presence honestly. While her lower body was buried underwater, making it hard for me to be sure whether she was subtly rubbing her legs together, the presence of her nipples, getting more and more visible through her swimsuit, was significantly easier to notice. </p><p>And I wasn’t the only one to notice that. </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I watched as Sarah’s expression stiffen in determination while Carrie focused on flirting with me, especially when Carrie was touching me. </p><p>“So, Chad,” Sarah said as she scooted closer in a moment Carrie’s flirting stalled. “I was recently thinking about start exercising. Do you have any recommendations?” </p><p>“Why you decided to ask me?” I said mockingly, even though her plan was rather obvious. </p><p>“I’m guessing that exercise takes quite a bit of your time,” Sarah countered, but her words were as pointless as my rhetorical question. Her real aim was to reach my arm and caress my biceps, like she was making a point, conveniently positioning her body between me and Carrie as she did so. “You certainly have the evidence for it.” </p><p>“That’s a fair assumption,” I said with a smirk, while Sarah kept her hand on my biceps in a pointed manner, squeezing. “There’s not much I can recommend. You just need the discipline.” </p><p>Sarah listened attentively as I listed several basic exercises she could use, but didn't take her hand off my arm. “That sounds useful,” she murmured. I could see the collapse of Carrie’s self-confidence the real-time as Sarah continued to question me about the advantages and disadvantages of various exercises, getting handsier as she did so. </p><p>I didn’t stop her for three reasons. The first reason was that it was a part of Carrie’s challenge. The whole point was to prove to her friend that she was a confident woman that could handle her own flirting, and a part of that was to defend her territory when another female tried to cut in. </p><p>The second reason was that I was amused by the way jealousy drove Sarah to stab her friend in the back without the slightest hesitation, too envious to actually realize the potential impact it might have on her friendship. Though, considering the dynamics of their friendship group, I was willing to believe that it was simple oversight rather than maliciousness. Still, it was rather fun. And just to make things more fun, I doubted Sarah was consciously aware of her emotional journey. </p><p>And the third reason was that I saw absolutely no reason to reject them as a fit brunette, sexy despite her relatively conservative swimsuit, flirting with me in a pool. </p><p>So, when she decided to change the dry topic of best exercise methodology, I wasn’t surprised. “It’s getting chilly out there. Let’s go inside and play a game instead,” she said with an excessive cheeriness, her sharp tone back in the discussion. </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I turned to Carrie, checking for her response. </p><p>“Fine by me,” Carrie said, but her casual confidence which she was building carefully during the discussion took a substantial hit as she noticed Sarah’s playful smile. Apparently, her external confidence that was born from her daring display wasn’t as stable as I had first assumed. “What do you have in mind?” </p><p>“It’s not a big crowd, but that’s nothing preventing us from turning it into a proper party,” Sarah said, satisfied with the sudden shift of the discussion as she walked at the edge of the pool, and put her hands on the side before pulling herself up. “Let’s play some truth and dare.” </p><p>To make things more fun, Sarah took her sweet time pulling herself up, giving us an extended view of her bottom. It was a tight ass, her best feature without the slightest doubt, and the extended show suggested that she decided to counter Carrie’s advantage directly. </p><p>Admittedly, it was an effective strategy. </p><p>I watched her slow climb in appreciation, and my focused gaze on her ass dealt another blow to Carrie’s already trembling confidence. A more confident person might have poked my side to punish me from my gaze, but Carrie just wilted silently. </p><p>A little assistance was needed, I decided. I scooted closer to Carrie and grabbed her ass aggressively. She jumped up in shock, a little yelp escaping her mouth, which made Sarah turn toward her and ask curiously. “Is there something wrong?” </p><p>“N-no, I just hit my toe,” she stammered, the relative darkness of the garden not enough to hide her furious blush, but since I already took a couple steps forward when Sarah turned to look, there was nothing to be suspicious. Sarah continued her climb, but after being distracted by Carrie’s interlude, she climbed quicker, abandoning her picturesque approach. </p><p>After Sarah turned away, I sent a saucy wink to Carrie before climbing after Sarah, leaving Carrie blushing in the pool. “So, Chad, the bathroom is upstairs, right?” Sarah asked as she put her hand on my forearm in a manner that was supposed to be casually, but in practice, happened rather clunky. Still, I wasn’t going to go as far as to tell that it wasn’t effective, as while it was delivered clumsily, it was still delivered by a sexy girl wearing a cute black bikini, still glistening. </p><p>I could have offered her the one on the ground floor, but having her on the second floor worked to my benefit. “You can use that, it’s the second door on the right,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>Sarah just smiled before turning back and leaving the garden with an excessive sway of her hips. Apparently, her determination to set me up with Carrie didn’t survive for long under the stirrings of her jealousy. </p><p>No surprise that many friendships between women were destroyed by love triangles. </p><p>As Sarah disappeared in the stairs, I helped Carrie to climb out of the pool. She was still blushing, but avoided my gaze. “Is there something wrong?” I asked. “You are kind of off in the last few minutes. Have you changed your mind about making her pay?” As I talked, I grabbed her waist and pulled her closer, until her covered breasts were pressing against my chest, which was enough to pull her from her funk. </p><p>“N-no, I didn’t,” she stammered. “I was just feeling a bit overwhelmed,” she explained. </p><p>I caressed her cheek. “Come on, sweetie. There’s nothing to be ashamed of, not from me at least. Just do your best.” </p><p>“I know, but I feel self-conscious.” </p><p>“You need to challenge yourself more,” I said with a sigh. “Are you going to try, or should we just call it off?” </p><p>My suggestion of disappointment seemed to work. Her expression stiffened. “No, I will continue,” she said. </p><p>My smile widened into a smirk. “Then, let’s test your resolve,” I said even as I grabbed the strings of her bottom, and with a tug, pulled them free. As she gasped, reaching desperately for her bottoms, I repeated the trick with her top, leaving her completely naked. </p><p>“Chad!” she gasped in shock. </p><p>She only received a teasing gaze from me. “You better rush to the showers if you don’t want to be caught by Sarah,” I reminded her, and she dashed in the house, giving me a scene worthy of an R-rated version of a Baywatch remake. I just chuckled as I watched, happy with the way the night was developing… </p>
