        <p>Hi everyone. </p><p>An important update about the story. </p><p>With the latest chapter, we have finally entered the last phase, which will be essentially several chapters that would function as epilogue based on the story developments and will reveal the future of the world. </p><p>I'll probably have a poll about what to replace the slot once the epilogue comes to an end. </p>
