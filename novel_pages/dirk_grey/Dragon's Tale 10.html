        <p>For a while, I said nothing in favor of watching Lillian’s expression change as I gently rubbed the soles of her feet. It was a beautiful sight, her naked body barely visible under the shimmering surface of the water with strands of her beautiful hair sticking to her shoulders in their wetness.  </p><p>It was a pity that she was too distracted by the possibility of her communications being intercepted. </p><p>I didn’t say anything and let her process by herself, not willing to raise the other possibility that there was a traitor in her house that arranged her kidnapping. After all, no matter how capable, I didn’t believe a pirate would have dared to take such a risk without a high chance of success and remotely listening to scraps of communication was not enough. However, I didn’t want to mention the possibility without any evidence, because it would make her worry unnecessarily. </p><p>I needed her unencumbered by such silly emotions for tonight. </p><p>As I expected, it didn’t take long for her attention to shift, away from the long term implications of the breach, back to the present. When I noticed her blush once more, signaling that she was once again aware of the implications of sharing a naked bath together, I brought my hands to her calves, caressing them softly, and enjoying the way she shivered, unrelated to the coldness of the water. “Maybe we should rest,” she murmured shyly. </p><p>“Not a bad idea,” I said casually while my hands climbed up her thighs, dangerously close to her entrance. “But we should do that after cleaning ourselves thoroughly. Maybe a massage to help you recover from the exertion,” I explained. </p><p>“Really-YYY!” she said, her sarcastic response turning into a shocked moan as I caressed her entrance, making her moan. She tried to look angry when she found herself under my amused gaze, but my finger around her knob prevented her from saying anything, converting her words to moans.</p><p>“Did you say something?” I asked, not bothering to hide the amusement in my tone as she trembled under my touch once more. Her inability to answer left her frustrated, but after the adrenaline-filled escape, her body was too alert to suppress her pleasure. </p><p>Sometimes, danger was the best aphrodisiac. </p><p>Seeing that she was busy biting her cheeks to hide her moans -rather unsuccessfully i might add- I decided to push forward. I grabbed her waist with my other hand and pulled her onto my lap. Distracted by the pleasure, she reacted only when she landed on my lap, her back pressing against my chest, my shaft trapped between her tight asscheeks. It was a pity that I promised to respect her virginity, preventing me from plunging inside her mercilessly. </p><p>“What are you doing!” she exclaimed, this time her shock enough to overcome her pleasure. </p><p>“Helping you clean,” I whispered as one of my hands grabbed her breast while the other continued to caress her entrance gently, relying on a ridiculous pretense. “Why, are you complaining?” I added. </p><p>“Yes!” she said immediately, and then followed it with a moan when I caressed her entrance. “No!” she corrected herself instinctively while my fingers sank deeper into her breast. “I don’t know,” she said at last, her tone reflecting excitement and arousal in equal amounts. </p><p>“Then, why don’t we discover the answer together,” I whispered into her ear, making her shiver. She didn’t respond verbally, but the way she leaned back and parted her legs, giving me full access to her body was enough of an answer. I let my hands roam over her body, moving back and forth freely without consequence as I pushed her arousal higher while also getting rid of all the dirt and grime our bodies collected during our desperate escape. Miraculously, she managed to keep herself from moaning, for a while, at least.  </p><p>Then, I leaned forward and pressed my lips to her neck, biting her softly for a moment before my lips started to dance over her skin. In response, her hips started to dance up and down, massaging my shaft nicely. “Better,” I whispered in approval even as I used a flare of mana to freeze a small ice cube, and circled it around her nipple. She shivered sexily, tempting me to push forward. </p><p>It was a pity that I promised not to touch her virginity. </p><p>Still, it wasn’t exactly a huge pity, I decided as I caressed her entrance once more while her hips rocked, her tight asscheecks doing their best to imprison my shaft between them. If those snotty noble boys who had done their best to pursue her only to be dismissed again and again had seen her on my lap, naked and obedient as I nibbled on her neck and teased her with an ice cube, they would have gone crazy. Unfortunately for those assholes, for tonight, Lillian was my little noble toy. </p><p>“So, tell me, Lillian, do you like this?” I said even as my fingers once again probed her entrance, making her shiver helplessly. </p><p>I liked the way she turned to face me, once again her shyness showing itself at my reminder, with guilt mixed in. She knew that what she  was doing was extremely wrong, but her desires, combined with my impressive heroism prevented her from acting on that guilt. Instead, she obediently nodded, and when I leaned forward, accepted my kiss obediently. </p><p>It was all I needed to let my fingers loose on her body mercilessly. My left hand teased her clit again and again, even occasionally slipping inside whenever she was too distracted by my kiss, while my right hand dragged the conjured ice cube mercilessly along her nipples, contrasting the warmth of the spring we were bathing in. </p><p>Under my determined assault, it wasn’t shocking for her to start shivering once again under my touch, trying to resist another orgasm. When she collapsed against my chest, I let her breathe for a while. After all, several orgasms and a long chase scene was difficult to handle. </p><p>But when I saw that she was about to fall asleep, I captured her lips in a domineering kiss without warning, the invasion of my tongue doing wonders to dispel her drowsiness. Then, just as she was getting in the mood, I pushed her back a bit, and under her confused glare, pulled myself out of the water, and sat on the corner of the spring, my legs still in the water.</p><p>Her lack of understanding only lasted until I pointed at the massive monster between my legs, waiting for a release for too long. After everything that had happened today, I had no intention of going to sleep with blue-balls. “It’s time to continue where we left off,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“I…” she murmured in shock, her eyes firmly locked on my shaft, no doubt trying to process just how dangerously close it was to truly ruining her. She took a deep breath as she tried to gather her wits, but her eyes stayed locked on my shaft. “I can’t do it,” she said, in a way she clearly thought came off as determined, but her fascinated gaze undermined her position. She stood up, the water barely deep enough to cover her thighs, but she didn’t bother to cover her body with her arms. </p><p>“Come on, princess,” I said lightly as I leaned back a bit, which only highlighted my erection further. “Don’t you think that it’s unfair not to reciprocate after everything I have done for you,” I added even as I examined her body without bothering to hide my desire. </p><p>“I…” she repeated, trying to look determined, but failing halfway. “I have never done something like this before!” </p><p>“Don’t worry, princess. I’ll teach you,” I said and presented my hand to her, and, despite knowing where it would lead, she closed the distance. “Excellent,” I said even as I led her hand to my thigh. “Now, crouch down,” I ordered, and she fulfilled that order readily, dwindling the distance between my shaft and her beautiful lips.  </p><p>Her fingers were trembling as she wrapped them around the base of my shaft, her eyes widening a bit more when her fingers failed to connect. She looked at me with shock, and I just smirked, knowing that she was trying to imagine how it would fit her mouth. </p><p>“Tell me what you are going to do?” I said. </p><p>“You can’t be serious!” she exclaimed, looking scandalized, but the important detail was her fingers were still wrapped around my shaft. </p><p>“What?” I answered with a mocking smirk. “Are you saying that you’re willing to suck my cock, but you’re too weak to say you are?” </p><p>She took another deep breath, but the explosion I expected failed to come to fruition. Instead, she avoided my gaze as her lips parted. “How dare you,” she said, but her words were weak, without any weight. </p><p>“Why wouldn’t I dare?” I said. “You were rather happy when I licked and fingered you to orgasm several times. Is it too wrong to actually want retribution?” </p><p>She whispered in response. “You’re right.” </p><p>“Then say what you are going to do to  pay me back,” I asked her, enjoying the way she trembled. </p><p>“I’m going to…” she murmured before taking a deep breath, but continuing with a whisper that would have been impossible to hear without the changes my body was going through. “… suck you.” </p><p>“Good girl,” I said as I patted her head gently. “Then, suck it,” I said as I gently grabbed her head and gently pulled her forward until her lips pressed against my head, and my shaft trembled, more from the importance of the moment rather than the sensation itself. Here I was, alone with one of the most prestigious heiresses in the school, and she was about to willingly suck me like a two-bit whore. </p><p>I was impressed when she opened her mouth obediently and moved her head forward, engulfing the tip with her warmth. She moved back and forth a bit, her eyes firmly shut. I pulled my hands away, curious just how far she was going to go on her first attempt. </p><p>The answer turned out to be not that far. She pulled back a few seconds later, her eyes firmly avoiding me. “How was it?” she asked in a trembling tone. </p><p>“Not bad for a start, but be careful with the teeth, and of course, don’t be afraid to go deep.” </p><p>That managed to turn her gaze back to my face. “You want me to go deeper!” she asked, clearly having no idea what constituted a good blowjob. </p><p>“Of course, princess,” I said. “I want you to swallow at least half of it.” </p><p>“Half,” she repeated in shock as she moved her hand upward in shock as she tried to measure my length. “But that’s impossible!” </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t even measure some peasants?” I said mercilessly. “So much for noble superiority.” </p><p>“You- how - but!” she sputtered in shock, but seeing my dismissive shrug, her eyes were on fire once more. She was smart enough to realize that I was goading her, but the pride of a woman was an interesting thing. “I’ll show you my superiority for once, then mock you as I invade your dreams,” she said heatedly, then leaned forward without even waiting for a response, pushing deep. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said once more as she actually pushed herself halfway down my shaft despite a gag that escaped her mouth, and looked at me victoriously. I didn’t know what she was expecting, but seeing her watching me victoriously while trying to open her mouth as much as possible to accommodate my shaft, but the site of it managed to trigger my new instincts once more, begging for me to dominate her. </p><p>This time, I was too aroused to resist. </p><p>“Good attempt,” I said as I put my hands to the back of her head, cutting off her escape route. “But now we’re going to do the real thing. Open your mouth as much as possible, and relax,” I ordered, unlike the other times, my tone neither calm nor mocking. Instead, a deep rumble escaped my mouth, more animal than human, something I didn’t know I was capable of.  </p><p>Lillian trembled. </p><p>She trembled, but it wasn’t fear I saw flaring in her eyes for a moment before she firmly shut them and swallowed my shaft. Instead, it was submission, triggered by my primal tone. That expression destroyed the last of my restraint, and I pushed deep into her throat, her gags echoing in the cave. </p><p>Her determination to keep her eyes closed didn’t last long when I pushed deeper into her throat, widening in shock to reveal her beautiful eyes in a novel expression. I ignored her failure to breath, and slowly pushed deeper in her throat, her throat wrapping around me nicely even as a bulge appeared. </p><p>“I’m impressed, I didn’t expect you to handle the full length,” I said, ignoring her obvious distress as she tried to breathe. Though, considering her hands laid on my legs obediently rather than trying to push back, I doubted her distress was aimed at making me stop. Even if it was, I wasn’t sure I would be able to control my own desires. </p><p>Letting my new instincts win was obviously dangerous, but seeing Lillian’s pouty lips around the base of my shaft while she struggled to breathe was not something that helped me control my desire. My instincts took control as I moved forward a bit, enough for my feet to press on the bottom of the spring before cutting loose, drilling into her throat mercilessly. </p><p>Then, without a warning, I pulled back, leaving her gasping and coughing helplessly. “What was that?” she managed to say between her attempts to breathe. </p><p>“That, princess, was a deepthroat,” I said in the same animalistic voice even as I held her beautiful blonde locks around my fist, but refrained from pulling her once more. “Why? Do you have a problem with it?” </p><p>She waited a moment to look down, courage shining in her eyes. Unfortunately, that ended up to be short lived under my gaze, melting quickly to leave its place to obedience, and without me pushing, she leaned forward to wrap her lips around my shaft once more. It surprised me at first, but it became clear when I saw my reflection in the water, the sharpness of my expression rivaling my tone, dangerous and animalistic. </p><p>It was another piece of evidence of my transformation, and once again I found myself discarding it in favor of the lips moving deeper on my shaft. I couldn’t help but chuckle as I pushed it deep once more, earning another string of gasps and gags. This time, I kept her pinned as I rammed into her again and again as my own explosion continued to build up. </p><p>I continued despite her involuntary tears, only pulling back halfway back occasionally to let her breathe enough to keep her conscious, while she proved herself by obediently taking my attention. I pulled back at the last second, covering her elegant noble face with my seed much to her shock. She wanted to argue, clearly, but she was too busy trying to breathe to do so. </p><p>I once again sat on the corner of the spring, watching her gasping for air. She didn’t collapse into the water only because her hand was on my thigh, supporting her. It would be a lie to say that I wasn’t tempted to continue, but I had one problem. My new instincts were pushing for me to do the same thing. Worse, after letting them get away with it once, they were even stronger. </p><p>I needed to stay in control, which was why I pulled out of the water while she desperately tried to wash her face. I wanted to order her to keep it on her face, but I was afraid of succeeding. If she actually listened to my command to keep her face covered with my cum, controlling those instincts would become impossible. </p><p>So, I stepped out of the cave and quickly cut a couple bushels of grass and pulled some soft-looking branches. After using a simple earth spell to beat and squeeze them several times, I created a soft material, enough to make it into a temporary bed. </p><p>When I returned to the cave, Lillian was pulling herself out of the water, her body even sexier as it shone in its wetness, dripping water down it and reminding me of a water nymph. Unfortunately, I ignored the sight in favor of quickly building a bed, not trusting myself to keep back. “You can stay back and sleep for a while,” I said, knowing that she was exhausted enough even without my latest treatment. “I’m going to hunt for a bit.” </p><p>She nodded. I was unable to solve the complicated gaze she sent my way, and with her naked body tempting me, I didn’t spend a lot of time solving that either. “Okay,” she said in a soft voice. </p><p>I nodded and stepped out, hoping to find a decent hunt, and maybe test the limits of my new ability in the process…</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
