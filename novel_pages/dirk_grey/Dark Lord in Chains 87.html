        <p>The mystery behind her name was important, one that I fully intended to explore. </p><p>But it was not the task for the moment, not when I was watching her body tremble helplessly in front of me as I watched her, on her knees, obediently accepting the presence of the silver chain around her neck. </p><p>It was a thing of pure amazement, watching her confidence and abrasion slowly eroding into obedience as the pleasure invaded her body…  </p><p>Inexperience was a dangerous thing. </p><p>Admittedly, she wasn’t as bad as Aria had been, her immense magical potential and her outward confidence creating a much stronger outer layer. Aria wouldn’t be able to survive alone without the protection afforded by her status, just like a cute little lamb lost in the forest, unprotected from the jaws of the predators. </p><p>Unfortunately for Cinder, the strength of her exterior prickly personality meant that she was equally vulnerable once someone daring — admittedly to a crazy level, enough to push forward, risking a battle that would leave an area of several miles radius in cinders. Just thinking the pun put a smile on my face, but I certainly wasn’t crazy enough to say that out loud. </p><p>Not even as the pleasure invaded her deep enough that she accepted the presence of the chain. I had a feeling that the comment would push her too much. </p><p>I turned my attention back to how to process. The additional services I managed to convince her to receive during the massage managed to destroy that prickly exterior, revealing a soft heart, one that was longing for comfort and pleasure. </p><p>I was more than willing to test whether my own brand of attention could fill that gap. </p><p>“So, you have completed the preparatory steps, are you ready for the real massage,” I said even as I leaned back. Though, that was not the extent of my moves to reflect my confidence. The real move came later. I tugged her chain, the pull making her stand up. </p><p>She stood up slowly, the move making her amazing curves ripple in a way that tempted me to abandon the theatrics and enjoy the show. I took a deep breath as I glanced at her, the chain still connected to her neck while she was otherwise naked and trembling, her beautiful wings flickering in intensity.  </p><p>“P-preparatory steps…” she murmured in a daze, but only after she fully stood up to show just how much time she needed to process it, unable to hide her surprise. “Was that—“ she started, only for me to tug the chain to silence her. </p><p>Admittedly, her half-formed statement was accurate, as I had initially framed the earlier massage she received differently. </p><p>Too bad for her that I had no problem leveraging her dazed state to mislead her. “Of course sweetie, I told you so, remember,” I said even as I put a hand on her hips. “Let’s see if you’re strong enough to handle the true massage.” </p><p>Despite my words, I didn’t push her to the next stage, and just put my hand on her core, dancing around her wetness to push her pleasure even more. Her moan was beautiful, a soft tremble quick to invade her body as she bent forward. </p><p>It wasn’t a climax, at least not yet, but as my hand moved back and forth, it wasn’t too far away either. </p><p>For a while, I said nothing, which would have given her a chance to consider the direction the situation was devolving, but, luckily, the pleasure was an excellent way of keeping her away from such pesky concerns. It was a beautiful moment, even more than the previous massage despite all the access it gave me, because of the nature of the position. </p><p>Unlike the massage, which was a servile position — at least on the surface — I was sitting while she stood with a chain around her neck, which left no doubt about the power difference. And, as much as I was willing to play along, I was self-aware enough to understand where my true preference lay. </p><p>One didn’t climb up through all the barriers to take the seat of the Dark Lord.</p><p>As my fingers continued to work, I could have easily pushed her to another climax at this moment. However, I had no intention of actually doing so. </p><p>I had a different plan in mind. </p><p>I tightened my hold over her chain once more, this time pulling her down to my lap. </p><p>It was an interesting moment. She could have resisted my pull easily. Despite my intention, the pull was soft, almost gentle, one that allowed her plenty of time to escape. Not to mention, her physical strength was immense enough that I doubted I would be successful even when pulling with my full power if she wanted to resist. </p><p>Of course, there was a great range between resisting and actively participating, and she was somewhere in the middle of that great distance, too confused by the rapidly changing conditions to properly react. </p><p>That didn’t prevent her from letting out a spectacular moan as my pull reached completion, and invaded her core. </p><p>Then, I met with another surprise. </p><p>I felt magic slamming my body with all the strength of a rabid dragon. I assumed that it was an attack, and was ready to retaliate, but not only my magic was in chaos, but the invasion of fiery energy filled my body to weaken my movement. </p><p>It was fortunate as well, because it prevented a retaliatory strike that would have likely hurt her significantly from such a close distance, even if all the stories about their regenerative capabilities were accurate. </p><p>It might have even been fatal if I used the chain as a weapon. </p><p>I was glad that I didn’t retaliate, because that second was critical for me to notice I wasn’t the only one that froze. Clearly, it was not a deliberate attack, but some kind of magical reaction that was triggered after I took her virginity, throwing her magic into chaos as well. </p><p>If the surprise growing on her face was any indicator, not exactly a casual one as well. </p><p>With the burning energy locking our bodies and magic, I didn’t have the luxury of reacting, so I turned my attention inward, trying to understand the nature of the change. </p><p>Two things were clear. Despite the intensity of the energy, it wasn’t harmful — at least not immediately so. And cutting the process halfway might have some dangerous implications. </p><p>Luckily, considering the method of trigger, continuing the process wasn’t exactly a chore. As I slowly regained control over my body, I tightened my grip around her hips, preventing her escape. </p><p>Not that it seemed necessary, as she made no move to actually abandon my lap. “Impossible,” she just muttered, showing that she recognized what was going on. </p><p>“Nothing is impossible when it’s about me, sweetie,” I said as I tightened my grip even more and started rocking my lips. She was not too far away from a climax. As I started pushing forward, she started trembling. </p><p>Despite her trembling, she created an amazing view. Her hands landed on my shoulders for balance, and her back arched, which, the sudden bursting intensity of the flames of her wings, was a wondrous sight, her naked body nothing less than a beautiful painting. </p><p>A masterpiece that only got more beautiful as she started moving once more. She let out a beautiful, primal moan before her hips started to rock, assisting my furious pumping, her back still arching to display her beautiful breasts perfectly. </p><p>I leaned to capture her nipple between my lips, biting aggressively, the sudden flare of pain just making her move faster. </p><p>I could feel her fingers digging into my shoulders painfully, but just like her dilemma, it made it more fun for me. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, it could also remind her that just how much power she actually had, so I had no choice but to take another step. </p><p>I gave another command to the chain as I let it go, and it wrapped around her wrists, forcing her arms to her back — which happened much slower than I would have loved, as my magic control was still fizzy as some kind of energy fused with it. </p><p>But, it still took only a few seconds, and with the silver contrasting against her fiery wings, the view certainly looked amazing. </p><p>“Impossible,” she murmured once more, showing that she was less concerned about the way I was using the chains, and more about the process that we were going through. </p><p>Clearly, it was an important process, but since interrupting that was clearly a bad idea, I just focused on the moment, enjoying the way her virgin hole tightened around my shaft. Her hips sashayed beautifully as they moved, showing I wasn’t the only one that was preoccupied with the pleasure aspect to some degree. </p><p>I didn’t stop observing the changes in my magic, of course, but as a fully nude phoenix — well, technically chain could count as an item of clothing, but it was not exactly an impediment to the pleasure I was feeling. </p><p>I grabbed her cheek aggressively, hard enough to leave a mark, which enhanced her moan. “So, do you like my special massage,” I asked mockingly as I turned that grip into a spank, hard enough to make her flinch. </p><p>“Y-you —“ she gasped, but that was all she was able to say before I leaned and captured her lips in a searing kiss, my tongue invading her mouth, enjoying the intense warmth of her mouth.  </p><p>Her eyes widened, showing a hint of anger at my interruption, but her reaction stayed limited to that as she obediently accepted the invasion of my tongue. </p><p>I felt a wave of amusement at her reaction, which was considerably more intense than her silent obedience as she chained her arms behind her. Teasing her about that was tempting, but that would have required me to stop the aggressive kiss we were sharing, and that was not something I wanted to do. </p><p>Instead, I continued to spank her ass, each slap triggering her tightness, while my other hand climbed to her chest, once again mauling her spectacular tits, each second making the moment even more intense. </p><p>Under that multifaceted treatment, it didn’t take long for my poor little Cinder to climax beautifully, her tightness around me begging for me to explode. But luckily, my earlier adventure with Isolde did wonders to give me some extra strength to resist that temptation. </p><p>Naturally, I had no intention to stop, or even pause for a second. All I just needed was to decide a particular direction of action first.</p><p><br></p>
