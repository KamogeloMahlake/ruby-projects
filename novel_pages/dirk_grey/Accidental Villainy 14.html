        <p>For all her power, Tara was unable to suppress her trembles as she stood in front of her boss. </p><p>Trembling of excitement…</p><p>For a while, he said as he examined her from the other side, the bar adding to the sense of authority he was radiating once he grabbed a couple of bottles and some fresh produce to mix a cocktail skillfully without even looking at the blade once, making her even more excited. </p><p>It wasn’t the threat of the blade, which was less threatening than a toothpick had been before her awakening, but the utter confidence he was radiating as he worked. </p><p>He was in total control, just like he was in the bedroom, and that drove her crazy even more than his skillful fingers and his handsome face… </p><p>“We really need to go shopping soon. Those scraps are hardly enough to highlight your incredible beauty,” he said, making her blush. Even though it was technically an insult to her outfit, she didn’t care much about that. She knew that she dressed poorly — growing up in a ranch was hardly something that gave her a great fashion sense, and her lack of money didn’t help — so she chose to focus on the important part. </p><p>That she had an incredible beauty. </p><p>“Now, let’s get rid of that ugly stuff,” he said, and her blush covered her whole body. She wanted to look at the door once more, to make sure it was properly shut, but under his sharp gaze, she found that very difficult to achieve. It was a silent order to just follow his request. </p><p>Her body reacted in autopilot assassin she reached to her back, unhooking her bra to let it fall on the floor like her other pieces. It wasn’t the first time he saw her breasts, but she was still able to see excitement added to his sharp gaze, which was far better than any compliment. </p><p>She pushed her panties down as well, once again standing in front of him, naked. “Inspiring,” he said, his soft tone enough to send shivers through her body. She managed to keep down a whimper, but only through sheer force of will. </p><p>As he worked on a cocktail, she said nothing, letting him enjoy her nudity without restriction. </p><p>It was hard to stand naked like that. A part of her wanted her to raise her arms to cover her body, gaining at least a part of her modesty back. </p><p>A bigger part of her wanted her to destroy the bar with a kick to close the distance and beg him to start working on her beautiful body. </p><p>She ignored both, standing obediently as he worked, though that didn’t prevent her from swallowing hard repeatedly in an effort to maintain her semblance of control. Of all the process, he spoke only once more, and that was to order her to not avoid his gaze. </p><p>It was even harder than the nudity. His gaze was hard to resist. His brown eyes had a way of giving the impression that he was not only looking at her eyes but also at her soul, like it was impossible to hide anything from him. Being exposed like that was harder than being exposed physically. </p><p>She loved it … but only because it was her boss. </p><p>“And, finished,” he said after he added some spice to the cocktail and stirred shortly. “Come here and taste my newest invention.” </p><p>With his order, she walked slowly around the bar, doing her best to walk just like he had taught her, ignoring her desire to run desperately — or worse, jump over the bar. She was his secretary. She needed to be calm and collected. </p><p>Though, his small smirk, dark, seductive, and amused at the same time, told her that he knew exactly what she was thinking. That she was just a farm girl who was trying to imitate poise and grace. Of course, once her doubts started to speak, the louder, darker voices joined in. </p><p>Voices that told her that she was worthless. That he would soon get bored of her and kick her out. That he would find a better secretary and demote her…</p><p>Then, he spoke. “You’re mine.” </p><p>She trembled as those two words hit her, her doubts disappearing as quickly as they appeared. Those words were not a request, or even an invitation. It was just a statement of fact, one that told her that she had no choice on the matter, that he would never let her go. </p><p>She loved it. </p><p>She stood in front of him, raising her head to catch her gaze. “Now, better,” he said as he pushed the glass toward her. “Taste it. Take a sip,” </p><p>She followed his order without even blinking. She was never a fan of alcohol, the sharp and bitter taste tickling her tongue annoyingly. She drank even less after her powers since it was near impossible to get even tipsy, let alone drunk.</p><p>But, it was an order from her boss, so she followed it. Her slight discomfort was not important. </p><p>Then, she took a sip. </p><p>And, a unique aroma exploded on her tongue. Her eyes widened even as she processed a taste she had never experienced before, the acidic sharpness of fruits mixing with the alcohol, creating that would have been overbearing if it wasn’t for the subtle tingling of several spices somehow connecting two tastes. </p><p>It was the most delicious thing she had ever tasted. </p><p>She found herself lost in another conflict.  She wanted to raise the glass and slam it back at once, draining it immediately. </p><p>She also wanted to take the smallest sip possible, savoring the taste forever. </p><p>Ultimately, she did none of them, and just put the glass down. He ordered her to take a sip, so she took a sip. </p><p>“I see that you enjoyed it,” he said. </p><p>“Delicious,” she said as she nodded shyly. </p><p>“Hmm, interesting,” he said. “Maybe I should take a taste as well,” he said, his tone surprisingly tingly as he said that. </p><p>She was surprised when he suddenly pushed her against the counter until she was lying on her back, though that mystery was resolved quickly. He poured some into her bellybutton before slowly sipping it, his lips leaving a tingling sensation on her belly. </p><p>“Hmm, delicious indeed,” he said, then smiled. “And, I already have a name for it.” </p><p>“W-what’s the name, sir?” she asked helplessly as she trembled. </p><p>“Do you want to guess?” he asked. She shook her head. She didn’t want to guess. “Very well. It’s the secretary, named after my Muse.” </p><p>Earlier, his lips made her belly tingly. But, his words made her whole body tingly. An invention that was named after her, one that belonged only to her. </p><p>The greatest gift she had ever received. </p><p>“Let’s give you another sip,” he said. </p><p>If it wasn’t for her ingrained obedience, she would have protested intensely. The cocktail was amazing. On that, there was no doubt, but she needed something else at this moment. </p><p>And she needed desperately. </p><p>Then, a moment later, she realized that she had nothing to worry about, as rather than bringing the glass to her lips, he took a sip himself. Then, rather than swallowing, he leaned over her. </p><p>She gulped. Even if she was stupid enough to miss the meaning of his actions, there was no mistaking the light in his eyes. He was about the feed her the best way possible. Her heart danced wildly as he pressed his lips against hers, making her tremble excitedly and in desperation. </p><p>His lips landed on hers, teaching her that there were things that were even more delicious than the earlier taste. Such as, the same cocktail, accompanied by the precious tongue of her boss, the dance of her tongues allowing the taste to infuse her tongue even more.</p><p>It was a delicious taste that lingered on her tongue persistently while he continued to hover above her, the height difference and the position enhancing the sensation of being domineered even further. </p><p>The fact that she didn’t have any clothing to shield her even nominally didn’t help any as his lips continued to dance over hers, driving her deeper and deeper into the land of pleasure. She was about to lose any sense of control until —</p><p>Her beautiful haze was destroyed by a loud, insistent knock on the door. They weren’t trying to break the door … but they weren’t trying to break it either. </p><p>She suddenly felt angry, wanting to go and teach them the risks of being rude. Unfortunately, she wasn’t dressed appropriately. She looked at her boss, hoping that he would order her to dress and deal with them. </p><p>However, when she caught his expression, she realized that the issue might not be as simple as she thought. His expression was sharp and tense, signaling that it was not just a random thug. </p><p>“Go upstairs and change. Jeans, a jacket, and make sure to wear that mask,” he ordered, his voice sharper than ever, without any hint of levity. “And, unless I call for you, don’t intervene.” </p><p>She immediately followed his order, stopping only to pick up her discarded clothes before she dashed upstairs. </p><p>It was work time. </p>
