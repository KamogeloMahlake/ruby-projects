        <p>I barely managed to close my eyes as she glanced up, no doubt testing the signs of waking up. With her little test giving a negative result, she started leaning down even as her hands wrapped around the base of my shaft. </p><p>Her lips followed a moment later, repeating the same effect around the crown of my shaft, adding another layer to my pleasure, especially when she started moving up and down. Her movements were choppy, but not completely unfamiliar. </p><p>She might not have done anything like this before, but clearly, she had lived far too long to never stumble on others doing something like that. Soon, she reached a simple, yet effective rhythm, her natural grace helping to compensate for her lack of experience. </p><p>That didn’t mean her hesitancy was gone, of course. However, her taste for pleasure was finally awakened, and it was a good combination when it was mixed with her curiosity. </p><p>I just watched, happy with the pleasure. Her technique — if it could be called that in the first place — was lackluster at best, but one of the advantages of a blowjob was enthusiasm was more than enough to compensate for a lack of skill. </p><p>And she had lots of enthusiasm. Her wings, still sprawled, twitching beautifully, only enhanced the inherent view of the moment. </p><p>I let her play freely without any intervention as she teased my shaft from every possible angle, her lips going deep enough to reach halfway mark. I was tempted to grab her head and push her down, curious how her wings would react in such a circumstance. </p><p>Pity I was too curious about how far my naughty angel would push while thinking that I was still asleep. </p><p>I limited myself to watching. Luckily, she was too distracted to keep her eyes open, allowing me to watch her rapt concentration as her expression constantly cycled in a wide range, from shame to arousal. </p><p>She pulled before I could reach a climax, and I prepared to stand up, to teach her why it wasn’t a good idea to wake me up in such a teasing manner and stop halfway. </p><p>Or, a rather excellent way, as it depended on the way one looked at the issue. </p><p>However, before I could stand up, I noticed her magic flaring, and she cast a spell on me. Ironically, it was a credit of my trust that I didn’t retaliate reflexively and instead checked the spell structure curiously, only to see it was a sleep spell. </p><p>A weak one that would have certainly failed against a woke target, even if I was as weak as I led her to believe. </p><p>However, it was an excellent way to make sure a sleeping person wouldn’t wake up. </p><p>Which had some beautiful implications. </p><p>So, I wasn’t surprised when she turned her back to me before climbing on the bed, her legs on both sides of my body. One perk of the position, it allowed me to open my eyes without fearing getting caught. </p><p>Which was excellent, because the sight of a beautiful angel from the back, her glowing silver wings spread wide as she hesitantly lowered herself was a memory I would cherish for all eternity. </p><p>I bit my lips as she finally lowered herself enough for our bodies to connect, her warmth phenomenal as she wrapped around my girth, and the fact that she stopped her blowjob just as it was starting to get amazing helped to carry the pleasure to the next stage. </p><p>It would have been an amazing trick even if it was intentional, and its accidental nature only made it more amazing. </p><p>I watched in appreciation as she slowly lowered herself with a speed that surprised me, showing that my forceful education had taken root excellently. Her back arched as she easily passed halfway mark. </p><p>A loud moan rippled in her mouth, showing her confidence in her sleeping spell trick. Too bad for her it was completely unfounded, leaving me a desire to move and pin her down to teach her about being more careful. </p><p>Yet, as she sank deeper, I decided on the lesson and focus on enjoying her beautiful treatment. She moved up and down, experimenting with the pace until she settled to a furious up and down, her wings waving in the same pattern in reverse to balance her momentum. </p><p>A rather inventive way of using her wings, one that I enjoyed greatly. </p><p>I waited, curious just how far she would leverage her freedom. </p><p>Quite a bit, as it turned out as she leaned forward, putting her hands on my thighs before her hips started to move even faster with the leverage, the sight of her devouring my shaft, again and again, creating a rather excellent view for me to occupy myself. </p><p>And that occupation helped me to suppress my desire to flip her and start her next lesson. </p><p>Her hips moved both back and forth and up and down, her wetness enveloping me greatly, her natural elegance once again helping to elevate her movements greatly. Another moan escaped her beautiful lips, making me curious about her expression. </p><p>Pity, she didn’t have a mirror in the room, and casting a spell to do so would have alerted her that I wasn’t as sleepy as she assumed me to be. Her hips continued to work, making me feel a slight pity that she didn’t get the benefits of the system. </p><p>Such steady work would have already earned her my first perk. </p><p>However, just because she wasn’t able to get the benefits of it, didn’t mean she couldn’t receive the benefits in another way. I let my magic rise slowly, coating my shaft. </p><p>It made her stop and throw a panicked glance back — at least, that’s what I assumed as I had to close my eyes to fake sleeping. Her body stayed twisted for a while, her posture suggesting she looked at me, no doubt trying to see if I had woken up. </p><p>But she stayed impaled even as she did so, showing she didn’t want to stop receiving the pleasure she had been sneaking. I gave no reaction as I did so, but let my mana calm slightly. </p><p>Selling the idea that it was just a reflexive reaction, one that overlapped with the pleasure I was feeling. </p><p>She said nothing, but even as her presence disappeared from around my shaft, I didn’t react, remembering the earlier situation with the blowjob. It turned out to be the correct decision as she settled around my girth once more. </p><p>This time her hands pressed against my chest. </p><p>It was a risky decision, but I found myself opening my eyes after her hips started moving, this time even more heatedly. But not before letting my mana rise once more, tainted with Tantric energy, slowly filling inside her. </p><p>[-381 Mana]</p><p>It turned out to be a good decision. When I opened my eyes, I found hers conveniently closed, which allowed me to take the view she created fully rather than trying to steal an occasional glimpse. </p><p>Which was good, as the view she created easily took a spot in the greatest views I had ever seen. Her wings were spread fully open, their glow even more intense as my mana invaded her body. And, that silver light contrasted against her body, highlighting the slight sheen that covered her skin in the best way possible. </p><p>Her beautiful breasts jumbled pleasingly with every desperate movement of her hips, begging for me to grab them and tease her hard nipples for eternity. Her face was contorted with pleasure as her core devoured my shaft repeatedly, her lips open as endless moans started to escape her lips. </p><p>I wondered whether she was that confident in her spell, or she had forgotten the dubious nature of the start of her morning exercise. </p><p>Either way, I said nothing as she rocked desperately on my lap, too distracted by the pleasure to pay attention to such nuances. </p><p>Her moans exploded against the walls as they started to gain a desperate quality, tempting me to use the trick that I had been fond of, blocking her arousal with magic to keep her on the edge.</p><p>Tempting, but after some thought, I decided against it. The poor girl had spent centuries without knowing the touch of a man. It would be plain mean to test her with such a radical edge play. </p><p>For now, at least, I decided, shelving the idea for later, when she got a more useful sense of what was ordinary and what was not.</p><p>While I was considering the appropriate time to pull some interesting tricks, she finally reached the peak she had been searching for. Her body tensed as she started trembling desperately, each second enhancing her pleasure even more. </p><p>As her moans subsided, she looked down, only now noticing my eyes were wide open. “Good morning, boss,” I said with a chuckle as she froze in shock. Which I leveraged by grabbing her waist and flipping our positions, trapping her under me in a missionary position, still firmly inside her.</p><p> She was done with her morning exercise. </p><p>It was my turn now.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 8826 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>
