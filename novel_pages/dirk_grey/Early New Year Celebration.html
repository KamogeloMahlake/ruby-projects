        <p>Hi everyone, </p><p>I wish a nice new year for all of you. 2021 had been a fun yet difficult year, and I wish that 2022 goes better for all of us. And Happy Christmas for anyone that celebrates. </p><p>Also, a quick reminder. January is another 5-sunday week, there'll be no update the next week, which will also give me a chance to nurse the inevitable hangover.  </p><p> Happy new years, everyone. </p><p><br></p>
