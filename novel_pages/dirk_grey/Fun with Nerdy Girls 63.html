        <p>As I walked to the kitchen to prepare some snacks, I was facing one of the most important decisions of my life. </p><p>Take an aggressive stance to heat up the party, making the day the best day of my life … or stay passive, and see what kind of devious little ploys the girls would come up with to make the day special. And, considering their surprise arrival, I had a feeling that a significant portion of them had plans in that direction. </p><p>Without a doubt, watching them as they enact those plans would be fun. </p><p>I started to prepare the promised snacks, leaving them to splash in the water and enjoy the iced tea, a decision not taken … when I heard footsteps, no doubt there to take the control away from me. One of them wanted not to spend any time. </p><p>Soon, Sarah appeared, her every step optimized to show her assets. Someone didn’t want to waste even a second out in the heat and away from me, it seemed. </p><p>“Hi, Sarah, anything I can do to help?” I said. </p><p>“No, I just came to get something to drink. Not a fan of the tea,” she said as she slowly walked into the kitchen, her expression sharp enough to show that she was still feeling slighted after my decision to leave her at the door after arousing her to the limit. </p><p>I wonder what she would say if she knew, after that, I was greeted by a threesome. </p><p>“The fridge is ready for your orders, my Queen,” I said mockingly, which only earned a scowl. She clearly expected a more explosive reaction, and I had no intention to give her. I was not that easily manipulated. </p><p>She frowned as she walked closer, and stopped when she stood next to me, watching as I prepared the snacks. “You’re quite handy, aren’t you?” she asked. “Preparing it from scratch.” </p><p>“That’s what you have to do when you’re serious about nutrition,” I answered, keeping my attention on the ingredients, like I wasn’t standing next to a sexy girl that might as well be naked considering what she was wearing. </p><p>“Well, it shows,” she said as she gave a smack against my ass, one that lingered far too long to be just friends even before moving down to squeeze my thighs, enjoying my muscles. Her fingers soon turned seductive. </p><p>In my defense, I tried to ignore it, and managed not to look at her. But a certain part of my anatomy, already charged by the earlier show, chose to awaken, straining my swimwear.  </p><p>She just grabbed it without any preamble, showing that her recent experiences with me had started to change her confidence level even more. Not to mention, she had always been the bravest. “I wonder if I can find something to quench my thirst,” she whispered, keeping eye contact as she played with it over my swimsuit. </p><p>I smirked back. It was enough playing. “As I said before, only if you beg,” I answered, enjoying the flash of anger that passed over her face. </p><p>“Beg, never,” she gasped, scandalized, but not enough to hide her arousal. “Your loss,” she declared, though it was not as convincing as she had hoped. Doing her best to ignore me, she opened the fridge and leaned forward, the light creating a halo around her. </p><p>I was sure that the way her bikini top slipped to give me a glimpse of her nipple was a complete accident. </p><p>I said nothing as she leaned more and more, which showed her barely-covered ass in the best light, before she finally grabbed a bottle. “That should … quench my thirst,” she whispered as she slammed the fridge door, and opened the bottle. </p><p>Then, she showed she had one more little ploy. As she drank, she let some of the water spilled down her cleavage, shivering beautifully as the cold hit. I watched as the droplets splashed across her breasts, dripped down her cleavage, and caressed her stomach. </p><p>Kitchen lights hit her beautifully, each droplet clinging to her skin, making her sparkle. </p><p>I had to admit, it was tempting enough for me to change my earlier resolution. Maybe a little kitchen quickie wouldn’t hurt. “You’re playing a dangerous game, Sarah,” I warned her, my voice suddenly sharp. </p><p>Her smile widened. “Oh, I don’t know what are you talking about…” she whispered. </p><p>I gave her a serious expression as I closed the distance. “Of course, you don’t,” I whispered to her ear, nibbling softly. She moaned even as her hands landed on my shoulders, reaching for a kiss. </p><p>Too bad for her I chose that moment to pull back. “Unfortunately, you need to play better to win,” I told her, enjoying the way she shivered as my words slammed into her. </p><p>I grabbed the tray of snacks and left the kitchen, leaving her back, angry and aroused, curious about what she would do. </p><p>“Snacks are here,” I said as I arrived at the poolside, and earned their gazes, but none of them was looking at the tray. No, their gaze was on my midsection, where I was sporting a monster erection. I had deliberately didn’t adjust it, giving them a show. </p><p>Also a warning … Sarah was already working hard, and they needed to join the game quickly if they didn’t want to lose. </p><p>“Come to the pool,” Naomi asked, her voice throatier than necessary. I wasn’t surprised that she was the first one to react. After all, she was the one that had lost against Sarah the last time, and lost spectacularly. “We’re the ones that ambushed you with this party. You shouldn’t work hard like a servant. Let us entertain you.” </p><p>“Sounds tempting,” I said as I placed the tray on the table, and threw myself into the water. </p><p>I swam to the middle of the water, and Naomi swam toward me, just as quick, splashing me with water. “Oh, no, you don’t,” I said, splashing back, and suddenly, it turned into a beautiful, lighthearted game. </p><p>Well, almost lighthearted, I corrected as I watched Carrie fix her top after her third accident, giving me another flash of skin to enjoy. </p><p>Even better, it didn’t take long for the others to catch on. Irene was the first, and her bikini top suddenly lost its strength to contain her amazing bosom, and started to give me more glimpses. Naomi was not too far back. </p><p>Ida was the only one that was still reticent in joining our little game, and Sarah was still absent after her most recent defeat. </p><p>We continued horsing around in the water for half an hour, which was fun and sexy at the same time — like anything else was possible when three shy beauties continued to flash at me to the best of their abilities, and the fact that they still managed to hide it from each other, unsuccessfully I might add, made it even more entertaining. </p><p>After all, neither Naomi nor Irene knew about the full extent of our little game — not that they had any right to complain with their own little tricks. Ida knew much more, but without her camera, she was too shy to take advantage.</p><p>Then, there was Carrie, who was more than happy to play the mastermind. “Oh, why don’t you give little Ida a piggyback. She’s afraid of coming to the deeper parts.” </p><p>That earned matching glares from Naomi and Irene. Whether they were unhappy that it added another player to their game, or they felt Carrie’s words sounded mean, I didn’t know. </p><p>I couldn’t blame them if it was the latter. Without knowing what happened in my house when Carrie visited with Ida, it felt like a catty statement to put her down. With the memories of what Ida had done to Carrie, however, it felt much more playful. </p><p>“I’m here to command,” I said as I grabbed Ida, easily lifting her to my shoulders, her warm presence welcoming as we walked toward the deep end of the pool. </p><p>I turned back with a sound of a splash, only to see Sarah diving. She looked sly, showing she had a way to take revenge. “How about we play a game, girls?” Sarah said. </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” Naomi asked quickly, split between dissatisfaction and enthusiasm. She had a clear idea about the lengths Sarah could go to when slighted, but also there were limits to her actions when all of her friends were with her in the pool. </p><p>I was just as curious. </p><p>“Let’s go with something simple, Marco Polo,” she said as she threw a bunched-up fabric at me. </p><p>“Isn’t it, a bit … childish,” Naomi muttered, relaxed and disappointed at the same time. </p><p>Sarah smiled. It was a smile that made Naomi shuffle in discomfort, and made my arousal even more intense. “That’s why we’re going to play that with a twist. Our hero here will be the one that’s seeking always, and whenever he catches one of us, he gets a … reward.” </p><p>“And, what’s the reward?” Irene asked. </p><p>“He removes a piece of swimsuit whenever he catches one, of course.” </p><p>Silence ruled the pool for a moment. “Isn’t it a bit … much?” Naomi cut in. </p><p>“Feel free to get out of the pool if you can’t handle it,” Sarah declared, sharp. Clearly, after her latest defeat, she was not in the mood to play around. Then, she smiled. “And it’s not like it’s much. We have all seen each other naked,” she lingered, then looked at me. </p><p>“Except our host, of course,” she added, unaware she was wrong about that part. “But he’ll be wearing a blindfold, so he doesn’t count. But if you don’t want to play, just climb out of the water.” </p><p>They said nothing as they looked at each other, waiting for the others to make a move. They looked tense, but none of them moved. </p><p>With a chuckle, I put on the blindfold… </p>
