        <p>I didn’t bother to put my swimsuit back on as I walked to the showers, just wrapping a towel around my waist, as putting on a speedo while I had a raging boner would hardly be comfortable. </p><p>Of course, it was hardly pleasant to be blue-balled, but a public pool, even when it was blocked, was hardly the location to push Megan’s limits,  especially since she would enjoy cutting me off just when I reached the edge regardless. I couldn’t help but have a grudging respect for her personality. She had a killer instinct I wouldn’t expect from a girl who looked like a blonde bimbo. </p><p>Pity we would break up after the game. I would have loved to make her pay properly, rather than the little challenge I had deployed earlier. </p><p>My mind was busy with little revenge fantasies that wouldn’t come to reality when I arrived at the locker room. Which was still empty, so I threw my towel to the side, and directly stepped to the showers. </p><p>I was trying to decide to relative merits of quick masturbation and just showering, when my little mental arithmetic was interrupted by the sound of a door opening. </p><p>“Really, Megan—“ I started as I turned, only to see a very noticeable redness rather than the blonde I was expecting, walking toward me with a rather smug attitude. </p><p>“Can I help you, Kimberly?” I asked her, wanting to annoy her a bit since I didn’t appreciate the interruption to my little plan. Luckily, she didn’t bring her camera with her, which made me feel calmer than the alternative. </p><p>“Call me Kim,” she answer, her voice laced with a threat. Yet, her annoyance didn’t prevent her from walking forward until she stood at the edge of the shower. “I’m here to talk to you about our date.” </p><p>“Let me guess, you want it to be canceled,” I said with a sigh, though I couldn’t say that I was unhappy about the decision she was about to deliver. I wasn’t exactly flush with cash to make it a fun date, nor did I have a lot of free time. </p><p>I even joined the earlier pool adventure, however fun, only because of the extra traits such a scandalous reveal would bring. </p><p>“Not exactly,” she answered, interestingly, not stopping even after she stepped into the shower, reaching to turn off the water before she kicked her boots off and stepped inside. “I’m more interested in an express date, if you don’t mind,” she answered. </p><p>The idea of an express date was quite nebulous, but that uncertainty was quick to disappear as I watched her removing her pants smoothly, revealing that she was wearing a delicious g-string that didn’t exactly fit into the rebellious aura she was trying to convey. </p><p>Though, it wasn’t as clear as the way she fell on her knees wordlessly in front of me, pushing me against the ceramic wall, her lips already parted, going a long way to show that the idea of an express date wasn’t as unpalatable as it first sounded. </p><p>“You’re such a good friend, solving the problem your bestie created,” I said, couldn’t help but chuckle in amusement, though I decided not to push her too much when her warning came in the form of her teeth scraping against my length, suggesting that she was not above punishing me. </p><p>I decided not to tease the sexy redhead who currently had the advantage over me. </p><p>Luckily, the way her lips tightened around my shaft gave me something more important to focus on, especially when her hands joined our little game soon after, wrapping around the base, pumping with a matching pace. </p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured even as her lips and hands worked wonders around my shaft, though, the passion she was displaying in her presence was less about the little trick her friend pulled, and more about the strain she might have felt as she spent a considerable time photographing our aggressive foreplay.</p><p>Maybe Seduction was a tad more effective than I expected. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but grunt as the pleasure hit, especially since I was already not too distant from the climax. I took a deep breath, doing my best to prevent a quick release — which was much harder after the extended game I had played with Megan. </p><p>Luckily — or unluckily, from a certain point of view — Kim didn’t push herself to take my full length inside. Without the great explosion of feeling the tightness of her throat would have brought, I managed to hold back the temptation to release, giving me some time to resist. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I said, doing my best to sound casual even as I watched her. “Though, do you plan to actually start working on it, or do you plan to act as weak as the blondie.” </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she murmured as she pulled back momentarily. </p><p>I shrugged. “Hey, if you can’t handle it…” </p><p>“You’re really pushing your luck,” she responded, though the way her fingers dug into my leg, I decided not to push it too much. Then, her smirk widened. “But, if you’re challenging, let’s see if you can handle a proper one for more than a few seconds.” </p><p>She followed her statement with a surprising aggressiveness, her hands tightening around my legs as she pushed forward. Yet, her task wasn’t as easy as she hoped as my shaft hit her throat, a beautiful gag escaping despite her full mouth. </p><p>“Not as easy as you hoped, right?” I asked. It earned an angry glare, but she continued to push herself, managing to make my shaft disappear more and more. </p><p>It took a lot to hold back a moan of my own as the tightness of her throat wrapped around it tightly. </p><p>“I think you need a little help,” I suggested just as I grabbed her head without a warning. The widening of her eyes was beautiful. “Of course, you can just blink if you don’t think you can handle it.” </p><p>Her eyes flared in anger, but her eyelids avoided moving determinedly, taking my challenge. </p><p>I was impressed with her courage, but not enough to make an allowance for her before I pushed forward, and I did it mercilessly. A push was enough to cover the distance she had failed to take, impaling her throat completely. </p><p>The pain of such an invasion would have resulted in a desperate cry in anyone else, but Kim impressed me by restricting herself to a grunt between her gags. A grunt that implied a lot of pain, but also pleasure, suggesting a surprisingly submissive side to a girl that showed such aggression.</p><p>Or maybe, it was just her way of signaling her preferences.  </p><p>Incredibly, as I continued to impale her throat, she managed to keep her eyes open, her gaze looking up, her gaze between a belligerent sharpness and a submissive acceptance. A surprising paradox.  </p><p>That surprise didn’t make me stop. I continued to invade her throat repeatedly, without mercy, curious whether she would fold first, or my resistance would fail. </p><p>Ultimately, after the great challenge her friend had put on me, I folded first. </p><p> I exploded without a warning, filling her mouth with her reward. Her eyes widened as she felt the sudden throbbing, but it was too late for her to pull back even if she had the ability. “Not bad,” I said as I caressed her hair, while she stayed there, struggling to swallow, afraid of ruining her outfit. </p><p>When she pulled back, she had been coughing softly. </p><p>“Naughty, not warning me,” she said after she managed to get control of her breathing, spitting to the side, which was easy to wash away in a shower. She looked at me sharply, no doubt expecting an apology. </p><p>I shrugged, with no intention of giving her that. “It’s your friend’s fault, leaving me on the edge,” I said. “She took her reward and left, leaving me helpless.” </p><p>“Yeah,” she said as she stood up, chuckling despite her attempt to look angry. “Megan can be a handful to manage.” I shrugged, and she started walking away, the beautiful sway of her hips by no means a natural movement, especially with the intentional slowness she displayed when she leaned down to pick her pants,, giving me an extended glimpse of her tight ass. </p><p>Sexy enough to make a certain part of me grew again despite the earlier explosion. </p><p>Just as she was about to leave, she turned, gazing down to see the evidence of her work. When she looked up, she was sporting a playful smirk. “Pity you’re going to break up soon. We might have had some real fun otherwise…” she said before leaving. </p><p>I shook my head in amusement even as I returned to my shower. </p><p>No wonder they were best friends. </p>
