        <p>I let my hand slip down to Tiffany’s ass as we entered the bar, which, considering her short dress, was rather obscene. I didn’t care about being seen because of the special design of the place, which was geared for absolute privacy, even at the entrance. The hotel didn’t explicitly say it, but it was clear that the place was designed for people having extramarital affairs, allowing them to enjoy a semi-public space without fearing to be seen. Each group had their own booth, with absolutely no visibility between them. </p><p>Perfect place to seduce a shy half-Asian beauty. </p><p>A beautiful waitress greeted us, not even blinking at our closeness. We followed her, while I slipped my hand under Tiffany’s summer dress, enjoying her curves. “I missed you,” she whispered. “It has been a while.” </p><p>“Occasionally, even I have to work,” I answered with a chuckle. “Luckily, we have several hours to ourselves.” </p><p>Tiffany chuckled as the waitress finally brought us to our booth and took our drink orders. “Don’t make promises you’re not intending to keep. I can see that you’re besotted with Umi. You’re going to neglect me again, aren’t you?” she said playfully. </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I answered even as I placed a small kiss on her neck. “Who says we can’t work on her together?” I suggested. </p><p>“Why do you think I would be interested in such a thing,” Tiffany countered, trying to provoke me, but with limited success. </p><p>“It’s a wild guess,” I murmured even as I let my hand trail down from her waist to her thigh before I took a sudden turn, climbing up her leg, underneath her skirt, until my fingers touched her panties, feeling her wetness. “And it seems that your body agrees.” </p><p>“You’re an evil old man,” she said as she giggled, while I continued to caress her thigh. She sighed. “But yes, I’m not against the idea of sharing that tasty geisha between us,” she said. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, interrupting myself as I leaned down and stole a kiss from her elegant neck. “Actually, why don’t you text her and make sure she wears something more appropriate for the occasion. I’m sure her fiancee would be happy for your help.” </p><p>“Why not?” she said as she pulled off her phone, and sent a quick message to her. Meanwhile, I continued caressing her inner thigh to push her arousal further, but not pushing for more. I wanted her to panting and ready to go when Umi arrived, as it would make the situation even more interesting, with one trying to slow things down while the other trying to push things even more. </p><p>Even as I teased her, I watched her screen as she started a rapid digital conversation with Umi, starting soft at first to increase the sense of familiarity with the idea. Umi’s reluctance was obvious. Clearly, she was only doing that because her fiancee agreed, and her fiancee only agreed because he was too spineless to actually reject a ‘sensible’ recommendation from his direct boss Mike. </p><p>After five minutes of chatting, Umi finally mentioned that her fiancee left the room for a night of drinking along with Mike. Tiffany chose that moment to open the more important part of the discussion, namely, what she should wear for our little dinner. At Tiffany’s insistence, she started sharing pictures of her evening wear, unfortunately by laying the clothes on her bed rather than trying them on. A true pity. </p><p>“Damn, is she a nun?” Tiffany murmured after she shared three conservative dresses with ankle-length skirts consecutively, finally writing a reply that asked her to dress more revealing. </p><p>“Don’t be so shocked. She was clearly raised in a conservative household,” I said. “But I’m sure you can convince her to be a bit more adventurous.” </p><p>“Is there a reward for doing so?” she asked, her ruby lips curling suggestively. </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” I asked. </p><p>“I remember seeing a magnificent pair of shoes recently, and they have a franchise here. Unfortunately, they’re a bit expensive for my dear husband’s budget, even with the recent bonuses.” </p><p>“How much?” I asked. My eyebrows quirked when she whispered the price into my ear. “Not bad, at least not expensive as a car,” I said with a chuckle. I asked, because I had learned my lesson after offhandedly making the same promise to Elena about a dress after she helped me to convince the wife of a business partner, only to set me back mid-five-figures. “I agree, but I have a condition of my own,” I added. </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” she gasped even as she wrote another quick reply to Umi, trying to convince her to wear a white sleeveless blouse. It was not exactly revealing, but I could see what she had in mind. The buttons on the front meant that we could bargain her about her cleavage the whole night. Important, since I wanted to taste those spectacular breasts. </p><p>“I want to come with you to the store, so you can model for me in them, and maybe only them,” I answered, catching her lips in a searing kiss as she parted them. </p><p>“Naughty,” she answered. “I might do so if the store is empty. And worst case, we will have the dressing cabin.” </p><p>“Excellent idea,” I murmured as I focused on her neck once more, creating a trail of kisses while she tried to convince Umi to wear a short skirt, but failed in that effort. Still, she managed to convince her to wear a pair of skinny jeans, a nice consolation price under the circumstances. I pulled back when Umi sent a message telling that she would arrive in a few minutes, giving Tiffany enough time to fix her attire, not wanting to scare our guest immediately. </p><p>We were sipping our drinks when Umi walked in, accompanied by a waitress. Since I was a part of the decision-making process — through Umi was unaware of that particular fact — I wasn’t surprised by what she was wearing, but I was surprised by the way she filled the chosen clothes. Her white blouse was tight enough to strain the buttons in front of it, looking like it was about to collapse in one wrong movement. However, the generous size of her breasts was not a surprise, since even with the conservative dress earlier, they were apparent. </p><p>Her smooth legs, easily slipping into her tight jeans was a nice surprise, especially since her ass was still wide enough to rival her breasts. I couldn’t help to dig my fingers into their wide expanse. </p><p>“Good evening, sir,” Umi murmured. I was about to correct her, but then the idea of a shy half-Asian woman constantly calling me sir was too tempting to pass. </p><p>“Good evening, sweetie,” I answered. “Any preference for a drink? Maybe a cute cosmopolitan?” </p><p>“White wine, please,” she murmured as she moved to sit next to Tiffany, only for Tiffany to gesture her to sit on my left. I acted unaware of that little exchange, looking occupied with the menu, and ordered a few starters as well to fill our stomach. I was hungry after spending all that energy with Jenny, and needed some refreshment if I were to satisfy my other redheaded acquaintance as well as my surprise brunette friend. </p><p>“So, Umi. Tell me, how do you like the be part of our corporate family,” I asked directly, before she could ever have time to get over the fact that she needed to sit next to me while she flirted with me. </p><p>“It’s - wonderful,” she managed to say after a small pause. “The hours are good, and the pay is satisfactory. My husband loves his job a lot.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I answered even as I brought my gaze to her face, making sure our eyes connected before letting it trail down her neck, getting the glimpse of her modest cleavage before climbing up. “I’m happy to see the happiness of my team. Some people would complain about their partners constantly traveling. I’m happy to see that you’re not one of those.” </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” she murmured, unable to prevent her blush against my explicit attempt of enjoying her sight. </p><p>“So, how do you fill your long nights when your fiancee is away. Any hobbies?” I asked, once again pushing forward rather explicitly. Since Mike had sold me as an old-fashioned powerful boss, I had no problems playing that particular role, curious how she would react against my authority. She was giving major submissive vibes, and I was curious about the extent of it. </p><p>She murmured a response, so low that I was unable to hear. “Speak louder, sweetie,” I said, my sharp tone compensating for the softness of my words. “The class needs to hear from you.” </p><p>“Sorry, sir,” she murmured, her eyes pointing at the ground, not unlike a student who just received an admonishment from her favorite teacher. Maybe it would be even easier than I first thought. Her answer was cut short when the waitress came with her drink and the food. While the waitress placed the orders, Tiffany typed a quick message to Umi, while tipping the screen low enough that I could read it from the corner of my eye. She told her to use the opportunity to flirt a bit to get a better bonus for her fiancee, that it was the whole point of their presence. </p><p>Umi’s reaction to the message was frustration. Rather than saying anything, she reached for the glass and drank most of her wine in one long sip, seeking courage in the bottom of the glass. “Hmm…” she murmured, giving her some time to put together a response. “Nothing much,” she answered in the end. “I don’t have a lot of friends, so I usually stay inside, mostly relaxing in a bath,” she answered, her blush intensifying with each word. The fact that she was referring to her naked state, even indirectly, seemed to hit her limit.  </p><p>“That’s a nice image to remember when I’m back in my room,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>Tiffany joined in the discussion while Umi dipped her head down even lower, trying to process the implication that I would be imagining her naked. “Come on, Nathan,” she said as she gripped my bicep. “Aren’t you going to ask me the same question? I’m beginning to feel neglected.” </p><p>“My bad, sweetheart. Tell me, what do you do when you’re alone.” </p><p>“Umm…” she suddenly murmured, something that was very much against her personality, making me wonder what she had in mind. “Do you mind if I run my answer through Umi first? I’m not sure if it’s appropriate,” she added, and I smiled knowingly. Even as she left the booth, I noticed her subtly pulling her dress higher, displaying more of her beautiful legs, her hips dancing erotically with each exaggerated step, something Umi also noticed if her shocked gaze was any indicator. </p><p>When Tiffany sat next to Umi and started whispering, I was afraid that Umi was about to faint in shock. She was definitely showing the signs of it, her blush thickening as Tiffany continued to whisper, and when she finally pulled back, Umi glowed as bright as a lamp. “What do you think?” Tiffany asked. “Can I share that?” </p><p>“I … don’t think so,” Umi murmured shyly. </p><p>“Really,” Tiffany said with a crystal laugh, making a point of putting her hand on Umi’s thigh as she chuckled, but didn’t pull her hand away when she stopped laughing, squeezing tight instead. “Sorry Nathan, my story had been vetoed.” </p><p>“It’s a pity,” I answered with an exaggerated sigh while I turned my gaze back to Umi, enjoying the way she squirmed under my gaze. “So, do you mind summarizing the story in a PG manner?” </p><p>“I rather not, sir,” she murmured, but her determination folded quickly under my sharp gaze. She turned to Tiffany, only to receive another encouraging squeeze while Tiffany’s hand climbed higher on her thigh. “She mentioned that… She spent a lot of time taking baths as well, but also with a massage wand.” </p><p>“Interesting, but I don’t see why it’s an appropriate story,” I said, acting dense. </p><p>Umi looked frustrated, unable to answer, while Tiffany laughed and cut it. “That’s because you have never seen me getting a massage. I can be … expressive when receiving a massage.” </p><p>“How interesting,” I said. “I’m not a bad masseuse myself, why don’t you come here and show me just how expressive you can be while getting a massage,” I said. Meanwhile, the waitress came with another round of drinks, and once again Umi grabbed her white wine, using it to drown her shyness. A very bad strategy under the circumstances, I noted. </p><p>“Why not,” Tiffany said and stood up, once again walking with a slow, deliberate eroticism. I was interested to note Amy’s eyes getting stuck on Tiffany’s beautiful legs, enjoying the sight. When she arrived back at my side, she sat inappropriately close, our legs brushing together, something that managed to shock Umi in the process. But her surprise was nothing compared to when Tiffany leaned down and removed her heeled shoe rather than turning her back. After removing her shoe, she slid back and put her foot on my lap, not particularly bothered by the way her dress climbed higher while she did so. </p><p>I put my fingers on the bottom of her feet, gently rubbing. It wasn’t the first foot massage I had given to her, so it was easy to identify her moan as exaggerated, though it was convincing enough to make Umi blush even more. I looked down, enjoying the sight of her beautiful leg while Tiffany continued to moan, the guttural sound enough to make my heart tingle. As a curvy redhead, she was the epitome of sexiness even discounting her impressive skills of acting. </p><p>I slowly worked my way up to her calves, then her thighs, each moan making Umi more uncomfortable, and she continued to rely on her wine to process that feeling, slowly getting tipsy. She didn’t seem to have a lot of resistance to alcohol, so when the waitress moved to refill our drinks, I gestured her to stop. Tipsy was nice, but drunk was not, especially for the first time. </p><p>“How was it,” I said as I pulled my hands away rather than continuing to her thighs. Not because I didn’t want to, or felt shy doing it, but because I was afraid of Umi running away. The last few moans had already pushed her to the limit. As Tiffany leaned to put on her shoe once more, I managed to whisper, asking her to have a private talk with Umi. </p><p>“That was nice,” Tiffany said relaxedly. “But I definitely need to refresh my makeup after this. Umi, would you like to accompany me to the bathroom?” </p><p>“S-sure,” Umi stammered as she jumped up to her feet, more than happy to take the opportunity to get away from the situation, and from her inquiring gaze, she intended to talk Tiffany about the limits of their ploy. </p><p>I leaned back, curious about the outcome… </p>
