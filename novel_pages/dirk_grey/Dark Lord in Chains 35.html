        <p>I didn’t need to think a lot to decide my next move, because Aria started to move before I could make a decision. She started rubbing her body against mine, her enthusiasm not lessened even a bit. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, my body reacted in kind, my erection returning to life almost immediately. “Someone is a morning person,” I said with a chuckle even as she climbed on top of me. She might be used to the carnal side of our relationship, but that hardly meant that she was used to teasing, even the simple kind I had been using right now. Her blush intensified as she staggered, avoiding my gaze. She tried to slide off my lap. “Hey, I didn’t say I don’t like it,” I said, colored with a horny smile. </p><p>“Sorry,” she murmured, ducking her head. </p><p>“Hey,” I murmured, caressing her cheek as I did so. “There’s nothing to apologize for. It’s not something to be faulted. Try to be a bit more confident.” </p><p>“I don’t know…” she murmured, but rather than sliding off my lap, she stayed on to continue grind against my shaft, which counted as a great success. “Sorry, please don’t take it seriously,” she added. “It’s just that people always have so many expectations from their princess, it sometimes feels overwhelming,” she murmured. </p><p>“People are always like that,” I answered with a shrug. “It’s actually not about your position. No matter your strength, if you don’t put a barrier, people will ask you more and more.” Even as I explained, however, I had to keep myself from laughing at the irony of the moment. I, Byron Mordred, the dark lord who loomed over the Empire as an everpresent intimidating threat, was giving counseling to the princess of the said Empire while she rubbed her naked body against mine. </p><p>It was certainly a moment too surreal to be real. </p><p>“You need to learn to exert yourself more,” I told her. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured. </p><p>“Why don’t we have a little try,” I said with a smirk. “Why don’t you try it with me?” I said as I raised my arms, and cast a simple spell, which made the bed covers wrap around like chains. “I’m under your mercy, exert your will.” </p><p>“You’re so bad,” she murmured, but considering her spectacular blush and her positioning, it was the most flirtatious mannerism she had displayed to date. “Then, start moving your hips,” she said as she slapped my chest. </p><p>Her mannerism as she tried to be domineering was thoroughly amusing, but I somehow managed to keep myself from laughing. Instead, I followed her request. She moved her hips against mine in rhythm, which made the moment even more delicious. </p><p>“Worship me,” she ordered as she leaned forward, her breasts pushing against my chest, giving me a sensation I could never get sick of. </p><p>“Your body is a work of art, Aria. You’re the pearl of the Empire, the thing that Anyone who doesn't appreciate every inch of you is an idiot."</p><p>She blushed, glancing down, which made her look at her exposed breasts. It wasn’t exactly the aura of a dominatrix, but that was to be expected considering her utter lack of experience in exerting will in any way. Still, after a shrug, she focused back on her actions, putting her hands on my shoulder as she continued to grind. “Grab my tits,” she ordered. </p><p>“As you wish, my princess,” I said even as I tugged my impromptu ties, making them fall off rather easily. Surprisingly, before I could reach her chest, she actually took my hand and dragged it at my chest. I saw the desire in her eyes, but also hesitation, feeling self-conscious about actually taking the lead. </p><p>I gently cupped my hand around her mounds, once again enjoying the fullness of that marvelous bust. Aria closed her eyes and murmured. “That feels nice.” She looked unbelievably beautiful at that moment, powerfully aroused but also relieved; finally exploring an aspect of herself that she had been denying for years under the expectations of her cold mother and the expectations of the public. </p><p>Of course, her emotional struggles didn’t affect the softness of her naked body in any way, every rocking of her hips giving me intense pleasure. I moved my hands to the space between her tits, caressing them from the inside out. My thumbs sought out her perfect nipples, delicately swirling around them. </p><p>That worked wonderfully to distract her from the existential crisis she was suffering. She leaned forward and kissed me passionately, while she simultaneously grabbed my hands to pull them deeper into the soft flesh of her breasts, her body shaking with desire. She was kissing me hungrily, with an active passion she had never displayed before. </p><p>It was a good moment. In Aria’s bed, with her softness above me, grinding at my erection. </p><p>Amazingly, it got even better, because, without any prompting from my end, Aria moved her hips and my shaft disappeared into her core, wrapped with her warmth. </p><p>“Do it, push inside me,” she begged even as she pushed her weight down, swallowing my length the best way possible. As the pleasure hit, she squeezed my hands even tighter, making my fingers disappear in her bosom. “You feel amazing inside me,” she gasped. </p><p>It seemed that my physical attention was a good enough emotional motivator for my emotionally neglected princess. </p><p>Still, her emotionally stunted development stole nothing from her beauty. With her deliciously plump legs around me, her hips smashing against mine repeatedly. Her golden curls danced freely as she moved her hips, occasionally sticking on her swelling pink tits. Her fair skin flushed with excitement further. </p><p>It was a good time to be completely naked, I thought as Aria pulled back from the kiss for a breather, still jumping up and down which made her succulent tits dangle erotically. But somehow, the aroused shine in her blue eyes suppressed the visual impact created by her delicious body. Her arousal was climbing more and more. </p><p>Therefore, I was really surprised when she suddenly pulled out.  </p><p>"Is something wrong?" I asked, trying to regulate my breathing. </p><p>"No, nothing. This is amazing," she murmured. "I just want to make sure this moment lasts as long as it can."</p><p>I might have complained about that, but when she turned her back. “Hug me,” she ordered, and I did that gladly, spooning her gently, using the opportunity to slip inside her once more. </p><p>The embrace was delicious, with my arms snug around her waist, her body pushing against mine. It was like a romantic dance, except my hands were wandering in areas that would have created a scandal in any civilized party even if we had been dressed. Then, she looked at me and we started kissing. </p><p>As we kissed, Aria pressed herself against me, tighter, our bodies mashed together. My shaft disappeared into her slit repeatedly, soaking in her warm arousal. “Hug me tighter,” she begged, and I did so, fulfilling her request with all the sincerity I could muster. I fingered her swollen nipples as I did so, making her moan even louder. </p><p>It was a beautiful moment. </p><p>After an extended hug, she tightened around me, which triggered an explosion from me, filling her insides as well. I hugged her tighter as she trembled, enjoying the aftershocks. It was a beautiful moment. </p><p>“It’s too bad that you’re going to leave one day for the dark lands, leaving me alone,” she murmured after her climax subsided. </p><p>I let out an amused smirk, entertained by her acceptance of my freedom. Though, considering the ease I was walking around the palace, it wasn’t an unfair assumption. If it wasn’t for the other reasons that made the dark lands unhospitable for me, I would have long deserted my cell. </p><p>“And, you would be sad to see me leaving?” I asked softly. </p><p>“Of course,” she murmured as she suddenly turned, our faces meeting. She blushed furiously, but that didn’t prevent her from looking at me with loving eyes. “I would miss you greatly.” </p><p>Honestly, I was surprised by the intensity of her look. I didn’t know when the affection she felt toward me had intensified to such a degree, but it seemed the simple kindness of bringing her a breakfast seemed to finally solidify her emotions into a delicious reflection of love. </p><p>It left me a difficult question, should I accept her confession completely, make her a proper member of my harem, or keep her at arms’ length… </p>
