        <p>“As you wish, princess,” I whispered, deciding to follow her direction for once. It wasn’t my usual attitude, but if there was one girl that earned that treatment, without a doubt, it was Aria. </p><p>“Really?” she gasped, her attitude of authority shattering for a second as she was surprised by my words, her shocked glee making her even cuter. </p><p>“Of course, who am I to ignore a royal order,” I said as I slowly moved down, arriving at the level of her breasts. “I have to do my best to handle this glorious mission assigned by my great princess.” </p><p>Aria looked at me, her excitement mixed with the slightest trepidation as  I lowered my head down the glorious valley between her breasts, aggressively devouring the remaining chocolate from those snowy peaks, leaving them squeaky clean while Aria squeaked in pleasure. </p><p>“It’s not a bad start, is it, my princess,” I murmured as I raised my head, catching her beautiful blue eyes, peering deep into their beauty, while she trembled under my fingers, busy caressing her stomach. </p><p>“N-no,” she stammered. “It’s - NOT!” she said, though it turned into a beautiful cry as my fingers moved even lower, landing on her wetness. It was beautiful, tinged with overwhelming arousal as my fingers danced around her knob, bringing her pleasure to the surface. </p><p>Her blush thickened further as her excitement reached a new level. “You can order me to stop whenever you feel I’m pushing my patriotic limits too much, princess,” I offered even as my fingers quickened. </p><p>Her shiver was enough proof that such an order was simply not possible. </p><p>I continued to move, leaving a trail of kisses over her beautiful stomach, each kiss making her moan even louder in anticipation until my head disappeared between her legs, her wet lips just an inch away from my tongue, her delicious aroma begging me to taste her.  </p><p>A shocked gasp escaped her mouth as my tongue brushed against her entrance, her body rising reflexively, her tits jiggling with her sudden move. </p><p>“Just close your eyes, and enjoy the treatment, my beautiful princess,” I murmured before returning to the delicious source of warmth in front of me, my tongue darting out once again. </p><p>The moan that escaped her mouth was heavenly, her chest pushing up, making her beautiful breasts jiggle more and more, almost in a hypnotic pattern. My tongue explored her entrance, quickly turning fast and aggressive, circling her knob again and again. After all, it was still the starter, and we had the main event to focus on. </p><p>She moaned, showing how much she enjoyed me spoiling her. She pushed her hips forward, her beautiful, plump thighs tightening around my head to make me feel even happier. </p><p>I might have reacted aggressively if someone else dared to do so, but if there was one girl that earned a little leeway, it was the cute princess that declared her love to me. I continued to lick her as her hips moved in response, grinding her pussy against my face. Her movements were a touch choppy and forceful, but her inexperience just made it sexier. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she murmured dazedly, adding another moan I grabbed her hips, my fingers sinking into her beautiful flesh, enjoying their softness, even as my shaft throbbed in anticipation. The idea of continuing for hours, slowly teasing her until she had turned into a delicious puddle of joy was tempting. </p><p>Unfortunately, I still had a lot of things to do, starting with a serious talk with her. </p><p>After one last touch, I started moving up, which earned a disappointing sigh since she was yet to climax. “So impatient,” I murmured, unable to keep a wide smirk from covering my face. “Don’t worry, we’re just about to start.” </p><p>She just nodded, still under my touch, while her irises widened as I slowly closed in the distance. But just as the distance was about to disappear into nothingness, she closed her eyes, ready for the kiss. I hummed as my lips pressed against hers, enjoying their delicate softness even as I brought the taste of her juices to her lips. </p><p>It was a soft, lingering kiss, one that she reacted in an instant as her tongue darted out, her pleasure allowing her to act more forward than she might have acted otherwise. Though, after that amazing breakfast show, I had to admit that her shyness had long transformed into its own special erotic version. </p><p>A development I had no problem with, especially since I was determined to keep her with me forever. Even if I decided to retreat from the Empire due to a mysterious growing double threat, I would bring her with me. </p><p>After everything I had done, kidnapping a princess didn’t even register as significant.</p><p>As the kiss deepened, her reaction intensified, while I readied myself to slide inside her. I wanted to tease her a bit more before slipping inside her, building her arousal to the limit before I could deliver the final blow. </p><p>But she managed to surprise me further, this time in the form of her legs wrapping around my waist, positioning my shaft against her entrance forcefully. “Oh, such a domineering princess, violating her subjects with force,” I murmured. </p><p>“You’re not one of my subjects, you’re my prisoner,” she managed to murmur cutely. “It’s only fair if I use some force to interrogate you.” </p><p>“Oh, the horror,” I murmured even as her legs pulled me even deeper, finally pulling me inside, her tunnels tight around my girth just as her legs tight around my waist. “This treatment is inhumane. Abolish the monarchy.” </p><p>“It’s just a start,” she said even as she pressed her hand on my shoulder, and flipped my body with surprising strength, fueled by her enthusiasm. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. Being buried in a soft bed as the princess of the Empire straddled my lap, my shaft buried inside her, her beautiful chest heaving in excitement… There were worse fates in the world. </p><p>Her hands landed on my chest as her hips moved with a rapidness that surprised me, any shyness she might feel about the situation long drowned in a sea of arousal. Her eyes closed as her hips started rocking, moving up and down as her nether lips danced over my shaft with dance too beautiful to describe, sinking and rising much faster than I expected. </p><p>A beautiful treatment, and her hands dancing on my chest just enhanced the sensation, especially with her rough treatment leaving more than one thin red line. Her gasps got louder and louder as she picked up even more speed, her face reflecting nothing but pleasure. </p><p>Enjoying the show passively was fun, there was no doubt about that, but even my patience had its limits. And watching the way her beautiful breasts jiggled in front of me with each jump certainly made it that much harder to resist. </p><p>Luckily, there was no harm in me helping her joy a bit, I thought even as I put my hands on her sides before letting them climb up, arriving at the borders of her beautiful globes. My fingers moved to their expanse hungrily, sinking into their generous depths. </p><p>“H-how dare you, touching a royal person without p-permission,” she stammered, but this time, it was her moans that broke her words rather than shyness. </p><p>“I’m sorry, your highness,” I mocked. “I’m such a bad person. Maybe you should make my punishment faster.” </p><p>“Maybe I should,” she said as she leaned forward, and her lips hovered above mine. </p><p>“Help, I’m being silenced. This is royal cruelty,” I managed to murmur before her lips landed on mine, her tongue darting out readily, doing her best to dominate the kiss. The twirling of her tongue as she invaded my mouth was perfect to convey her burning desire as she stole the control of the kiss, a touch out-of-character, but certainly glorious… </p><p>Then, her hands landed on my head, pulling my hair painfully as she continued to ravage my mouth desperately, trying to find a panacea that would reward her with her climax. A search that was going great, if her tightness was any indicator. </p><p>I sank deeper into her treasure as she reached a speed that was best described as furious, my muffled grunts of pleasure mixing into our flesh colliding, her tits rubbing against my skin to make the pleasure even tighter. </p><p>"You’re just so beautiful,” I whispered when she pulled for a breather even as my hands moved to her hips, triggering her furious dance even more. </p><p>“You can’t buy your way out of punishment,” she managed to growl, though her attempts to look menacing had failed spectacularly. </p><p>“I’m scared,” I whispered, unable to hide my chuckle. </p><p>“Shut up,” she ordered, her blush getting more intense. When I opened my mouth to add another insult, however, she decided to silence me the best way possible, with another invasion of her beautiful tongue. </p><p>As our tongues battled, her hips gyration reached its climax, tightening around my girth, the sudden rush putting every single inch of my skin to high alert as it triggered an explosion of my own. </p><p>She started to shiver as I filled her beautiful body, bringing our little dance to a temporary end. She collapsed over my chest, her warmth more comforting than all the luxury that surrounded us. </p><p>“Maybe a decadent nap wouldn’t be too bad,” I murmured as I hugged her even tighter, enjoying the moment. </p>
