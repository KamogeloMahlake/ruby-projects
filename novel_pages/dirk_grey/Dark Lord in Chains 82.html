        <p>Trying to pull juvenile sexual tricks against someone that was stronger than me — at least, as far as the pure magical strength went —  was a bad choice, even if I wasn’t locked in with her in the depths of her base, with dozens of magical constructs to help her if she decided to rely on the more violent aspects of her little plan. </p><p>Especially since I needed her to make some accurate decisions. </p><p>Yet, as she listened to my explanation with confident laziness, a smug superiority shaping her beautiful face, the temptation of pulling such juvenile tricks was simply impossible to deny. </p><p>After all, what was life without the occasional tricks to send my heart racing? </p><p>“There are some valid clues about the possible locations for the Eternal Core,” I murmured as I channeled my magic through the Tether, distracting her with a potentially relevant source of information that could give her the reward she was searching for while I increased my connection with her dress.</p><p>Then, I pulled a subtle trick, and let some of the silvery fabric move down, making her dress more transparent in the process. Not completely sheer like a nightie, but still enough to get a glimpse of her breasts. </p><p>And the glimpse I got was simply spectacular. Just like her face, her body had a surreal beauty, almost enough to be classified as alien, but enough to prevent my shaft from stirring in anticipation. </p><p>Yet, that was just the start of my plans. I wouldn’t have classified my actions as risky if that was the extent of my ploys. Her magic was still connected to the dress, which gave me a chance to make a subtle connection to her magic, using the dress as a medium to prevent her from being alerted. </p><p>Then, I started casting Tantric magic. </p><p>I was careful in my targeting as I cast my spell, not trying to affect her directly — which would have been a deadly move with her magical aptitude, no matter how distracted she was with the potential clues of the location of the Eternal Core.</p><p>The bludgeoning way Sapphire used Tantric on me was not the only method available. Carefully flooding her dress, letting her own connection absorb it while she rotated her magic was also a viable strategy. </p><p>Not without its own costs, of course, as using it indirectly meant that I had ceded the control of my mana to her, and she could easily use it for her own purposes. Not that it was a great perk to her considering just how incredibly strong her mana was already, but the real drawback was the limited effect. </p><p>Unlike a properly cast spell that could easily send them into throes of passion under my control, my indirect method only allowed me to enhance her arousal slightly, barely more than a beautiful perfume or a charming smile. </p><p>Luckily, I thought as I decided to act the moment I noticed the flames of her wings started to burn differently — almost amorously. Compared to that, her gaze wandering down might as well be a subtle clue — I had the assets and the skills to push forward once she had felt that flicker of passion. </p><p>I started moving as I continued my explanation, stretching my arm and letting my shirt ride up, taking a note of her reactions to seeing if she was particularly affected by a part of my body. </p><p>I didn’t notice a particular source of attraction, but more a low-level instinctual interest, one that, even with the assistance of my spell, was only possible because of her boredom. Not just the boredom of my explanation, as if that had been the case it would have been much less effective, but the mind-numbing exhaustive boredom she was clearly feeling, mostly hiding in her own base. </p><p>Albeit I doubted she would particularly enjoy what passed as entertainment in the Capital. She clearly had tastes expensive enough to treat the most expensive city in the land as a backwater waste. </p><p>With her spoiled nature radiating off her with all the intensity of a forest fire, another option was not possible. </p><p>And, that was only a part of my tricks. My real trick was her dress, the unwitting tool she had given me to access her body. Even as I was busy with everything else, I continued playing with her dress, using it as an indirect incarnation of my fingers to give her a soft, hard-to-notice massage, easily written off as the movements of her extraordinary dress. </p><p>Another simple trick that showed surprising effectiveness when supported by the other two sources. </p><p>Soon, her lips parted beautifully, letting out a soft, lingering sigh. </p><p>I chose that moment to make her dress move, leaving a soft, stinging pain on her nipple, making her gasp in shock. I pulled my magic away completely as I did so, of course, not daring enough to leave any evidence of my subtle manipulations.</p><p>“Is something wrong?” I asked, doing my best to look concerned. </p><p>“N-no, just a cramp,” she explained quickly. </p><p>“I’m not bad when it comes to massage, your Highness, I can give you a treatment if you want,” I offered. Of course, I didn’t expect her to accept that offer, as even with the previous tricks, it was too early for someone as haughty as her to allow me to touch her body.</p><p>Which was why I was surprised when I received a nod from her. “It’s a good idea,” she said as she stood up and gestured, and a door parted open at the wall. “Follow me.” </p><p>After a momentary freeze, I stood up and followed her, surprised by the quick speed she had accepted my offer. Though, while I did my best to hide it, I was feeling rather tense. Not because I would be massaging her, but because she had accepted that much closer than I had been expecting. </p><p>Suggesting I had misread something about her. Maybe she was more calculative and wanted to test me, maybe she was more affected by my simple tricks. Maybe, she simply saw me as inferior enough to count as a servant, and had no problems allowing me to touch her. </p><p>Or maybe, she was simply bored enough to jump at the opportunity of some fun while she was away from her family. </p><p>After all, the way she dressed clearly revealed she appreciated my hungry gaze as long as I wasn’t daring enough to act on it. Massage just could be the next step to that. </p><p>When I arrived in the next room, she was already lying on her bed — a huge, four-poster bed that was filled with a shocking number of magical wards, to the point of making it almost impossible to analyze them. </p><p>Luckily, while I lacked the ability to analyze and deconstruct the wards due to their unfamiliar nature, checking their outcome of them was much easier, especially since none of them particularly well-concealed. </p><p>It didn’t take long to ascertain that as I walked forward, that other than a defensive ward that was big enough to be activated under the emergencies, the rest of the spells were just enough to ensure the spectacular comfort of the bed, turning it into a true luxury. </p><p>“Show me how well a king can serve,” she said as she stretched on the bed, lying prone. I walked closer as I watched her dress shuffle, creating a nice wide space for me to allow my touch. </p><p>Her words revealed more about her mood, revealing the subtle mystery of her sudden desire to get a massage from me, one that couldn’t be explained by the subtle trick I had just pulled. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk in amusement as I understood it. </p><p>She wanted to treat the king as a servant. </p><p>It wasn’t to say her body was not tempting, but still, I was more interested in the wings of flame that were coming out of her back. There was no direct limb on her back, revealing to me that it was fully magical rather than a mixture of her natural looks — at least, as far as her human form was concerned. </p><p>Of course, my information about phoenixes was not exactly comprehensive, it was more accurately framed as a mixture of scraps and legends — which shouldn’t be too shocking considering before seeing the beautiful woman lying in front of me, I didn’t believe the existence of the phoenixes. </p><p>Even now, I wasn’t sure if it was her true form, or if it was just a very effective transformation she was able to put on as a secondary form. </p><p>Luckily, delivering an extended massage was a good way to address some of those curiosities. </p><p><br></p>
