        <p>I continued acting hesitant as her hands started exploring my body more and more, until she cupped my growing shaft like she owned it. “Oh, are you sure you want to go there?” I asked, my tone barely above a whisper. </p><p>“I don’t know what you mean, I’m just helping you to feel better,” she said, her amused tone telling me that she had managed to misread the implications of my voice. “We’re in a dangerous situation, and I need you to be hundred percent ready.” </p><p>I was tempted to let her continue, but the intensity of her smugness managed to trigger me. </p><p>I decided to punish her … in a fun way, but punishment still. </p><p>“Oh, and how are you going to do that?” I asked. </p><p>“Like this,” she started as she pushed my pants down, revealing my shaft. She was about to wrap her fingers around my shaft … when I decided it was enough playing the submissive. </p><p>“Well, you’re the expert. I need to trust you. If you think that’s a problem in the ruins, I have no choice but to trust you.” </p><p>“Oh, trust me. We can’t afford you to be distracted,” she moaned as she caressed my naked shaft once more, then leaned against the wall — and empty section, still careful not to damage the drawings — which displayed her ass, wrapped in perfect leather. “It’s hard to resist this, I assume.” </p><p>“It definitely is,” I said with a sudden change of tone and suddenly reached forward, grabbing her ass with both hands. “It’s amazing enough to worth being locked in a deadly ruin.” </p><p>The way her expression shifted was beautiful. Her confidence evaporated in an instant, leaving its place to shock, her panicked yelp hardly helping. “I …” she whispered, which was all she was able to say as she was being utterly molested by my hands. I took a step forward, my massive hard-on pressing against her leather pants</p><p>“Sorry, miss leader, you need to be louder,” I chuckled as I shifted my hand, cupping her pussy. The leather was thick enough to reduce the sensation, so I added a flick, opening the front. “I-isn’t it a bit forward?” she stammered, showing that she was certainly not as confident taking what she was ready to dish out. </p><p>I chuckled. “Oh, really? Even when I’m doing exactly what you have been doing,” I whispered throatily, and she shivered. “Oh, wait a moment, one mistake,” I added and pushed her leather pants down, leaving her in her panties. </p><p>Which were considerably smaller than I expected. “Oh, naughty,” I whispered as I grabbed her core once more, the material too thin to reduce the sensation.</p><p>She said nothing, shocked that her little game reversed in a way she hadn’t expected. </p><p>"Y-you!" she managed to stammer, but that was all she was able to say as I pulled her arm and then pushed her against the wall, applying the same treatment to her leather top, but this time, I dragged her underwear as well, leaving her amazing tits naked. </p><p>She covered them up protectively as enjoyed that sight. I chuckled at the sight. “Me,” I said. “I can stop, you just need to admit that you’re a little coward that can’t take what you deliver.” </p><p>“I … I’m not a coward,” she stammered, trying to sound confident, but that failed. She was the one that initiated it, but facing my naked body, she realized it was not a good idea. I hovered above her, big enough to fill her sight. </p><p>She could have done something drastic like saying that she wanted to stop … but I could see in her eyes that confusion was prevalent. She was clearly never been in this situation before, and she wasn't entirely sure she wanted to stop.</p><p>“I - I’m not sure,” she admitted. </p><p>“Do you want to have a minute to think?” I offered. </p><p>“I can?” </p><p>“Yes, you just need to keep me entertained in the process,” I said. </p><p>“E-entertain how?” she said, her voice beautifully hesitant. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, you’re a smart woman,” I chimed, rubbing my cock and smiling at her.</p><p>"Right..." she whispered, looking indecisive. For a moment, I thought that I had pushed her too much, which would have made the rest of my work considerably more difficult. I had no idea what kind of defenses this place had, but considering my old rival worked hard to look like a loyal retainer rather than trying to threaten her, pushing her too much was risky. </p><p>Luckily, rather than retreating, she turned her back, pushing her ass out. </p><p>"And if I do this... you’ll give me time to think,” she asked, unable to take her eyes off of my throbbing cock as she looked back. </p><p>"Exactly, I promise," I said, knowing full well that it was an exaggeration at best. I wouldn’t want to stop once we started … but then it was not a problem. She didn’t look like she wanted to stop either. </p><p>She didn’t move the slightest as I pressed my shaft against her ass, her panties not working particularly well to block the sensation. “I’m not going to do all the work, move your ass, sweetie,” I said as I slapped her ass. </p><p>She started moving. "Do it sexily,” I ordered, and she started moving faster. “Good. Now push your sexy ass more and grind properly."</p><p> She followed that order, closing her eyes as she tried to come to a decision, the repeated moves only it harder for her to reject the follow-up requests. More importantly, her panties were getting more drenched each second. </p><p>A minute passed before I caressed her wet snatch over her panties. “Oh, it feels like you have already made your decision,” I whispered. </p><p>She shivered badly. “N-not yet,” she whispered, clearly not knowing what to say. She felt deep embarrassment at the way I was acting and she was reacting. Part of her clearly just wanted to get this over with.</p><p>The more dominant part of her just wanted to continue. </p><p>"Bend over for some more if you’re going to take that long to decide," I said as I put my hand on her hips, and pulled her back, creating enough space between her and the wall for her to bend forward properly. </p><p>She followed, her legs parting open slightly for balance as her hands pressed against the wall, her tits dangling freely. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I enjoyed her bent-over figure, while I tightened my grip around her waist. Then, I pushed forward, changing my target location, my erection passing between her meaty thighs, her wetness enough to make it a slippery journey. </p><p>It was already pushing hard for a delaying activity. "That's it. Rub your ass around slowly. It’s your fault for teasing me that much,” I said. I could have pushed for more, but I was loving the sensation of her soft, silky-smooth thighs caressing my shaft. And, her indecisive arousal just made the situation more tempting. </p><p>She was having trouble taking the increasing pleasure from the treatment, yet the answer was yet to arrive, which restricted me. Pity that I couldn’t push yet, enjoying the total control over her, her submissiveness spectacular. </p><p>Suppressing my desire to push for more, but I continued to pump back and forth enjoying her growing wetness. I wanted to do more, but luckily, her sexy thighs were beautiful enough to keep things entertaining… </p><p>Still, after it reached the five-minute mark, with no decision, I decided to add another snag. “You need to make another sacrifice for our fun game,” I ordered, and she looked at me questioningly. </p><p>“A-another sacrifice? What?” she whispered. </p><p>“Turn around and drop your panties,” I ordered. She looked hesitant, but her facial expression didn’t stop her movement. She leaned against the wall as she pushed them down, her legs crossed to hide her core. </p><p>“It’s that?’ she whispered. </p><p>“Yes, now you can start dancing,” I said, and she looked shocked. </p><p>“I - I’m not much of a dancer,” she admitted with a blush, implying that there was a story behind it. Unfortunately, I wasn’t in the mood to dig that. I leaned, grabbed her hair, and pulled her for a rough kiss, sticking my tongue down her throat and enjoying her lips. </p><p>When I pulled back, she was dazed. “I don’t like being played, sweetie. Either pay the price for the delay, or make your decision.” </p><p>Her expression told me that it was impossible for her to answer the question negatively, yet somehow, after everything, she was still too shy to answer positively. </p><p>The contrast with her earlier courage was simply too amusing…</p>
