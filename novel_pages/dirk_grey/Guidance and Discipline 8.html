        <p>Mark was getting more and more conflicted as Laura silently slid down, paying his abs inordinate attention for a while before completing her little journey, though her focus was a little weird. He was aware of the fascination the women had toward his abs —and enjoyed it, hence the reason for the endless hours he spent at the gym to sculpt them to perfection— but Laura’s was a bit different. </p><p>Like she was actually forcing herself to pay attention to them before she moved on. </p><p>The reason revealed itself a moment later, when she continued to move down, her beautiful eyes widening as her gaze fell onto his shaft, the object that had been invading her earlier. He barely held back from chuckling, realizing that she had been trying to hide her fascination, somehow still ashamed of it after what they had just done. He forced the chuckle to die before it could leave his lips, not wanting to make her self-conscious. </p><p>Instead, he aligned the pillow so that he could watch as Laura made herself familiar with a rather important part of his anatomy. </p><p>The tense vulnerability on her face as she wrapped her fingers around his girth to test the texture of his shaft would have been cute, if it wasn’t for the fact that her chest was slightly raised, giving him a limited view of her amazing bosom, the one that she always hid behind thick blouses and boring cardigans. Distracted by the amazing view she was creating, he absolutely had no problem giving her the time she needed to wrap her head around the new concept. </p><p>Especially if she was willing to follow that by wrapping her lips around his girth… </p><p>He had to admit that she was lucky to have her first proper experience with such a spectacular example of manhood—even though it felt rather a narcissistic thing to say in the confines of his mind. It was a quality he was aware of in himself, otherwise, he wouldn’t have torturing himself to maintain his body to perfection even as he was starting to push to forty. </p><p>Laura’s expression started to get more and more intense even as her fingers started to move up and down, with a hesitancy that left no doubt about it was the first time she was touching a cock. If it was one of his frequent one-night stands from his lawyer days, it would have annoyed immensely. Those days, sex was a performance, and he demanded excellence from both sides to make it fun. </p><p>Looking back, not too unlike playing tennis with someone. A lot of sweat and fun, but little to none actual emotion other than what a rush of adrenaline could evoke. </p><p>As he watched Laura, however, it was different. Special. How or why, he had no idea. He had spent such a long portion of his lawyer days as an emotional blank that was only occupied with the next case that actually feeling something against some other person was a genuine change of pace. </p><p>But regardless, he decided to ignore the nature of his emotional journey, and focus on the beautiful sight of Laura’s hands slowly gaining confidence, dancing over his shaft, slowly leaning further. His smile widened even further when her tongue darted out to leave a hesitant lick on his length. The cute gasp she let out as her tongue disappeared in her mouth was a thing of beauty, even as she lowered her head down to hide her expression. </p><p>Still, despite her obvious shyness, she decided to push forward, using the same determination that allowed herself to piece her life together after her hopes of getting into an ivy-league college had been demolished. </p><p>She used her tongue and once more, licking around the head of his cock, this time her touch lingering for far longer. She pulled back for a moment, shivering in excitement, but her tongue touched again a few seconds, slowly covering the crown of his shaft with an abundance of saliva. </p><p>Her quick development surprised him, but not as much as her next move, when she suddenly dipped down without a warning and capturing a third of his shaft in her deliciously hot mouth, her presence swirling around. She pulled back, but with her lips clamped tight around my girth —even if it forced her to open her mouth as wide as possible— the move created a delicious rush of pleasure. </p><p>When she pulled out completely rather than repeating the pattern, Mark was ready to feel disappointed, but that faded quickly when her tongue took over, moving along his length. Still, it left its place in surprise as she started delivering a combined assault of her lips and her tongue, much smoother than he would have expected. </p><p>If he wasn’t absolutely sure about her lack of experience, he would have assumed she was one of the lip queens back in high school. But still, the expertise she was displaying, when contrasted with her inexperience… </p><p>When the obvious answer finally appeared in his mind, cutting through pleasure, he failed to suppress a chuckle. Which, naturally, destroyed her fragile confidence, and she immediately rose with a wounded expression, ready to dash away. “Sorry,” he said with a kind smile even as he grabbed her wrist. “I wasn’t laughing at you. I just realized an interesting detail, and it surprised me.” </p><p>“What?” she said even as she raised her arm reflexively to cover her chest, her expression fragile even after the spectacular orgasm. After her reaction to his earlier loss of control when he took her domineeringly —not to mention her confidence in the way she dressed as she visited him— he had underestimated just how fragile she might be despite everything. </p><p>And apparently, being laughed at was one of her triggers, to a point of risking all the progress they had made. </p><p>“Nothing,” he said calmly, using the same tone he had used years earlier when he went riding lessons, where a trainer had used against a panicking mare. “I just realized something rather interesting. You have studied before coming here, right?” he asked. </p><p>“Studying?” she murmured dazedly, only understanding what he was talking about when his gaze dipped down to his crotch. The fear of being mocked that was about to make her escape disappeared, leaving its place to a much cuter version of shyness. “M-maybe,” she stuttered, reluctant to admit but unable to lie. </p><p>“It’s not something to be ashamed about,” he said even as he reached to caress her cheek, before turning that touch into a much more solid one on the back of her head, applying the slightest pressure to lower her head. She immediately followed his wordless direction, once again taking her place between his legs, her hands pressing against the bed. </p><p>In her shyness, she was even more willing to follow his directions. </p><p>But, rather than focusing on the implications of her sudden obedience, he decided to focus on the amazing blowjob she started to provide. Her head started to bob up and down, both quicker and deeper as he maintained his grip, giving her the occasional directions. </p><p>He didn’t keep his hand on her head for long, nor that he needed to. She proved herself as an excellent student once more by swallowing more than half of his girth even without his assistance, bobbing aggressively. Her moans soon rose, their rumbling making the treatment even better. </p><p>He let his body buried in the bed, letting himself enjoy the amazing treatment he was receiving, something he had deserved after disarming the unexpected bomb of vulnerability, though he had to bite his lips to prevent a cry of pleasure when she suddenly pulled out, only to slide her tongue down his shaft to the bottom and back up, her movements getting smoother and smoother, to a point that betrayed she had spent more than one dedicated evening playing with a toy to train her motor skills. </p><p>Not that he was complaining, on the contrary. After all, a good blowjob had two components, skill and enthusiasm, both had been considerably lacking on the female half of the population when it came to giving good head. The latter was understandable, but the former was usually about their inflated perception of their own abilities. </p><p>It was good to see Laura embracing a systematic approach, the same kind she applied in her studies. </p><p>However, that didn’t change the fact she was turning to be a tease, Mark added a couple of minutes later, when he watched her pull out and lick the sides of his shaft again. Pleasurable, no doubt, but not in a way that would extinguish the desire starting to burn intensely in his heart. </p><p>Still, he suppressed the temptation to grab her head and enjoy the tightness of her throat, willing to enjoy the show she was providing… </p><p>The night was sufficiently long… </p>
