        <p>As I watched Cinder fly in the sky unimpeded, flying low enough to touch the ground, and high enough to brush against the wards, radiating happiness. I was tense the first time I had watched her flying toward the wards, ready to cut her mana once again, afraid that she had lost herself in transformation once again. </p><p>Just like the first time, she took a sharp turn before hitting, her flames brushing against the ward. </p><p>A smile bloomed on my face as I continued to watch her, deciding not to call her down or bother her directly or indirectly. Clearly, after a lifetime of failing to transform, she was exuberant with her success, and deserved a moment to celebrate it. </p><p>“Fascinating, right,” I whispered into Isolde’s ear even as I let my fingers dance over her wetness. </p><p>“She’s just a bigger target for my bow,” Isolde answered, but she was nowhere near a good actress to successfully hide her jealousy. Or fascination for that matter. </p><p>“Oh, really, maybe we should practice that … later,” I said even as I let my hands dance over her body, removing the remaining scraps of clothing, and leaving her completely naked. “But first, some additional entertainment.” </p><p>Isolde gasped as my hands danced over her body hungrily. </p><p>Very hungrily, even, I realized even as I enjoyed the tight body of Isolde, her soft skin contrasting with her tight muscles underneath. </p><p>I wanted to frown as I was not used to unexpected bursts of emotion like that, but my body had other ideas as my lips landed on Isolde’s neck, biting hard enough to earn a beautiful, charged cry. </p><p>A sharp move like that might have earned a negative reaction from someone else, but I didn’t need to know this reaction to know that Isolde enjoyed a rougher treatment. I let my hands follow my instincts even as I closed my eyes, trying to understand my own uncharacteristic reaction. </p><p>Finding the source of it was trivial. There was only one thing that changed during the last day that could result in such a major change. </p><p>My connection with Cinder. </p><p>I turned inward, examining our connection. With Cinder successfully transformed, we were resonating even more intensely, which increased the impact of the flames. Not only strengthening of my magic getting faster, but also I was feeling my magic getting stronger and stronger. </p><p>I twisted her nipples, triggering a beautiful moan off Isolde, still nibbling her neck, but I kept my attention on the way the connection to Cinder worked inside me, noticing that, this time, the impact was not limited to my magic but also spread to my body. </p><p>I was not a healing expert, but I was competent, as no dark lord that was at least competent in curing poisons — or immune to it completely by being a lich or a similar creature — would last long. It allowed me to make sure it wasn’t hurting me, just like my magic. </p><p>But instead, strengthened me. The sudden impulses were just a side effect of the sudden burst of vitality. </p><p>With the impact of the flames on the living things, that result was not shocking, and best classified as a pleasant bonus. I might have focused that more, but a needy moan from Isolde triggered my instincts, even more, begging me to focus outward. </p><p>Who was I to deny the call of my own body and my needy assassin? </p><p>I grabbed Isolde’s hair and pulled hard, making her bend backward until she created a dangerous curve. If I tried to do that against someone else, the best I would get was a painful accident, but Isolde managed to balance herself even as I pulled hard, the pain only intensifying her pleasure further. </p><p>For a while, I just looked down, enjoying the sight of Isolde’s tight body as she did her best to maintain her balance. Meanwhile, I continued examining her, watching the flickers of emotions on her beautiful face, cycling between various intensities of arousal and desire. </p><p>And any kind of shame was completely absent. </p><p>“Obedient slave,” I whispered as I caressed her cheek with my free hand. “Are you ready to serve your master?” </p><p>I had expected my choice of words to trigger her emotions, at least frustration if not anger. Her mouth parted open, showing that her emotions had been affected, but not in the direction I had expected. </p><p>Her face was filled with elation. “Yes, master,” she whispered, one that managed to reflect obedience and arousal at the same time. </p><p>Maybe I underestimated her desire for obedience. </p><p>“Excellent, and what does an obedient slave gets,” I said, giving her the option for a reward. </p><p>“Whatever her master desires,” she whispered back as she looked at me, amusingly not even flinching when Cinder passed close to us — who was no doubt annoyed at my lack of attention. </p><p>I ignored her, and stayed focused on Isolde, who certainly earned a reward. “Excellent answer,” I whispered as I slapped her beautiful breasts, making them sway freely in her nakedness. </p><p>She said nothing, just moaned, which didn’t stop even as I pushed her down harder, and her naked back hit the ground, hard. I knelled down next to her, my finger rapidly invading her core with a vengeance. </p><p>I considered teasing her softly, to test her determination to trust her ‘master’, but luckily for her, we were short in time — I didn’t trust Cinder to not act out as I neglected her, making Isolde’s reward a priority. </p><p>And what better reward than an explosive orgasm, I decided as I let my fingers drill into her core aggressively. She was not able to talk, but considering it was her moans was the thing that was blocking her words, assuming that she was enjoying her treatment wasn’t too difficult. </p><p>Isolde trembled in excitement as my fingers continued to invade her core, her nipples rock hard, pushing up as her back arched in pleasure. Cinder passed over us, even closer, and her flames were even more intense, brushing against my hair. </p><p>I was ready to cast a ward if necessary, of course, but the few flickers of flame that fell on my skin danced harmlessly, almost gleefully, making a defensive effort unnecessary. I leaned over Isolde, grabbing her breasts hard. </p><p>Her moans were quick to rise, only to intensify as I slapped her breasts to create some contrast. “You’re lucky you have such a good master,” I said as I changed my position, and soon, positioned myself between her legs, and pushed my head down. </p><p>It was time to reward her properly. </p><p>“Ohh,” she gasped as my tongue danced around her clit. “It’s too—“ she started, finally managing to speak once again, though it was interrupted before she could actually finish her sentence. </p><p>I chuckled even as I grabbed her thighs, forcing them wide enough that even with her flexibility, it was an uncomfortable experience. Of course, with her preference, such discomfort was nothing more than another bucket of water to her growing arousal. </p><p>She cried in desire, her eyes tightly shut, this time not even flinching as Cinder made another close pass. Unlike the previous attempts, she was fully lost in her growing pleasure under my tongue. </p><p>What an impressive focus. </p><p>I chuckled even as I treated Isolde. She was not the first lady I discovered at the Capital, the greatest bastion of light, with a submissive side — a position that was competed for by Emma and Aria depending on the benchmark —  nor she was the most shocking one — a position that was held firmly by the Queen — but she had her own unique twist. </p><p>None of the others liked the pure physical domination much, appreciating power in different, more abstract terms. </p><p>In contrast, Isolde loved the sheer physical pressure generated by my muscles, each touch pushing her deeper.  </p><p>When I pulled back and flipped her, my hand pressing her head against hard ground with only a layer of grass in between — shockingly thick thanks to Cinder’s influence — and slid my fingers in her core once again, she was already pushed to the edge of a climax, requiring only a touch to topple her over. </p><p>Which was good, as I had noticed Cinder finally coming down, still wrapped in flames, but even the head of the giant phoenix managed to reflect her annoyance.  </p><p>I decided to wait until she landed to decide how to take such a decision, and focused on bringing Isolde to completion. After all, the poor girl deserved her reward for not being spoiled at the last step. </p><p>“Someone is close to the end,” I whispered, which made her gasp scandalously, but that was all she was able to do as the climax hit, making her collapse under an endless rain of trembles.</p><p>But, before I could attend to her further, Cinder had already landed, her giant phoenix face turned to me, her jealousy clear…</p>
