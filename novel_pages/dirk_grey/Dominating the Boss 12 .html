        <p>“Oh, yes. To business,” Mike said as he pulled a piece of paper in front of him, failing to hide the depth of his enthusiasm in his tipsy state. “I was thinking that maybe we could restructure product categorization, then…” he added, giving a detailed breakdown for a new structure which would incidentally cause the size of his check to nearly double. I leaned back, watching him calmly as he explained his plans with great fervor. He seemed intent to bore me senseless. </p><p>Thankfully, the distinct sound of heels hitting the floor reached my ears, and I turned towards the corridor, only to see Tiffany as she stepped into the room, her swaying walk even more attractive when seen from the front, her breasts swaying with each step thanks to her lack of bra, her dress failing its task to brace her breasts. I deliberately kept my gaze on her as she closed in, ignoring yet another annoyed huff from Mike. It was his genius idea to soften me up through the attractiveness of his wife, and he had no ground to stand on when the strategy started to work through enthusiastic compliance of his wife. </p><p>“Another double,” she asked as she looked at me, with a tone far too gaspy to be natural. </p><p>I made of show of dipping my eyes down to examine her cleavage unashamedly for a couple of seconds, then raised back to look into the depths of her green eyes. Her eyes slid to her husband for a moment, her expression alight with vindication. I wondered just how angry Mike was. “Yes, a double sounds like an excellent idea,” I answered. I pushed the glasses towards her before Mike could countermand it, and then, watched with admiration as she filled them generously, the angle affording a great angle for me. “Back to work,” I said as I raised the glass up once more, inviting them to drink. </p><p>Mike looked less than pleased by the fact that he required drinking, but he still raised his glass to take a large sip. Of course, it was also likely that I was misreading his source of anger. His anger could easily be about me treating her wife like a piece of meat on display, or his wife doing her best to act like it. Whatever it was, it didn’t prevent him from drinking whenever I prompted him to drink as we continued to discuss the zoning assignments, and Tiffany just sat there in a way that alluded many sweet promises, looking sexy. The discussions took another fifteen minutes, and I managed to fill Mike’s glass twice more on that period, while I just sipped my drink. </p><p>“How about like this,” Mike slurred as he scribbled the map in front of him with his trembling hand, creating a circle that covered more than half of the available area, and approximately three-fourths of the revenue. It was such an outrageous distribution that had I actually tried to push it, the rest of the sales team would have quit instantly. Thankfully, I had no intention of humoring him at the end of the day. </p><p>“A bit too ambitious, isn’t it?” I countered as I draw a much-smaller circle that had a few large accounts we were struggling to maintain. It would have looked lucrative at first, but it was a death sentence. “This might be a better idea to leverage your skills, pitting you against a more challenging crop of clients. It’s a difficult group, but with equally impressive rewards. A salesman as impressive as you should have no problems handling it, right?” </p><p>The conflict on his face was amusing. On the one hand, not wanting to admit his inability to maintain unsatisfied clients, on the other hand, he didn’t want to get stuck with something like that. Luckily for him, his wife came to his aid. “Stephen,” she said as she stood up. In silence, she walked towards my side without saying anything, each step measured for maximum impact. I couldn’t help but breathe harder as she stood next to my side, closer than appropriate, her perfume tickling my nose. I knew it was intentional, but that fact didn’t blunt the impact of the moment. </p><p>She leaned on the table, which made her dress rode up in a way that revealed more of her delicious white flesh, begging for a bite. It also treated me with a glimpse of the red g-string she was wearing, flimsy enough to fall in its own accord. She pointed out the map, but no one in the room thought that where she pointing was the most important detail. “Maybe you should assign something less time consuming to my husband. I don’t want him always working too hard.” She turned to me, and winked suggestively. “I have needs, you know.” </p><p>“An excellent point,” I said as I pulled a chair closer. “I think it’s only fair if we also address your concerns. Why don’t you take a seat.” </p><p>Her expression flickered as she noted that the chair I suggested for her was practically connected to my own, but she was too deep in her ploy to pay that fact the attention it needed. And Mike must have started feeling the bite of alcohol, as he was busy looking at the map with a silly smirk rather than paying attention to the proximity of his wife with all its implied dangers. A rather important lack of foresight, I noted with a smirk. I used the opportunity to fill his glass once more, and returned discussion. </p><p>It didn’t take long for Tiffany to lose her stiffness. Soon, she returned her game to tease me, doing her best to ‘accidentally’ rub against me whenever she leaned forward to make a point on the map. It was enough, I decided after the fourth time she managed to smash my arm with her breasts, trying to abuse her perceived power over me and a lack of attention from her drunk husband. </p><p>I put one of my hands under the table, not bothering to hide what I was trying to do. Mike was too drunk to notice, and Tiffany was going to learn in a couple seconds nevertheless. I put my hand on her thigh, enjoying the way she flinched at the contact. There was a certain satisfaction in turning the tables on a woman while she was under the impression of holding all the cards. </p><p>Her wrist wrapped around mine in an instant, trying to push it away without making it obvious, but I kept my arm solid, in place. Moreover, I waited until Mike’s attention was fixed on creating another draft on the map, then leaned into her ear. “You pushed your luck too much, miss tease,” I murmured, enjoying the way she shivered as my breath fell on her earlobe. I slid my hand upward. “Now, it’s my time.” </p><p>“No,” she managed to whisper in shock despite her shock. </p><p>Mike spoke before I could answer. “Did you say something, honey,” he said without raising his head from the map. </p><p>“You must have misheard, honey,” she said under my warning glare. Mike returned to his task. </p><p>“Good girl,” I whispered into her ear once more. “Now, we’re going to play a little game, or tomorrow your husband might not have a job. It would be a pity to lose such a beautiful house just because you can’t afford the mortgage payment.” </p><p>It was a delight to watch her self-confidence evaporate, leaving its place to disbelief. But even that wasn’t long-lived as my hand slowly climbed upward on her leg, draining away, leaving its place to a trembling surrender. “Excellent,” I said loudly as my fingers passed the border that her dress created. Mike raised his head, a proud smile adorning his drunken face, thinking that my comment had something to do with his latest map. I just filled his glass once more before turning my full attention back to his young wife, leaving him with his distracted doodling. </p><p>And what a deserving target she was, I noted as I slid my hands upward, finding the edge of the small triangle which her g-string relied on to cover her sexiest place. And to my surprise, I discovered the sopping wetness of that small triangle piece. It seemed that I wasn’t the only one that was feeling the excitement of the situation. And from the shocked expression on her face, I guessed that she was surprised by the arousal she was feeling from being molested in front of her husband, </p><p>Her shock was barely a reason for me to change anything in the way I act, of course. I softly dragged my fingers over the silky fabric, which might as well be invisible, barely containing her warmth in its soaked stage. Her eyes widened, but she managed to maintain her silence under the assault, and I managed to maintain things despite the challenge she was feeling. </p><p>But her silence meant little. We were just at the opening stages of the game. I answered another inane question from Mike even as my fingers twisted, pushing her panties out of the way, leaving her gentle folds without protection. They danced in the new field they discovered, drenching themselves with her juices. As they danced, her face started to shift to a tone closer to her hair. </p><p>It was enough playing, I decided, and slid two of my fingers inside her. Her walls barely resisted in their soaked state, allowing me to start a journey to discover her weak spots. But of course, it was just a beginning. First, I reached my belt, and a brief struggle later, my shaft was free. A glance was enough to convey my request. Her hand hovered in indecision as she looked at the weapon I just revealed, intimidated by its size. </p><p>Normally, I would have pushed her to start working as soon as possible, but I had other plans on the work. I leveraged her distraction to reach to my phone, and started to record a video with the camera facing us, for two reasons. First, it was always good to immortalize such a moment. Second, it would be handy to have a recording in case she tried to create problems by trying to misrepresent the situation. </p><p>The camera was recording when her delicate fingers wrapped around my shaft, gently dancing up and down. The angle was horrible, no doubt missing a great amount of action, but it was good enough for documenting the intent of the situation. It would be interesting to show that particular recording to Mike in a later date, when he managed to annoy me even more than he had managed to do. </p><p>I would have liked to have a chance to further adjust the camera, to make sure the recording was also enjoyable in its artistic merits, but each second increased my risk of getting caught. And I doubted that even her current mixture of trying to annoy her husband while also trying to protect his work would be enough to accept being recorded. So, I dropped the phone from my hand, and turned my attention back to the one that most deserved it. </p><p>Tiffany was trying to open her eyes when another twist of my fingers managed to steal her breath explosively, her sweet voice echoing in my ears, its intensity making me question the last time she had experienced a man’s touch. At least, a competent one, as I was willing to bet that Mike was one of the guys who classified a sloppy kiss followed by a minute of frantic pushing as satisfactory performance. Something his wife no doubt disagreed, if her shocked cry for to my skilled touch was any indicator. Her eyes opened wide when she realized that she had been loud enough to rouse her husband from his drunken stupor. </p><p>I could feel her stiffen under my touch in panic, her hand steel around my wrist as she tried to push my hand away. But I kept it there, because I could see that Mike was too deep into the domination of the alcohol to notice the nature of her enthusiastic cry. “Is something wrong,” he asked a second later as his eyes drooped down in his alcohol-laden exhaustion, validating my assumption. </p><p>“Nothing!” she managed to say, the way her cry turned into another heated moan not exactly helpful for her case, but her husband missed another clue of his humiliation. She sent a warning glare to my way, but I greeted it with a mocking smile. </p><p>“Really,” Mike slurred in exhaustion. He paused a second, making Tiffany even more alert, which I could read from the way she clamped around my fingers. But it was an empty worry, as Mike’s struggle to find the right words was enough to distract him from noticing more important details; like the way her nipples tried to cut free of her dress and the way she pressed her lips together to hide her moans. </p><p>“It’s a bit uncomfortable,” she explained in a hurried gasp, unable to separate her arousal from invading her voice. </p><p>I decided to cut in. “It must be the chair,” I explained. “It’s not exactly comfortable. Here, let me help.” And just like that, I pulled my hand from its snug resting place, and wrapped it around her waist. Her eyes popped up in shock, but it was just a beginning. I tugged her hard, in perfect alignment with my shaft. She tried to turn towards me, but it was already too late. With my arms around her waist, there was no escape for her. I pulled her down, lodging my shaft deep inside her. It was a good thing that I had already warmed her up with my fingers, otherwise, it would be impossible for her to keep her voice down. Even then, it was a small miracle for her to keep it contained. </p><p>“What the hell!” Mike slurred, his anger at my sudden closeness with his wife managing to break his passive stupor. Thankfully, he kept sitting, as there would have been no hiding if he actually bothered to stand up. I doubted that, even in his half-blind state, he would miss the fact that I was impaling his wife in front of him. </p><p>“Come on Mike,” I said conversationally. “It’s just joking around between work friends, right? Not really a big deal.” I let my eyes fall on the papers he had been painstakingly working on for the last several minutes, long enough that even in his drunken state he had caught the insinuation. Though how he missed what was going on with his wife while catching my gaze told a lot about his priorities. “But if you are willing to be a party pooper…”</p><p>But, while he might be unaware of what was going on underneath the table, that still left the problem of his ‘boss’ openly molesting his wife in front of him. He was frozen in indecision, something that hadn’t slipped from Tiffany’s attention. I decided to act, not wanting to waste even a second of the amazing experience I was having. I steeled my grip around her waist, and started pumping. </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I could see that her expression, which could be described as freaked out, but it somehow passed Mike’s muster during his introspection. Maybe he missed it completely, or maybe he assumed that it was her response to suddenly finding herself on the lap of a stranger. Regardless, he continued his silent assessment of for the response he was about to give, and I continued fucking his wife in front of him… And longer the silence stretched, harder it became for him to give an actual answer. </p><p>He reached for his glass to give a reason for his silence. A glass that had been filled to a brim. And with his tastebuds deadened with the excessive amount he already consumed, he carelessly gulped it down, treating his high-proof drink like water. “It’s a bit inappropriate,” he murmured pathetically in the end. “It feels like crossing a boundary,” he answered after he placed his glass down, but he said that in a weak, trembling voice. </p><p>“Whatever you wish, man,” I answered as I loosened my grip around Tiffany’s waist, allowing her to stand up. Tiffany started raising herself, but instead of pulling away completely, But, to my surprise, instead of pulling away completely, she slammed herself back across my length, swallowing the full length. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one that was surprised by Mike’s slow response. And unlike my reaction, she was decidedly unhappy about it, reflected by her preferred method of revenge. </p><p>“Come on, dear,” Tiffany answered with a thin layer of sweetness that failed to hide the venom below even as her hips started to grind my lap, pushing my shaft even deeper, but like most of the subtext, Mike had managed to miss that as well. “Like we have talked in the kitchen, there isn’t any harm in a bit of playful teasing, is there?” </p><p>Mike had fallen silent once again, caught flatfooted by the source of the resistance. And my unlikely ally’s statement worked wonders. “It wasn’t exactly what I had in mind,” Mike spat back, but his gaze had fallen on the table document, avoiding her gaze. The last glass that he had consumed was starting to take its toll. </p><p>“And what did you have in mind?” Tiffany countered even as she raised herself up in her seat, her walls caressing my shaft gently, her face painted with vindication. It was Mike’s mistake, angering his redheaded wife to a point where she delighted the opportunity to cheat him just a couple of feet away. </p><p>“I don’t know…” Mike murmured, his words lingering into nothing, misreading her outrage completely, but still cowed by it. He closed his eyes. At first, I had thought that he was trying to compile an answer, but then he put his hands on his temples, suggesting that it was the effects of all the drinks he had consumed, slowly squeezing consciousness out of him. </p><p>And a few seconds later, he finally decided to put his head on the table, surrendering in his rigged battle against booze, removing the last restriction I had been under. I leaned to Tiffany’s ear, who was watching her husband’s last gem of action with shocked eyes, and whispered. “About time, now we can really cut loose.” </p><p>My hands were already traveling as I whispered those words, so it wasn’t a surprise when one of my hands found her breasts before she could say anything, treating myself with the first grasp of her supple flesh. She opened her mouth in shock to react, finally realizing that we were well-past a dangerous point, but she had one mistake. She had lost track of where my other hand was. A mistake that she had realized quite harshly when I grabbed the knot that was holding her together. All it took was one insistent tug for her dress to slide down, revealing her chest bare. </p><p>I was ready for her panicked cry, so I pressed my hand on her lips the moment she opened her mouth, muffling her cry. Moreover, I used the opportunity to push even deeper inside her, her breasts tangling attractively in front of me. “You should be careful,” I commented, in a tone a shade above a whisper. “You don’t want your dear husband to wake up, do you?”</p><p>“No,” she answered softly when I pulled off her hand as well. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I shifted my hand from her lips to her hair, roughly grabbing her red strands, slamming into her repeatedly. And from the way her body was responding, I was willing to bet that her objections had fallen onto wayside under the pleasure of the moment.</p><p>As minutes passed, I could feel my need for a  climax growing. I was struck with a desire to fill her up. But, even with my current success in controlling her, I doubted that I could just risk impregnating her without earning her explosive ire. Then, my eyes fell on Mike, his head pressed on his arms as he tried to combat his drunken vertigo, unaware of what was happening. I remembered the small discussion I had with the neighborhood gossip about their attempts to have a child. </p><p>Until now, Mike had been the perfect idiot to push my agenda. And in his drunken state, there was no reason for him not to generate even more impressive pearls of failure. “By the way, Mike,” I asked, ignoring the way Tiffany stiffened with fear on my lap. It was a rightful fear considering her state of dress. Or more accurately, the lack of it.  </p><p>“Yesss,” Mike murmured from his mental place between consciousness and unconsciousness. But he kept his head on the table, therefore missing the fact that his wife was jumping up and down on my lap. </p><p>“Are you guys planning to have children,” I asked, smirking at Tiffany when she twisted her neck to face me, but still continuing her treatment on my shaft. </p><p>“We’re trying,” he mumbled. </p><p>“No result yet?” I asked mockingly. “Is there anything wrong with you?” </p><p>“Of course not,” he answered sharply, and tried to raise his head, but his drunken vertigo was too strong. “My swimmers are strong. But I suspect that bitch is taking birth control pills.” </p><p>Jackpot, I thought as I saw Tiffany’s face alight with anger. Rejecting to go to the doctor for fertility issues was bad enough, but blaming his wife for it, even in his drunken state, was a touch too far. “Perfect timing,” I whispered into her ear. “I’m just about to release. Do you want to prove him wrong?” </p><p>It was a horrible decision, but the cacophony of emotions she was under was designed perfectly to encourage horrible decision making. After a second’s pause, her lips parted open ominously, and whispered two words. “Go ahead.” </p><p>I didn’t need a second prompting. My grip around her waist tightened, locking her in place, and I started spraying her insides with my seed, which, combined with the significance of the moment, managed to trigger a rather explosive orgasm in her as well, and we shuddered in harmony. </p><p>I only pulled out after spraying all of my seed inside her, earning a catlike purr of her. “Is there a taxi I can call,” I said. “It’s going to be late.” </p><p>She looked at me angrily, but mollified after seeing my smirk and my implied teasing. “You don’t expect me to sleep alone after this, do you?” she asked. </p><p>“You want me to help you carry Mike upstairs?” I asked. </p><p>“Funny,” she snarked before standing up on her tiptoes, and put a heated kiss on my lips. “Come on,” she said as she grabbed my hand. “I realized, as a hostess, I’m in remiss, not giving you a tour of the house. Come on…” </p><p>I followed her, enjoying the amazing view, rather compounded by the fact that her sexy dress had bunched up in the middle, acting like a thick belt while leaving her body naked. I had a feeling that the next stop was going to be a ride to remember...</p>
