        <title>Darion's Office 36</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Darion was in his janitor's office, resting. Not the most beautiful location, but strangely, he was warming up to the location. It was not the cleanest of the location, but it was silent. </p><p>And, he appreciated the silence. </p><p>His new office was fun, and his new coworkers were just the right mixture of sexy and submissive, with just the right touch of gullibility, but even he needed his rest. </p><p>Not for long, but some. </p><p>Which was why, when he heard the door open, he turned toward there with an annoyed expression, ready to admonish … when he saw someone he didn’t expect. Gina, the rival of his boss and fake girlfriend. </p><p>He was about to kick her out, but he didn’t do so for two reasons. First, he didn’t want to ruin things for his fake girlfriend — especially when the alternative was to make her owe him even more. </p><p>Second, the delicious cleavage Gina had was enough to earn his momentary attention. “I didn’t expect you to find here,” Gina said. “It’s so rude for Mia to use you like a worker for her work. It’s so rude of her.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” Darion said, unable to hold back his smirk as he stood up. “And, I’m guessing you treat your boyfriends better.” </p><p>Her expression twisted. “Nice attempt, but I wouldn’t touch anything second-hand from that whore, not even a man as fine as you,” Gina said, dismissing his words before they could even start landing. If he were being honest, he liked that attitude better…</p><p>But only because he could already smell an opportunity to turn the tables. </p><p>“And, what do I owe the pleasure of your visit, then?” Darion answered. </p><p>“Well, just because I wouldn’t touch you doesn’t mean I can’t make you a fun offer. I need a new head of security in my company, which is a cushy job with little responsibilities. You might be interested in that.” </p><p>Darion smiled wider. “Let me guess. Only if  I can bring Madam Paisley as a customer,” he said.</p><p>She chuckled. “I love working with smart people. Exactly.” </p><p>Darion let his smile widen. “Well, I appreciate the offer, but it wouldn’t work. A new work is nice, but I like my fun. And, it’s hard to match Mia when it comes to that. So, unless you’re volunteering…” </p><p>Gina smiled widely. “Why don’t you come to my club tonight and we can see whether I can entertain you more than Mia,” she said before she turned and left, leaving him alone. </p><p>He had to admit, she knew how to make an exit. </p><p>Now, all he needed to see was whether she knew how to entertain guests as well.</p><p>*** </p><p>Gina was on the piano, playing one of the more challenging pieces, when the door to her club opened, her guest arriving. He walked toward the main scene, but his dismissive glance as Gina played the piano was enough to show her that he didn’t know much about fine arts. </p><p>Not that it surprised Gina. Mia had always been weak to a nice body … and if Gina was being honest, Darion had one of the finest ones she had ever seen. </p><p>“If that’s the entertainment you prepared, I shouldn’t even bother sitting,” Darion said, not bothering to hide his dismissive glance toward her piano. Ironically, Gina appreciated that. She had met with many men who knew exactly as much about classical music, yet somehow believed themselves smart enough that they could hide the fact. </p><p>Gina loved to mock such men until they crumbled. At least, Darion didn’t bother with that nonsense and was confident enough to show his dislike. Of course, she might have reacted differently if it wasn’t for his importance … but then, this was life. </p><p>Never fair. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about it. This is just the background, the real fun is about to arrive,” she said. And, to her surprise took the clue, and appeared on the door. </p><p>Aisha, her loyal bartender owed her a lot of money, and was willing to work hard to cover that debt. Even if that work was to keep Mia’s boyfriend happy. </p><p>“Your entertainment is here,” Gina said as she gestured, and Darion turned toward her. </p><p>“Much better,” he said. </p><p>“Exactly. Just to look, of course, but if you’re willing to help me—“ Gina started, only for Darion to cut her off. </p><p>“Nonsense,” he said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” Gina replied, unable to keep her frown off her face. </p><p>“Well, you can’t expect me to accept a deal before a test run. Give me a twirl, sweetie,” Darion said. </p><p>Gina frowned, but before she could say anything, Aisha already followed his direction. </p><p>Weak girl. Gina swallowed her words, not willing to weaken her position any further as she saw Darion walk toward her bartender. </p><p>“Now, beautiful, why don’t you show me exactly how you plan to entertain me,” he started. </p><p>“Well, I have a dance prepared—“ Aisha started, only to be cut when Darion grabbed her hair and twisted her. </p><p>“Nonsense. I’m sure a pretty girl like you could come up with a more clever solution.” </p><p>Gina frowned as she watched the show, wondering if she could intervene. But, as he pushed Aisha against the piano, a glance was enough to confirm that Aisha already surrendered, and was enthusiastic about what was about to follow. </p><p>Weak slut. </p><p>“Well, I have a bedroom attached if you want to use it,” Gina answered. </p><p>“Nonsense. I have no intention of your beautiful music,” he said, his expression mocking. “Unless you’re scared, of course,” he followed, and Gina found herself reaching for her phone. </p><p>She wasn’t the kind that would retreat from a challenge. </p><p>Especially if that challenge came from the boyfriend of that whore Mia. </p>
