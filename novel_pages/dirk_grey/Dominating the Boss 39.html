        <p>I had a bounce on my steps as I walked through a mostly empty corridor, a jump in my steps after a quick nap. It was not my habit to have regular naps, but I decided to make an exception for the day.</p><p>Umi was fun and exhausting, and while returning, Brenda did her best to exhaust me further as well, feeling jealous of my attention. She assumed — rightfully — that my attention was a fleeting commodity, and decided to work hard to keep it on. </p><p>Though, I had to admit that she had the instincts for it. Another girl might have just tried to follow up with more sex, but she followed up with a long tease only, doing her best to leave me wanting for more, only to abandon me once we arrived at the shore, dragging Umi away. </p><p>Not before taking my credit card with her — one with a limit that I found acceptable, I was not a moron — while promising she would give her new bestie a makeover. </p><p>I might have kept her back, but considering it was still morning, I decided to let her go, and instead went for a nap. </p><p>I had a feeling that it would be a long day. </p><p>I was distracted as I walked, not expecting anything to happen, which turned out to be an erroneous assumption. </p><p>Which came in the form of a hand — a beautiful, carefully manicured hand — suddenly grabbing my arm and pulling me to a small room. The pull wasn’t strong enough to pull me in if I resisted, but the hand that grabbed me was familiar enough for me to allow that. </p><p>Tiffany, the busty redheaded wife of my most annoying employee. </p><p>“How can I help you, sweetie?” I chuckled even as I looked around while the door closed behind me, only to realize that I was in one of the smaller conference rooms the hotel kept for other events, and it was currently empty. </p><p>Her frustrated expression was very beautiful. “I didn’t expect to you break your promise,” she whispered petulantly. </p><p>It was theatrical petulance, evident by the way her pouty lips curled excessively, making her look more like a spoiled college girl — which, I had to admit, worked excellently, especially combined with her beautiful white summer dress. </p><p>Before asking that question, I let my gaze linger down, taking note of her incredible allure. </p><p>With her amazing curves, she was already beautiful, but the way her dress barely hang onto her body with one of the straps skewed — looked accidental, but considering the dress just dipped down enough to reveal the edge of her bra while providing an excellent view of her cleavage, arranged very carefully. </p><p>The shortness of her dress was further enhanced by the way her skirt was folded up on the right, giving me a glimpse of her beautiful, legs fully, but this time ending just before I get a glimpse of her underwear. </p><p>She was prepared very carefully. </p><p>“Tell me, honey, how did I break my promise?” I said as I raised my gaze to her face. </p><p>She trembled under my attention, but her smile got hungrier. “We were supposed to go shopping, but you chose to gallivant with your newest toy instead.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Are you frustrated that I didn’t invite you?” I asked, which earned a frustrated growl. </p><p>“Maybe,” she admitted. “Especially since you chose that whore Brenda instead. I didn’t know you had such high standards, maybe we should rethink our whole arrangement —“ she said, but she was unable to finish her words as I cut her off. I wasn’t in the mood to listen to what kind of beef she had with Brenda. </p><p>I leaned forward, capturing her lips even as I pushed her against the wall. Her lips widened, allowing my tongue to slip inside even as my hands landed on her hips, slipping under her dress to enjoy the feeling of her naked hips once more. </p><p>It might not have been long since I tasted those hips, but the sensation was still spectacular. </p><p>I stretched the merciless kiss for a minute, and when I pulled back, her makeup was thoroughly mussed. “You were saying,” I whispered as I looked at her blushing face. “It felt like you were trying to control who was I spending my company with, but that must be wrong. Certainly, you’re smarter than that.”</p><p>“I …” she murmured dazedly, her words hard to find in her haze, and my hands still mauling her ass making it harder for her to recover. “I wasn’t trying to control you. I just wondered why are you spending your time with … such a low-class person,“ she said. </p><p>I was amused, as she was talking about someone that was almost her copy, from the looks, attitude, and even the submissive machiavellian streak. The only difference was that Brenda was betraying her boss, while Tiffany was betraying her husband — which was hardly a comparison that put Brenda in a worse place. </p><p>But, since I was not an utter and complete moron, I mentioned none of those details. Dominance didn’t mean one could act recklessly, one must always be aware of what to say. And, to someone like Tiffany, any comparison to Brenda where she came as inferior was one of the taboo topics. </p><p>Luckily, there were many interesting ways to handle that. </p><p>“Oh, that’s big talk from you. Are you sure?” I asked enjoying her thoughtful expression. “Maybe you should show me that.” She threw a glance toward the door, particularly toward the key that allowed her to lock the door. “But, if you’re afraid that you can’t handle the risk of getting caught—“ I continued, only to be interrupted by a push to my shoulder. </p><p>“I’ll show you who can’t handle it,” she said as she pushed me toward a chair. Not the nearest one, but one that was positioned in a way that would be hard to see from the entrance, giving her a chance to hide under the table. </p><p>A nice thoughtful trick. I let that pass. </p><p>“Daring. You’re not afraid of people coming and find us here. It would be quite a scandal.” </p><p>“Of course not,” she answered, her smirk merciless. “After all, my dear husband was very insistent that I needed to flirt with you and earn your goodwill. As a good wife, it’s my role to listen to him. He’s the one that needs to think about possible blowback.” </p><p>I doubted that her idiot husband was imagining her slowly undressing me to blow me, and certainly not in a conference room anyone might walk in, but I didn’t bother saying that, more interested in watching her fingers pulling down my bermuda shorts. </p><p>“Oh, you’re already here,”  she whispered as she looked at my erection, acting surprised. Maintaining one was certainly not hard, not with the angle I was able to look down her dress, cleavage further enhanced as the dress slipped. </p><p>Her fingers wrapped around my shaft, slowly dancing up and down. “Well, but let’s make sure I’ll stay there,” I said as I leaned forward, my hand lightning fast as I took off her bra, and her dress slipped down, even more, to leave her tits completely naked. </p><p>“It’s a bit risky—“ she gasped in panic, but under my gaze, she nodded. She turned a bit, making sure the table was blocking her enough to hide her in case someone burst in, then turned back. “Just like I love,” she continued, her growing smile showing it wasn’t entirely inaccurate. </p><p>“Good,” I said. “Then we don’t have anything stopping you from starting.” </p><p>She started fast. She moved forward slightly,  her tits trapping my erection in between while her lips landed on top, her suction force incredible. Occasionally, she stopped to give a lick along the side, making it even sexier for my enjoyment. </p><p>I let her work as I crossed my hands behind my back, about to enjoy the sensation, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from Brenda. </p><p>Curious, I checked. It was a selfie, with Brenda hugging Umi from behind, and they were in a dressing room. Umi was blushing furiously, which was understandable considering neither was wearing a stitch. Umi managed to hide her core by crossing her legs, while the task of hiding her breasts was left one of Brenda’s arms hugging from behind, the other holding the phone.  </p><p>An amazing photo, even without including the mirror that reflected Brenda’s ass perfectly. </p><p>“That’s rude,” Tiffany growled as she looked up. </p><p>“Well, you need to work harder to keep my attention—“ I started, only for a click to come from the door. Someone was coming in.  </p><p>Her eyes widened in shock as she hid under the table, while I pulled the chair forward, enough to hide the fact that I was naked halfway. </p><p>The door opened, and Natalie entered, and following her was a young woman that I didn’t recognize, but looked somewhat familiar. </p><p>She was a beautiful woman, brunette, with a soft face, but her sharp smile contrasted that, almost vindictive. Her body was not as soft, but it wasn’t the bony, unattractive hardness, but a sportive kind of hardness that implied endless hours in the gym. </p><p>“Hey, Nathan, why are you here?” she asked, surprised. </p><p>“I’m having an emergency call with a client,” I said, showing my phone which was already in hand. “Work never ends, you know,” I said. “So, who’s your guest.”</p><p>“You don’t remember me?” she asked, frustration clear in her tone. </p><p>Normally, I wouldn’t have cared that much, but I was familiar enough with Natalie to know she wouldn’t have panicked for no reason. “Of course not, how could I forget you,” I said with a teasing smile. “I was just teasing you.” </p><p>Her expression softened, showing that she believed it. Meanwhile, I was desperately trying to remember who was she. </p>
