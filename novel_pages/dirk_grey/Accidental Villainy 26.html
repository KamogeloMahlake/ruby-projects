        <p>“I need to go shopping. I want you to stay here in your costume, and be ready to take my calls, while you dig that tunnel I asked of you, alright?” I asked. “And, don’t throw the dirt until we can find a way to get rid of it, alright?” </p><p>I only received a muffled response, no words, which might have been annoying, if the reason wasn’t the way her lips wrapped around my girth, giving me a beautiful morning blowjob in the shower. </p><p>It was already morning, and after a nice sleep, I was rested. So was my power, ready to face the new day. </p><p>I said nothing else as I let her finish her task, enjoying the warm water dancing over my body, trying — and failing — to compile my shopping list. Only after I exploded into her mouth, and left her alone in the shower after a gentle kiss to her temple I gathered enough of my mental faculties to do so. </p><p>The first objective was the renovation, but I wanted to hide it as long as possible, meaning the tunnel needed to be completed before we could start that part. </p><p>The second objective was the temporary security devices of better quality, which I needed to visit various shops to purchase directly while leaving Tara behind, using the cameras to keep observing the area. But, for that, I could visit later. </p><p>The last, and the most important, objective was the message I had just received. Thanks to my power, I knew that whoever wrote the message believed the truth of the situation … but that didn’t mean that it was actually the truth. It might just be the ploy of a villain to trigger someone to target the guild. </p><p>And, even if that was the truth — while I didn’t expect the guilds to actually kidnap and imprison people, I didn’t trust them enough to categorically reject it — that didn’t mean there was only one message. She might have dropped several such messages. </p><p>And, some of them might have been intercepted by the guild, meaning that the so-called stash might be already emptied. </p><p>Or worse, under observation. </p><p>I had no intention of visiting that particular junkyard to poke around a potential trap. I had enough problems already. </p><p>However, there was one important problem. I couldn’t say the same for the guild headquarters itself. Oh, I wanted to do so, intensely, but after somehow introducing myself as a trusted agent of a mysterious villain, I couldn’t just assume I would always fly out of their control. </p><p>No, I needed to at least get a glimpse of the place from a distance, to see if my power could provide me with some kind of advantage. </p><p>Then, I left the bar, realizing I needed to make one more purchase, a vehicle. I went and used a bus, acting like I didn’t notice several people that were following me, some amateur, some with a decent amount of skill … one even using a distant drone. </p><p>None was able to avoid my attention. I let them follow me as I went and purchased a bike, a racing one with a decent engine. It was a conscious choice, and, ironically, more secure for my circumstances. An accident was riskier on a bike, but a bike was far more responsive to adjustments than a car. </p><p>It worked better with my power. With that, I drove downtown, going around and handling the other shopping requirements — while also making sure to check the security cameras around the bar constantly so as not to let Tara down. </p><p>The purchase of security equipment and other necessities went quickly, especially since they were not the real set of equipment, but a temporary set. </p><p>No harm in adding some extra security, especially since I wasn’t hurting for money and could easily repurpose the equipment. I didn’t bother hiding those purchases, and acted like I didn’t notice the presence of all but most incompetent tails. </p><p>Yet, even when I noticed them, I deliberately acted fearless, as if I was daring them to act. It seemed to be enough to keep them scared. </p><p>I hoped it would be the status as usual. </p><p>I just didn’t believe it. </p><p>When I arrived back at the bar, Tara was in the corridor, patting herself down to clean her hero costume — which she wore to make sure she would be ready for an incursion — to greet me. From her expression, it was clear that she had good news for me. </p><p>“How’s the tunnel going?” I asked instead of directly inquiring about it, not wanting to ruin her enthusiasm. It would have been a jerk move, especially against someone as naive and eager as her.</p><p>“I made great progress, sir,” she said, her smile bigger than I had ever seen outside the bedroom — well, any sexual situation, really. </p><p>“Really, show me,” I said as I followed her. First, the location of the tunnel was nice. Hidden at the back of my office, behind a bulky wardrobe. The tunnel itself was both large and well-designed, even with some handles for me to grab. </p><p>And, after I climbed down, I found a basement, one that wasn’t supposed to be in place according to the plans. “Oh, interesting,” I said as I looked around. The walls looked strong as well, but there were no doors. The original owner probably designed it as a personal shelter — a reasonable precaution — but covered it up while selling as it wasn’t in the original plans. </p><p>Digging underneath a building without official permission and creating the risk of a collapse probably had more fines attached to it than the building was worth at this point, so, altogether, a smart idea. </p><p>Also, while the basement was nothing more than empty concrete walls — except the small pile of fresh dirt and rubble, and another tunnel, this time moving straight out —it was clean. Too clean, like an industrial operation had just gone through. </p><p>Super cleaning for the win. </p><p>Yet, as I watched her expression, I could see that this was not her surprise. Interesting. “Lead the way,” I ordered. She went into the tunnel, a flashlight in hand as she moved deeper into the tunnel. Thirty meters, and a slight slope downward, we met another concrete wall. </p><p>Much thicker. </p><p>“It looks like some kind of sever, sir. I didn’t breach it, but we could use it to move around safely.” </p><p>“And you waited to see to return before breaching?” I asked. She nodded, though a slight hesitance entered to her expression as she didn’t realize whether I was praising or giving her problems. “Good girl,” I said, and her smile was back, even bigger. </p><p>I certainly didn’t want to punish her for being cautious. That was how bad habits developed. </p><p>“Good, dig around a bit more, and let’s see if we have a way to peek into what was going on without breaching. </p><p>She grabbed a large metal sheet that she had been using as a shovel — which looked unwieldy but worked excellently with her strength, allowing her to move almost fifty pounds of dirt with every swipe … which would take at least an hour for an experienced worker without modern machinery. </p><p>I found what I had been looking for after ten meters, a large crack, enough to give us a view of what was going on. </p><p>Her assumption was correct. It was sever, but the lack of water — and thankfully smell — suggested that it hadn’t been used for a long time. However, when I peered inside, I saw a soft artificial light rather than the expected darkness. </p><p>Meaning, we weren’t the only ones to discover. “Don’t make any noise,” I said as I put one of the new cameras to the crack and covered it, over with a thin layer of dirt, enough to cut the light, extending the wire. </p><p>I was glad that it was wired, as wireless cameras were much easier to detect, especially underground, where there was supposed to be no signal. “Good girl, you earned a reward for tonight,” I said, which made her smile like I promised her a car. </p><p>However, rather than taking that into place, I stayed underground, directing her to create another tunnel that ran in the opposite direction, one that led to another abandoned building — my power allowing me to measure and track our exact locations so I wouldn’t just appear in the middle of a street. </p><p>Even better, it had a basement, but not a hidden one, but with actual stairs. </p><p>“Try to pull that pile closer, and spread out a bit of rubble here…” I said, ordering Tara around as she moved a lot of items to make sure the exit was concealed, piling most of the dirt to the basement in a dedicated pattern shoo that, unless someone was trying their best</p><p>Then, I set up another camera, this time wireless, to make sure I could watch the main entrance. </p><p>And, just like that, we had a little secret entrance that could be used to move around secretly. “Excellent work, my beautiful,” I said as I kissed her on the lips, ignoring the dust that covered her skin. Even with powers, construction was not clean work. </p><p>I went back to my room, and a quick shower later, I was looking for my wardrobe, trying to come up with a disguise that would keep me hidden. </p><p>I had no intention of letting the villains notice I was observing the strongest guild of the city. That felt like a recipe for disaster.</p>
