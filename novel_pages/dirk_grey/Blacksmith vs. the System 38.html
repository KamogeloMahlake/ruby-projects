        <p>For the second trip, I didn’t destroy the cart completely. While it was a good way to get some extra iron, it would be suspicious if I brought back every single one with significant damage. </p><p>Instead, I spent some time reforging the parts. There were several thick metal bands, which I melted and reforged with a stone core. It was too much effort for something that could be purchased for three copper coins, but the opportunity cost was too critical. </p><p>Only after I was finished with the cart and arrived at the second floor, I actually absorbed my newest skill. My first real magical one. </p><p>[Fire Bolt (Basic) - 1]</p><p>Did I expect it to be useful in any kind of combat situation? Not particularly. Basic skills were basic for a reason. But, I was sure that it would be situationally useful during my smithing. The ability to reheat the metal locally, for example, could be really useful. </p><p>But, the real objective was to give me an idea of how to use mana. </p><p>I was tempted to start playing with it immediately, but I managed to hold myself back until I arrived at the third floor, afraid that someone would stumble upon me. Throwing fire bolts around was not exactly a good way of progressing. </p><p>Still, before trying it for the first time, I made sure to clean my surroundings. I didn’t want to be interrupted. With that, I looked at a rock thirty feet away, opened my hand, and triggered the skill. </p><p>The first time using a new skill was always weird, and it had been even more true for the fire bolt. The mana burst out of my hand, with an intensity I could have never imagined. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>I tensed even as I felt the mana take shape in my hand, rotating and transforming in a complicated pattern that I couldn’t begin to understand. I had already assumed that the mana blow was complicated. Watching my mana reshape under the control of the skill was nothing less than a true miracle. </p><p>A fire appeared from nothingness and collided against the rock with an eerie precision. </p><p>Well, at least, it was the perspective of my scientist side. </p><p>From a tactical perspective, it was just garbage. It took almost ten seconds for me to channel the spell. It consumed a truly ridiculous amount of mana, and for all of it, I had nothing to show but a projectile attack that moved slower than an ordinary arrow, which could easily be dodged. </p><p>I was glad that I hadn’t wasted a skill slot for Ice Blast the day before. </p><p>Of course, its tactical uselessness meant nothing. I could already imagine a dozen different ways I could use it for my experiments. But first, I needed to push it to the limit and see if I could glean any insights that I could apply to my sword attack. </p><p>My first instinct was to stop and see if I could modify the skill somewhat. With the perks from multiple skills allowing me to interact with mana, it felt like a worthwhile experiment to run. However, I still remembered how trying to do that with Meditation blew on my face. </p><p>“Maybe not now,” I muttered even as I searched for another monster. After a few quick takedowns followed by absorption, I was ready to cast again. A few more times, I targeted my skill at the rocks, but there had been no improvement. </p><p>Just like any other skill, it required a lot of repetition. Unfortunately, unlike other skills, every repeat required a lengthy pause as I refilled my mana. Luckily, it took less than five minutes to hunt the necessary monsters and absorb them. </p><p>Before the perks, filling my Mana reserves took closer to half an hour. </p><p>The next step was to target the monsters, but I wasn’t in a hurry to do that. I wasn’t able to even walk while trying to cast the spell, and ten seconds was too long to deal with the monsters. Instead, I stopped by my temporary forge, dropped the new batch of iron I had brought with me, and changed into the anti-corrosive set. </p><p>Even then, I didn’t attack a monster immediately, but searched for a specific opponent. </p><p>What I was looking for was one of the creatures with the ranged attack. I cleaned their immediate surroundings and used the shield to block their attack, which gave me the leisurely ten seconds I had required. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>[Fire Bolt (Basic) - 1 -&gt; 6]</p><p>“Wow, that’s a nice jump,” I muttered. Targeting stronger monsters always helped, not to mention improving basic skills was easier than their better variants. “Now, let’s see what changed.” </p><p>Another attempt, once again targeting a ranged monster. This time, the spell gathered faster, something like eight seconds, not to mention flew faster and burned brighter. A nice range of benefits, though mostly incremental. </p><p>A few more repeats and I soon reached the improvement limit. </p><p>[Fire Bolt (Basic) - 23 -&gt; 25]</p><p>The casting time had dropped to just below five seconds, which was barely enough to attack the giant beasts. I tried that just to be on the safe side, but it didn’t go up. </p><p>It turned out that people were right about the limits of the Basic skills. Worse, there was no Perk. </p><p>A pity. An extra perk would have been useful. </p><p>Once it reached the limit, I decided to test a few other things. I wasn’t able to move while casting, because it was somewhat anchored in the air. However, my experience with the camouflage ring showed that such requirements were rather arbitrary. </p><p>But, breaking it was a mission for another time. At first, I attempted interrupting spells. It was not as hard as I feared. Nothing like the disaster reversing the meditation technique had triggered. It was easiest when I interrupted once I let out all the mana, but interrupting halfway was also safe. </p><p>It just gave me more resistance, but at this point, I was used to interrupting skills exactly when I wanted to. Three years of practice was truly useful. </p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t learn much from the way the mana moved. Despite what I had hoped, it wasn’t the exact same pattern every single time. While it had roughly the same shape, even getting a rough sense was next to impossible. </p><p>Suddenly, I understood what Maria meant by it being impossible to sketch properly. Truly, what she was able to draw was leagues more complicated than what I had been able to even comprehend. </p><p>“Alright, now I understand why they need Intelligence,” I groaned. It probably required Intelligence to direct and control the mana, which was a level of multitasking even a skill couldn’t handle alone. </p><p>Well, at least, that was my current working theory, one that I couldn’t examine one way or another. One that I wanted to push more, but could not. </p><p>The trick with the sword was far more important. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a sword technique that was anywhere close to anything I had in my forging techniques. Though, there was a chance it existed, but I wasn’t able to access it. </p><p>Another arbitrary restriction. </p><p>A spear, on the other hand, could be classified as a chisel if one squinted enough. There was no reason for it not to work. I still needed a skill, but that could be mixed with the search for the dungeon door for the next floor. All I needed was for me to slow down slightly to make sure the monsters I killed connected. It didn’t take too many small monsters to make sure every giant bug dropped a skill of Uncommon variety — which now I could distinguish thanks to a quick talk with the skill vendor. </p><p>Previously, I wasn’t able to get much information on it, with most people hiding the information. Understandable, as when I had the money to buy skills, they were still rare enough that even common ones had required connections to acquire. </p><p>And, once they started to get more common, I was poor enough to be treated as a nuisance. In that regard, my current stage showed a significant difference, in which I looked like an adventurer with a lot of money to throw around. </p><p>Of course, it was still nothing more than a reasonable hypothesis. I fired up the forge once more and started creating a multitude of different chisels, ignoring the limits set by the System. And, if at one point, those chisels had started suspiciously like short spears, it was surely an accident. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I waved around my ugly chisel made entirely of metal, with a thick wedge at the front. </p><p>“Now, all I need is to set a search pattern,” I said as I moved a while. It didn’t take long for me to realize that the density of giant monsters varied greatly based on the direction I picked. Eleanor had already mentioned that the giant ones were mostly spilling from the next floor. </p><p>“Probably the right path,” I muttered even as I shifted to my hammer, angling myself to avoid the charge of a giant monster while making sure the second one had been blocked by the first. It was challenging enough even without factoring in the ordinary monsters making things more complicated. </p><p>Luckily, the new armor was allowing me to block the corrosion attacks, or dealing with the combination of monsters would have been a messy challenge. </p><p>But, while it had been difficult, I made sure to slowly immobilize the giant ones first before it disappeared. </p><p>The reward had been equally impressive. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Swift Spear (Uncommon)]</p><p>A short but painful absorption period later, I concentrated, targeting the nearest stone, treating it as a target I needed to shape as a grindstone. The mana pattern appeared in front of it. At this point, switching between attacks was a common trick. </p><p>[Swift Spear (Uncommon) 1 -&gt; 7 ]</p><p>“Marvelous.” </p>
