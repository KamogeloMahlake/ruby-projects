        <p>I paused for a moment, stopping all the punishment activities, letting Valkyrie recover for a while as her hair was being pulled by Sapphire, whose expression was more serious than I had expected considering her question was about her dancing. </p><p>Or maybe I shouldn’t have been too surprised. She had lived a double life, one that forced her to split her life as a dancer and her life as a Queen into two disconnected pieces. </p><p>She clearly appreciated the opportunity to get some comments to assist her with that. </p><p>A poignant silence ruled the room as she tightened her grip on Valkyrie’s hair, looking down sharply. Valkyrie gasped, but I was sure that it was nothing to do with the pain of her grab — as she was used to far more intense pain — but the weight of her gaze. </p><p>“It was … beautiful … my Queen,” Valkyrie finally admitted, a beautiful gasp escaping her mouth as she did so. </p><p>I caught Sapphire’s gaze, to see if she accepted that answer. Receiving a nod, I smirked. “Good, it seems that you have made up. Let’s focus on our celebration, then.” </p><p>“Yes, let’s do it,” Sapphire answered as she climbed onto her bed. “But before, let me teach my loyal knight some more tricks. She clearly needs it,” Sapphire said, her words mocking and jealous at the same time. </p><p>Before Valkyrie could answer, Sapphire positioned herself in front of Valkyrie, her nether lips inches away from Valkyrie’s lips. “Well, I was thinking it was a celebration,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry, it’ll be a celebration, watching my dear Queen begging to cum would be too entertaining for me,” Valkyrie cut in, showing she had no problems with the little competition that was proposed by her liege. </p><p>I shrugged. With both of them enthusiastic about the next step, it definitely counted as a celebration. Those were Valkyrie’s last words for a while, as Sapphire moved forward slightly, silenced by Sapphire’s wetness. </p><p>Her tongue darted out aggressively, forcing a soft moan off Sapphire’s lips, showing that she wasn’t as unfamiliar with the task as I had expected, which made it even more entertaining to watch. </p><p>Unfortunately — or maybe fortunately — for her, it wasn’t entertaining enough to actually stop me. With my shaft still lodged in her tight hole, I pushed, exploring her new depths. </p><p>Maybe it was the sudden increase of aggression, or maybe the intense assault from both sides… Either case, Valkyrie let out an explosive moan, one that had significantly hampered her intention to look dominant. </p><p>One that she was clearly unhappy about, as she showed her intention to cheat. She put both hands on Sapphire’s legs, parting them hard, pinning her in place. Her finger danced back and along her wetness whenever she felt forced to raise her head for a moan. </p><p>“How’s her performance,” I asked Sapphire mockingly, just when Valkyrie exploded into another chain of moans. </p><p>“I can’t say bad since she’s showing such great enthusiasm, but she clearly needs a better tutorial. Right, my loyal knight?” </p><p>Her initial answer was just a moan, muffled considering her occupied mouth. Sapphire smirked viciously — which only made her attitude more erotic — assuming her quip landed without retaliation. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I knew exactly how Valkyrie’s mind worked. She was not one to leave a challenge unanswered. After she managed to let out her moans, she raised her back. “Oh, mister Dark Lord, would you mind shifting to our dear Queen, she’s clearly finding my little service insufficient,” she said, then raised her gaze to Sapphire. “Only if she can handle it, of course.” </p><p>“O-of course, I can,” Sapphire stammered, who had a much more mixed attitude toward being challenged. </p><p>“Good,” I said with a chuckle as I pulled out, but paused halfway, putting my hand on my chin like I was thinking about a very difficult problem. “But it won’t be fair…” I muttered with mock seriousness, interrupted by a big smile. “Oh, I found it!” </p><p>With a wave of my hand, and I had conjured a large, cylindrical object, shaped exactly like mine. Another wave, and it lodged deep into her tight hole that had just been vacated by the original — a little fast, if Valkyrie’s shocked gasp was any indicator. </p><p>“Now, it’s fair —“ Sapphire answered, one that interrupted as I stood behind her, triggering the lubrication spell, a sensation that she was getting more and more familiar with each day. </p><p>Valkyrie chuckled, with no doubt about Sapphire’s sudden tenseness as she leaned forward once again, starting her frontal assault. However, rather than slipping in immediately, I grabbed Sapphire’s hair,  her blonde locks caressing my skin. I leaned forward, enough to see her beautiful eyes widening, reflecting her utter and dreadful arousal. </p><p>“What an enthusiastic little knight, right?” I whispered as I pressed my lips against her, invading her mouth as my other hand danced on her naked body, enjoying her absolute nudity, her nipples once again rock hard to perfectly complement her gravity-defying breasts. </p><p>Her signs of arousal didn’t reduce as I pressed my shaft against her puckered hole, pushing in. </p><p>Slowly. </p><p>“Faster,” she begged as I pulled back slightly, but that died a quick death as I pulled her hair, my other finger dancing around her nipples. I acted like I didn’t even hear her desperate moan and pushed inside her with torturous slowness. </p><p>I was amused by just how quickly she had forgotten about the challenge she had just committed to. </p><p>Valkyrie also noticed that, raising her head to catch my gaze, looking conflicted. On one hand, it was good to see her revenge working. </p><p>On the other hand, my great involvement took from her achievement quite a bit — and it clearly bothered her a lot, considering that was her reaction even with the huge toy slamming into her ass repeatedly. I nodded as I chuckled, bringing my hands to Sapphire’s hips, leaving her lips and breasts alone. </p><p>Instead, I drilled into her tightness, and I did it hard, exactly at the same rhythm as the toy Valkyrie was ‘suffering’ under, making their competition fairer. </p><p>Was that absolute fairness? Certainly not. </p><p>Did I care? Certainly not. </p><p>I had no problem with the aggression, knowing their limits were significantly higher than the moment they were currently dealing with. Yet, I didn’t push more either, enjoying the spectacle instead. </p><p>After all, it was supposed to be a celebration. It certainly was, though with a more intense, competitive edge than I had been planning. </p><p>Well, if they didn’t mind, I certainly didn’t. Instead, I continued pushing down, my hands tight around her hips as I manhandled the Queen in front of me while she was receiving a steady assault from the tongue of her loyal knight. </p><p>I pushed down harder, and Sapphire’s moans intensified. “She’s a true champion, isn’t she?” I asked Valkyrie, but only received a dazed moan back while she interrupted the treatment, showing that it wasn’t trivial for her to handle as well.  </p><p>“She certainly —“ Valkyrie started, still trying to answer, but her words died rather quickly when Sapphire grabbed her hair and pushed her down, showing that she was too close to the edge to listen to our banter. </p><p>She might have not dared to do that against me, but her knight clearly didn’t deserve the same consideration. Valkyrie responded to that touch, her tongue circling around her knob, triggering a beautiful chain of moans. </p><p>Her Queen’s aggressive touch was accepted easily… </p><p>I said nothing, greatly enjoying their moans, one muffled, one free. Though, the way Sapphire tightened around me made the moment even better, my fingers tightening around her shapely hips, delving deep into their huge area. </p><p>“Faster,” she managed to murmur, the double assault proving to be even more intense, enough to make her Sapphire forget about the challenge she had initially declared. </p><p>“Your wishes, our command, my Queen,” I countered even as I flared my magic, momentarily conjuring a paddle of ice to slap Valkyrie’s ass, hard enough to get her attention. “You heard your Queen, faster,” I ordered, testing her resilience while enjoying the ability to give her such direct commands. </p><p>It was fun to deal with her in a different manner. </p><p>That earned a gasp from Valkyrie, but she immediately followed with a quickening of her lips… </p><p>Then, they both exploded, marking another step in our beautiful celebration. </p><p>The only question; had they worked hard enough to earn their rest? </p>
