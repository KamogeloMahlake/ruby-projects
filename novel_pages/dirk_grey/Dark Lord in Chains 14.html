        <p>Looking at the quivering blonde beauty that lay in front of me, still covered in my cum, my instincts started to boil up to the surface. Any reasonable person would have said that I had pushed my poor hand of the card as much as possible, and I needed to take my meager winnings and leave… </p><p>It was very hard to do when the princess of the biggest Empire of the world lay in front of me, completely naked, gasping and wheezing as she begged for me to make her cum. How could a wolf resist the delicious temptation of a lamb, even if he had to risk the shepherd's arrival? </p><p>I needed to have her. The only question was the way I took. For a moment, I was tempted to just push inside mercilessly, dominating her, and considering her personality, it would work. However, as much as that idea sounded nice, having Aria begging me helplessly for my cock was even more delicious. Not to mention, it would be more helpful in future manipulations if she thought that she was responsible for the final decision. </p><p>“So, you want to cum,” I whispered even as I cast a spell, telekinetically summoning a wet cloth, using it to gently clean her face. </p><p>She trembled under my gentle touch —not to mention the softness of the cloth, silk and velvet, probably more expensive than the yearly income of a low-class family— as I slowly rubbed her face, cleaning my cum from her face. She needed to be delicious enough to lick for the next step. “Y-yes,” she stammered. “Please.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I dipped down to her chest, cleaning her bountiful bosom, which was heaving in anticipation under my touch. She closed her eyes to enjoy the sensation, which was a mistake as I used the opportunity to get rid of my pants without alerting her. So, when I finished cleaning her chest and leaned down over her, taking the top role, she failed to understand the consequences until my shaft pressed against her entrance. </p><p>“We - we can’t!” she stammered in shock, but with my arms pressing on the bed on both sides of her, she made no move of pulling back. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s not going in, it’s just going to rub on the surface. It doesn’t count,” I whispered, followed by a gentle kiss to her neck which made her shiver helplessly. I needed to be careful, however, as she was already very close to the edge, her sensitive body ready to explode in my first mistake. But that only made my job more delicious, like trying to play a masterfully crafted musical instrument. </p><p>She was stiff as a board at first, but she slowly weakened as my hot breath teased her neck. Still, she weakly protested, “This is wrong.”</p><p>I didn’t say for a moment as I brought my lips to her ear with agonizing slowness. “So, you don’t want to cum,” I whispered, of which she replied with a delicious whimper. I dragged a finger down her arm, until my fingers arrived at her hand, grabbing it tenderly. Without waiting for her answer, I started moving slowly, my shaft rubbing against her entrance, slowly being coated by her juices as she gushed out. </p><p>Then, I leaned down, capturing her lips in a soft, lingering kiss, one that could be easily mistaken for a husband’s first kiss to her gentle wife as they started their life together. However, if the enthusiasm of her tongue was any indicator, Aria didn’t seem to mind too much that it was me in her bedroom, dangerously close to defile her as we shared a very intimate hug instead of Lancelot. Her enthusiasm burned brighter as the time passed, arousal dominating fear. </p><p>I chose to push forward at that exact moment, and slipped the crown of my shaft inside her, enjoying the tight and warm grasp of her entrance in the beginning. She tried to push me away panickedly, which was actually not a good move on her part as she almost made me deflower her accidentally. “T-that’s - too much,” she managed to stammer when I pulled back from the kiss momentarily. </p><p>“Don’t worry, Princess. It’s just the tip, it doesn’t count,” I said confidently, in a matter-of-fact tone, like it was a completely normal thing to happen. And since I had no sense of shame, I continued while making eye contact. “Do you trust me?” </p><p>“I do,” she answered, though I could feel the answer was more about her inability to handle confrontations than her honest feelings, though the fact that she was yet to have some time to process what had happened inevitably played a role as well, not to mention her raging arousal, dancing on the edge, impairing her decision-making process even more. Under the rush of pleasure, her already weak resolve melted away as our lips connected once more. Our tongues danced as she slowly forgot the exact circumstances and the unique danger they represented, losing herself in pleasure in anticipation of a big explosion. </p><p>Not for long, however, as she soon realized that her arousal was yet to arrive despite the intimacy of the situation. When I pulled back, there was a question mark in her eyes, though her blush signaled that even under the circumstances, she was unable to just ask the question. </p><p>“It’s hard without full penetration,” I explained, which was bullshit considering the number of times I made her cum just by my touch, but she was not in a position to argue against it successfully. “Maybe it’ll help if you move your hips in the same rhythm. It’ll enhance your pleasure.” </p><p>I stayed just enough to catch her blue eyes shining in shock and enthusiasm before leaning for another kiss, while her hips started to follow the rhythm of mine, trying to increase friction without it reaching a ‘dangerous’ point, the crown of my shaft dallying around her entrance but not finalizing the task. Minutes passed, and her arousal rose further, but never enough to actually push her over the edge. She even tried to push her hips further, but I was careful to follow her rhythm to prevent her from taking more of my length. </p><p>It must have bothered her as well, because when I pulled back for a quick break, frustration was the clear emotion on her face. “Can you go a bit … deeper,” she whispered. “Not deep enough to actually …” she added, only to came to a sudden stop, a stricken expression replacing her earlier frustration as she realized what she was asking me to do. </p><p>“Your wishes my command, Princess,” I said as I pushed a bit deeper, just enough to tickle the barrier that signaled her identity as a virgin, though at this point, it was more of a technicality than an actual fact. Her intention to take back her earlier statement was obvious, but under a renewed rush of pleasure, she failed to do so, her moans taking control. Her blue eyes begged for mercy, but ignoring that was trivial. </p><p>I still stayed in the missionary position as I dipped my head down once more, catching her lips in another searing kiss, letting time pass by. Under the renewed rush of pleasure, it didn’t take long for her hesitancy to melt away, leaving back desire. The smell of her arousal filled the room more and more, begging me to take the last step, a call I rejected. I wanted her to do that particular mistake. Also</p><p>Also, I was curious just how long she would be able to survive under my attention. </p><p>“I need-” she started when I pulled back from another kiss, but it instantly faded into another cry when I leaned down to bite a previously-discovered sensitive spot on her neck, making her shiver. Just inches away from a climax, she was unable to even speak, which didn’t improve as my lips moved lower to her delicious bosom, and my tongue flickering on her freshly cleaned nipples. </p><p>I took it as an opportunity to turn on the intensity. With her inexperience, it was a hopeless battle, her surrender foregone. It was just a question of when. “What do you need?” I asked moments later, not bothering to hide my mocking edge. </p><p>“I need to cum!” she shouted, surprising me with her reaction, even though it was mostly about the frustration she was feeling. </p><p>“Do you want me to go deeper, despite the risk?” I asked, which was enough to silence her. I smirked like I had just got an idea. “You know what, why don’t you wrap your legs around my waist and pull me deeper, so that we don’t have an accident?” </p><p>That was a terrible idea. “That’s a good idea,” she stammered, the extended state of frustration as she stayed on the edge making it hard for her to think clearly. Her plump legs curled around my waist, slowly pulling me deeper inside her, until the crown finally pushed against her barrier. She stopped, and I pulled back, only to repeat it again. </p><p>“See, it works perfectly,” I said before I returned my task of leaving a fresh set of bite marks on her beautiful tits while my fingers found her plump ass, enjoying the texture. “You just need to be careful.” </p><p>Of course, that was easier said than done. She was already half-drunk with pleasure, and the temptation to feel more must be overwhelming. More importantly, before yesterday, her experience with the opposite sex was practically nonexistent, only to get an overwhelming lesson in the last few hours. As a side effect, she was like a gambler who had just won the biggest pot of her life, distracted, confused, and most importantly, yearning for even more. </p><p>Not the best mood for decision-making, or maintaining the delicate balance in the game I had constructed. </p><p>I went back and forth repeatedly under the guidance of her legs, but with each repeat, I was moving just a bit deeper. At first, I was pushing against her barrier gently, then it started to stretch a bit under my pressure, said pressure increasing further with each repeat. I looked at her questioningly, only to find her eyes firmly shut as she tried to process the pleasure to push over the edge, only to fail spectacularly. </p><p>A mistake was inevitable, though it came even sooner than I expected. She was gently leading me deeper once more when I chose that exact moment to bite her nipple hard, which made her twitch, accidentally pulling me far too deep, turning her status from virgin to ex-virgin. </p><p>“No-” she gasped, which immediately turned into a moan as I used the opportunity to slide halfway in, and while she tried to say something else, I pulled back, only to impale her again, and she started trembling, finally pushing over the edge. She bit her lips to contain her moans, shivering helplessly, while I stayed in her, enjoying her snug warmth. “It can’t be, no,” she gasped once aftershocks were subsided. </p><p>“Come on, sweetheart, nothing to worry about,” I whispered into her ear after gently kissing her cheek. “You’re the most prominent healer of the Empire, you can easily fix it later.” </p><p>“But, it doesn’t count.” </p><p>“Of course it does, what we are doing is just practice, and you’re doing it to be better,” I whispered temptingly, this time her shivers not directly related to the pleasure she was feeling. </p><p>“We need to stop,” she replied as she put her hands on my chest, like she wanted to push me away, though she neglected applying any of her strength. </p><p>“Do we?” I added, just like a demon trying to mislead a saint. Though, considering the circumstances, it wasn’t too different from the actual situation. She was really a saint with her selfless healing, and I certainly had the qualifications to be a demon. “After all, it’s already done. What’s the harm of practicing a bit more, so you’re really prepared for your wedding night?” </p><p>“I don’t know…” she murmured, but her desire was clear. Moreover, as I started slowly moving inside her, forcing deeper into her tight grasp, her expression slid further and further toward a surprising ecstasy, with just a bit of discomfort as she tried to accommodate my girth. “It’s just training, right?” she asked, though she avoided my gaze as she did so, signaling she was aware just how paper-thin the excuse was. </p><p>“Of course, just training,” I said even as I moved deeper into her, while once again sealing her lips with a kiss. Surprisingly, her legs wrapped around my waist once more as I started pumping, showing just how amped-up she was after such a long teasing period. Each repeat pushed my presence deeper into her core, earning a louder moan in return, finally breaking my lips’ ability to contain them. Luckily, her room was covered with silencing wards to maintain total privacy. </p><p>It wasn’t the most exciting position I had ever experienced, but there was something special watching the way her expression changed under my care as she learned the true meaning of womanhood for the first time, arousal mixed with wonder, with a permanent undertone of shocked shyness. It was simply delicious. </p><p>Her lips opened for a cry that threatened to break through the sound resistance of the room, and I grabbed them with another domineering kiss, using the benefits of the position to the limit. Her cry vibrated in my mouth, tempting me to impale her even harder, which in turn made her moan even louder, in a divine example of positive feedback. Unused to the pleasures of the flesh, it didn’t take long before she started climbing toward another orgasm. </p><p>“Faster,” she moaned even as her legs tightened around me, surprising me even more. I stared at her face, her eyes closed but her trembling lips speaking volumes. I leaned forward and kissed her as a lover should, but even as our tongues danced, my hips picked up speed, pushing harder and deeper. “Yes, just like that,” she moaned, which was a sentiment I agreed. It was a delicious moment of connection to treasure. “Deeper, Byron, deeper,” she gasped. </p><p>For a moment, I had to suppress my laughter, as I imagined Lancelot’s expression if he heard his dear fiancee begging for me to fuck her deeper, her shyness finally lost under a rush of pleasure. To be fair, it was his own fault for leaving such a treasure leaving untouched even as they adventured together for months. I obliged Aria’s request, pumping in and out faster and faster, exploring her untouched depths, each repeat with a new discovery. Her moans got louder and louder, her faced blossoming into a radiant red. Her eyes never opened as she seemed to allow her body to just relax and enjoy the crests of pleasure I was bringing her. </p><p>When she finally tightened around me, signaling her climax, I was far too gone as well. Luckily, her legs were still around my waist, giving me an excuse why I didn’t bother pulling back as I exploded in her, staining her untouched depths for the first time. She just moaned, missing the significance of my ejaculation as I enjoyed the development of the explosion. </p><p>I pulled out of the kiss, staring at her beautiful face as she climaxed, her eyelids fluttering helplessly. At this moment, I could understand why some people spent their whole life learning to paint, or play a certain musical instrument. Creating a masterpiece was worth it. </p><p>Aria was definitely a masterpiece, with her beautiful blonde hair, her fluttering eyelids, and flawless face contorted with pleasure… </p><p>“Have nice sleep,” I whispered to her as I slid out of the bed, leaving one last lingering kiss on her cheek. As much as I wanted to stay next to her, I had already pushed my luck sufficiently, and I needed to return to my cell, just in case someone else decided by. </p><p>The only question, what should I do tonight?</p>
