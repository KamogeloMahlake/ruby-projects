        <p>My mind was still on the sudden appearance of a drug distribution center near my bar, weighing advantages and disadvantages when I arrived at the bar and unlocked the door. </p><p>If there was one benefit of the absence of a bus service, it helped me consider the advantages and disadvantages of opening the bar tonight versus delaying it a few more days. Of course, the best option was to move to a safer part of the city … but I wouldn’t have been in this situation if I had the money to do so. </p><p>However, my mood changed when I entered the bar. “Wow,” I muttered. For a moment, I was sure that I was in the wrong place. After all, neither the layers of dirt, nor the smell was there. </p><p>The reason was clear. Tara was at a corner, lifting one of the tables with one hand while holding a mop with the other, destroying the last specks of dirt. </p><p>It seemed that I had underestimated her efficiency. With no need to keep her strength hidden, she went through the place with a shocking efficiency, literally transforming the place. </p><p>Such a thing deserved a reward … or a punishment, I corrected as I noticed the subtle shift in her attitude. The subtle shift in her posture showed that she had noticed my arrival, but rather than turning to greet me, she kept cleaning, acting unaware of my arrival. </p><p>Her intention was clear with the subtle change she had made. She leaned forward as if she was trying to reach a corner, but rather than kneeling, she bent forward enough for her modest skirt to ride up. </p><p>Rather transparent, but it made it even more amusing. I barely held back a laugh as I walked toward her, amused by the way she tensed with each step, yet somehow believing that she had managed to hide that from me. </p><p>That only stopped when I put my hand on her waist. She turned to look toward me as she started to lower the table, my touch enough to send her blush overdrive. “Did I tell you to stop cleaning?” I said. </p><p>“N-no, sir,” she answered immediately, her blush spectacularly beautiful, and raised the table once more like it weighed absolutely nothing. </p><p>“Better,” I said even as I let my hand drift lower, cupping her ass, doing my best to play the role of the sleazy boss. Admittedly, it was not inaccurate, even with her intense enjoyment. “I see that you have made nice progress with the cleaning. If you work hard, we can even start serving customers tonight,” I commented. </p><p>“Whatever you think better, sir,” she responded, trying to sound normal … but it was a challenge with the way I cupped her ass. Her skirt was thick, but not enough to block my aggressive grab. She continued mopping the floor like nothing had happened. </p><p>“Good, we need to make sure everything is in order before we open,” I said. “A mistake, and you get punished,” I added, enjoying the way she shivered in excitement. I was curious whether she would immediately make a mistake with the promise of a punishment. </p><p>Her expression was easy to read, showing to me that she was thinking exactly that. I chuckled as I watched her expression shift between temptation and determination … finally settled on the latter. </p><p>Even with the enjoyment she would derive from the punishment, she clearly cared about following my orders more. </p><p>How fascinating. </p><p>Of course, such determination might have been made easier by the fact I was squeezing her ass aggressively, suggesting to her that the obedience came with its own unique benefits under the circumstances…</p><p>But why should I care for such details when I could just watch the way her arm trembled. Not due to exhaustion … as it had been the case, it wouldn’t have been perfectly timed with the touch of my finger to her naked skin. </p><p>“Careful,” I warned with a throaty tone as I caressed her inner thigh, her shivers intensifying enough to make me take a step. A part of it was the temptation to stand right behind her to make the situation more entertaining…</p><p>But I had to admit, another part of it was not trusting her to keep her grip on the table. </p><p>Yet, despite the potential risks, I didn’t ask her to put the table down, a nice source of excitement for me while I tested her limits … more to see if she lost control of her strength to be distracted than anything else. </p><p>I rather prefer her shattering a table rather than my shoulder. </p><p>Risks of dealing with a super intimately. </p><p>Still, even as I slowly climbed up on her inner thigh, I couldn’t help but wonder that she managed to stay untouched and unfulfilled for long. Probably a combination of growing up in a distant ranch, her extremely understated way of dressing that hid her beauty, and her powers further scaring her from taking initiative. </p><p>“You’re a surprisingly good secretary,” I said, referring to her most recent promotion. I barely held back a chuckle as her blush spread even further, showing just how unaccustomed she was to receive any compliment. </p><p>And I was just enough of a bastard to take advantage of that. </p><p>I said nothing else, enjoying her reactions as I slowly caressed her inner thighs. She was already inexperienced enough to reach explosively to an inept touch … and mine was nowhere near deserving of such a title. </p><p>Add in the unique advantage my power granted, and it turned into a truly unfair affair. I was able to discover several spots along the path of her inner thigh that she was unaware of. I knew that, as the shocked nature of her whimpers whenever I discovered a new trick or a spot was truly spectacular. </p><p>It was like playing a beautiful new instrument … for a symphony that only I could listen. </p><p>To her credit, she did her best to ignore the resulting pleasure and focused on her mopping, still holding the table high. Though, not without some sacrifices, as the determined, steady movements of her mop soon turned into a monotone back and forth, her eyes staying close too long for her to notice that.  </p><p>Not that I blamed her, as the intensity of arousal was evident. Not just on her barely-suppressed moans, but also by the wetness I felt whenever my fingers trailed up and touched the edge of her panties. </p><p>She managed to resist my touch for almost five minutes, which might as well be an eternity … until the pleasure got simply too much. A clattering sound reached my ears … luckily, it was the mop and not the table, the latter she barely managed to hold on. </p><p>“Oh, what a clumsy secretary you are,” I commented as she barely managed to place the table back on the floor without letting it fall, then leaned against the same table to resist her trembling. </p><p>“I … I’m s-sorry, sir,” she said, the most she could say as her body trembled badly. It wasn’t as bad as the previous night when I bent her over my desk, but it wasn’t too far away either.</p><p>“Do you think being sorry would protect you from your punishment?” I said, but the moment I said that, I started walking behind the bar. </p><p>I had already christened the office and my room upstairs … now, it was time to apply to the same treatment to the bar. </p><p>“Of course not, sir,” she said, her tone excited at first, but fading toward the end when she noticed that I had walked behind the bar. </p><p>“Come here,” I ordered. She followed that order, but only after a momentary glance toward the door and the windows, both appropriately closed. She was clearly sensitive to being seen by others even when being punished. </p><p>Something I should remember in the future. Both not to push her too much … and in case she actually made a mistake that needed to be punished rather than the playful version she was currently receiving. </p><p>But, since the place was appropriately sealed, there was no harm in pushing her a bit. “You’re overdressed,” I commented. </p><p>Another shiver, but her fingers were already on the buttons of her shirt, opening them one by one to create an incredible cleavage.  She managed to remove her shirt halfway in, and left it on one of the tables. Pity her bra was another boring and ugly piece that detracted from her beauty rather than to add on it. </p><p>She took another step forward, her steps alluring just like I had taught her before despite her excitement, each step making her hips sway. Naturally, her skirt kept the most interesting aspects of that particular issue hidden, but that </p><p>Then, she paused as she unzipped her skirt, and let it fall to the ground, removing that particular impediment as she continued her approach. </p><p>For all its challenges, owning a bar had its advantages… </p>
