        <p>Hi everyone, </p><p>I'm suffering through some health issues for the last several days, which affected my writing a bit. Therefore, this week's updates are probably going to delay. Unless the problems intensify, the chapters should be up by Sunday, though, so no worries. Still, I'll try to put at least some of the chapters by Friday, assuming I leave the hospital in a timely manner.  </p><p>Hopefully, you guys are having a better start for the new year :) </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Dirk</p>
