        <p>When I woke up, it was already six, and the first rays of the morning were dancing over the lake surface. Anna was sleeping, once again wrapped in thick pajamas that contrasted greatly with her evening courage. I chuckled a bit as I quickly prepared a sandwich, then left after taking my practice notebook. </p><p>As usual, I spent the best hours of the morning practicing my drawing. Toward the end of the second hour, I once again noticed Anna watching me from the window, but I acted unawares, focusing on my practice. She watched me until I finished my work and started walking back.</p><p>She was about to prepare breakfast when I returned. “Are you hungry?” she asked, her tone once again surprisingly shy, to a degree that would have made me suspicious if I already hadn’t known about the reason for her almost crippling shyness, reliving her ‘solo’ adventure of the night. </p><p>“I’m a bit famished, but still, I’m going to skip the breakfast,” I answered. </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>“I don’t like to swim with a full stomach,” I said even as I walked toward my section of the room, and pulled the curtain close. “Wanna join?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” she stammered. “I was planning to finish my book.” </p><p>I shook my head in surprise, still unable to believe how she could do what she did in the evening but feel hesitant to wear a swimsuit in front of me. “Come on, let’s break in your new swimsuit. The weather is perfect for a swim. You can finish your book later on.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to say, but when I opened the door, revealing my body, wearing only swimming shorts, her complaints staggered for a moment. It was enough time for me to leave the RV, without giving her a chance to answer. </p><p>“I don’t want any complaints. See you at the lake,” I said, and closed the door. </p><p>I swam for almost fifteen minutes, but she didn’t appear. Just when I was about to go back and make another attempt to convince her, I saw her leaving the RV, wearing the swimsuit. Unfortunately, she had her towel wrapped around her waist, and her arms were crossed around her chest to hide the tightness of her chest. </p><p>Though, when she came nearer, I saw that she was rather justified with her action, because the swimsuit was a bit smaller, and a lot more elastic, than I had expected. The red fabric stretched over her skin like it was painted. I acted like I didn’t notice her hesitant gaze and swam away from the shore, giving her enough time to drop her towel and dash into the water. </p><p>I only turned back when I heard her step into the water. “Cold,” she exclaimed in shock, and I turned to look at her, only for my eyes to widen. I hadn’t noticed when she was walking because of her arms, but the topside of her swimsuit was even more revealing than I had expected, so much that she was unable to pull the zipper completely. Instead, it barely passed the halfway line. In a different woman —with a more normal chest size— it might have looked normal, even modest, but with her amazing tits straining the swimsuit to the limit, it was a delicious view. </p><p>The swimsuit fit even better than I imagined, though it was a small miracle she managed to leave the RV wearing it. </p><p>Now that she was in the water, I decided to tease her a bit. “You’re finally here,” I said even as I swam closer to her, her blush increasing with each stroke bringing me closer. “Didn’t I tell you, the water is perfect.” </p><p>“You’re right, it’s perfect,” she murmured even as she sank deeper in the water, but it was an empty gesture. The lake water was perfectly clear, giving me a perfect glimpse of her cleavage as I closed in. </p><p>“You should listen to me more,” I said, punctuated with a dark, seductive smile that I frequently employed during college, often with spectacular results. I winked, but before she could answer, I started swimming away, giving her a bit of space to recover. Despite her habit of nighttime molesting, she was yet to reach a point of handling my teasing for an extended time. </p><p>So, I swam across the lake, though I made sure to swam closer every five minutes to deliver another teasing quip, some innocent enough to leave her giggling, some suggestive enough to leave her blushing. It was a pleasure to visit her, because as she swam, she failed to realize a very important detail. The swimsuit we purchased came from the bargain bin, and didn’t have the best zipper. Under the rather impressive pressure of her tits, enhanced by her strokes as she swam, the zipper moved lower and lower, creating an even more delicious cleavage. Miraculously, she managed to miss that detail, her eyes far too focused on my glistening back muscles. </p><p>So, I decided to bring my teasing to the next level. When she was swimming, I dived under the water, and closed in behind her, still under her. When I aligned under her, I switched to my back, so that I could see her face. Her eyes were closed to protect them from water, so she was wholly unprepared when I reached to touch her nose. </p><p>She barely managed to pull her head out of the water as she screamed in panic, slapping her arms on the water without balance, like she was about to drown. There was no risk of her actually drowning of course, she didn’t even swallow any water, but still, as I appeared from the depths, chucking, I used the opportunity to hug her in the guise of saving her. I even used the opportunity to pull her zipper even lower, which elevated her cleavage from daring to wholly indecent. </p><p>“What was that!” she exclaimed, scared and angry enough to miss the fact that I was hugging her tight enough to her inappropriate cleavage to my chest.</p><p>“Calm down, it’s just a little joke,” I answered, maintaining my smile. </p><p>“A joke,” she said stiffly, but before I could reply, her breathing got slower, and a panicked expression appeared on her face, realizing the intimacy of the position. She tried to pull back, and I let her go immediately, and she found herself dipping deep. This time, rather than saving her, I pushed her shoulders a bit, so that she sank even deeper. </p><p>“I’ll show you,” she exclaimed when she appeared on the surface, her blonde hair sticking to her face. She grabbed my shoulder and pushed me down. I could have easily resisted her, but that would run contrary to the aim of the teasing. I let her dip me down, which inadvertently pushed my face to the softness of her cleavage. I stayed deep for a while, before I grabbed her legs and dipped her, sinking her down with another playful cry. </p><p>That playful banter lasted for almost five minutes, until we managed to swim. “Enough,” she finally begged as she held my arm, trying to stay on the surface as she breathed hard. </p><p>“That was fun, isn’t it?” I asked even as I dragged her to the surface as I swam. “And you were going to stay in the RV to read.” </p><p>“You were right,” she admitted with a giggle, and we walked out of the lake. </p><p>“Come with me,” I suddenly ordered. “You look beautiful, I want to draw you,” I said, and rushed toward the notebook I kept near. I directed her to sit on her towel, her back arched, her elbows pressing on the ground so that her body was almost parallel to the ground while constructing a graceful arc, her head dipping down. </p><p>I quickly dried, wanting to start before she could realize the state of her cleavage, especially the way her pose stretched her swimsuit and enhanced her cleavage further. My pen was already on the paper when her eyes drifted down, and realized the revealing state she was in. “Don’t move,” I ordered as she started shuffling. </p><p>“But-” she started, but I was quick to interrupt. </p><p>“No, don’t move. Just close your eyes and enjoy the sun. It’s a perfect angle, we can’t waste it.” She stiffened at my words, but she lacked the determination to reject such a statement —though her activities of the evening doubtlessly played some role in this. </p><p>Still, as my pencil danced on the paper, creating a black-and-white portrayal of her beauty, she was barely keeping herself from trembling helplessly, clearly overwhelmed. Keeping her eyes was making it even harder. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t have pushed a model out of her comfort zone, but Anna had long spent her right to mercy. </p><p>Instead of comforting her, I deliberately closed in, and pushed my fingers through her hair. Her blue eyes popped open. “Just fixing your hair,” I said to her, but whispering throatily, staying close enough for my breath to caress her. She trembled again, but this time, not from discomfort but from excitement. Her nipples, suddenly stiffening enough to push against her swimsuit was the perfect evidence. </p><p>I pulled back to finish the drawing, which took another ten minutes, while she trembled with excitement. “Done,” I said even as I plopped next to her. </p><p>“Oh my!” she gasped as she looked at my drawing. “I can’t believe I look like this,” she murmured as her gaze danced over the paper, distracted enough to miss the significance of our closeness, even leaning against my chest. From this angle, I had the perfect angle to enjoy her cleavage, which was a different kind of delicious from her nakedness the last night. </p><p>Then, after almost a minute, she remembered the cleavage she was displaying on the drawing was the same she was displaying in the real-life, and hurriedly tried to pull it, which turned out to be a mistake. The cheapness of the swimsuit meant that it failed to resist her harsh pull, and snapped. </p><p>She exclaimed in panic as her zipper parted open, turning her swimsuit into a transitory stripper costume. I decided to pity her and passed her my towel —after getting the eyeful I deserved— and she dashed away to the RV. The way her hips jiggled as she ran away was the last piece of delicious bonus. </p><p>“You have nothing to be ashamed of, sweetie,” I called from behind, pleasantly surprised by my own swimsuit selection. However, I was curious how she would react after her accidental flash. She could either overcompensate and go back to wearing her thickest and ugliest clothes, or she might decide to push the envelope a bit now that she gave me a delicious glimpse of her body. </p><p>Either way, it was bound to be interesting. </p>
