        <p>It had been a while since Aria’s arrival, and the prudent thing to do was to stop. </p><p>That strategy had one problem. The sight of Aria’s half-naked body —covered in my cum, collapsed on the floor as she tried to process the second orgasm of her life, one that came minutes after the first— was far too tempting to resist, especially when she was confused enough to listen to my orders. How could I call myself a Dark Lord if I turned my back to the opportunity to corrupt an innocent princess even further? So, I established an alert ward —one that was weak enough not to be noticed unless someone was actively searching for it. On the negative side, it barely caused a mental tingling sensation when triggered, but that would be enough for me to act quick enough to prevent us from being caught. </p><p>Luckily, Aria was far too focused on the aftershocks of her orgasm to notice the spell. “That was excellent, Aria,” I spoke gently, only to continue with a sharper tone. “Now, we’re going to move to the next part of our lesson to make sure you have the ability to reawaken a cock after a climax. Lean down and capture the head between your lips.” </p><p>Even in her confused obedience, my words were enough to make her stumble. “That’s - that’s too much!” she exclaimed in shock, trying to stand up, but her trembling body betraying her, keeping her on her knees. </p><p>“Really, that’s the part you are balking after everything,” I commented lazily, not bothering to hide my derision as I gazed at her tits pointedly, which was covered with my bite marks, my seed dripping down her chin, only to end on the beautiful expanse of her bosom. She flinched in shock, and I shrugged dismissively. “If you want to fail at your education despite already sacrificing this much, that’s your call,” I added for good measure, doing my best to sound like a supremely disappointed teacher facing a previously-favorite pupil, similar to the tone Queen Sapphire used against her whenever she tried to convince Aria quickly. </p><p>Her eyes widened in shock, confirming my guesses. She had a fragile personality, and while the Queen used to break her resistance. I also had no doubt that Aria was always under the protection of the Queen, who was far too shrewd to let others manipulate her heir —mostly because it would reflect badly at her authority— so Aria must be unused to hear the same tone in others. So, when used that particular tone, I was echoing the authority of the Queen, one that Aria obeyed for her whole life whether it was for political or personal matters. It wasn’t an invincible strategy, as there was a reason I hadn’t tested this trick before. Only in her already flickering and confusing state, such a tactic had any hope to work. </p><p>“No, I’m sorry!” she stammered immediately as she leaned forward, putting her hands on my thighs, which made her stained tits dangle forward, tempting me to unlock my chains and enjoy her fully, but I kept that part back. There was no reason to change the game when was this close to a victory. </p><p>“Your words mean nothing,” I said, my tone still disappointed. “Show me your remorse by respecting my teachings.” She nodded reflexively, as that was a reasonable statement. The next one, not so much. “Now, lean down, capture my cock between your lips, and start sucking,” I ordered. </p><p>Her eyes widened, and for a moment, I was sure that I had pushed too far, and she was going to run away. She even tried to rise on her trembling legs, but she collapsed when she met with my disappointed eyes. Her hands found my thighs once more, but this time, she used them for support as she leaned forward. She did so with a shocked expression on her face, one that reminded me of a drunk person despite knowing she was stone-cold sober. She closed her eyes as she leaned further, hiding the panic and shock dancing in their blue depths. </p><p>Then, I felt her lips around my shaft. </p><p>I watched as her mouth easily swallowed my currently-soft shaft, but as I felt her tongue touching my skin, that situation was quick to change. My manhood returned to life at a surprising speed, making it harder and harder for her to keep swallowing. She moaned in shock when it got too big for her to contain, gasping as she watched its growth. “So quick,” she murmured in shock. </p><p>“Only because of your immense skill,” I quickly said, once again playing the proud teacher. “It’s an excellent start,” I said. </p><p>“Start-” she commented, alarmed, only to be silenced with a gaze and immediately lowered her head once more, her lips once again closing around my girth. This time, however, it wasn’t as easy as before, the girth of my shaft large enough to cause her problems. </p><p>Even as I watched her struggle with my size —and occasionally giving her suggestions on how to achieve her aims— I considered my success. Looking at her, I truly understood Sapphire’s decision to marry her off to Lancelot, as the ease she was being manipulated had bordered ridiculous. Yes, I was a Dark Lord with significant experience in convincing people to forsake their morals for immediate benefits, but I achieved that through a wide array of rewards, bribes, implied threats, blackmails, all reinforced further by the overwhelming presence of my Dark Throne and my deadly retainers. </p><p>For Aria, all it took was a few underhanded comments about the threat represented by the other girls, and a few words to convey my disappointment was all it took to make her suck me obediently. She was so easy to manipulate, something I had all the intention of using to the limit. “Now, pull out, and give it a lick across its length.” Her eyes popped open on my command, but her shock didn’t prevent her from following my order. “Bring your left hand to my balls, and massage gently, and wrap your right hand around the base of my shaft.” </p><p>“Like that,” she whispered after she completed her lick, but before returning to sucking my shaft. </p><p>“Exactly,” I said to her, approving her move. “Now, go back to sucking,” I said. Her warm lips sunk over the head of my cock once again while her hands continued the tasks I had assigned, and a lightning bolt of pure pleasure passed through my body. She might be inexperienced and weak, but she was very quick to learn. Even better, after the initial hurdle was passed, she was quick to follow orders, no matter how much they made her blush. She was like a dam, flowing freely once her moral barrier was breached. </p><p>And I wanted to enjoy the uncontrolled flow as much as possible. “Try to add some tongue,” I ordered. She pulled out again, about to give a lick. “Not like that, keep your lips around my girth, but as you move your head back and forth, use your tongue to massage the crown.” She did so without saying anything, delivering a performance above my expectations considering it was the first time she did remotely similar. </p><p>After a few small corrections, I stopped speaking, watching as her head bobbed around my length. I was rock hard, which wasn’t surprising as I had gone through a long dry spell, and the delicious experiences of the last two days were far from enough to quench my thirst. She didn’t even notice that I stopped speaking, as her shyness had soon turned into utter concentration, her pouty lips continuing to caress my sensitive skin. </p><p>Her cheeks stretched lewdly whenever she lowered herself to halfway mark, temping me to release my hands and push her down to test whether the tight grip of her throat was pleasurable enough to touch her lips. To make things even better, her tits pressed against my thighs every time she lowered herself, and giving me a glimpse into their beautiful expanse whenever she rose, making the scene visually appealing as well as arousing. She was slowly losing her reticence, and picking up speed. </p><p>“The next stage,” I murmured, unable to reject the temptation to push it further. “Keep your eyes open, and look at me.” She tried to pull out. “I didn’t say stop,” I reminded her, and she froze, her lips still around my girth. Her eyes fluttered open, and met my gaze, their blue expanse trembling in shock. However, I maintained a firm expression, not willing to compromise. I didn’t want her fantasizing about someone else, but focus on the fact that her lips were around my shaft. “Now, start moving,” I ordered, and her head bobbed once again, but this time, our eyes stayed connected, allowing me to watch her chaotic emotions, mainly cycling between shock, excitement, shyness, and arousal. </p><p>It was a beautiful moment, especially since she was steadily climbing toward an orgasm alongside me. </p><p>Then, the door opened without a warning, freezing everyone, well everyone except me, but my response was automatic as I flared my magic and freed myself from the chains, giving me complete access to my powers, ready to blast our surprise visitor. Aria froze around my shaft as well, too shocked to even pull out. </p><p>It took me a second to register the identity of the intruder, as I was busy cursing myself about missing the ward being triggered, cursing my lack of attention. Yes, Aria was innocently sexy and surprisingly good at blowjob, but that shouldn’t have distracted me enough to miss that. Only when I realized the intruder had a familiar crimson hair, I relaxed a bit, my mind already churning a plan to twist the situation based on the findings of my evening incursion. </p><p>I made eye contact with Aria for a fleeting second, which was enough to send a mental message to her. “Just follow my lead and I’ll handle the situation. Trust me,” said the mental message, but I didn’t wait for Aria to respond —not knowing whether she had the skill to respond in the same manner. Every second was precious. </p><p>With my free hands, I could have cast a spell to slam Emma against the wall, or even kill her, then take Aria as a hostage. Though, I had a sinking feeling that Queen Sapphire would have loved the opportunity to show her dedication to the country by letting me kill her, ensuring the loyalty of the citizens through tragedy. No, I had a better way to handle the situation. </p><p>So, instead of casting deadly spells, I grabbed Aria’s head with both hands and pushed down, forcing her to swallow my whole length, and while Aria gagged and wheezed at the sudden intrusion, I turned my attention to Emma. “Oh, hello, Emma,” I said lazily, like I wasn’t throat-fucking the heir to the throne in front of a loyal —or at least, supposedly loyal, as the last night had put a question mark in that particular detail— mage of the throne. </p><p>Emma watched us with wide eyes, too shocked even to cast a spell. “What the - hell!” she stammered, starting with a whisper and ending with a shout. Luckily, she had already stepped inside, so it was trivial to cast a telekinesis spell to close the door behind her, preventing her voice from echoing in the secret tunnels. </p><p>“Why don’t you take a seat,” I said even as I waved my hand lazily, and the only chair in the room slowly flew toward her, while Emma watched in shock. She raised her hands, ready to cast a spell, but I shook my head slightly even as my expression hardened to the same expression I wore while I delivered a horrible assault against their party the day they had fought against me. That stalled her for a second, and used that time to reach to her mind and awaken a sense of hopelessness, the same kind she felt that day. Inside, I wanted to gloat, as it was the way the mind magics were supposed to be used, not the clumsy way she tried to subject me the last night. </p><p>“W-what’s going on?” she stammered again, this time in a whisper, the emotional trigger awakening her memories of the fight, a fight that they had to attack me with the full strength of their party as well as the assistance of several traitors to take me down. Alone, she had no chance. </p><p>“Sit down,” I repeated, my tone cold, even as I pushed Aria even deeper, enjoying the way her throat wrapped around my shaft. Speaking with such a menacing expression was hard, as Aria’s presence was steadily pushing me toward an orgasm. Luckily, Emma was not in a mood to carefully measure my expression. </p><p>This time, Emma sat down woodenly, unable to suppress her shock. “What’s going on?” she repeated again, this time in a whisper as she tried to understand what was going on, her gaze darting between Aria —who was doing her best to breathe with my cock lodged— and me, who was sitting on the floor, without the chains to keep me imprisoned. </p><p>“Simple,” I drawled lazily. “You have fucked up big time, and this poor Princess here has volunteered to sacrifice her dignity just to remedy a part of it.” </p><p>“I fucked up?” she whispered, confused. </p><p>“Yes, you fucked up,” I said lazily. “Or was it another stupid redheaded whore that woke me up by giving me a blowjob while insulting me at the same time, too distracted by her own burning pussy to properly lock my chains?” I explained smugly. Of course, I misdirected her by suggesting that I was still unconscious during her mental intrusion, not willing to reveal all of my cards at the same time. I could always use that detail in the future. </p><p>I let my gaze down to check Aria’s reaction, but luckily, she was far too gone to actually process our words, her own shock and the forced deepthroat in tandem enough to temporarily destroy her ability to eavesdrop. I kept one had on her head, forcing her deep enough to bury her nose into my pubes, while the other found her breast, finally sinking into their vast expanse, enjoying their firmness, finally filling a desire. </p><p>“But - no!” she gasped, shock and horror filling her face as the enormity of her failure hit her. She stood frozen, trying to process, while I continued to pump into Aria’s throat. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” I said smugly. “I had no idea you were horny enough to molest a sleeping man, though, so it was a surprise. Why did you unlock my chains, though? Did you used my fingers for some nefarious purpose as well?” I commented, amusing by the way her horror transformed from an existential threat to personal shame, helped by the fact that I was yet to attack her. </p><p>I was about to mock her a bit more when I felt my cock throbbing. I didn’t try to keep myself back, but let Aria rise for a moment, allowing her to take a deep breath before I exploded in her mouth, filling her with my seed. “Try to swallow, honey,” I said to her. “Maybe you can have a better chance than Emma here. The last night, she failed rather spectacularly when she tried to swallow,” I commented even as I kept Aria in place, who, surprisingly, actually followed that order and collected my seed in her mouth, and swallowed. Some of it slipped off her mouth, but it was an incredible achievement for the first attempt, especially under the circumstances. </p><p>“Bastard,” Emma murmured in shock, her face red enough to match her face as my comment reminded her of the way her face was covered by a load of my seed. </p><p>I just shrugged, smirking amusedly as Aria rose, trembling and coughing, stained in cum, trying to catch her breath… </p><p>“Now,” I murmured lazily, but the girls tensed regardless. Understandable, as one didn’t stop fearing a tiger just because the tiger was loaming lazily… </p><p>The most dangerous phase was complete, and despite the ridiculousness of the situation, I managed to dissuade them from attacking or attempting to retreat, all without sacrificing anything in my negotiating position. However, I needed to decide how to handle this, and I needed to decide it quickly! </p>
