        For Sarah, every step she took towards the living room was torture, struggling to put one foot ahead of the other. She found it easy to fall behind the two men who were laughing to yet another story Thomas shared, despite the target was once again Erik, targeted by the thoughtless cruelty of her husband and his friends. Under the effects of the alcohol, Thomas didn’t even bother to soften the stories, telling them with all their nakedness, making her eyes grow in shock. She was learning about another side of her husband, a side she wasn’t sure she liked. <p>But then Erik turned towards her with a mocking smile, and she realized why he was showing no sign of anger for these stories. He was relaxed because he already knew how he was going to take his revenge… She was struck with a desire to turn back and leave, not caring about the business, or her future. She could always start working once more, and if Thomas could find a sales job, they would make more than enough to live a cozy life.</p><p>Still, she followed them to the living room. As heavy as her feet were, it was nothing compared to the weight of a deadened future. The men were already sitting on the couch when she entered, with Erik reaching for the remote. The TV blinked open a second later, showing a basketball game going on. “Nice, our guys are leading by seven,” Thomas said with a happy tone, his eyes stuck on the screen. “I wouldn’t have guessed that you now follow basketball,” Thomas said to Erik, his eyes firmly glued to the TV. </p><p>“It’s an acquired taste,” Erik answered. “But I have no doubt that tonight’s encounter is going to be quite enjoyable.” The fact that he was turned towards her with his hungry gaze left no mystery about the source of said pleasure. She walked towards the couch with heavy steps. </p><p>She would have preferred to sit on Thomas’ left, away from Erik’s hungry paws, but that required her to ignore Erik’s hand pointing at the seat that was between him and her husband. She could, of course, but that would mean that the earlier humiliation she suffered under his hands was a complete waste. </p><p>Still, it wasn’t all bad. With her husband sitting next to her, and without the visual cover the table provided, the only thing he would be able to do was to look. Not that she was happy with providing him with such a revealing view. She would have liked to pull her dress up a bit, which would significantly reduce the amount of cleavage she was providing, but only with the cost of increasing the number of legs she was displaying, and an added danger of revealing much more in an errant movement. </p><p>Then, her eyes caught the brown blanket she occasionally used when cozying up against the TV. She turned towards her unwelcome guest. “Erik,” she said, satisfaction from her victory coloring her tone, however small. “Could you pass me the blanket, I’m feeling a bit chilly.” </p><p>“Of course,” he answered with a matching smile of his own. An actual chill spread through her face against his confidence, but she still placed the blanket over her legs, hiding them from the view. She pulled her dress up a bit, reducing the cleavage that was on display. </p><p>A couple minutes passed unremarkable, broken by the occasional comments on missed scores. Complacent, Sarah started to relax. The match was already in its third period, meaning she had to suffer the position for less than twenty minutes. Since they were too drunk to talk business -her husband was, at any rate- which would necessitate Erik’s departure, ending her torture for the night. Disaster still loomed at the horizon, but she was sure that she could develop a solution after a good night’s sleep. </p><p>However, she soon learned that she wasn’t able to accurately assess the lengths he was willing to go. The first sign was a small movement she felt at the blanket. She looked down, only to see his hand disappearing under the cover. A second later, she felt his fingers brushing her thighs, and a tremble passed through her body, leaving her motionless. The last thing she expected was for him to be that daring, while her husband was literally next to her. </p><p>The blanket was a huge mistake, she realized too late. Without, the only thing that he would be able to do was to look, but under it, she could feel his fingers tracing her inner thighs, angling dangerously closer to her core. She turned towards him with a pleading expression, hoping to find a shred of mercy, only to find an uncaring glee in the depths of his gaze, mocking her for her mistake. </p><p>Still, she sat there until she felt his fingers caressing her core, sending an unwelcome jolt through her body. She grabbed her wrist, trying to push his hand away, but it was a losing battle, especially since she was unable to push too hard, afraid of alerting her husband. His fingers twisted, teasing her nether lips. </p><p>Then, his fingers moved even further, probing her entrance, trying to slip inside, a fact that she couldn’t allow, not with her husband in the swinging distance, even if he was distracted by the TV. She didn’t think she had the ability to control her voice if that was the case. She stood up, her hands on the edge of her skirt, pulling the dress down enough not to reveal much, then got away from the coach with rapid steps. </p><p>Her husband didn’t even bother to comment. Normally, she would admonish her husband for rudeness, but at that moment, the lack of attention from him was a welcome miracle. But she wasn’t able to enjoy it when Erik stood up as well, walking to the back of the seat, calling her closer with a negligent gesture of his finger. “Do you want something to drink from the kitchen,” he asked Thomas, who didn’t even bother to turn to answer, just raising his scotch glass. </p><p>Afraid of what he had in his mind, she didn’t follow his command to walk closer, instead stood in her place. But that stance lasted until he started walking towards her. Then her reflexes took over, and she took a step back before her conscious mind took the control and stopped her journey. There was little point in running away after accepting his outrageous proposal. At least, with her husband in the room, his actions would be limited, even if her husband was distracted by the match. And, the game was already closing to the end, so she had to suffer his attention less than fifteen minutes before the match was over. </p><p>She was unable to breathe as he stood just a step away, towering over her by a considerable margin. She wasn’t unfamiliar with the difference in size, her husband was as tall as him, nevertheless, she felt suffocated. It was the expression in his eyes, she realized as she tried to stand still. Her husband had never looked at her like she was a songbird, captured in his trap, helpless… At that moment, she realized, even ten minutes was far too long, but it was too late, with his hand caressing her arm, poised to prevent her from escaping, slowly crawling towards her shoulder, naked other than the flimsy string that was holding the dress up.</p><p>She wasn’t expecting him to pull it on the side, leaving her shoulder completely bare. Her hand rose in reflex, wanting to fix it. Him touching her was one thing, as they could stop if her husband ever tried to turn, or maybe come up with an explanation, but being undressed was much harder to explain. However, her hand froze halfway under his warning gaze. Her hand fell down, despite the fear that her husband might turn towards them, however unlikely with the match still going on. </p><p>He replicated his move on the other side, leaving her dress without support. Still, the dress stayed in its place, its tightness helpful for once. “Tasty,” he mouthed as he dragged his finger into her cleavage until it was pressing her dress. She looked into his eyes beggingly, hoping for a scrap of mercy. It just took a glance from her husband, and her marriage was dead. But, in the depths of his eyes, there was no mercy. With a smile that reminded her a tiger, he pulled the dress down. </p><p>She knew that she should have reacted in any way, slapping him, covering herself, shouting for her husband, turning and running away… Anything… But never expecting such a daring behavior, the only thing she was able to do was to freeze in panic, even when he grabbed her arms and dragged her towards her husband. </p><p>She realized his plan only after he dragged her until she was standing behind her husband half-naked, forced to her knees. She watched him with an unbelieving expression as he casually unbuckled his belt, unable to believe he could be this daring while her husband was just a foot away, even if he was distracted with the alcohol and the match. </p><p>Helpless, she did the only thing that was possible. She parted her lips, swallowing the head of the shaft that was teasing her lips. She had no other option, not if she wants to keep her husband unaware. She forced her mouth to open, struggling to take all he pushed inside without making a sound, a task she had realized impossible when she felt the head pressing to the end of her throat while she could still see a sizable amount was outside the confines of her mouth. It was unfair, a part of her brain commented, for such a miserable human being to be rewarded with such a huge shaft. </p><p>However, acknowledging the size did nothing when he pushed even more, and a reflexive gag escaped from her mouth, ringing in the room. She froze, mortified with shock and fear, when she heard the voice of her husband asking a question. “What was that?” Thomas asked. </p><p>“I got a bit of a hiccup,” Erik answered smoothly even as he pushed his shaft deeper into her mouth, forcing her to struggle to contain her voice. She was lucky that her husband failed to recognize the source, but didn’t want to risk a repeat, as if he turned backward even for a second, her life would be over. Luckily, Erik was leaning forward, forcing her husband to look up to talk to him, leaving the ongoing activities outside his field of vision. </p><p>Erik pushed deeper into her mouth, and only the full application of her willpower was enough to prevent her from gagging loud. She looked up him incredulously, sure that her gaze was conveying the full extent of her anger. Infuriatingly, she received only a mocking smile in return, followed by a pumping motion with his hand. The message was clear, if humiliating. </p><p>But she had well-past the point of humiliation, considering she was giving a blowjob to her husband’s schoolyard victim inside the swing distance of her husband. Sooner it ended, the better, she decided and brought her hands to the base of his shaft. After a bit of struggle where she tried to wrap her fingers around the base, pumping as quickly as possible without making a noise.</p><p>“I see that you are a supporter of our guys as well,” she heard her husband saying to Erik. “Considering that you are looking that satisfied with a prospect of victory.”</p><p>“Do I? How interesting,” Erik said, and she was sure that her husband had completely missed the mocking undertone, having no reason to suspect he was busy fucking his wife’s mouth. </p><p>“Yeah,” Thomas answered with a coarse laugh. “You look like you're about to cram in your pants, man.”</p><p>“No, I'm sure that I'm not going to stain my underwear,” Erik answered with a laugh of his own, few shades darker. “Anyways, let's drink to victories.” She was sure that he wasn’t talking about the match. She heard the clink of crystal, followed by gulping as they drained their glasses. </p><p>“By the way, have you seen Sarah,” Thomas asked. “She is not around for a while.”</p><p>“She was looking hungry, so I'm sure she is busy stuffing herself.”</p><p>“Really, snacking is not a common habit of hers,” Thomas said.</p><p>“You might be surprised,” Erik added, making her realize that there was no limit of feeling humiliated. Every time she felt like she had hit the rock bottom, he managed to push deeper through the barriers that she thought solid, unbreakable. </p><p>With the match drawing closer, her husband lost her interest for the discussion, a fact she welcomed as a silver lining to her vigil. She focused on her attempts to bring him to a climax because she wanted to extract herself from the situation, more time she had to slip away unnoticed. She squeezed her fingers tight, a feeling that was enjoyable if the moan that left his mouth was any indicator. She could hear Erik continuing to talk with her husband, a discussion that interrupted often with the clink of their glass, though she wasn’t able to discern the content, her attention firmly on the thick meat that was trying to push deeper into her throat despite her struggle to keep it at bay. </p><p>She felt something was wrong when she heard the volume of the TV getting louder, but before she could come up with a reason, she felt two hands wrapping at the back of her head. A strain of fear passed through her, but it was already too late to react as he pushed his cock into her throat mercilessly, passing through her throat. </p><p>She had always hated deep-throating, even when she was in college, well aware that it was just another way for males to feel dominant. The fact that she was actually being dominated did little to take the sting out of that fact. She would have liked to push him away, but she was busy with something much more important. To keep her voice low. The TV was masking the unwitting gagging and wheezing that was escaping her throat, but only up to a point, forcing her to use the entirety of her focus to control her voice. A fact that didn't make any easier with her cut breath, making her lungs burn painfully, and her sight blotted.</p><p>She wasn't proud of the fact that the first emotion she felt when she felt his shaft throbbing deep into her throat, filling her mouth with a viscous liquid, was a satisfied relief. Though understandable, considering she managed to avoid alerting her husband throughout her torture.</p><p>But she met with a thoroughly unwelcome sight when she looked upwards. Erik’s face, adorned with a smug smile, she was expecting. The phone in his hand, much less so. “Nice camera presence,” he mouthed silently, shaking the camera jokingly as he pulled his shaft out of her mouth, leaving her frozen with cum dripping from her lips. </p><p>She was filled with a red-hot helplessness, humiliating bright enough to suppress her desire to stab him. She couldn't even tell, or attempt to take the camera. It would be hard to explain to her husband why she was wrestling with Erik bare-chested while a suspicious pearly liquid stained her lips. So, she said nothing, just pulled the dress up, stood up.</p><p>The mystery of her husband's awareness revealed itself. Her husband was passed out drunk, his mouth open wide, his snores hidden by the volume of the TV. She felt a stab of anger worming itself into her heart. It wasn't her husband's fault, other than drinking like a frat boy, but nevertheless, he was a convenient target to her rage.</p><p>Then she realized the opportunity generated by his untimely unconsciousness. She turned back, and grabbed Erik’s phone off his hand, and before he could react, she slammed it on the ground, blasting it to the smithereens. She sent a smug smile to Erik. “I think that’s enough for the dinner, you can see yourself out,” she said, the sense of victory coloring her tone. Then, she turned and started climbing the stairs. Her sense of victory wasn't entirely warranted, she knew, but after the horrible night she suffered, every bit counted.</p><p>     *****     *****     *****</p><p>Sarah wasn’t feeling very energetic when she woke up, alone since she hadn’t bothered to wake her husband up. A horrible night’s sleep on the couch was the least he deserved after leaving her at the mercy of his rival, focusing on a bottle of scotch instead. She licked her lips, still tasting the pungent aroma of Erik’s cum despite the hours passed and the several rounds with mouthwash. She was sure it was physiological rather than physical, but it tasted disgusting nevertheless. </p><p>Normally, she would have changed into something more attractive. It was the usual weekend ritual in their home, starting the holiday with some hot action. However, she was not feeling charitable enough after the horrible night she had experienced, still present in her memory. So, she just pulled a morning gown over before walking downstairs. </p><p>She wasn’t exactly surprised to see her husband sitting on the couch, trying to rub his head in a desperate attempt to bring some relief, beset by the hangover that remained from the last night. “Morning,” she said, intentionally loud. </p><p>“Could you speak a bit softer please, honey,” Thomas answered. “My head is killing me.” </p><p>“How surprising. You barely drank anything,” Sarah responded, not breaking her stride towards the kitchen, not feeling even the slightest bit of mercy towards her husband. </p><p>“You don’t have to be such a bitch about it,” her husband murmured. </p><p>Sarah felt her anger roaring into an inferno with his words. It wasn’t enough that he had chosen a horrible business partner which caused the most humiliating moments of her life, and spent the night drunk instead of focusing on the deal that was supposed to save their business, but he was also trying to act like he was the victim of the circumstances. “I don’t?” she shouted. “Even when you spent the whole night drinking instead of signing the agreement that was supposed to be vital.” </p><p>A panic went through Thomas’ face. “Didn’t we sign the agreement? Shit!” With panic, he reached for his phone, trying to call Erik. Sarah walked back to the kitchen, knowing that Erik wouldn’t be able to receive the call with his phone destroyed. She wanted her husband to suffer a bit. It was the least he deserved. “By the way,” she said as she walked out of the kitchen, carrying a green smoothie she prepared for herself. “I remember his phone falling last night. Maybe it broke down or something. Have you tried calling his office?” </p><p>“Why didn’t you tell it earlier,” her husband tried to berate her, but she just shrugged and walked outside. She wanted to relax a bit next to the pool, enjoying the soft breeze, getting her mind away from the last night’s disgrace. But that was not to be, proven when her husband came to their back-garden, his eyes squinted in a vain attempt to avoid the bright sun. “I managed to reach Erik. He is inviting us for lunch to sign the agreement.” </p><p>“Us? Can’t I just stay at home?” </p><p>“No, you can’t. He explicitly called you to thank you for the last night’s dinner, and I already accepted the invitation for you. Just go upstairs and change. We leave in ten minutes.”</p><p>“Of course,” Sarah spat as she stood up. “God forbid if you try to get a deal without parading your wife like a stripper.”</p><p>She started walking away without waiting for his answer. She wasn’t being entirely fair, she knew, but the anger and humiliation burning inside her didn’t allow for anything else. “Don’t play the martyr,” Thomas shouted from behind. “You just wore a short dress, it’s not a big deal. No need to exaggerate.”    </p><p> “I’ll show you what is a big deal,” she murmured in a tone that went unheard, determined to make her husband eat her words. Not to mention, they were going to be in a public place, meaning Erik would be able to do nothing but look longingly at something he was never going to taste anymore. With the deal about the be sign, and the video he took gone, he simply had no leverage he could use to solicit anything from her. With those thoughts in her mind, her hands reached for a short, plaid skirt, and a white blouse. Both were on the conservative side, but she folded the skirt on the waist a couple of times, shortening it effectively. A similar treatment to the blouse as well, popping a couple of extra buttons free, and the view was much more revealing than the poor material initially suggested, especially after she picked a set of lacy red underwear, much more fitting for evening fun instead of wearing under a white blouse. </p><p>She could see the anger flashing in her husband’s face as soon as she stepped into the living room. “What the fuck are you wearing?” he exclaimed. </p><p>“It’s just a short skirt, right? It’s not a big deal. There is no need to exaggerate,” she answered, mirroring her husband’s earlier comments with glee, underlining each word. </p><p>“Fine,” Thomas answered blithely, the realization clear on his face. “I don’t want to be late, let’s go.” </p><p>The drive passed in absolute silence. Suffering under a combination of anger and hangover, Thomas showed no inclination of speaking, a fact that suited Sarah just fine. The last thing she wanted was to talk as well. They arrived in the restaurant they were supposed to meet, a small but sweet French Bistro, and Sarah stepped out of the car, without even waiting for the valet to reach for the door, got off the car and walked towards the restaurant. She could see the burning jealousy in her husband’s eyes and understood that valet was busy watching her skirt dancing with each step. But instead of pushing it down, she put an extra swing to her every step. She didn’t like to be ogled like a piece of meat in the normal circumstances, but she was willing to make an exception to annoy her husband.</p><p>The waiter on the door was more professional, meaning he just spent several seconds examining her cleavage before pulling his gaze up, pulling the door open for her. She stepped inside, and Thomas was next to her a second later. “Please follow me, sir, madam,” the waiter mumbled, trying to deflect her husband’s gaze. A few seconds later, they were on a partially separated section, with Erik already waiting for them in the table. “Thomas, Sarah, welcome,” he said as he stood up.</p><p>Thomas shook his hand first, then Sarah pointed her hand towards him. She would have preferred not to let her hand in his clammy grip, but that would be hard to explain to her husband. She was glad that almost no small talk happened, with their attention stolen by the final agreement, going on line by line to ensure that they were aligned on the topics. She started to hope that Erik had gotten the message, and was going to leave her alone. She pulled her phone to browse the net.  </p><p>It didn’t take long for him to invalidate that assumption. She felt something rubbing in her inner thigh, too rough to be a hand. She turned towards the source, only to met with a smug smile. She let one of her hands sneak under the tablecloth, trying to push him away, but her struggle was in vain, even when she pushed harder than she supposed to. </p><p>“Is everything okay, honey,” Thomas said, the annoyance obvious on his face. It was less that he was trying to understand if there was something he could help, and more of his warning for her to stand still, not to distract him while he as busy with important stuff. She could have stood up and gone to the bathroom, of course, but she hadn’t wanted to risk the deal at the last minute. Just until they sign the deal, she repeated in her mind, again and again, trying to ignore his toe caressing the edges of her flimsy underwear. </p><p>She hoped that he wouldn’t go too far in a public place, a hope that had come empty a few seconds after its inception when his toe moved sideways until it was resting on her slit, separated by her flimsy underwear. Once again, she cursed herself for letting to be carried by a silly argument with her husband, leaving herself vulnerable for his predations. </p><p>“How is everything, Sarah,” Erik interjected. “I hope you are enjoying the lunch.” </p><p>“I can’t complain,” she answered, not bothering to force her expression to display anything other than pure contempt since her husband was captivated by the agreement, not bothering to turn towards her even when an involuntary gasp escaped her mouth. </p><p>Minutes passed where she silently suffered under Erik’s toe, and the slow tingling that was starting to fill her belly didn’t make her feel any better. Nor the sudden presence of the disappointment, flaring surprisingly in her as Erik and her husband signed the deal, and Erik pulled away. “I need to make a quick call to my lawyer,” Thomas said as he stood up, leaving them alone in the room. “I’ll be right back in two minutes.” </p><p>Her husband left, leaving her alone with Erik, who had a huge smile on his face. “You had your fun,” Sarah said in a scathing voice. “But the deal is signed, and your little game came to an end.” </p><p>“Oh, really?” Erik answered, his expression amused enough to worry Sarah. </p><p>Still, she bulldozed through the worry and answered with a tone that sounded much more confident than she was feeling. “It’s too bad that your phone had been broken in that unfortunate accident, right?” She smirked. “We might be talking a different game if you still had the video, of course. Maybe you should learn how to hold onto your phone.” </p><p>“It’s an interesting comment,” Erik said, pulling his phone out, obviously new, and pressed a few buttons. </p><p>Sarah felt her phone buzzing. “I don’t see what you expect me to do when you spam-” she started, only to be silenced by a soft gesture of his hand. </p><p>“I would check that message if I were you,” Erik said. </p><p>Her earlier confidence drained in an instant against the absolute confidence oozing from his eyes. She unlocked the screen and saw that she had received a picture from an unknown number. She tried to click, but with the sudden trembling of her fingers, she succeeded only in her third try. She felt the blood draining off her face. “How? Your phone was in pieces?!” </p><p>“I had to admit, it was a good thought,” Erik answered, his smile getting wider. “It’s too bad that my phone backs up automatically to the cloud.” </p><p>Sarah could feel her breathing getting out of control, her hands trembling. Without saying anything else, she stood up, and dashed towards the bathroom. Thankfully, it was empty. “Fuck. I’m a total idiot,” she murmured to herself. “What was I thinking, taunting him verbally, dressing like a slut.” She had a bad feeling about her future. </p><p>She decided to stay in the bathroom for several minutes in order to calm herself a bit. The last thing she needed was for her husband to see her ragged state and ask questions about it. But once again, her plans didn’t work like she expected, when she heard the door opening a few minutes later, revealing the last person that she wanted to see. </p><p>“You can’t be here,” she said reflexively as she took a step back. “It’s the ladies room.” </p><p>“Come on, Sarah,” Erik said as he slowly prowled towards her. “Such concerns are beneath us, with the closeness we are already sharing.” </p><p>“Please, we don’t have to do it,” she said, trying to convince him to change his mind, even though she had no intention of doing anything of sorts. </p><p>“Oh, I disagree,” Erik answered. “I was not going to do anything, but then you tried to mock me in your perceived stupid victory. Did you know I was going to let you free until you stupidly ran your mouth?” Sarah stood frozen, cursing her stupid pride. “But now,” he continued, close enough to put his hand onto her body. She watched his hand slowly drawing closer like a rabbit hypnotized by the approach of the snake, motionless. </p><p>He placed his hand on her chest, the flimsy fabric of her blouse affording her no protection. His fingers sank deep into her flesh, extracting a moan from her. She said nothing, consoling herself with the fact that her husband was at the restaurant, meaning Erik wouldn’t be able to keep her inside for long without triggering her husband’s suspicions. </p><p>Still, it was a small consolation when someone she despised was busy exploring her body without paying the slightest respect for her needs. Even worse, she could feel her body responding his touch, her breathing quickening due to something other than panic this time. Wanting it to end, she said nothing when his other hand slid at her back. It was too late when she realized his intention. His fingers were already around the clasp of her bra. He unlocked it one smooth motion, and his other hand slid through her cleavage, and pulled it off. “Much better, right?” Erik said, then chucked her bra into the trash can. </p><p>“What the hell!” Sarah shouted in a panic, a part of her mind trying to come up with an explanation to her husband, only to fail miserably. </p><p>“You look better like that,” Erik answered, his hands back on her chest, caressing it softly. “And I’m interested to see how you are going to explain the absence of your bra to Thomas.” </p><p>Shocked, Sarah barely reached when his fingers wrapped around her waist and pulled her towards the entrance. She just followed without any resistance, a part of her shocked at her own obedience. But she wasn’t able to focus on that, because as soon as they stepped out of the bathroom, they came across the same waiter that she saw at the entrance. His eyes dipped down after spending the second recording just who she stepped out with before sinking back into her breasts, his smile getting wider when noticed the obvious absence of her bra. She blushed, her free arm jumping up to cover up her chest. They continued walking through the corridor, but Sarah pulled her arm off his grasp. Things were hard to explain as is without him holding her. </p><p>She decided to frame it as another attempt to make him jealous. It was going to cause a huge row, Sarah knew, but it was easier to explain than why she lost her bra to his new business partner. </p><p>More than one table was discreetly watching her as she returned the table. She was just glad that their table was relatively covered. Even more importantly, her husband was not there yet. She sat down, trying to slouch in a poor attempt to hide silhouette of her breasts, visible through the thin white fabric. “By the way,” Erik said. “Thomas already left, he had to visit the lawyer to finalize the deal. But don’t worry, I promised him that I’ll drop you home.” </p>
