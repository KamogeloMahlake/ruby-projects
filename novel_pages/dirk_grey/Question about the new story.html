    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello, everyone. </p><p>The previous poll I had about whether to have a new story, or focus on one of the older ones had been decisive enough to show the demand for a new story, which aligns with my own preference as well. </p><p>Now, the hard part. I have a few stories that I'm excited to write about in equal amounts, so I want to ask for your opinions, at least about which general concepts feel more appealing. </p>
