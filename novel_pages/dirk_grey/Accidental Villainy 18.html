        <p>When I arrived back at the store, Tara was looking in the mirror at the deepest corner of the store, wearing a beautiful but conservative pantsuit. </p><p>Too boring. </p><p>I carefully positioned myself to catch the attention of the saleswoman without being noticed by Tara, and shook my head, signaling to her that I wanted something better for her. </p><p>The saleswoman must have guessed that it would be my reaction, as she pulled another blouse and a pencil skirt from the shelf next to her, along with a packed set of underwear. “Your suit is beautiful, but why don’t you try this one,” she suggested. “Just to have some options once your…” </p><p>“Boss,” Tara said, blushing, unaware that she had been subtly interrogated. </p><p>I made a mental note to train her about that kind of trick. It was a habit that was already problematic for a secretary to have … let alone a superpowered bodyguard. </p><p>But, just like the puzzle, it was a move for the future. </p><p>“Good. Why don’t you try it? You don’t even need to leave your dressing cabin,” she said as she led Tara toward the corner one, one that I could slip in without anyone else noticing. </p><p>It seemed that I wasn’t the first business owner who brought my secretary for such meetings. </p><p>Fun. </p><p>“But, how is he going to see me in them if I don’t go out,” she whispered. </p><p>“Well, you can always send a picture of yourself,” she suggested, making Tara blush and fall silent. I had to admit, the saleswoman knew exactly what she was doing. </p><p>She earned herself another tip. She said nothing as she led Tara to the dressing cabin, who locked the door. Twice</p><p>I walked to the saleswoman, who greeted me with a victorious smirk. I passed another hundred. She passed me a master key that every employee had to unlock the cabins from outside. “I need the key back, and try not to make too much noise, or the security has to intervene,” she said. </p><p>I just nodded and walked toward the cabin she occupied, listening to the subtle sound of the movement, wanting to time my approach perfectly. It was a pedestrian way of using a superpower … but it wasn’t like I could use it to throw cars around. </p><p>I carefully unlocked the door once the sound of rustling stopped, and sneaked inside. I locked the door behind me, expecting Tara’s reaction … which didn’t come, as she was busy examining herself in the mirror, fascinated. </p><p>Another point that needed to be trained. Situational awareness. </p><p>I didn’t say anything, watching as she twirled in front of a mirror, wondering when she would notice my presence, but, as we quickly neared half a minute mark, I started to doubt that she could do so without assistance. </p><p>Waiting was not a chore. Certainly not. </p><p>I let my gaze dip down, enjoying the glimpse of her beautiful legs wrapped in white stockings, one that ended up mid-thigh, but connected to the distinct presence of a garter belt. Amazing enough, then as I continued, I caught a glimpse of her pencil skirt, too short to be appropriate for any kind of real business. </p><p>Luckily, my bar had long lost its feature to be a real business. Most of the time, the doors would be closed, and I much rather prefer her that tiny piece rather than anything more boring — but I made a note to buy something more appropriate just in case.’ </p><p>With that done, I continued to climb, taking note of her blouse. White and transparent enough to give a glimpse of her skin, it was even more inappropriate than her skirt even discounting the incredible cleavage that left her bra visible for my gaze. </p><p>Altogether, it was an excellent choice. </p><p>She noticed my presence only when she twirled to check her back on the mirror. However, rather than gasping in fear, she tensed, ready to attack … before she noticed who was the one that was in the room with her, turned into a gasp. </p><p>Still, I made a note not to startle her. </p><p>“S-sir,” she stammered as she suddenly raised her arms to cover her chest, and her legs crossed, like I hadn’t seen her in much less. I said nothing, wondering if she would realize that. Her blush spread quickly, showing that she realized it … but was still somehow challenged more by her sexy clothes than her nudity.</p><p>Luckily, my power allowed her to read her reactions quickly, giving insights into her reaction, probably more accurate than she knew herself. And, now, as I looked at her, I could feel the way her shoulders dropped slightly, suggesting a lack of confidence, like she was just an impostor, trying to look like something she was not. And, along with that, there was a lack of confidence, subconsciously thinking that she wasn’t beautiful enough to be worthy of such clothes. </p><p>It wasn’t hard to connect the dots on top of those impressions. I could easily see that her concerns weren’t just about the revealing state of her dress, but also the sophisticated nature of them — at least from the perspective of a farm girl. </p><p>Growing up on a ranch, she was comfortable in a rundown bar — which didn’t have any nice implications about the general quality of my place, not that I was unaware of it — but she felt out of place in an expensive clothing store, wearing sexy city clothing. </p><p>How fun. </p><p>“Do you need any help with your clothes?” I said as I took a step closer. </p><p>“N-no, sir,” she admitted, before she realized the implication of that suggestion, regret mixing into her expression. </p><p>“Do you want help, then?” I added. As much as teasing her about her reflexive answer was tempting, she was clearly feeling too self-conscious about the situation, and teasing her further wouldn’t have helped. </p><p>She paused for a moment, catching my gaze for a moment, then avoiding it even faster. “Y-yes, sir,” she admitted. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I took a step closer, enjoying the heavenly sight in front of me. I made a gesture, asking for her to twirl. She followed that order immediately, showing that her personal crisis was nowhere near as strong as her desire to obey. </p><p>Beautiful. </p><p>I stood in front of her, examining her beautiful face that dipped down to hide her intense blush, only to make her even cuter. I let the silence rule the room for a while my gaze crawled down, enjoying the depths of her cleavage, giving a glimpse of her areolas, a little pink line peeking from the side, multiplying the sexiness of her fair cleavage. </p><p>I had to admit, now that she was dressed properly, she looked fascinating. At that moment, I was glad for her horrible fashion sense, as otherwise, she never would have made it to my bar. </p><p>My luck might be horrible, but it had its own perks. </p><p>“Now, let’s see if this clothing could handle some heavy-duty work,” I said as I put my hand on her shoulder. “Are you ready?” </p><p>I loved the contradiction she was displaying. She was too shy to speak, yet her enthusiasm was clear in the way she nodded enthusiastically. </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I dragged my hand down, disappearing into her beautiful cleavage while she shivered desperately. </p><p>She dipped her head even lower as I enjoyed her perky breasts. I wanted to watch her expression, so I put my hand under her chin to raise it. The moment I touched, her lips parted in anticipation, turning into an invitation I was helpless to resist. I was planning to deliver a playful lesson about how to be a good secretary…</p><p>But my own lips rebelled against my order, moving forward to land hers, my tongue invading her beautiful mouth. I didn’t miss the hesitant glare she had thrown toward the door, but that tenseness didn’t prevent her from responding to my invasion, turning it into a beautiful dance. </p><p>A beautiful whimper escaped her mouth as my hand started to move lower, compromising her shirt’s already limited capability to keep her breasts hidden. A beautiful sound. </p><p>When I finally pulled back, she was frozen for a second, her wet lips parted, tempting me to push forward, and her nipples peeking free after my touch pushed her bra down — not much, just slightly, but it was enough. </p><p>It took a second for her to realize the state of her top, which added to her blush, but she made no move to fix it despite her constant hesitant glances toward the door. She was uncomfortable about the location, but not enough to actually ignore my implicit orders. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>“Now, it passed the first test, but we need to make sure it’ll hold against the more heavy-duty aspects of the job,” I said, and she trembled. </p><p>“Bend down,” I ordered. </p><p>She did, her already short skirt riding up to reveal a beautiful surprise. She was wearing a garter belt…</p><p>But her panties were absent. </p>
