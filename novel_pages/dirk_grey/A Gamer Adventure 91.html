        <p>On my lap, Helga’s smugness was almost palpable, highlighting her position on my lap as the superior case, like she was sitting on the throne of a queen. It would be a lie to say that if I didn’t puff up my pride. “Oh, Caesar, you’re so hard,” she gasped, unnecessarily loud under the current circumstances, clearly aimed at Cornelia’s jealousy rather than the pleasure she was feeling at the moment. </p><p>Under different circumstances, I wouldn’t have let that go without making Helga pay for such shenanigans, but considering her warped relationship with Cornelia, I decided to allow it. It was a good way to initiate a controlled confrontation between them. </p><p>And if Cornelia got competitive to steal the throne, well, I saw no drawback in that. </p><p>Cornelia didn’t look ready to act, at least in the beginning, so I turned my attention on Helga while Cornelia made up her mind. My fingers found the zipper of her skirt, and after a pull and a brief tumble, it was removed as well, and since her panties were already around her ankles, revealing her smooth crotch. Her corset was the only piece of clothing she had on her. </p><p>A silence filled the room when I pulled my shaft out, and slid between her plump thighs, her wetness rubbing against the topside. “So, Cornelia,” I said even as my fingers reached the strings that kept her corset in place, aware of Cornelia’s hungry gaze. After all, despite their rocky relationship, there was no doubt that Cornelia found Helga attractive —though I couldn’t help but think that Cornelia had a rather clear type she liked, as both Marianne and Helga was curvy and blonde— enjoying the way I was about to divest the last piece of clothing Helga was wearing to reveal her amazing tits. “Tell me, what do you think our plan should be?” </p><p>“Our plan,” Cornelia stammered, her eyes firmly on Helga’s cleavage, getting wider with every loosened string, her tits jiggling every time she moved up and down. </p><p>“Yes, our plan for the evening,” I repeated, using the tone of a disappointed teacher. “Try to focus, please, we’re dealing with something serious.” </p><p>The shape of Cornelia’s face was almost as enjoyable as the sudden tightening of Helga’s hips, enveloping my shaft within her plump thighs, who was clearly enjoying the teasing Cornelia was receiving. Though, if her vindicated expression was any indicator, she would have enjoyed even more if I had been resorting to chains and whips, but despite everything, Helga was a realist, willing to take whatever that was provided to her. “Sorry,” Cornelia stammered after a moment of silence, trying to get her grips with the situation, but failing rather spectacularly. </p><p>My presence, my relationship with Helga, the possible ambush she was walking in, and the show she was receiving… It wasn’t shocking that she was feeling a touch overwhelmed. I kept my gaze on her while my hands continued to work on Helga’s corset, and when I finally removed it, I threw it to Cornelia, which worked perfectly to pull her out of her dazed state. She pulled her eyes away from Helga’s tits, only to be caught by my gaze. </p><p>“Come on, why are you wasting our time? We’re facing a great disaster,” I said even as I cupped Helga’s breasts, making her moan gently. </p><p>“Sorry,” she stammered again. “What was the question?” </p><p>“The plan for the evening, about the possible ambush,” I said, not bothering to hide my mocking glare. To Cornelia’s frustration, however, I wasn’t the only one that was looking at her mockingly. Helga even let out a little giggle as she tightened the grip of her hips. While Cornelia tried to put together an answer, I squeezed Helga’s breasts, making her moan repeatedly. </p><p>“T-there’s not much we can do other than staying in defensive and saving most of our mana, ready for an ambush. We don’t know what we’re facing against,” Cornelia answered, managing to recover her calm after a slight stammer, trying to focus on the problem, which was rather hard with the amazing show that was going in front of her. Helga’s moans were getting louder as I teased her nipples, especially after she had established a quick silencing ward around the room, making sure that her commotion wouldn’t be heard by the rest of the inn. </p><p>“Really, that’s the best you can come up with,” Helga cut in, her voice rather louder than appropriate for a strategic meeting, but considering my fingers were dancing above her entrance, bringing her great pleasure, it was an acceptable flaw. </p><p>“Why don’t you show your ability, then,” Cornelia answered angrily, not appreciating the challenge she received. </p><p>“Sure,” Helga answered, her smile widening like she was waiting for that exact opportunity. However, rather than answering immediately, she raised her hips, only to lower them directly on top of my shaft, her wet lips enveloping my shaft. A loud grunt escaped my mouth, which might have been partially faked to annoy Cornelia further. Teasing her until she displayed her impotent anger was still fun, especially when her green eyes looked as bright as a forest fire. “Let me show you my skill,” Helga said as she lowered herself, taking half of my shaft in one smooth push. </p><p>“Go ahead,” Cornelia said, </p><p>“First of all, we need to assess the possible enemies. There are several options. They might have an undercover agent as a part of the group, they might have arranged a group of assassins on the mission location, ready to launch, or they might have been relying on faulty mission description, and the monsters in the location might have been much stronger…” Helga started, giving a rather detailed breakdown of the possible attacks. It wasn’t comprehensive, missing a couple of options, but considering she was trying to give said breakdown while trying to devour my thickness, it was an excusable oversight. </p><p>Especially since she was continuously receiving experience-gain notifications. I was increasing my mana transfer speed as I made sure there was no drawback to the process. </p><p>[-3721 Mana]</p><p>Cornelia didn’t seem to appreciate Helga’s relative eloquence, her face once again taking its usual stormy quality. Her hands twitched, signaling that she wanted to rely on her violent instincts to teach Helga a lesson, like all the times she had relied on that particular strategy, but my presence made that path impossible. </p><p>I wasn’t messing with Cornelia because it was fun. Well, at least, not just because it was fun. While the entertainment value of watching her usual arrogant attitude split between arousal and impotent anger was entertaining, I wanted her to have some experience reigning her anger. Otherwise, her uncle —who seemed to be a political animal based on my impressions— could easily manipulate her during their confrontation. </p><p>“So, Cornelia, what do you think our plan should be based on the updated risk assessment?” I asked even as I let my hands slip down Helga’s hips, leaving her amazing tits to dangle freely as she jumped up and down on my lap. Helga’s face was contorted with a smug sense of victory, complementing the thick layer of pleasure. </p><p>For a moment, I was sure that Cornelia would have exploded in anger, which would have disappointed me rather immensely. She even raised her hand like she was about to slap Helga, but then, she noticed my disappointed expression, and lowered her hand. “Good girl,” I said in approval, making her smile for a moment. </p><p>“We need to scout the area first…” Cornelia said, starting a lengthy tactical breakdown of the actions we could take, along with a detailed risk-benefit assessment, surprising me positively. Her explanation almost lasted ten minutes, near-flawless despite Helga’s increasingly frustrated attempts to distract her, ranging from heated kisses to earth-shattering moans. </p><p>She impressed me, because it wasn’t a dry explanation. She stood up at the beginning of her explanation, slowly unbuttoning the buttons of her robe one by one as she swayed with the music. Soon, her dark robe was pooled on the floor, revealing that she was only wearing panties and a corset underneath. “Daring,” I murmured, approving her approach to fashion —no matter how ill-advised was to dress like that for a mission— especially the way her black and crimson corset wrapped around her body, enhancing her cleavage spectacularly. </p><p>She might not have the spectacularly large bosom of Marianne, but that didn’t mean they weren’t gorgeous in their own way. She continued to dance as she explained, even shedding her panties, but deliberately leaving her corset on, which added to her sexiness. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said after her explanation finished, much to her satisfaction, and the displeasure of the blonde beauty that was doing her best to milk me, so much that if our relationship was any weaker, she would have walked away, or in minimum, exploded in anger. </p><p>“Thanks,” Cornelia said smugly, glad that she had managed to prove herself. </p><p>Helga wasn’t happy with the sudden reversal. So much that, even the fact that she had managed to gain a level while watching Cornelia’s delicious explanation didn’t manage to uplift her mood. She didn’t appreciate the sensation of losing, especially coming from someone she had positioned as a rival. </p><p>[Helga - Level 14/19 - 14%] </p><p>However, since lashing out was on her cards, she chose to channel her frustration in a different way. She cast a familiar spell on herself, cleaning and lubricating her backdoor entrance before a quick switch, enveloping me with her tightness despite the pained grunt that escaped her mouth. As far as distraction attempts went, it was a spectacular one. </p><p>Cornelia had many negative qualities. She was rash, quick to anger, and her perceptions were colored by a sense of superiority. However, no one could call her a quitter. Seeing the smugness on Helga’s otherwise strained face, she didn’t bother to comment, instead walked toward me in a deliberate slowness, her naked hips swaying with the grace of a dancer. </p><p>She was leveraging her recently-enhanced Agility to the limit, with rather spectacular results. </p><p>“Smug bitch,” Helga murmured as Cornelia climbed on the bed, hugging me from behind. </p><p>I silenced her with a stiff spank, making her ass jiggle beautifully. “Don’t be crass, sweetheart,” I said, which made Cornelia’s smug smile widen even more, which received a spank of her own. “And don’t focus on enjoying other people’s misfortunes,” I told Cornelia, before devouring her lips in a heated kiss. </p><p>It wasn’t the first kiss I shared with Cornelia, but it was the most heated one. Not only she was feeling aroused by the show she had been watching —not helped by her own striptease— but also she was fueled by the desire to prove her superiority to Helga. Her tongue danced freely, trying to dominate mine, the hopelessness of the skirmish doing nothing to blunt her enthusiasm.  </p><p>Helga was clearly unhappy with the shenanigans that were going behind her. Luckily, she had an easy solution for that. She stood up, only to make a half-turn before impaling herself with my erection again, facing me instead of pressing her back against my chest. The moment Cornelia pulled back for a breather, Helga took her place, her tongue just as aggressive. </p><p>“Bitch,” Cornelia murmured, but I could hear a faint hint of respect in her tone. The fact that Helga was willing to confront her directly slightly changing her opinion. </p><p>However, she showed her growing respect in a surprising manner. While Helga continued to devour my lips, Cornelia’s hands passed around my torso landed between Helga’s legs, directly on her soft entrance, which was currently empty. </p><p>Helga gasped in shock as she felt Cornelia’s fingers slipping inside, reflexively pulling back. It wasn’t the first time she felt Cornelia’s touch, of course, but highly likely, it was the first time she felt Cornelia’s touch tenderly. </p><p>Cornelia just smirked smugly as she took back her place on my lips, her tongue battling with mine while she rubbed her body against my back, her hard nipples creating a delicious sensation. “Bitch,” Helga murmured, repeating the earlier insult, but with a broken voice littered with moans, as neither Cornelia nor I stopped the impaling her, the double-assault taking its toll. Meanwhile, I rewarded Cornelia with another flood of mana, the transfer eased further by my improving Tantric skills and the potency of my mana. </p><p>[-1491 Mana]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25 - 95%] </p><p>Helga wanted to counter-attack, I was familiar enough to read that particular conviction on her face despite the pleasure that flooded her, but as she moved closer to the edge, mounting a counter-attack was starting to get harder. </p><p>“I’m-Going-to-Make-You-Pay!” she managed to shout as Cornelia’s fingers disappeared deeper into her wetness, unable to prevent herself from crying in pleasure after every single word. Admittedly, my repeated spanks to her ass or my girth, stretching her puckered hole to the limits as I impaled her furiously didn’t help her much, especially when I picked up speed to turn it into a furious assault. She was getting closer and closer to a final explosion.  </p><p>“Don’t be impatient, sweetie,” I whispered to Helga’s ear when Cornelia pulled away from my lips to focus on the dance of her fingers, while using her free hand to grab Helga’s breast, squeezing mercilessly. “We’re about to switch, and you can do whatever you want after that,” I added, and Cornelia missed that particular discussion, too focused on the amazing perkiness of Helga’s tits. </p><p>[Achievement: Peculiar Pacification. Resolve an animosity between Companions in an extraordinary manner. +2 Endurance +500 Experience]</p><p>The notification of the achievement signaled Helga’s acceptance as much as her quickening hips did. She started to move up and down repeatedly, pushing me ever closer to my own climax, and when she finally tightened in a final manner, her voice filling the room, I was halfway in filling her entrance. Soon, she moaned and cried helplessly. </p><p>Cornelia was rather smug as she pulled back, watching as I helped Helga to lay on the bed, gasping desperately to catch her breath after her explosion. </p><p>She had no idea the intensity of the ride that awaited her… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 443000 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 39    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 32      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 5070 / 5070	Mana: 4126 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 14/19]  </p>
