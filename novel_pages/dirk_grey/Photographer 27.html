        <p>Since the encounter with Penny had ended without a true release to keep her wanting for more, I had found myself with a raging boner aching for a release. Luckily, I had the perfect person for me to handle that. The time it took me to return the rental car didn’t help my arousal any. </p><p>On my way to return, the arousal was starting to get rather unbearable. A quick look at the hidden camera feed I had installed revealed that Nicole was in the living room, with no sign of the girls. Katie was at her school, and it was still too early for Nancy to wake up. I wrote her a quick message. ‘I’m about to come back. Wear a French maid costume, and wait for me at the foyer,’ the message said. </p><p>I was pushing my luck. Nicole had impressed me with the extent of her submissiveness, accepting obediently no matter how much I had pushed her. But it was with one particular caveat. For the other encounters, I was next to her, pushing, dominating, and seducing as needed. </p><p>It was the first proper test of my remote domination. </p><p>Of course, I wouldn’t dare to do that without the cameras around the basement and the first floor, allowing me to observe the situation, ready to be involved in case of an emergency. </p><p>So, I was watching while Nicole lay on the seat in front of the TV, enjoying the silence of the house by lazing around. I couldn’t help but feel fascinated by her though, as even when wearing a boring pair of sweatpants and a loose t-shirt, she looked ravishing —though her obvious lack of a bra did play a critical role on that particular aspect.   </p><p>Then, her phone buzzed, and her expression transformed completely the moment she checked the screen, relaxation was replaced by panic, but I was familiar with her enough to notice the signs of growing arousal even through the imprecise eyes of my secret cameras. </p><p>I watched as her fingers danced on the phone screen, writing and erasing several messages, trying to compose an answer, but since my phone didn’t ring even once, it meant that she failed to find the elusive message she had been searching for. </p><p>I decided to cut her search short. ‘I will be there in five minutes,’ read my next message. Her eyes widened immediately as she read that, and a moment later, she was on her feet, dashing toward the basement, the urgency of the situation cutting through her fears. </p><p>I didn’t switch to the basement camera, not wanting to watch her as she changed clothing, mostly to maintain the mystique of the moment, just like anticipating a present on a Christmas morning. After all, due to my various jobs, I had managed to collect more than a few French maid costumes, spread along a spectrum of functionality and sexiness, some almost enough to be wearable while working as a proper maid, some excessive anywhere but a stage in a seedy strip club… </p><p>Unfortunately, Nicole stayed in the basement as I drove back, leaving me to suffer in anticipation. I was tempted to check the cameras to ruin the surprise, but after a lengthy struggle, I managed to resist the temptation. Though, I didn’t forget to send a reminder just before I took the turn that would bring me the street of the house. ‘Don’t forget to wait for me at the entrance,’ the message reminded her. </p><p>Still, until I pulled on the driveway, Nicole stayed in the basement. I was about to discard my little test as a failure when the door to the basement finally opened. She pushed her head out hesitantly, looking around to make sure the coast was clear, her body hidden behind the cover of the door. I put my phone back in my pocket at this point, wanting to see the costume she selected with my own eyes. I didn’t expect much though, not if she could dare to walk the common areas wearing it. </p><p>I grabbed my camera and walked to the front door, not even bothering to bring the rest of the items inside, my shaft throbbing hard enough to hurt. I couldn’t wait to rip whatever conservative costume Nicole had picked to wear. I knocked on the door, and she opened it… </p><p>Only for my mouth to fell open in shock. It turned out that Nicole hadn’t opted for one of the more conservative costumes, ones that covered her whole torso and had a proper skirt. Instead, she had gone to the other side of the spectrum. </p><p>Like most maid's outfit, it was black with white lace trim and a matching white lace headpiece, along with a pair of black fishnet thigh high stockings to complete the package, ending with stilettos. She also had a feather duster, implying a desire to work, no matter how improbable it was with the rest of her costume. More importantly, the costume also had a black satin ribbon choker, an under-appreciated but critical part of the French maid outfit. The choker was necessary to underline the subtle sense of ownership, which was the ultimate basis of the fantasy. After all, any lingerie would have shown more skin, but wouldn’t have matched the sexiness of the outfit. </p><p>Of course, the costume was lacking in several areas. For example, a backside, leaving her elegant back completely naked until where her panties started, wide enough to give a glimpse of the side of her boobs, removing any chance of putting on a bra to support her breasts —luckily, she didn’t need any support. </p><p>The second thing the costume lacked was a skirt that was long enough to cover her panties when she was doing anything other than standing completely straight. I could see her hands twitching, tempted to pull the costume down, but that risked pulling down the whole costume. It was already hanging on her body by luck and prayer, waiting for the slightest mistake to slide down, as it lacked any kind of strap to keep it up, leaving her elegant shoulders completely naked. Also, even without pulling the whole costume down, the cleavage was outrageous enough, with a line low enough to reveal hints of her areolas, and dipping even deeper in the center. </p><p>Altogether, she was far too sexy to be put in a fashion magazine. No, anything less than a tasteful erotic magazine would have been fined aggressively for putting her in. </p><p>Luckily, she was all for me. Putting her out for commercial shoots was one thing, but I had no intention of revealing her to the public truly. No, she was mine. </p><p>From her fidgeting, I realized that I had lost quite a bit of time examining her costume, which made her anxious. To my defense, the revealing costume was a perfect fit for her curvy figure, especially with my raging arousal. “Shouldn’t a maid greet the owner of the house?” I suggested with a smirk, clutching on the role-play to muddy the supposed power balance between the landlady and the houseguest even further. </p><p>She blushed at my words, but that didn’t prevent her from stepping into my arms after I parted them invitingly. Her slender arms wrapped lightly around my waist, while I chose to go even lower, and my hands landed on the naked cheeks of her plump ass, checking her panties. At first, I thought them absent, but as I continued to explore the expanse under the deficient cover of her skirt, my fingers finally caressed it, which was barely more than a thin string struggling not to disappear in her cleft. A g-string was braver than I had expected. </p><p>To make it a proper greeting, I leaned and captured her lips, my tongue darting out. Surprisingly, it discovered hers halfway, creating a mini-embrace, no less delicious. Curious at her sudden show of initiative, I didn’t press further, only for her to run her tongue across my lip. I let her take control of the kiss completely, and her tongue continued darting forward, playing with my tongue and lips. Her arms around my waist tightened, pulling me closer. While I felt the pressure of her spectacular tits on my chest along with her deepened breathing, I spent my time deepening my grip on her plump ass. </p><p>We continued to share the kiss for gods knew for how long, shivers were running up and down my spine from the combination of her tongue and hands. From her excited humping, I could see that it was even worse for her. Apparently, my repeated efforts finally managed to awakened her arousal completely, so much that I didn’t need lengthy foreplay disguised as a photoshoot to get her motor running. Just ordering her to dress like a slut was enough. </p><p>She squeaked as I pinched her ass, but continued to kiss me for another minute before pulling back, proving that it wasn’t just her sense of obedience that was enabling her lewdness. </p><p>After the kiss stopped, I left her behind and walked toward the couch in the middle of the room, plopping myself down, much to her shocked look. “A-aren’t we going to have a photoshoot?” she asked as she walked closer, her eyes slipping toward the basement door, her fishnet-clad legs trembling in anticipation. </p><p>“No,” I answered even as I smirked at her, enjoying the way her beautiful eyes widened. “I wanted you to change because I wanted some eye candy as you cleaned up.” </p><p>“But …” she murmured, her shock palpable as her expression cycled while she tried to complete her words, only to fail halfway. “What if Katie comes home early, or Nancy wakes up?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, you better work fast, then,” I suggested. There was nothing preventing Nicole from walking away after slamming the duster in my head, but also, there had been nothing that forced her to wear the sluttiest maid costume she could find; other than her own desires, as evidenced by the wetness on the center of her panties, visible whenever she walked. “Why don’t you start by dusting,” I offered. </p><p>Her expression of indecision barely survived under my decisive gaze. “A-as you wish,” she murmured. </p><p>“Is this the way a maid should talk the master of the house?” I suggested, feeling lucky enough to push my luck even further. </p><p>“I-I’m sorry, sir. As you wish, sir,” she said, her smile surprisingly wide after I nodded. When she walked toward the nearest table with her duster raised, there was a palpable spring in her steps. She started dusting the place obediently, keeping her attention on the task, but that didn’t prevent her from providing me an excellent glimpse whenever she tried to reach something, whether she was facing me or her back was turned against me. </p><p>Initially, I was planning to tease her a bit more, maybe take a bunch of photos for my private collection, but the view of her ass, straining her g-string as if it was trying to escape its confining prison managed to change my mind. Five minutes of watching her clean were all could handle before I decided to act. “Bring me a glass of scotch,” I ordered her. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she gasped, her voice tinged with arousal, recognizing the signal hidden in the change in tone. She went to the kitchen, her hips dancing temptingly. It might be hard to walk unsexily with a micro-skirt and a pair of stilettos in the first place, but Nicole really turned the heat up to eleven, her ass dancing with every single step, begging for me to stand up and take her on the kitchen floor. I managed to resist, but it was a close call. </p><p>From the rare hint of smugness flickering on her otherwise obedient expression as she walked toward me, carrying a generous glass of scotch, with no ice just like I liked. “You think you’re clever, don’t you, teasing your employer like this,” I whispered, and she smiled softly, but not completely free of smugness. </p><p>“If my employer has a problem, maybe he could punish me in his bedroom,” she whispered. </p><p>“Good idea,” I whispered, and her smile widened. “Only partially, though,” I added, and her smile flickered. </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>“Since I’m your employer, I don’t need your opinion about the best place to punish you. And I’m not in the mood.”</p><p>“But…” she whispered, her smile erased by panic, but her arousal stayed constant. “What if the girls come early…” </p><p>“Not my problem,” I answered immediately, aware that I was once again pushing my luck, but from her reaction to the maid costume, I was reasonably sure that it would be successful. “You should have thought that before teasing your employer. Now, on your knees,” I said. </p><p>“But…” she repeated, but her halfhearted complaint didn’t have the slightest importance, not when she followed my order after a second of delay, and crouched in front of me, the angle giving me a perfect view into her cleavage. </p><p>It was going to be fun… </p>
