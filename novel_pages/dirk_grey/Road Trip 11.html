        <p>Unlike the previous times, I didn’t bother to leave a gap in the curtains. After everything that happened, her visit was inevitable. </p><p>The lights went off almost immediately. Then, she pulled my curtains open barely ten minutes after I faked going to sleep, immediately following my first fake snore, not even bothering to check whether I was fully asleep. Her usual caution was abandoned to the winds, which wasn’t surprising considering she had turned into a bundle of nerves thanks to the combination of her revealing clothing and my extended teasing. </p><p>However, keeping my reaction hidden as I watched the curtain being pulled from my cracked eyelid took everything I possessed.  as she pulled the curtain open to step into the area I deemed as my bedroom. I was expecting her to be either naked, or still wearing the same clothing she had been wearing ten minutes ago. </p><p>Instead, she met in the middle of those two options, dressed only in her lingerie. The same red, transparent lingerie she had been wearing during the day, which enhanced her deliciousness several times. The transparent fabric of the bra was barely able to contain her huge breasts, just adding a nice red hue to her fair skin. And that was before her nipples rebelled, doing their best to cut through the fragile fabric. And in the darkness of the room, her rosy areolas looked as beautiful as a poem. </p><p>Her panties were even better. The same fabric that struggled to contain her breasts fared no better in containing her plump ass, stretched to the limit the best way possible. And factoring in the fact that after a day of extended denial, her panties were absolutely drenched, making the transparent fabric almost non-existent in certain places, revealing her smooth core my pleasure. </p><p>Once again, I watched her beautiful body in fascination, unable to believe that somehow these high school boys failed to discover the treasure that lay beneath just because of their chase of more popular. </p><p>Well, their loss, my gain… </p><p> Despite her courage in the way she dressed, she was still careful as she pulled off my blanket, revealing my erection, which was still hard. It would have been suspicious, if it wasn’t for the fact that her whole frame of reference consisted of other times she sneaked into my bed, therefore assuming that a full mast while sleeping was completely ordinary. </p><p>I waited silently as my naughty goddess climbed on my bed once again, as silent as she could manage, uncaring just how much her movements stretched the capabilities of her underwear. Still, she surprised me immensely when she pressed her weight against the side of my shaft, giving it a nice caress with her wetness as she slowly moved up and down, her flimsy panties only thing preventing an accidental slip. I was never as glad to convince someone I was an unbelievably heavy sleeper. </p><p>As she moved up and down, her eyes were firmly shut under the rush of pleasure, allowing me to open my eyes to watch the full glory of her act. It was risky, that if she opened her eyes, I could have been caught easily, but watching her barely contained breasts jiggle was worth it, especially when the moonlight added a beautiful sheen to her skin, making the moment ethereal and erotic at the same time. </p><p>She was rather careless as she leaned forward, putting her hands on my chest, along with enough weight to wake up any sleeping person. But, lost in her desires, she didn’t care about the significance of it. She leaned harder and harder against my chest for a while, not caring that maybe she might wake me up. </p><p>I was struck with a desire to grab her wrists and pull her on the bed next to me, educating her about the risks of awakening the sleeping lion. It wasn’t the first time I was struck with that thought, but unlike the other times, I seriously started to consider it when she pulled one of her hands away, and it landed on her breast. She started caressing herself as her hips moved thirstily. </p><p>However, I was glad that I managed to hold back, because it seemed that it was just the start of the show. She bent down until her tits rubbed against my chest, the silky texture of her bra no better to separate our skin than her panties, existing there just to enhance the sensation. She started to move upwards, pressing her tits against my chest at first, but then, she started to climb upward. I kept my eyes firmly shut at that point due to our closeness, but I didn’t need my sight to know what she was doing when I could feel her globes caressing my neck at first, then my face got buried in the amazing pillow created by her cleavage. </p><p>For a fleeting moment, I was absolutely sure that I had died, and went to heaven. The touch of her breasts was just that soft. I let my lips move, faking the mindless movement of a sleeping person, giving myself an excuse to leave a lingering kiss on the edge of her areola, half an inch away from her nipple. </p><p>When she pulled back, I didn’t felt a sense of disappointment, mostly because her hips started to gyrate with a renewed fervor, tempting me to reach my wallet, pull a bunch of bills, and start squeezing her body while using tipping as a transparent excuse. </p><p>She proved that I wasn’t the only one feeling captured in the naughty scenario, because she reached to her back and unlatched her bra without stopping her breasts. It slid a bit, but her arms were ready to catch it, somehow enhancing the scene further by hiding the sight of her rock-hard nipples for a moment. Her hips continued to move more rapidly, torturing my shaft while she let her bra slid lower inch by inch, before ultimately letting it go. </p><p>It fell on my chest carelessly, but once again, Anna looked uncaring about the risk of waking me up, convinced that I slept like a rock. For a smart girl, she knew how to trick herself if it was for her benefit. </p><p>Her topless, grinding dance continued. Objectively, it wasn’t the smoothest lap dance I had ever received, but her amateurish abilities didn’t detract from the moment. On the contrary, knowing that every passionate swing of her hips was fueled by real emotion made it ten times better than any private show I could acquire, no matter how beautiful was the stripper, or how fancy was the club. </p><p>Now naked, her firm breasts started to sway freely with every repeat, creating a sense of motion I wanted to capture with my thick fingers, getting lost in the depths of her flesh. Her wetness that drenched her panties and my shaft alike didn’t help me to quench that desire either. She continued to rock her hips for the next several minutes, her eyes firmly closed to enjoy the sensation, allowing me to observe her show with open eyes. </p><p>I bit my lips in an effort to keep in a grunt. I was so tempted to cut through the veneer of acting to confront her, to push her to the ultimate end. I never felt such a sharp desire for someone to envelop my presence so acutely, the need burning my heart like a forest fire, wrapped around like scorched chains. Somehow, however, I managed to tap into the same well of willpower that kept me on track on my career rather than turning into yet another drug-addled bodyguard or a lazy waiter that hoped for the ultimate break to save his dreams to become an artist. </p><p>However, it was hard, especially when I felt her legs tightening around my torso, her body hit with a shattering orgasm that made her gush like a broken tap, drenching my crotch completely. Her hands landed on my chest carelessly once more as she tried to balance herself, her weight acutely present on me. All it would take was a sleepless move, and it would be skewered inside her, making her mine…</p><p>Luckily —and unluckily at the same time— she stood up before I could act. A part of me —a small, clinical part that drove me to make new year commitments— was glad, but that part was drowned by the intense desire I felt. Luckily, she was walking away. </p><p>Or so I thought when she turned her back… Only to be surprised when her fingers were hooked around her wet panties, pulling them down with a deliberate slowness that could have driven me crazy even without revealing the unobstructed sight of her smooth lips and her boundless yet firm ass. I expected her to drop them on the ground then go to the shower, only to be surprised at both counts. She grabbed them firmly in her hand, and she once again turned to face me. </p><p>Surprised, I was late to react, closing my eyes only after she completed her turn. Luckily, the moonlight wasn’t the brightest source of light, and more importantly, her attention was on my glistening shaft —her parted lips giving me an idea about what she had in mind— to notice my eyes. However, even then, she managed to compound my surprise by climbing on the bed again rather than reaching from the side, showing absolute confidence that I would continue sleeping. </p><p>Though, admittedly, since I ‘slept’ through her latest treatment, it wasn’t absurd for her to think so. </p><p>Even better, rather than facing the same way I did, she chose a different way, instead of positioning her hips over my chest while her lips pointed at my shaft, in the delicious position of sixty-nine. Everything was ready to push for the next step, the temptation burning brightly. She proved that she was doing her research by wrapping the base of my shaft with her still-wet panties, while she slowly lowered her lips, her breath caressing my throbbing shaft.  </p><p>Thanks to the limited line of sight the position granted to her, my eyes were once again wide open, enjoying the amazing sight of her parted legs, which spreading her nether lips slightly without the pressure from her thick thighs. Her arousal smelt sweet, reminding me of fresh strawberries, tempting me for a taste. When her tits pressed against my stomach and her lips enveloped the crown of my shaft, however, I was unable to resist the temptation for more than a second. </p><p>Her hips were low enough so that all would it took for me to caress her sweet entrance was to raise my head slightly, and let my tongue darted out. The only knowledge that kept me chained was knowing if my tongue touched at her entrance, she would have jolted away like a scared lamb, sentencing my poor throbbing shaft into a horrible fate. </p><p>Unknowingly, she provided me with a consolation prize. As one of her hands stayed around the base of my shaft, moving up and down in a desire to make me explode, the other landed in between her trembling nether lips, slowly caressing as she tried to push for the second climax of the day. My shaft moved deeper and deeper into my mouth, to a point that her lips were repeatedly hitting the thumb of the hand she used to pump my shaft. </p><p>Once again, she proved the determination that allowed her to attain the perfect grade record, and pulled away from the obstructing hand —only to land on her breast, squeezing her nipple— and swallowed even more of my shaft. She wasn’t smooth, but her desire and determination were once again more than enough to smooth her technical failings. The vacuum of her mouth enveloped most of my length, her tongue assisting occasionally. Considering the impressiveness of my length and girth, it was a true achievement. </p><p>It was like being trapped in a silk furnace, hot and soft at the same time, generating unlimited pleasure as she bobbed her head, her moans buzzing gently. When the head of my shaft finally hit the entrance of her throat, she pulled back, discouraged by her loud gag, but before I could even feel disappointment, she repeated the attempt again… Then again…</p><p>Soon, she was close to deep-throating my shaft successfully. If only my hands were near her beautiful blonde hair, ready to give a little assistance for her to achieve her aim… </p><p>When she finally pulled back and stood on her knees, I felt disappointed, thinking that she was sufficiently satisfied with her oral fixation. A second later, I realized that I was right, but not in the way I had been fearing. She moved forward along my belly, her core dripping a complete track, until finally, she had my shaft under her once more. Unlike the previous time, however, she aligned herself perfectly, that if she moved slightly down, she would have skewered herself. </p><p>“So big,” she murmured as the crown pressed against her entrance, preparing to abandon her virginity. “It’s all your fault,” she added softly even as she continued to align my erection for the ultimate move. “If you didn’t treat me like I’m a beautiful girl, I wouldn’t be burning with a desire that was impossible to quench with just my fingers. Now, you need to pay.” </p><p>It was time to act, I decided. Our little game was fun, but we needed to have a talk before she took a step that she couldn’t erase.</p><p>“Thank you,” I said with a smirk even as I grabbed her waist, and pulled her to my side. She found herself lying next to me, while I enjoyed the way her eyes opened in shock, inevitably making eye contact. </p><p>“I can explain,” she muttered automatically, frozen as she lay next to me. </p><p>“Sure, go ahead,” I said, though made sure to smile to prevent her from collapsing in panic. As I expected, she failed to say anything at first, her smart brain trying to catch up with the sudden emergency. I made a show of sighing. “It seems that we need to talk.” </p><p>She just nodded, her beauty as tempting as an innocent angel that found herself in the lair of the devil, begging to be tempted… </p>
