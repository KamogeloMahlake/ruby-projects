        <p>“How about if I add ten thousand more, boys,” I said during another hand, slurring my words to show I was getting drunk. The mostly empty bottle next to me reinforced it further. </p><p>I decided to make a move, because when Tiffany turned the first three cards, there was an ace there, which guaranteed my victory unless they had revealed something ridiculous as four of a kind. </p><p>I had pocket aces, which was a bit more literal. I had literally stolen them during earlier hands, hiding them in my pocket, waiting for such an opportunity, but the boys hadn’t noticed it. Even Umi didn’t notice it, and her hands were still very close to said pocket as she gave me a slow handjob whenever she was out of the game by folding. </p><p>“That’s an excellent idea, sir,” Mark said. </p><p>Charlie didn’t share his idea and leaned to whisper something to him. Unfortunately, they were also drinking, and while they weren’t drunk, they were certainly tipsy, enough not to realize their whispers weren’t as inaudible as they might have liked. “Maybe we should stop. What happens if he doesn’t remember losing all that money, and refuses to pay,” Charlie whispered. </p><p>“Don’t be a moron. We’re not going to take his money, but generously forgive it, and he’ll be thankful enough to assign us better districts, and we’ll make more in commissions. The more he owes us, the better,” Mark said, his whisper equally ineffective. His plan was not terrible, but execution left much to desire. </p><p>Tiffany and Umi grinned mockingly, but neither said anything to protect them. </p><p>“Sure, boss,” Charlie said. </p><p>“Good, but I need a beautiful fairy to give me some luck,” I slurred as I let my gaze between the two, and tapped my lap. “Who will be the lucky one.” The silence that followed was beautiful. After all, what I was asking was absurd, yet they couldn’t say anything to me because I had the excuse of being drunk. “I think it’s only fair for you two to decide it,” I added as I pulled a coin and flipped it.</p><p>Frozen by the sudden change, neither reacted until the coin could land on my palm, which I put on the back of my hand … but not before revealing the coin to Mark, knowing exactly how he would react. </p><p>“Heads,” Mark said. Charlie froze once I revealed the coin, unable to react to the sudden change. </p><p>“It looks like you’re the winner, my sexy secretary,” I said as I pushed my chair back slightly, careful to keep my boner hidden under the table to avoid some uncomfortable questions. </p><p>“Well, since my fiancee decided to put me as a bet,” she said as she pulled her blazer as tight as possible, and shifted to my lap. </p><p>“I … but … what?” Charlie stammered, trying to come up with an argument, but failed. It didn’t surprise me. Charlie was not a very assertive person at his best, and facing a crowd that was willing to ignore his opinion didn’t make him any more assertive. “Umi?” he asked. </p><p>“Oh, since my dear fiancee wants to use me as a bet, who am I to refuse,” she said. </p><p>Charlie looked at me, but an angry gaze from me was enough to dissuade him even as I slipped my hands under Umi’s blazer and caressed her belly directly. I didn’t need another reason to disrespect him, but I had one anyway. </p><p>He glanced at Tiffany, no doubt wishing that she was the one on my lap rather than his fiancee, but even in his tipsy state, he was able to realize it was an absurd point to take. Yet, he was still frustrated, so he turned to the only person he could. </p><p>His ally, who had just betrayed him. It was the reason I had used a coin flip and revealed that to Mark, who was too much of an opportunistic stain not to use the chance to keep his wife away from me while she was angry. </p><p>Too bad he was too late. </p><p>Charlie looked at Mark angrily, preparing to say something. “I raise my three grand,” I said, interrupting their romantic gaze. “How about you guys.” </p><p>I interrupted it because I wanted Charlie steaming, ready to take revenge. “Yes, sweetie, how about you?” Umi asked with a seductive tone, which impacted the mood even more as she rocked her hips, which felt amazing on my naked cock. </p><p>“I call,” Mark said, happy to keep his betrayal unmentioned. Charlie nodded as well but was nowhere near as happy as he pushed his chips forward. They pushed bravely because I almost lost thirty thousand, which was split between them. Three grand was nothing, particularly since I was a bad poker player, right? </p><p>As Tiffany added more cards, I was paying more attention to Umi than the cards, the results were already fixed, raising twice more. Then, Tiffany flipped the last card, and I cheated my way to victory with my three aces. </p><p>“Excellent, it looks like I was lucky,” I said as I pulled the pot in front of me, instantly recovering half of my losses in one hand. I grabbed Umi’s hair pulled it back, and kissed her neck while passing five hundred dollars worth of chips to her hand. “Your tip for my fortune,” I said, then kissed her neck. </p><p>Rather than keeping her moan in, Umi moaned. Charlie stiffened. </p><p>“Stay calm,” Mark said as he grabbed his shoulder, once again thinking that he was whispering. “It’s a good way to distract him. This way, we’ll win even easier.” </p><p>“It’s not your wife that’s on his lap, struggling to put on a brave face,” Charlie said. Tiffany barely held back her laughter at the absurdity of that statement. Umi didn’t try to laugh, but she was too busy not to moan as I continued to nibble her neck. </p><p>They looked at each other like they were about to fight, so I interrupted. I needed more than an inept boxing match between two skinny tipsy dudes to entertain me. “Deal another hand,” I ordered Tiffany. </p><p>Charlie was frustrated, but once again, he was unable to adapt quickly, which left his beautiful fiancée on my lap as we played. How unfortunate. </p><p>I lost next hand spectacularly, my ‘stupid’ move coinciding with Umi’s moan, which triggered another argument between the two about how to win, while the girls and I acted oblivious to it, like we were unable to hear them. </p><p>Meanwhile, while they argued, Umi rolled back her skirt until my shaft was not resting against the cloth of her skirt, but against her wetness directly. She moved back and forth with renewed passion, coating the side of my shaft with her juices. </p><p>Beautiful. </p><p>“… I just think it’s unfair,” Charlie muttered, trying to whisper, but once again, his voice was nowhere near as low as he thought. Meanwhile, I said nothing, enjoying Umi’s subtle dance. He spoke again once the hand was over, and he won. “Maybe Tiffany should take her place since I’m the winner,” Charlie said. </p><p>What a genius idea, I thought, but said nothing while Mike looked at him in shock. </p><p>Tiffany was the first one to speak. “He has a point, my dear husband,” she said. “After all, it’s not fair for Umi to be the only one to keep him happy, when you asked me to keep him satisfied … several times.” </p><p>Mark blinked at the unexpected intervention, but when he Tiffany’s vindictive smirk, he didn’t argue. “Well, I can’t argue with that logic,” he admitted, though it was like trying to pull a tooth, no doubt cursing himself when he first accepted that as a part of the game when he saw the opportunity to cheat on the coin toss, which allowed him to act as a bootlicker while making Charlie pay. </p><p>Only now,  he realized Charlie wouldn’t be the only one to pay. </p><p>Umi slid back to her seat reluctantly, while Tiffany took her place with relish. Her plied skirt was easier to manipulate than Umi’s pencil skirt, and it allowed her to pull her skirt away. </p><p>It wasn’t the only difference. Unlike Umi, who kept herself rubbing, Tiffany aligned herself against my shaft, and sank slowly, taking my shaft inside. Not all of it, as even with her wetness, it was not a challenge that could be taken easily.  Barely a  third, but it was still impressive that she managed to deal the next set of cards with a perfectly smooth expression that revealed nothing. </p><p>“Oh, what an interesting reveal,” she said softly, concealing a moan. Alright, not that smooth or perfect, but it was more than enough to trick the two tipsy men across the table, too busy looking at each other in anger,  frustrated with each other’s betrayal…</p><p>Unaware of the real betrayal that was going on. </p><p>It was quickly shaping up to be one of the greatest poker games I had ever played despite some stiff competition. Not the best, but certainly in top ten… </p>
