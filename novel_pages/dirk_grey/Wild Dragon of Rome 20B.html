        <p>As Lillian faced me, her beauty was captivating. She was wearing nothing but drenched and scrapped remains of her fancy dress, but as it gathered around her waist, somehow, it looked on her. Her arms were at her chest, trying to cover her breasts shyly, but not entirely succeeding. The droplets that remained of her magical bath made it look even more spectacular. </p><p>She was certainly blessed on the subject of curves.  </p><p>Yet, the sexiest part of her looks was her smile. Eager yet shy at the same time while she caught my gaze despite not having anywhere near a good view. “What are you waiting for?” she whispered. </p><p>“I’m trying to capture it for posterity,” I answered as I took a small step forward. She let her arms fall to her side, revealing her breasts for my hungry gaze. The next step came much faster. Then, she took a step of her own, making them tumble slightly. </p><p>I decided that using my new, enhanced speed was acceptable. I ended up in front of her. My arms wrapped around her waist, hers were only a fraction of a second slower as they wrapped around my neck, and I  felt her lips over mine. </p><p>Her breasts felt amazing as they pressed against my naked chest, and her tongue felt even better as it invaded my mouth, her passion burning a fire that was impossible to squish. I was lucky that she seemed just as reluctant to stop. </p><p>I stopped grabbing her waist tightly, but only because it turned unnecessary when she jumped and wrapped her legs around my waist. My hands started wandering around her body, enjoying her naked skin once more. I wanted to push her down and take her … but I also wanted the kiss to last forever. </p><p>A difficult dilemma. </p><p>Lillian decided to solve it before me. One of her hands wandered down, and tugged my pants, freeing me from the last piece of my clothing. I tried to replicate it by pulling her dress down, but I miscalculated just how poor the state of her dress was, and it just came off. </p><p>A problem … for the future. </p><p>I focused on the present, where my rock-hard shaft was locked between our bodies. I grabbed her hips and lifted her. “Slowly, I never…” she whispered with a sudden shyness. </p><p>I silenced her with a kiss, but I managed to clamp down on my burning arousal enough to slow down. Her reluctance would have been surprising — as Roman nobles were usually pretty hedonistic, with orgies treated as an acceptable social celebration — if she hadn’t already used a druidic ritual on me, showing their mixed cultural practices.  </p><p>Not that I was complaining. </p><p>We continued kissing as I pressed against her entrance, the tip slipping into her wetness. “Dance for me,” I whispered when I pulled for a desperate breath and continued kissing.  </p><p>The pleasure was incredible, but also the most uncomfortable. My body begged for me to push forward and take her, far stronger than I should be feeling even with her beauty. </p><p>It looked like I had some additional instincts I needed to deal with. </p><p>I knew I should have stopped, but as Lillian slowly pushed her hips down, devouring some of my length, that quickly turned impossible. Letting her pick the pace was all I was able to do to control those feelings, which soon turning into torture. </p><p>Luckily, Lillian was just as impatient. After a few gentle pushes, she suddenly pulled back with a beautiful, erotic smile on her face, and pushed her hips down, devouring me completely. </p><p>I kissed her desperately. Not to silence her — that was just a welcome side effect that kept us safe which I had forgotten momentarily — but to share my passion. Her hips danced up and down, each repeat driving my pleasure higher and higher. </p><p>The kiss was spectacular. </p><p>I had been determined to stay passive while letting her pick the pace, but that determination had been destroyed when Lillian pushed down again, taking my length fully. </p><p>“You have enough time to warm up, beautiful. Now, it’s my turn,” I whispered, my own voice feeling unrecognizable. A deep, desperate growl. </p><p>It made Lillian tighten even more. </p><p>I took another step, and trapped Lillian between my body and the wall, and started slamming inside her. Her moans would have brought the cave down if it wasn’t for my lips silencing her, they soon went into desperate wails. </p><p>Her hands landed on my shoulder, but rather than pushing me away, she pulled me even closer desperate. I shifted my hands to her hips, enjoying their incredible tautness while I also created better leverage. </p><p>I slammed inside her again and again, and soon, she started trembling, her wails turning into a listless yet erotic whimper. “Do you need me to stop?” I asked.  </p><p>“I-if you slow down, I will kill you,” she whispered. </p><p>“Well, who am I to refuse the orders of such an exalted noble —” I started to tease her, only for her to grab my hair and pull me into the kiss, not letting her lack of experience slow her down. I continued invading her with a merciless beat, exploring her depths.</p><p>It didn’t take long for her to regain her luster,  her hips moving passionately in an effort to let me join her. One of my hands traveled up, interjecting between our bodies as I finally grabbed her breast, sinking into its glorious depths. </p><p>“I've wanted to do that since I have seen you,” I whispered. </p><p>“While I — I tried to kill you,” she whispered. </p><p>I chuckled despite the overwhelming pleasure. “Well, not then, but soon after. Giving you that shirt was the hardest decision of my life.” </p><p>“Oh, true selflessness,” she whispered. “I think such chivalry deserves a reward.” </p><p>With that, she raised her hips before sinking down even more aggressively. Then again. And again…</p><p>Until I heard an explosion. I prepared to pull back, but just as I prepared, I felt some of my mana was following the movement of my seed. If I exploded out, we would get caught. Yet, it was too late to stop. I slammed inside her again, and filled her with not only my seed, but with my mana. </p><p>That triggered another climax. </p><p>“Was … that …” she stammered. </p><p>“No, not intentional. Another side effect. I’m sorry—” I started. </p><p>She kissed me again. “Don’t worry, I’m a healer. There won’t be any danger,” she whispered. I kept hugging her as we sat on the floor, still inside her. We both said nothing, then, she looked outside, where the sunlight was still coming in. “We can’t move until midnight, right?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes—” I said, only for her to push me down. </p><p>“Good. Then we can continue,” she whispered, and started riding me,  her beautiful tits dancing freely until I grabbed them… </p><p>I had to admit. Heroism had its benefits. </p>
