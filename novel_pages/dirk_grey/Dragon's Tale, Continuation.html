        <p>Hi everyone. Since Dragon's Tale had reached the end of its first arc, I wanted to check whether you guys are happy with the story. </p><p>Should Dragon's Tale continue to be the 5$ exclusive story, or should I replace it with a new story. </p><p>(If I remove it from the exclusive, it'll still continue, but in a slower pace like Dominating the boss or the Photographer, and I'll have another poll for the new story)</p>
