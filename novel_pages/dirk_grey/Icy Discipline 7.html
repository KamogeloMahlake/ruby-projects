        <p>“Okay,” Carly whispered, her tone split between fear and desire, which surprised me. </p><p>I expected her to resist that particular advance, maybe playing hard to get, but before I could cover the distance between our lips, she leaned forward, covering the rest of the distance. </p><p>Our lips touched, and before I could process her sudden speed, I felt an enthusiastic tongue probing my lips, asking for entrance. It was a shockingly clumsy move, though by no means it removed just how beautiful that move was, especially considering her identity. </p><p>I suppressed my desire to dominate her, enjoying her sudden initiative too much to ruin her enthusiasm. </p><p>A gasp escaped her mouth, one that I drowned with my lips enthusiastically, the rest handled by the noisy shower head. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I felt her hands on my shoulders, not even noticing the sudden absence of water as I worked on her beautiful lips. Her grasp on my shoulder slowly got stronger as the second passed, almost reaching a point I would classify as painful. </p><p>Almost, but not quite. </p><p>I decided to pay her back. But not directly by touching, remembering that just minutes earlier, my touch to her core was enough to trigger her escape. This time, I decided to use a different aspect. I pulled the shower head from its place, aiming at a certain part of her anatomy, which, without her panties to protect her, worked wonders to earn a moan. </p><p>She must have been even closer to the edge than I had assumed despite her earlier climax. The hot water blasted against her core, and a gasp escaped her mouth, though it was short-lived before my lips suppressed it. She didn’t climax, but her reaction showed that she wasn’t entirely too away from that point either. </p><p>Her tongue stilled in shock, so mine started to move faster to compensate, slowly invading her mouth, digging for moans. Under the blast of hot water, she was clearly getting closer and closer to a climax. </p><p>Since she had no complaint about the treatment, it was certainly tempting to continue until she experienced the second climax of the day, but sometimes, fortune favored the bold. I pulled back, just enough to pull my shaft away from her stomach. Her hands landed on my hips to pull me closer, clearly wanting that touch, but she lacked the power to make that work. </p><p>I bent my knees slightly before allowing her touch to succeed, a move that located my shaft between her legs. Unfortunately, not slipping inside her — as I felt it would be too exaggerated, especially if I was reading her lack of experience accurately — but pushing my shaft between her legs, rubbing the underside of her nether lips was still daring. </p><p>Daring enough to make her pull back from the kiss. I let her succeed, but caught her gaze, my expression sharp once more. “I’m just trying to make myself more comfortable,” I answered, my tone implying it was completely normal. </p><p>That was not normal, of course. Far from it, but the combination of the blast of hot water and the daze of our earlier kiss worked wonders to slow her decision-making. Though, arguably, it was actually normal compared to our earlier recreational room adventure. </p><p>“R-right—“ she muttered, which was all she was able to say before I leaned down and captured her lips once more. </p><p>Succeed bred success. It was a motto I believed in, so, even as one of my hands was busy holding her breasts, it still left my other hand free to work on her body, and it danced all around her body — except one particular part — hungrily. Caressing her waist, teasing her shoulders, digging into her breasts, ticking her neck… </p><p>All the while, my hips were rocking. Slowly at first, just giving a subtle teasing, almost unnoticeable compared to the blast of water, but my hips slowly picked up speed as my hunger started to grow and surpass my decision to play it slow — for a very loose definition of it. </p><p>Soon, I placed the shower head back in its place, giving my both hands-free reign on her body, my hips getting wilder and wilder, while my both hands focused on her extremely sensitive breasts. </p><p>Only when I let one of my hands drag down, invading the land her panties would have protected if she had been wearing any. She pulled back from the kiss, her eyes wide, but when I used the opportunity to slide down to her neck, she was helpless against a growing moan. </p><p>With the combined assault of my lips, my shaft, and my fingers, she lost herself in pleasure. Especially my left hand, caressing and teasing her clit repeatedly, circling around with an endless determination, teaching her a new meaning of pleasure turning her into a beautiful machine of gasps and moans. </p><p>Another climax was around the corner, so I was more than happy to silence her with a twist of her nipple when she tried to speak. “We need to —“ she started, only to fade into a moan. </p><p>“We need to, what?” I said, once again infecting that harsh tone to my voice, which took every single scrap of willpower I had to fake the great pleasure I was feeling. </p><p>“We—“ she said, which was all she was able to say before my fingers intervened, this time caressing her entrance aggressively. “That’s too much,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>“So, do you want me to stop?” I asked, and actually paused every single activity I was doing. </p><p>Her answer was decisive as the pleasure disappeared, leaving her on the edge. “No!” came it loudly, giving me the excuse I needed to start the next phase. I silenced her with another kiss as my fingers started every single inch of her body, pushing her steadily toward another climax. </p><p>One that didn’t take long for her to reach, another loud moan declaring its glorious arrival. </p><p>I pulled back as the orgasm hit her, this time even harder, making her have trouble standing even as she leaned against the shower wall, trembling helplessly. Yet, she failed, sliding down beautifully, and she found herself sitting on the floor. </p><p>I couldn’t help as a satisfied smirk invaded my face as I turned my gaze down, watching the trembling global model, a part of my mind wondering just how much money I would have made if I recorded the earlier show. </p><p>Yet, as she looked up with her trembling gaze, I had no intention of letting her stop, not with my throbbing shaft begging for more. “It’s time for payback,” I said as I leaned forward. ”</p><p>“How?” Carly murmured dizzily, her tone challenging me to explode, a challenge I barely succeeded. </p><p>“Simple,” I said as I continued to push forward. “Just open your lips.” </p><p>“But, I never—“ she whispered, which was all she was able to say before my crown pushed into her lips. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m a good teacher,” I said as I pushed forward, enjoying the way she was confused with her desires, obediently accepting my invasion as her tits jiggled. </p><p>I couldn’t help but grunt as I pushed forward, enjoying the warmth of her mouth as she devoured my shaft. “Feel free to tap my leg to show you’re too weak to handle it,” I said as I pushed deeper and deeper, enjoying the shocked shine on her beautiful lips. </p><p>I wanted to tease her a bit more, but as her warmth wrapped around me, it pushed me dangerously close to the edge, and with the amount I was backed up, there was no hope for me to actually resist for any amount of time. </p><p>Not with the beauty of the pouty lips around my shaft, grunting and moaning while they allowed more and more of my shaft inside. </p><p>Far more than I expected without tapping my leg, especially with her clear inexperience, showing that she was even more submissive than I expected. “Let’s see how much you can handle,” I said as I grabbed her head to prevent a painful hit before pushing forward. </p><p>The resulting gags were simply spectacular. </p><p>She didn’t manage to take all of it at once, of course, but it was not a simple achievement. I focused on the speed instead. Even more spectacularly, as I rocked back and forth, she didn’t tap my leg even once, allowing me to invade her throat despite her endless gags and gasps. </p><p>More endurance than I expected of her. She just accepted it, her shyness temporarily shelved as I lashed into her throat. I wished that I wasn’t already on the edge and could enjoy the sensation forever — or at least enough, such as until the inevitable heat death of the universe — but my body finally surrendered... </p><p>Naturally, I exploded in her mouth, filling her mouth to the brim. I didn’t even need to think. </p><p>“Swallow,” I ordered as I continued to throb into her throat, watching her neck move, still obedient. Her achievement wasn’t flawless, of course, as more than one drop slipped out of her throat, only to be dragged away by the still-running water. </p><p>Yet, she earned full marks in obedience and enthusiasm. </p><p>Altogether, an excellent start. </p>
