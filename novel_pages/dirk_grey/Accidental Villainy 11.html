        <p> Even as I stood up to position myself behind Tara, grabbing her hips softly, I couldn’t help but feel shocked. Every time I pushed her, my power-assisted reading was suggesting me to push her even more. </p><p>Many times, I questioned that read, but as I positioned myself behind her and grabbed her hips, it was yet to be wrong. And, now, there was only one step remaining. “Are you ready for the final step of our celebration,” I asked. </p><p>She just moaned rather than asking me to stop, or ripping off the belt that still kept her arms together, so I decided to take that as a positive answer. </p><p>I shifted a bit as I moved his cock forward, almost losing myself as I slid it between her cheeks, giving her one last chance to retreat. She moaned again. </p><p>Enough chances, I decided. My cock was hard as steel already, begging for me to stop playing and start working. </p><p>I pushed, finally enjoying her tightness properly, while she moaned, her body still trembling with her previous climax. Admittedly, as I started moving, I wasn’t too far from it. It was only sheer willpower that prevented me from exploding. </p><p>I didn’t want to climax before I brought her to another one. Another way to set my dominance — even if it was difficult for me. </p><p>Being the boss was not easy. </p><p>I clenched my teeth in an effort to control myself even as I pushed halfway in, her moans filling the office. Initially, I hated the old furniture and the dusty room, but I could see my attitude changing if I continued to accumulate such amazing memories. </p><p>I leaned forward, putting my weight into my pushes even as I cupped her breasts, my clutching fingers reshaping their perfection from the side. </p><p>Her hips gyrated in response, pushing me dangerously close to climaxing, but I let her do so. I wanted her to act like that more, not less, and admonishing her about it might have bounced back badly. </p><p>Her head turned slightly as she tried to settle into a comfortable position, her beautiful face contorted with pleasure. Her eyes were closed, her mouth half opened as she continued to moan, showing just how much she loved this particular aspect of her new role. </p><p>Though, along with her pleasure, there was a certain calm in her expression. I loved the pleasure, but calm, I wanted to destroy. So, I pushed forward with a sudden recklessness, invading her core fully. </p><p>Her eyes jerked open in shock. “Don’t tell me you can’t handle it,” I said with a chuckle, spanking her as I said that. She moaned, yet her head rose slightly and shook, confirming that she had no intention of stopping. </p><p>Not that it came as a surprise. </p><p>I tightened my grip on her hips before I started moving even more aggressively, earning a chain of moans. Her hips jerked helplessly while her expression changed, her eyelids half-closed, her mouth open even wider. </p><p>Her hips moved and rotated a I disappeared completely inside her, the sound of rhythmic slapping filling the room, steadily picking up speed. The only problem, moving at that speed was making the situation much harder to resist. </p><p>I slowed down slightly, trying to catch my breath — cursing the fact that my powers didn’t include endurance — when she chose to suddenly rebel.</p><p>Well, the best way possible, pushing her whole body back as she impaled herself on my hard cock. Clearly, she had no intention of stopping, and I would be a poor dom if I let her finish by herself. At the risk of my self-assigned game, I grabbed the belt — that was still around her hands — tighter, using it as leverage as I invaded her core. </p><p>No longer in control of myself, I sighed as I matched her movement, responding to her pushes with thrusts of my own.</p><p>One thing was clear. Tara was the greatest hire I could ever make as a new business … and I had no idea how I could surpass that. </p><p>*** </p><p>Tara couldn’t believe the intensity of the feelings she was feeling. She had already thought herself to be enjoying the greatest pleasure ever as she desperately used his fingers as a masturbation aid. But, however great that feeling, it was impossible to compare to what she was feeling. </p><p>Her first time was supposed to be painful and uncomfortable. It was what the magazines said, confirmed by a few people she was close enough to talk to. Yet, there was no pain — well, nothing she couldn’t handle — and supposed discomfort was easily surpassed by the waves of pleasure that spread through her with each push. </p><p>The pleasure that defied reason. Even as he moved desperately, she felt herself wanting more, doing her best to push herself to meet his pushes. </p><p>“What an eager secretary,” he said, his dark tone as arousing as his spank. Feeling shy, she tried to suppress her moans, but she was unsuccessful. Her body was betraying her as the pleasure invaded her. “Do you want more?” </p><p>“Y-yes, sir,” she said, her focus still on the way her core was stretching wide as he repeatedly invaded her. “P-please, faster.” </p><p>“Such a needy little secretary,” he said, picking even more speed, her core expanding with his invasion, overwhelmed with pleasure. It was good that his hands were on her hips, because his touch was the only thing that allowed her to maintain a hint of control. </p><p>Lost in pure carnal pleasure, she was not able to say anything as she felt her body clench once more, giving her another climax. She barely registered his pull, followed by a soft rain on her back. “Congratulations, you’re hired,” he said as he finally unwrapped her hands. </p><p>She lay on the desk, unable to move as her legs softened. Even as he fixed his clothing, she said nothing, and continued to lay, breathing hard. </p><p>“Are you going to stay here for all night,” he said. </p><p>Tara felt herself blush once again, this time for a different reason. “I … I don’t think I can walk,” she whispered. </p><p>“Such a needy little secretary,” he repeated, chuckling. Before she could answer, he hugged her, and she found herself in a bridal hold. “Let’s bring you to shower, then,” he said. </p><p>“T-thank you, sir,” she whispered as she hugged him, enjoying his warmth. It was different than the previous carnal rush … but no less amazing. “It feels … good.” </p><p>“Nice to hear, sweetie,” he whispered, his voice enough to send shivers across her body. “I don’t need much from you. Just loyalty and obedience. Tell me, can you do it?” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she whispered, burying her face against his chest, once again listening to his heartbeat. “I can do that.” </p><p>He said nothing else, but he hugged her tighter. It was all she needed. As they arrived at the shower, she stepped once again, ready for a shower. She expected to take the shower alone … but said nothing when he got rid of his clothes rapidly and followed. </p><p>She blushed even as he turned a satisfied smirk toward her. “You look exhausted. I should help you,” he said, not bothering to hide his amusement.</p><p>“I-it’s not necessary, sir,” she whispered, feeling self-conscious. It was not proper for him to help her. Even if … even… </p><p>Her thoughts flew away as he turned on the water. The warm dance of water was amazing, but not as amazing as his hands dancing on her body once more. He positioned himself so that she was trapped between his body and the wall with no route to escape except through him. </p><p>And, that route was impossible for her to take. She couldn’t push him back. </p><p>“I insist,” he said as he crouched down and grabbed a loofah, pressing it against her ankle, gently rubbing her legs as he climbed upward. She froze, feeling self-conscious even as he slowly moved up, covering her skin with soap. </p><p>She couldn’t help but whimper as he climbed up, focusing on her thighs. Yet, it wasn’t the earlier explosive pleasure. It was more of a gentle exhaustion, one that mixed with a sense of security. </p><p>She closed her eyes, trying to calm down for a moment, and…</p><p>***</p><p>“Well, that was not what I expected a shared shower to be,” I chuckled as finally turned off the water and used a towel to gently dry her off, doing my best not to awaken her. I could have felt annoyed as she fell asleep, but I decided to let it slide. </p><p>Even without considering the effects of a warm shower, she had a tough day. Her interview, her intense work as a cleaner, her first accidental debut as a superhero…</p><p>Losing her virginity. </p><p>No, she certainly deserved her rest. I helped her to wear one of my shirts, yet somehow she continued to sleep. </p><p>Maybe it was the effect of the exhaustion, but she was certainly a heavy sleeper. </p><p>It would be fun to share a room with her, I decided even as I lay her down on the mattress, squeezed next to her, waiting for sleep to take me. </p><p>I doubted I would wait for long after the day I had. </p>
