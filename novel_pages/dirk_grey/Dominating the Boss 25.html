        <p>The hesitation that covered Umi’s face as Tiffany leaned over her body to press her lips against her elegant neck was beautiful, like a little sparrow caught in a trap. Umi trembled, her emotions not helped when Tiffany leaned against her side, her arm pressing against Umi’s bosom — her lack of a bra making the feeling much more intense, her nipples hardening almost instantly. </p><p>“M-maybe-” Umi stuttered hesitantly, realizing that things were going to a place she wasn’t prepared for, if the current situation was the start of it. My redheaded partner, however, was too sly to allow her to air her concerns, pressing her finger on her lips playfully to silence her while leaned to whisper a few things. </p><p>Her voice was too low for me to hear, but Umi’s growing blush left no doubt about the direction of her words. Quite effective as well, as Umi’s reluctant attempts to stop her weakened considerably, giving Tiffany a level of access that would certainly prove to be a mistake.</p><p>Or from a different, more hedonistic — and less moralistic — perspective, it might prove very beneficial.  </p><p>"Excellent," I declared exuberantly as I watched Tiffany’s hands slip under her top, caressing her belly while also giving a generous glimpse of her smooth skin. </p><p>Tiffany chuckled at my exclamation, while Umi reacted by blushing even further, barely held back by another whisper from Tiffany. Something about the scene made me wish to laugh before leaning forward to join. Pity that doing so would have sent Umi running. </p><p>Umi’s demure reluctance — fitting for her Asian heritage, I was ready to admit at the risk of sound stereotypical — contrasted greatly with Tiffany’s fiery enthusiasm — another common trope that fitted to a T — creating an amazing show for me to enjoy, to a point I was starting to suspect how much of Tiffany working to get her promised reward, and how much she was actually enjoying it. </p><p>I didn’t bother questioning her about the exact reason since I wasn’t an idiot, just leaning back to enjoy the show. Only an idiot would anger such a beauty in the middle of providing a show. </p><p>As I watched, Tiffany’s fingers moved higher and higher, revealing more of Umi’s skin as she journeyed. Then, her second hand joined her little game and grabbed Umi’s top, filling me a temptation to cheer for her. Umi’s back arched reflexively like she was trying to escape, but the velvety walls of our booth prevented her escape. </p><p>I was so tempted to cheer like I was watching a particularly popular strip show, or ask Tiffany to pull Umi’s top, revealing her delicious bosom to my sight. Unfortunately, while the restaurant was fairly permissive about what was going on in private booths, there were limits, and stripping definitely violated them. </p><p>Luckily, Tiffany saw the problem and shifted her hips as she leaned forward, her skirt pulled up, revealing her delicious ass, covered only by a deficient thong. When she added a delicious sway on them as she lifted up, relying on the table to hide the sight from any waitress that might decide to drop by, it was enough for me to enjoy the show for a while without making an aggressive move to ruin the moment. </p><p>When Tiffany finally pulled back from peppering Umi’s neck with kisses, both women were breathing hard, Umi with shock, Tiffany with arousal. Then, Umi realized the state of her top, bunched upward enough to reveal a thin line under her boobs, turning her already sexy state into downright erotic. </p><p>She tried to pull that back, of course, but Tiffany was quick to grab her wrist to prevent her from fixing her top, whispering to dissuade her from her action. </p><p>Umi listened to Tiffany’s tempting whispers, and doing so, missed another interesting fact, that Tiffany shifted her seat so that she was sitting on the opposite side. I slid closer, conveniently sandwiching Umi between us. </p><p>Only when Tiffany settled on her new seat, Umi realized her new seating arrangement. She sent a panicked glare to my side, particularly toward my hand, panickedly checking whether I had any intention of replacing the area Tiffany’s hands departed recently. When noticing I had no intention of doing it, she relaxed slightly, and soon, her attention was stolen once again by Tiffany’s wandering lips, this time tracing down her chin. </p><p>“So, any plans after the marriage, maybe a fancy honeymoon,” I asked while Tiffany’s kisses started to trail even upward toward her ear, making it very hard for her to focus. </p><p>“N-not really,” she managed to stammer. “The money is a bit tight… So unless the quarterly bonus covers it, it doesn’t seem likely,” she added even as she started shuffling under Tiffany’s touch, this time with an even more heated touch. </p><p>If it was Tiffany that uttered that sentence, I would be sure that she was fishing for some more money for her household — which was much easier to do in a company that was trying to get rid of me — but Umi was too innocent to do so, especially with Tiffany’s tongue strategically teasing her earlobe, distracting her the most delicious way possible. </p><p>“Really, I didn’t know our salaries were that low.” </p><p>“They are not!” Umi responded rapidly, taking my gentle ribbing as genuine displeasure. “It’s just that we have student debts and a mortgage, not leaving a lot of money to spend.” </p><p>“It’s good to be financially savvy,” I said, trying to suppress my instincts not to pounce her helpless state. She had just revealed the horrible state of her financials despite the fact that I was fairly transparent about my intention — not to mention, she came there intentionally with her fiancee’s insistence to get a bigger bonus. I could have easily used her admission to pressure her for more ‘favors’ until she was a bundle of guilt and shame. </p><p>Paradoxically, her gullible innocence was the thing that prevented me from doing so. I had no problem using such weapons against Natalie, but against Umi, they were just overkill. I just chuckled before deflecting the amazing opportunity she had provided me, despite Tiffany’s shocked glance as I let it slide away. </p><p>“It’s a pity,” Tiffany said as she pulled back, but her finger still dancing at the edge of Umi’s breasts, pushing her top higher and higher. It was still acceptable for an evening dress cleavage, but it was rapidly nearing that limit. “A fancy wedding and a fancy honeymoon is something every wife deserves,” she said. “If only there was a way for you to get that bonus,” Tiffany said before leaning down to lick her earlobe once more, but this time, whispering more. </p><p>I couldn’t hear what Tiffany was saying, but I didn’t need to hear to know what she was talking about to guess its contents, not when her hands started to move even more aggressively, pushing Umi’s tanktop high enough until her nipple prevented it from going further. </p><p>Tiffany let her hands slide down at that point, but her lips got even more aggressive, clamping on Umi’s, stealing an aggressive kiss. Watching a demure Asian beauty with an amazing underboob cleavage getting dominated by a feisty redhead was enough to turn up my hardness into a level of torture. </p><p>Still, I watched as Tiffany’s skilled fingers traveled down across Umi’s stomach, teasing her cute belly button before moving up moments later to cup the underside of her breasts once more. Umi trembled, her unsupported tits bouncing beautifully. Her eyes danced in panic, looking at everywhere but me, especially when Tiffany’s hands started to travel down once more. </p><p>Her fingers arrived at Umi’s jeans and flipped the button open. Umi flinched — which only made her generous bosom dance even more — while trying to stop Tiffany. But her attempts to stop her rang hollow because she failed to pull back from the kiss, too shocked with the sudden escalation to do anything but obey, even when Tiffany’s fingers disappeared into her jeans. </p><p>I couldn’t help but let out an excited gasp as Tiffany’s fingers started to dance in the confines of Umi’s jeans, making her sway and gasp. My surprise only grew as unlike what I expected, her fingers stayed in that dangerous destination, dancing continuously while she still kept their lips connected. </p><p>Umi’s body started to undulate helplessly under Tiffany’s control, captured by her charm, her ability to make good — or even decent — decisions disappeared under Tiffany’s enthusiastic tongue. When she broke the kiss, only to clamp on her neck, Umi’s mouth opened in shock, ready to let out a loud moan. </p><p>I reacted quickly, pressing my hand over her lips. “Careful, beautiful. We don’t want to be kicked out,” I reminded her. She managed to suppress her voice, but as our eyes connected, it only increased her panicked arousal more, finally remembering that not only we were in a public space, but I was also watching from the side, two facts that had been forgotten thanks to Tiffany’s skillful fingers. </p><p>Umi said nothing, just biting her lips to contain her voice while looking down Tiffany, helplessly confused under her assault. </p><p>Another delicious minute passed, and I was starting to consider whether I had to actually stop her before the escalation reached a point that would get us kicked out of the restaurant even with their fairly permissive approach to that kind of fun activities when Tiffany pulled back without a warning. Umi just leaned back, trying to catch her breath, her beautiful dark eyes wide in shock. She was just trying to understand how things had escalated to that point that quickly… </p><p>Before she could do that, however, Tiffany grabbed her wrist and dragged her out. “It’s time for a soak. See you at the hot tub,”  Tiffany said as she dragged Umi away, who was too focused on fixing her shirt before stepping into the proper hotel area to resist Tiffany’s one-sided decision. </p><p>I just chuckled before calling the waitress and paying the bill — with a rather generous tip that was more than the bill itself. Considering the potential of the restaurant, I decided that keeping the staff happy with my presence might allow them to turn the other side into a similar situation. After all, we were going to spend quite a bit more time here. </p><p>I stopped by the reception to arrange a private hot tub and some refreshments before going to my room to change. When I arrived at a large, spacious section that was surrounded by walls at three sides but with an amazing view of the city, with a bubbling tub in the center, I slipped in, ready to wait for the girls. </p><p>Then, my phone rang once again, once again from Tiffany.  </p><p>But this time, a video call…</p>
