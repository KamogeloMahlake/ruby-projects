        <p>The bathroom was silent. </p><p>I had no doubt that the silence was rather uncomfortable for the two beautiful girls in the room, their gazes locked on each other, trying to process their shock. Naomi was frozen because it was not the friend she had been expecting to find in the bathroom, while Sarah was stiff because she didn’t expect to be ambushed like that, her panties around her ankles to reveal her glistening core. </p><p>Though, I had to admit, being thoroughly ignored like that despite being naked hurt my pride a bit. Luckily, not enough to sap the fun from them looking at each other with shifting expressions, each trying to decide whether to be ashamed or angry. </p><p>Of course, the simplest, and the most rational thing would have been getting angry at me, shouting and crying, maybe even landing a couple of slaps before abandoning me. But their gazes locked as they explored each other’s reactions. </p><p>It took a moment for me to realize they were waiting for the other to display the anger I had been expecting and leave, leaving themselves alone with me. Yet, as they realized the other had no intention of doing so, their gazes started to get livelier. Soon, they gained a beautiful sharp quality as they understood each other’s aim. </p><p>The silence that descended to the bathroom was beautiful. It was like a western movie, and they were two gunslingers, tense as they waited for the other to act. </p><p>Ultimately, Naomi was the first to break the silence, which surprised me. “What a nice surprise, Sarah,” she whispered, a whisper that somehow managed to carry the same tenseness despite the absurdity of her situation. </p><p>Admirably, her voice trembled only once despite her nudity. And even more, interestingly, she let her arms fall to the side as she spoke, treating Sarah to the sight of her beautiful nudity. </p><p>Sarah didn’t cover herself even from the start, but I was familiar with her expression to know that she wanted to conceal her body. She just didn’t want to lose a challenge from her friend, even a wordless one— competitiveness that had worked wonders the last night, when she visited with Carrie. </p><p>“Likewise,” Sarah said as she put her hand on her hips, taking a pose that would have been provocative even if she had been fully dressed. </p><p>With her panties as the only piece of clothing on her — which hardly counted as a proper item of clothing in the first place, let alone pooled around her ankle — it was marvelous. </p><p>I looked at Naomi, curious how she would react. I expected her to react more passively, considering her actions everywhere except exercising, and she didn’t surprise me much. Her arms crossed under her chest, which turned her pose erotic and defensive at the same time. “Well, since Carrie struck out, I decided to throw my hat on the ring.” </p><p>Sarah’s eyes widened slightly as she realized Naomi’s misconception about Carrie’s current progress, but she wasn’t exactly in a position to use that fact as a defense. “I see, and where’s that hat?” she asked, deciding that attack was the best form of defense. </p><p>“It must have been mixed with your clothes,” Naomi countered reflexively, though she took half a step back still, showing that her nerves were fraying. It was enough to make me revisit my decision to keep myself out of their fight. I put my hand on the small of her back, encouraging her to stand her ground. </p><p>Her gaze met mine, and I gave her an encouraging smile, though I couldn’t help but feel like I was really pushing my luck. </p><p>Luckily, Sarah once again proved herself an expert on angering others, the dismissive smirk she wore when she realized Naomi needed help working better than my touch. “Maybe we should go dress and have a talk,” Sarah said, her tone dismissive. </p><p>“Why?” Naomi whispered. “Can’t you handle it?” </p><p>“O-of course I can,” Sarah was quick to correct, the same habits that forced her to stay next to us while I was exploring Carrie’s beautiful body during our game exerting themselves once more, putting her in a situation she would have preferred to escape otherwise. “I was just trying to help you,” she added, louder, as she started walking, her hips shaking beautifully. </p><p>Naomi turned toward me, her beautiful eyes trembling in fear. “Maybe we should—“ she started, only for me to lean down and steal a quick kiss. </p><p>“Why?” I asked, acting unaware of the fact that she expected to see Carrie. “You knew you would find her inside once we opened the door, right? Why the sudden change?” </p><p>“I…” she whispered her voice fading as she realized she couldn’t exactly reveal that she expected to find Carrie without making the situation even more absurd. “I didn’t expect Sarah to be that forward,” she murmured, using it as an opportunity to surrender.  </p><p>“She definitely is, but I’m sure you can handle her. I trust you,” I said even as I wrapped my arm around her waist. “Of course, if you think you are too weak to handle her…” I added, letting it drag. </p><p>“Maybe…” she whispered, her confidence weakening even with my playful challenge, but when I dragged her out and she saw Sarah leaning against the sofa in a pose that was beautiful, yet too unnatural to be anything but completely intentional. “I can handle her,” she whispered, her competitiveness fueled by Sarah’s gaze. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I took a step back, watching as Naomi walked forward, her beautiful ass swaying erotically. </p><p>Sarah’s expression flickered as she realized her bluff had failed, but since I was behind Naomi, nothing prevented me from smirking at her dismissively, which was more than enough to inflame her competitive spirit. </p><p>The silence was deafening as Naomi walked past Sarah and sat on the sofa slowly, her body stretching beautifully in the process. Sarah growled softly as she followed her and sat next to her. They looked at each other, saying nothing. </p><p>I gave them a minute for the weird tension to build up even further, aware that the tenser they got, the more competitive they would act. And I needed their competitiveness as close to the peak as possible to convince them. Keeping my chuckle in as I walked toward them had been a great challenge, but I managed to — mostly — succeed in my self-assigned task as I sat between them. </p><p>“So, girls, anything you want to do in particular,” I asked even as I gazed at Naomi, who was busy seething in shock as she slowly got used to shock, while her competitiveness continued to build up. </p><p>Sarah was quicker to react. “Well, since Naomi arrived at the latest, we should ask her. That’s the fair thing to do since she’s the guest. A surprise one.” </p><p>Naomi was clever enough to read the subtext of Sarah’s words, not that it was particularly difficult, especially with her last words. Yet, rather than reacting immediately, she reacted in a slower manner, but it hardly made it less impactful. “You’re right,” she murmured as she stood up, only to grab my hand and pulled me up. “I don’t plan to spend a lot of time here. I just come here to ask Chad’s help to make me stretch.” </p><p>Before I could say anything, Naomi raised her leg high, putting it on my shoulder while I grabbed her leg, repeating the exact same pose we had shared earlier today during the shopping trip. </p><p>Of course, without any clothes to create a barrier, it was much more intense. And soon, Naomi’s hips started to move, which added quite a bit of extra fun to our little exercise. </p><p>“I see,” Sarah murmured, her expression tight as she watched, not bothering to hide her jealousy. “It looks rather difficult, are you sure you can handle it without ripping a … muscle.” </p><p>“It’s just exercise, nothing I can’t handle,” Naomi answered, her voice much more confident. Interesting that even under this absurd situation, she managed to get courage from exercising. “You don’t mind waiting a bit, do you?” she whispered as she added. </p><p>“I see, and how long this … exercise session would take?” Sarah said. </p><p>“I don’t know, maybe half an hour?” Naomi answered, her smirk getting wider. “You know that I have good endurance.” </p><p>"Oh, I do,” Sarah countered, though I didn’t miss the teasing way Naomi had delivered that sentence, nor the way Sarah tensed when she heard it. </p><p>There must be an interesting story behind that if that was enough to Sarah react to it like that when Naomi was currently rubbing against my body in a way that would have forced a movie to take a late-night slot. </p><p>Sarah stood still for a moment, making me wonder whether the issue Naomi had poked was too significant, enough to ruin her mood. However, a smile soon grew on her face, one that reminded me of her attitude when we were in the pool with Carrie, and she had decided to challenge her. </p><p>Excellent, I thought. A competitive Sarah was nothing less than a treat. </p><p> “You’re right, you have a better endurance than me,” Sarah said with a wide smirk. “Maybe I should join you guys to exercise,” Sarah commented, her tone tight.</p><p>“If you think you can keep up with us,” Naomi said as she pulled her leg away from my shoulder and stepped on the floor once more, a sharp expression on her face, picking up Sarah’s challenge and answering it excellently. </p><p>Though, I doubted she was aware of the exact lengths Sarah was willing to go for that challenge. </p><p>Interestingly, that was a mystery even for me, I thought even as I felt Sarah’s fingers around my wrist, pulling me toward the couch. </p><p>I couldn’t wait to see her surprise. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
