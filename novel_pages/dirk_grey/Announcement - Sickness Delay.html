        <p>Hi guys, </p><p>I regret to tell you that, but I'm sick as a dog, so, there'll be no updates this week.  </p><p>I know it's not the greatest news, but you know that I do my best to keep up with the update committments under better circumstances. I'll do my best to slowly compensate for the missing chapters, but I can't promise a timeline for that. </p><p>The next week's update should be out in time. </p>
