        <p>“Can’t we cast some kind of spell to create a carriage,” Xia begged after half an hour of uninterrupted travel, getting more and more exhausted by the walk as we traveled inward. “You’re a sorcerer, it should be easy.” </p><p>“And you’re a sorceress, shouldn’t you be able to handle it even easier,” Theodora interrupted, not missing a chance to needle her. It wasn’t the first time.</p><p>“I’m a healer, which will be fun to remind you the next time you require me to heal you,” Xia responded. </p><p>Theodora looked ready to respond, but I silenced her with a gesture. “Enough, both of you. If you have the energy to dawdle, you have the energy to scout,” I answered. “And, with my magical control ruined once more, there’s no way for me to create something that intricate, certainly not without revealing our location to anyone within a hundred-mile radius.” </p><p>That was enough to silence both, which hadn’t been too surprising. Xia was already submissive before realizing that I was somehow linked to the ancient kingdom of Egypt, which just enhanced further. And, Theodora already had a strong case of hero-worship before I saved her from a terrible fate for the second time, just when she was convinced that all hope was lost. Unfortunately, even that wasn’t enough to keep their jealous sniping at bay. </p><p>Annoying, but not enough to truly be problematic. </p><p>We walked in silence, my attention still at our rear, afraid that our subterfuge would be discovered. But, at the edge of my perception, I could feel the ships battling, their spells explosive enough to keep the situation in control. </p><p>“Where are we walking exactly,” Xia asked, looking exhausted, showing that she wasn’t used to physical activities.</p><p>“Away from the reach of the ships,” I answered. “We need to make sure we won’t be caught by a foraging party or a shipwrecked crew and ruin the only advantage we have.” </p><p>“Can I at least heal myself,” she said.  </p><p>“No, magic use is too risky,” I said, trying not to sound annoying. </p><p>She looked ready to argue more, but a dismissive snort from Theodora was enough to cut it short. Her wordless challenge was clearly enough to cut her complaining short. </p><p>I couldn’t help but sigh at their pointless bickering, but I didn’t intervene. It at least keeps them distracted and motivated, allowing me to focus on more important issues. </p><p>Like, trying to find water. </p><p>I couldn’t cast anything delicate enough to help me map the environment — especially since using anything but the lightning was getting harder and harder after consuming even more Dragon Hearts — but that didn’t mean I was helpless. My enhanced senses allowed me to smell far more accurately. And, as we left the sea and its overwhelming saltiness behind, I finally detected a water source. </p><p>I changed our direction silently toward that direction. I wanted to take a rest. Xia was tired, and Theodora was not any better. More importantly, as the adrenaline of the battle faded away, it left behind a mental exhaustion that was difficult to beat. </p><p>However, as we walked, the rocky shore left its place to a sandy and dry interior, walking getting even more difficult as each step sank deeper into the sand. Xia, in particular, was getting even more exhausted. </p><p>I thought about carrying her, but decided against it. She needed some toughening. </p><p>“Should I cast a water-gathering spell,” Theodora asked a while later. “We’re getting thirsty.” </p><p>“Not yet,” I said. “There’s water nearby.” </p><p>“Really,” she said as she looked around, only to see a bunch of rocks and sand. “Are you sure?” </p><p>I just nodded, which seemed to mollify her, just because I was the one saying it. </p><p>Another turn around a hill, and we found ourselves in a little oasis with a beautiful, bubbling spring, surrounded by an inviting layer of thick grass, too comfortable to be resisted. “Finally,” Xia said as she rushed forward. </p><p>Showing her experience with the wilderness was absolutely nothing. </p><p>I sighed even as I swung my spear, which passed dangerously close to her face, and sank into a rock, which bled for a while before transforming into a lizard that was the size of the rock. “Never rush to a water source without checking it first,” I said. “Magical beasts love ambushing people there.” </p><p>“I … I see,” Xia stammered, shocked by how close she had come to a violent attack, which could have easily killed her before she could react. </p><p>“Well, at least we have our dinner while camping,” I said. </p><p>“We’re going to camp? Isn’t it better to travel at night,” Theodora said. </p><p>“Certainly more comfortable, especially since we lack proper clothing,” I agreed. “But, we’re too exhausted to avoid ambush, so I’m willing to waste half a day here rather than being ambushed,” I said. </p><p>Also, at this point, we were sufficiently far away from the sea, and staying behind the wards and creating a few equipment first was more critical than anything else. In particular, shoes and water skins, but thankfully, the giant lizard had more than enough skin for all the necessities. </p><p>Including making sheaths for all three weapons. After their reaction, it looked like walking around them in the open might not be the best idea. </p><p>“Why don’t you two set up a concealment ward while I handle our dinner,” I said as I grabbed the sword. Which earned double gasps. “What’s up with the reaction?” </p><p>“You … you’re going to use a Patrician weapon as a carving knife,” Theodora gasped. </p><p>“It’s sharp, clean, and the only blade we have, of course,” I said even as I started walking. They looked shocked at my decision, clearly expecting me to treat it with respect, but I shrugged that away. Ultimately, it was a weapon. </p><p>And, it certainly made it easier to go through it, the magic skin of the creature acting like paper as I cut forward, and even bones didn’t react anymore. “You look very proficient in that,” Theodora commented even as she drew a rune to create another ward stone. </p><p>“It’s important to know how to hunt,” I said, not bothering to mention exactly how I had been trained. My grandfather might have been merciless, but there was no arguing with the results. There was no way I could have survived my adventure in Rome without his torturous training. </p><p>That was enough to silence them, and I continued with my task, separating the skin first before cutting some meat from its back, which would be the safest part. Then, I carved a few runes on a large stone, and called Theodora. “Do you mind powering those runes,” I said. There was no way I could blow any rune that was weaker than a city defense array without blowing up with my magic once again out of whack. </p><p>“Are you sure, these fire runes look weak,” she said. “I can replace them with something stronger.” </p><p>“That’s because I want to cook the meat, princess, not turn it into charcoal. Have you ever tried cooking with something stronger?” I said, chuckling as she looked blushed. </p><p>“Do you think our princess ever cooked a meal?” Xia said, not missing a chance to needle her. </p><p>I chuckled as I caught Theodora’s gaze, the answer hidden in her self-conscious blush. I chucked. “Enough, put that ward on so we can have dinner,” I said. She put the runes on, and I started cooking the first set of meat, a heavenly smell filling the oasis. </p><p>I continued working on the rest of the meat, separating it into different parts, some to be cooked immediately, and some to be processed and dried for our travel. </p><p>As I worked, I noticed something interesting. A tendril of magic, spreading from the sword. I let it connect slowly, feeling like the sword was getting a part of me, as if it was trying to teach me how to use it. The connection was nowhere near as strong as I had with the Spear of Scipio, but nonetheless, it was efficient enough. </p><p>Unfortunately, stopping to have dinner was a luxury, so everyone just grabbed a piece of meat whenever it was ready, snacking as we continued working steadily. </p><p>I worked continuously, feeling the connection with the sword getting better and better, feeling that, even without knowing any unique powers, I would be able to use it in battle. </p><p>I couldn’t help but glance at the bow, thinking whether I should practice with it some to see if I could create the same kind of connection. On one hand, it was a pretty distinctive weapon that might alert others. On the other hand, it might help us as I dug around the secrets of Egypt. </p><p>With both sides of Rome inaccessible to us, it was my best hope. The evening arrived while I was thinking that. Theodora was already asleep, the act of powering the ward — and doing it alone to prove herself better than Xia despite her sorceress status — wiped her off. </p><p>However, as I watched Xia create a small lake next to the spring and create a connected pool that filled rapidly before slipping her dress off, I decided that testing the bow was not the priority. </p><p>Especially with the smoky gaze she threw to my way. </p>
