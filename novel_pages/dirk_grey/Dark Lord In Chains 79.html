        <p>“Not a bad start,” I whispered softly. “Continue with your performance, and you have the chance to convince me that you’re actually serious with your declaration of loyalty.” </p><p>“Of course—“ she started, but that was all she was able to say as I slide forward, clogging her beautiful mouth with my shaft once again. </p><p>Yet, this time, it wasn’t the only challenge I had in mind for her. “Strip,” I ordered, which didn’t help her surprise any. </p><p>That surprise only lasted for a second before she put her hands on her shirt, her fingers dancing skillfully. It wasn’t a sexy way of undressing, as her actions were too sharp, too utilitarian to reflect an aura of sexiness. Combined with the other activities she was delivering, it felt considerably better. </p><p>She even managed to surprise me in turn with the speed she was able to shed her clothing while busy taking my shaft to her throat, showing the benefits of her phenomenal flexibility as a ranger to the limit. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel curious about the limits of her flexibility as she gave me a preview, so the moment I pulled back, an order left my lips. “Turn your back to me, bend down, and grab your ankles,” I ordered. </p><p>She looked confused at the order, but that didn’t make her delay before complying. On the contrary, she was getting faster following my orders, showing that she was still adapting to her new role, and showing great gusto while doing so. </p><p>It didn’t take long for her to understand my aim as I rubbed my shaft against her entrance, earning a beautiful moan. “Ohh,” she gasped, unable to resist the pleasure. </p><p>“No moans,” I ordered, mostly to add a layer of punishment to our little game. After all, with everything she had done to me, she did earn some punishment. “You need to pay back for your disrespect.” </p><p>“Y-yes, my lord,” she whispered, unable to prevent a slight stammer as I rubbed my shaft against her wet lips. Yet, the speed of her adaptation to her role kept impressing me. </p><p>“Start moving back,” I ordered, asking her to move despite her challenging pose. Once again, it didn’t even stagger her as she worked her hips, and she started rocking back and forth, at a perfect pace, coating the top side of my shaft with her wetness. </p><p>I could feel her wetness intensifying with each passing second, her wetness turning into a beautiful river. She managed to follow my order and kept herself from moaning, but she closed her eyes and threw her head back just to process the unfamiliar sensation. </p><p>“Faster,” I ordered. Once again, her obedience was instantaneous, but this time, it came with another reaction. She started biting her lips to imprison her moans, hard enough to leave a mark on her lips. Seeing her pouty lips, ones that almost always carried a sharp, intimidating frown, struggle to contain the signs of pleasure was certainly beautiful. </p><p>Though, not as beautiful as the way her nether lips widened in preparation, begging for my invasion. </p><p>And, as much as teasing Isolde was tempting, it wasn’t as tempting as taking that invitation to drill her mercilessly. </p><p>“Open your eyes,” I ordered. </p><p>She did so, which hardly made her attempts to keep her moans inside easier. Yet, the challenge was nothing compared to the other source, the crown of my shaft slowly sliding inside her core, forcing her lips to reshape around. </p><p>“Yes,” she managed to whisper as the sensation of slowly being filled up hit her, only for my hand to explode on her ass, the spank cracking loud enough to echo. </p><p>“No moans,” I reminded her, then made a show of looking like I wanted to think. “Maybe I should stop. You clearly can’t handle it, if you can’t even fulfill the simplest of commands.” </p><p>“No, please,” she gasped as she pushed her hips back desperately, giving me her first disobedience. Yet, I expected it, so I pulled back as she did so, managing to keep the crown inside her without letting her slide more. I grabbed her hips. </p><p>“How dare you? Maybe I should stop if you’re not going to follow orders,” I ordered as my hand exploded on her ass, turning into a grip to immobilize her. Yet, I noticed her hands around her wrists getting looser. “Don’t change your pose,” I added, and she followed it quickly. </p><p>“I’m sorry, my lord,” she whimpered, the desperation of her tone shocking me, a tone that I had never expected to hear from her. “I … I have never felt something so intense. I … I lost control.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle, though it had a touch of pity. Maybe her issues with failing to get aroused were worse than I had expected, if she had turned this desperate this quickly. I wouldn’t have been surprised if it had been a weaker girl, but for all her faults, Isolde was strong. </p><p>And just how intense was her problem to make such strength turn into whimpers in just minutes — though, admittedly, my skill played no little role in the extent she was crumbling. “You’re lucky that I’m a merciful lord,” I said even as I pushed forward, impaling her mercilessly, which made my words rather ironic. </p><p>Isolde gasped as my shaft pushed in, forcing her virgin core to widen rapidly. It must have been an uncomfortable sensation, at least partially, but Isolde’s moan was one of pure pleasure, showing just how much she enjoyed the reckless invasion. Though, her moan wasn’t as decisive as the sudden trembling that started affecting her, showing that my reckless push also managed to trigger a climax.</p><p>That wasn’t a reason for me to stop, of course. I tightened my grip on her hips before starting to push forward recklessly, filling the cell with the sound of flesh hitting flesh with undertones of squishing. Her whimpers were quick to join, the invasion of pleasure breaking her commitment to keeping herself from moaning. </p><p>Her determination lost against her pleasure, and did so spectacularly. </p><p>“So, how’s the feeling of giving your first time to your lord,” I whispered as I quickened my assault. </p><p>Her answer came in the form of a whisper, though her tone was garbled as I rammed her faster, the combination of shame and pleasure enough to keep her mouth shut. Yet, even if she had been having some last-minute regrets about declaring her loyalty, her body clearly disagreed completely with such actions. </p><p>I continued my assault, her moans and cries creating a beautiful backdrop. Yet, when I pulled back, those moans were cut instant. “I’m sorry, my lord,” she gasped panickedly, not wanting to lose the pleasure she was receiving. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I just want to change positions. Sit on the bed, then, put your legs behind your neck,” I ordered, wanting to explore the benefits of her flexibility in a fun manner. </p><p>She followed my orders with a quickness that was only possible for a dedicated warrior, and before I could even walk to the bed, she was in front of me, her legs behind her neck, presenting her entrance like a gift. </p><p>I pressed my hands on her thighs, forcing her to stretch even more as I slid my shaft back in. </p><p>Then, exploded into action, drilling mercilessly. </p><p>It was even more aggressive than my earlier show, the position allowing me to put my strength into every push without a worry — well, the way the bed cracked was a sense of worry, but not a big one — as I taught her the true meaning of physical subservience. </p><p>Her cries exploded even louder, filling the room, once again making me very glad about the silencing spell I had used. As my cock disappeared into the depths that were untouched just moments ago, she was getting tighter and tighter under the exertion. </p><p>Under my assault, I could the reflection of another growing arousal in her beautiful eyes, her cries carrying the aura of surrender. Yet, along with that orgasm, there was fascination in her eyes, like she was unable to believe how such a pleasure was possible. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s just a preview,” I whispered even as I continued my reckless assault.</p><p>“Impossible…” she murmured, her tone getting dazed like she was unable to believe more pleasure could be possible. “So big, so deep…” </p><p>“Oh, sweetie,” I said, unable to help but chuckle at her reaction. After all, size was just a part of the equation, and while Isolde’s personal preferences indicated that she clearly needed it, the pleasure she was feeling was nothing compared to the ones she would feel with the assistance of a few select items. </p><p>I had a feeling that chains and collars would work particularly well on her. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t bother explaining to her that since I wouldn’t be able to use those at the moment. Not because of a lack of equipment, as magic was certainly useful to handle such deficiencies rather easily, but the lack of time… </p><p>After all, I still had a lot of work to do. </p><p>“Yes, yes, yes,” she started to whimper as the arousal started to reach the boiling point, like an addict that was begging for another dose. “So big… So good…” </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk smugly as I continued to drill her. Of course, Isolde wasn’t the only woman that had moaned under my weight with such intensity, but that didn’t change the fact that seeing such an accomplished warrior submit completely was fun. </p><p>Just like sunrises. It might not be the first sunrise one sees, but that didn’t take anything from the unique wonder… </p><p>Soon, her moans reached a point of climax, and her trembling started once again, but this time, she wasn’t alone. Her tightening triggered a climax of my own. My shaft tightened, filling her core with my seed with each twitch… </p><p>Properly marking her loyalty… </p><p>I pulled back, taking a deep breath as I watched her trembling body, her legs finally removed from her neck, and lay supine, listless, the rapid invasion of pleasure enough to break her resistance. </p><p>All I needed to decide what to do next, starting to work on her freedom… </p><p>Or maybe, test her loyalty once more…</p>
