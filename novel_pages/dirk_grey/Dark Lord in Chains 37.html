        <p>Despite the inherent risks of the situation, I barely needed a second to come to a decision. “Ask her to stay and tell you what to do,” I sent a magical whisper to Aria, hoping that the Queen wasn’t paying attention to notice such a low-intensity magical spell. </p><p>It was a risky move. Things would get far too complicated if the Queen discovered that I was not in my cell like she had expected but hiding in the depths of the bath of the Crown Princess. </p><p>And the fact that I was currently in the midst of defiling the Crown Princess was not likely to make things any easier. Or at least, I assumed so. Maybe the fact that Aria had already achieved the task of seducing me —well, the reverse, actually, but that was a small, unimportant detail that I’m sure Sapphire wouldn’t care too much. </p><p>Right?</p><p>While I analyzed the risks of my impulsive decision, Aria followed my suggestion. “Could you stay and explain it better?” she asked, too overwhelmed by the situation to actually process the implications of her request. I knew she hadn’t understood the implications, because when Sapphire pulled off her nightie to reveal her deliciously voluptuous body —still carrying a couple fading hickeys from our adventures of the previous evening, missed by her healing spells, though with the steam blocking the view, the only reason I noticed was because I knew where to look. </p><p>“I can’t believe that I still need to explain that to you when you’re in your twenties,” Sapphire said dryly as she sank into the embrace of the warm water, closing her eyes to enjoy her soak. Which was convenient, as it allowed her to mistake Aria’s sudden gasp as I pushed deeper inside her with her reaction to the harshness of her statement. “I wouldn’t have bothered if things were getting direr by every passing day, risking to become a total disaster.” </p><p>Her last statement was curious, not the content itself —as I wasn’t stupid enough to miss that her search for the Eternal Core had a semi-urgent reason— but Aria’s reaction. She stiffened in a way that made me think that it was the first time she had been hearing about this so-called upcoming disaster. </p><p>Luckily, I was positioned perfectly to dissuade her from following up about that topic immediately. I wanted Sapphire to be relaxed a bit before asking the question. I pushed my hips forward, distracting Aria with a moan that she struggled to suppress, only to barely succeed. </p><p>It was a delicious feeling to slide inside Aria repeatedly while Sapphire leaned back to the other end of the bath, her beautiful breasts that easily rivaled Aria’s floating among the bubbles, enhancing the erotic potential of the moment several times. </p><p>It was a breathtaking moment even before Sapphire started explaining her tricks. “Let’s start educating you on the seduction. Hopefully, for once in your life, you can do something without being pointed at,” Sapphire said, which, admittedly, was undeservedly sharp. A day ago, their conflict would have just amused me, but now, a flare of annoyance appeared in my heart. </p><p>I have declared Aria as mine, who was she to insult her like that. Punishment was necessary. And the side-effects of the tantric spells she had tried to use against me gave me the perfect opportunity to exact some revenge. I started filling the bathwater with my mana slowly, allowing me to enhance the said side-effects. </p><p>Meanwhile, she started explaining her perspective on seduction. “The most important thing is your gaze,” Sapphire explained. “Every seduction starts and ends with the emotions reflected in your eyes. You need to reflect a mixture of innocence and availability, but never completely. Your target needs to think that he could get what you want, but only after a great effort.” </p><p>With that, Sapphire started to give a detailed breakdown of elementary seduction, her eyes still closed as she leaned against the bath, caring about the caresses of the warm water —even before my mana reached a density to properly affect her— more than whether Aria was fully getting what she had been explaining. Even when she was explaining that, she was distant, suggesting that their bond was even weaker than I had first assumed, which was critical information I used to adjust my further strategies, especially in the light of my growing relationship with Aria. </p><p>However, that was something to be considered later, because, at the moment, I was occupied by the increased tightness of Aria’s nether lips. She was clearly overwhelmed by the presence of the Queen in the bath, explaining to her how to seduce the dark lord —the same dark lord she was currently busy being impaled by— and reacting it by tightening further. </p><p>I reached to caress Aria’s beautiful blonde hair which framed the soft features of her face, currently contorted with pleasure. “Don’t worry, she’s plenty distracted,” I said as I gestured the Queen while I caressed along her spine, calming her while I impaled deeper repeatedly. As she moved, the water lapped over her nipples, begging for me to touch them. </p><p> I was never best rejecting the impulses unless there was a very strong reason against it. It was just the absurdity of the situation that the presence of the Queen that imprisoned me in her secret prison didn’t count as a strong reason. I caressed Aria’s breasts aggressively, and her back arched, a moan escaping her mouth. </p><p>I saw Sapphire stir and cut her explanation about the different types of kisses and sank back in the water, just in time to avoid being caught, leaving Aria to handle her shocked expression. “I know you always repressed yourself to a ridiculous degree, and the art of seduction is new for you, but at least try to control yourself and listen rather than imagining how it would feel to being kissed,” Sapphire said, with a detached uncaring manner that didn’t surprise me the slightest bit at this point. </p><p>She closed before poor Aria could even put together a response, and continued on explaining the best way to kiss. I didn’t miss the fact what she had been describing carried several interesting tricks from me. </p><p>It was nice to know that I had left an impression. </p><p>I once again pushed my head out of the water, this time using that opportunity to cover Aria’s neck with soft kisses, otherwise keeping silent, and she reacted by pushing her hips down, swallowing more of my shaft. It was obvious that what was transpiring was currently rewiring the way she had been looking at life. I could feel her expression change as she watched the Queen, her fear and respect slowly evaporating. </p><p>It was an understandable reaction. Their relationship was based on hierarchy and fear. Not that I disregarded fear and hierarchy, of course. As a dark lord, they were some of my favorite tools to rule the masses, but one should always be aware that they could be as dangerous to the wielder as they were to target. Fear, for example, works only when the target believes the power difference between the oppressor and the target was wide enough to be insurmountable. </p><p>For Sapphire, that sense of power came from her aura of infallibility. She always acted like she knew everything, using that to create an unsurmountable sense of authority. And now that Aria was watching Sapphire giving a long speech about seduction, unaware that they weren’t alone in the pool, her aura of infallibility shattered. </p><p>And my mischievous yet daring actions like continuing to fuck Aria and poking my head to kiss her neck were useful for more than just enhancing her pleasure. I was wordlessly showing her that Sapphire was not a real threat, but just a simple obstacle I could easily run circles around even when I was naked in the palace she owned, just a couple of feet away from her, sharing a bath… </p><p>It didn’t take long for Aria to unconsciously accept that message. Something started to stir inside her, something that she was yet to understand about her own mind and her own sexuality, maybe even her real position in life. </p><p>Aria managed to stay silent for a long time as the Queen’s explanations moved from kissing to best foreplays tactics, her eyes firmly shut. At this point, my mana in the water slowly reached the critical density, allowing me to tease Sapphire subtly using the leftovers of the tantric magic she tried to use on me, enhancing her arousal further. </p><p>It was very effective. </p><p>Her eyes shut even tighter as she continued explaining about foreplay, but her voice gained an ethereal quality as she started to detach completely from the situation and started focusing on the memories. The way she started shuffling in her place, shaking her amazing tits, was just another evidence of it. </p><p>Aria watched her with no small amount of shock, but that didn’t prevent her from picking up speed as I grabbed her tits aggressively, enjoying her body freely now that I would stay unnoticed. I still tried to keep the noise at a minimal level, but Sapphire was sufficiently gone to minimize the risk. </p><p>Almost at the same moment Sapphire ran her hand seductively along her thigh, her movements getting clearer as I used a subtle spell to dispel the bubbles on her side of the bath, giving me a clear view of her body. The sight of her fingers gently massaging her inner thigh as she mindlessly murmured the best foreplay tricks —while literally replaying one of the sessions I had delivered to perfection the previous evening— was amazing. </p><p>Aria twisted her neck to turn toward me, fluttering her eyelashes to look at me with her beautiful blue eyes, silently telling a story of desire and power, and she whispered. “Cum inside me,” she declared, making a monumental decision by not only rejecting the rule of the Queen, but also truly taking initiative in our relationship —twisted as it was. </p><p>Who was I to reject such a beautiful request? I exploded in her, filling her with my seed and my magic while she moaned freely —which I blocked through my magic, not wanting to alert Sapphire. Using a spell at that level was risky, but not as risky as Aria’s unbounded moans. As she rocked her hips, I felt my mana invading her body along with my seed, her healing magic working overdrive to contain my essence. </p><p>It was developing to be an amazing time for the first bath we shared. </p><p>All I needed to do was to decide on the next step… </p>
