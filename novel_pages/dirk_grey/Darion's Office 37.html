        <p>Gina couldn’t help but feel hot as she watched Mia’s boyfriend push her bartender to her knees and invade her mouth. She knew she should probably just retreat, but under his smirk, she wasn’t willing to. </p><p>She hadn’t once folded against Mia, and she wasn’t going to do so against her even weaker boyfriend. Oh, he looked strong and dominant, but Gina was familiar with the stories of exactly what Madam Paisley did with the boyfriends and husbands abandoned to her grasp. </p><p>He couldn’t be as strong as he looked if he was willing to accept such a treatment, which was enough to suppress any concern Gina might have otherwise felt as she watched him play with her employee. </p><p>Typical man, only able to act out against the weak. Gina lost count of the number of the men she had to dump just because they were uncomfortable with her wealth and power. </p><p>“Let’s make sure you get a better view,” he said mockingly as he pulled his shirt, showing his muscles … admittedly sexy enough to impress Gina. Too bad she knew that, despite everything, he was a weakling, which did a lot to reduce her attraction. </p><p>Still, at least it was a pleasant show, she thought as she watched Aisha’s top of head bobbing back and forth. Pity the piano was on the way, blocking the show. Gina thought about asking them to get a better position so she could enjoy the show, but after a momentary consideration, she decided against it. </p><p>Her pride was more important than a show… </p><p>Though, as Aisha’s apron flew, Gina found herself asking just how much of her pride it would have hurt if she had just taken a little peek. She owned the club, after all. </p><p>However, before she could even take a decision, he chuckled. “Let’s not deprive your boss of our show,” he said, his tone enough to send shivers through her. Too bad his voice was just fake, and had nothing to do with his true strength of personality. </p><p>He could never be anything more than an arm candy, and Gina didn’t feel low enough to take Mia’s discards … especially not after Madam Paisley had her turn and ruined him already. </p><p>Still, as he lifted Aisha like she weighed nothing looked good, the light glowing on them to highlight his serious yet handsome face. Then, he started walking, and Aisha already moving like a toy. </p><p>Gina never realized just how weak she had been. Maybe she should fire her once this debacle was over. What use was to have a loyal employee if she was manipulated that easily by anyone. </p><p>“Oh, I thought you were going to let me watch,” Gina mocked them as they moved behind her. </p><p>“Then, I had a better idea,” Darion answered, and Gina felt Aisha’s hands over her shoulders, the moan she let out showing exactly what was going on behind her. Gina couldn’t help but whimper as Aisha moaned, glad that Aisha was loud enough to cover her voice. </p><p>She couldn’t help. Darion’s domineering attitude might be paper thin, but she didn’t have the luxury of pressing him until that facade crumbled … and the more that facade stayed up, the more aroused she was getting. </p><p>Aisha’s whorish moans didn’t help. “Try to keep your voice down. Are you trying to deafen me,” she ordered, hoping that it would cover her voice.</p><p>“S-sorry, mistress,” Aisha answered, but her voice wasn’t her usual respectful tone. She decided not to blame her, as the sound of the wetness and flesh clapping showed her exactly what was going on behind her. </p><p>And, what Darion was packing wasn’t easy to handle. </p><p>Gina ignored the temptation to turn and watch Aisha being slammed even as she felt their position shift. It was a silent challenge, and she had no intention of letting that win over her. </p><p>She thought that things were over when she felt Aisha’s hand pulled away … but another hand landed on her body. A rougher, stronger hand, immediately followed by pulling her tunic up. She could have easily prevented it … but she realized it was a fair chance. He would get a glimpse of her naked body. </p><p>And she would have an excuse to turn toward them. </p><p>She let him pull the tunic up, acting like she was surprised by the move. “You’re a naughty man, aren’t you. Never satisfied,” she said as she stood up, acting like she was surprised … but not bothering to cover up her body. </p><p>“Of course not,” he said, teasing. “But, can you help me? I’m having trouble lifting the fat ass of this slut.” </p><p>Gina chuckled as Aisha shivered. He didn’t even look like he was lifting something let alone struggling, but she was feeling too horny to actually reject the chance to enjoy herself a bit. Not fully, of course, but a little preview wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>She took a step forward, wrapping her arm around Aisha’s smooth leg, enjoying the way her body shook with every push. Enjoyed too much, maybe, she realized. </p><p>She needed to stop before she did something she would regret. “Let’s put her down,” Gina commented as she led Aisha down, parting her legs open as Darion slipped inside … the way he parted Aisha tempted her even more. </p><p>She needed to stop indeed. </p><p>“Have fun,” Gina said as she stood up, glad that she was too good of an actor to show just how much the show affected her. </p><p>“Really, boss. You’re leaving just as things are getting fun,” Darion said. </p><p>“Unfortunately, I have a meeting,” Gina answered automatically, before even asking whether she actually respected him enough to bother coming up with an excuse. A mistake … but it was too late. </p><p>Somehow, she felt defeated. </p><p>No matter. </p><p>She would teach him a lesson the next time…</p>
