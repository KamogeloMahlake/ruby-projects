        <p>I did nothing for a while, just listening as the silence fell into the pool. I might have called it boring, but the water made the panicked shuffle of the girls clear, the sound of water moving to hit my ear like a song. </p><p>“Okay, girls, you know how the game goes. You need to make a bit of noise so I can find you.” </p><p>Sarah was the first to speak. Well, to be fair, speaking was not exactly what she had done. It was a cry, a moan even… A sexy sound. </p><p>And a smart one as well, because it triggered a reaction from the other girls as well, most gasping. Irene exclaimed. “Sarah!” And, to her great misfortune, she was too close to me. Two strokes, and before she could even realize it, I already caught her. </p><p>“I caught you —“ I started, only to be interrupted. </p><p>“Stop!” a voice called. I stopped, surprised. I was surprised, because of the source of that voice. Not Irene like I expected … but Sarah again. I was sure that she had a trap in mind, so I listened. </p><p>“Okay,” I said, but I still kept my hand on Irene’s waist, far lower than it was appropriate, enjoying the way she shivered under my fingers. “Tell me why?” </p><p>“Another rule for the game,” Sarah said. “Whenever you catch someone, you need to identify your victim correctly.” </p><p>“Why should I accept that rule,” I answered with a chuckle. “It only makes the game harder.” </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t handle it, big boy.” </p><p>“Well, I might, but I should have some time to assess my target. Otherwise, it would be unfair.” </p><p>“Excellent,” Sarah said. “But you should let your current catch go. It’s not fair for her to get a new rule immediately.” </p><p>“I … I don’t mind,” Irene interrupted. “I’m the one that got caught. I need to … suffer  … the consequences.” </p><p>The usage of the word earned a derisive laugh from Sarah. To be fair, she wasn’t the only one laughing. She was just the loudest. </p><p>“Let’s start, then,” I said as I put one of my hands on her stomach, and the other on her back. I started moving my hand on her back, enjoying the way she shivered. I had been planning to play along slowly, teasingly, but then, Irene managed to change my mind. </p><p>A soft moan escaped her mouth. </p><p>That was all I needed to let my other hand climb up, right at her chest, groping her, a daring move that earned gasps from everyone else. “Daring,” Sarah commented from a distance, but I could hear the jealousy in her tone. </p><p>“Well, it’s hard to recognize people blindfolded,” I answered with a chuckle, not stopping my fingers from delving into her softness. </p><p>I enjoyed it for a while. “It has been a minute, make a guess,” Sarah called, though this time, there was no hiding her jealousy. “Do you want to make a guess, or should we leave you two alone!” </p><p>“If you insist,” I answered, then leaned forward. “I’m going to guess that I’m holding a redheaded goddess,” I moaned throatily, and without even waiting for a response, pulled off her bra and wrapped it around my arm.  </p><p>Yet, rather than letting her go, I cupped her naked breasts, her nipples hard against my palm. “You have to let her go to continue the game,” Sarah called once more, frustrated that her little scheme not developing as she expected. </p><p>It was a pity that I was blindfolded, because I could easily imagine her looking angrily at Carrie for her excessive permissiveness. The game was a thinly veiled excuse to exert control, and it was already ruined. </p><p>I didn’t say anything. I was having too much fun to risk calling her on it. Instead, I pulled back, and started swimming back and forth, moving faster than they could react — though, from the sounds they were making, they were not trying to make it particularly hard to get caught. </p><p>Soon, I managed to catch another, the tightness of her body, developed through endless yoga, was impossible to be confused. “Hmm, another one. Now, I just need to guess,” I said as I leaned forward,, trapping Naomi between my body and the edge of the pool, my shaft buried between her cheeks. </p><p>I said nothing as my hands disappeared underwater and grabbed her firm thighs, molesting them recklessly. Her moans were beautiful. “Hmm, a little flabby. I’m guessing the owner doesn’t exercise much —“ I started. </p><p>“How dare you!” Naomi exclaimed as she pushed me back. Unfortunately for her, I had already grabbed the string of her bottom, and as I moved away, I dragged her bottom with me. </p><p>“Oh, come on, Naomi. I can’t believe you fell for that. You’re such a virgin,” Sarah called, her call made more amusing by the fact that she was there when Naomi lost that.</p><p>“Shut up, Sarah,” Naomi called, her tone shamed. </p><p>I chuckled as I raced around the pool once more, leaving them to their little fight. They sniped at each other, while I managed to grab Ida. “Hello, my exotic beauty,” I said as I slowly freed her from her top, but I continued to squeeze her breasts. “Let’s make sure I know who are you,” I added as I enjoyed her tits. </p><p>“Enough playing,” Carrie called, her tone a tad jealous and frustrated. </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I called, and suddenly, I dove underwater. It didn’t make me invisible, but it shocked them enough that I managed to catch two of them at the same time. One of them was clearly Carrie, but the other, I only recognized as I pulled toward me. </p><p>Sarah. </p><p>Nice. </p><p>“And, I caught Sarah and Carrie, completing the set for the first round,” I said teasingly. </p><p>“W-wrong,” Sarah said, trying to conceal her voice. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said as I pulled Carrie’s top, freeing her amazing tits as they deserved before turning my attention to Sarah. I carried her toward the edge of the pool, trapping her just like I did to Naomi. </p><p>I pulled her top off immediately. “So, are you saying that, if I opened my eyes, I’ll not see Sarah?” I started, then leaned forward, whispering in a way others couldn’t hear. “Shuffling like a needy whore, trying to anger me, just because she’s too arrogant to actually beg for what she truly wants.” </p><p>My shaft pressed against her stomach, making her shiver more. </p><p>“O-okay, you guessed right,” she admitted, one that was an answer to my latest statement and not just her cheating attempt. </p><p>“Good, a punishment, then,” I said as I pulled her top and bottom at the same time — though, considering how little they were, it should count as one. I didn’t limit it to that, and before she could react, I gathered her arms behind her back, and used her swimsuit to tie them back. </p><p>With that done, I pushed her out of the pool. “You better get some timeout for cheating,” I said mockingly, like I hadn’t just pushed her to a point that made her reveal her naked body in a very compromised manner. </p><p>Pity I was still blindfolded. </p><p>As I pulled back, Sarah whispered. “Hurry up, we still have our next game,,” she said. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, she was still being punished, so I decided to deliver the slowest, most extended game of tag imaginable. I caught them many times, of course, but just by deliberately calling them the wrong names, I extended the game quite a bit. </p><p>Not a great hardship, as each catch ended up with another half-naked beauty pressing against me. I even gave a piggyback ride to Naomi after one of my ‘failures’, her naked pussy pressing against my neck. </p><p>Unfortunately, as fun as it was to tease Sarah, I didn’t extend the game for more than fifteen minutes, not wanting to ruin the mood. One by one, I divested each girl of their clothing, leaving Carrie to the last, trapping her near the ladder as she tried to escape. </p><p>I tried to ‘prevent’ ending up with my face temporarily burying into her wet ass. A glorious feeling for certain. </p><p>“Wait for two minutes, then come to the living room,” Sarah ordered before we escalate further. Considering how entertaining her previous game had been, I decided to listen to her. </p><p>Two minutes into the pool, I removed the blindfold, found a towel, and walked back into the house. </p><p>In my living room, a surprising sight was waiting for me. The girls were all sitting on the large couch, which was not that surprising. </p><p>The surprising part was that all of them were under one blanket. And, I was too familiar with them to miss the discomfort on their faces — more intense on Irene and Ida, and a fake one on Carrie. </p><p>It wasn’t hard to deduce that they were all naked under that blanket. </p><p>“Sit there,” Sarah ordered before I could comment, pointing at an armchair. Large, but for a single person, but another blanket was waiting for me. “Sit down and get rid of that ugly swim shorts!” she ordered. </p><p>I was too happy to follow that, curious about what was our next game…</p>
