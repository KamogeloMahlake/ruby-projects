        <p>Hi Everyone. </p><p>I'm going through a bit of tough week, so, rather than the usual update schedule, I was only share one of the stories I had written for emergencies. </p><p>My apologies for the interruption, but I'm going a bit of a personal crisis. </p><p>Next week, the updates will continue as usual. </p><p>Hopefully, you guys would enjoy Icy Discipline.</p>
