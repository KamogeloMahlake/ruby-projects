        <p>Hi everyone, </p><p>I'm going through a little copyright dispute about the visuals I had been using for the stories, and as a part of it, I'll have to remove them from my pages for the time being. </p><p>The stories will continue as is, and I'll do my best to solve it, or by finding an alternative method for it. </p><p>I'll keep you posted about any changes. </p>
