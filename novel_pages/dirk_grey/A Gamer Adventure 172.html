        <p>Being crushed under a dragon should be a scary concept, the kind that was supposed to make my heart explode in fear. </p><p>However, considering the current form of the little sexy dragon who thought herself to be my mistress, the current speed of my heart had little to do with fear, especially not when her hips started to dance over my lap. </p><p>The expression on her face was beautiful, a mixture of arousal and frustration, victory suspiciously absent. “You look frustrated, mistress—“ I started, only for her hand to appear over my face, shutting me up. </p><p>“Don’t you dare to speak,” she growled, smart enough to realize the direction of the words I had prepared, and with no intention of allowing me to mock her. Yet, her current frustrations with my attitude could not be compared to the burning need of her unmet arousal. </p><p>Otherwise, she wouldn’t have climbed on my lap, rocking back and forth as her weight pressed against my shaft. She didn’t take me inside her, but from the way she was going, I guessed it wasn’t too far away. </p><p>So, rather than trying to coax her, I put my hands under my head, enjoying the show. “Stop it,” she warned. </p><p>“Stop what?” I asked, not hiding my smirk. “I didn’t say anything.” </p><p>That earned another growl, but rather than trying to push me on the issue, she put her hands on my chest, using the leverage to rock me more desperately. Though as her dance picked up speed, I was starting to feel tempted to call off our little game as I pushed her against the wall or bent her over the table once again, taking her freely. </p><p>Yet, I stayed in my place, obedient. As much as the idea of taking her roughly was fun, it couldn’t compare to the idea of my lust-filled dragon getting so overwhelmed to take me. </p><p>Being ridden by a dragon was a unique experience. </p><p>So, I kept my mouth shut even as her delicate hands caressed my chest, her nails sharp enough to leave actual bleeding wounds on my chest — though they recovered only after a moment. She was almost straight looking up at first, but the more her hips repeated their glorious movement, the more she leaned forward. Her tits soon started to rub against my chest, but she avoided kissing me. </p><p>Amusingly, she wouldn’t be able to kiss me without changing her position even if she wished to do so. A humorous drawback of her shortness. </p><p>I managed to keep my opinion to myself about her height, courtesy of her sexy ass, rubbing against my shaft repeatedly. Yet, she was determined not to sink my shaft into her sopping wet entrance, repeating the same motion again and again. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of allowing that to be the whole theme, especially since, I had the ability to change it without actually taking back the control. </p><p>First, I brought my mana to the surface once more, coating the head with a generous amount of it and leaving the rest to the shaft, before I chose the exact apex of her movement, and changed the positioning of my shaft slightly. </p><p>[-610 Mana]</p><p>When she moved back once more, she noticed the sudden change of alignment, but not before the tip sank into her wetness. “No,” she gasped as she pulled herself back, only to stop halfway as I felt the mana around my shaft starting to be drained with an efficiency that surpassed her earlier attempts. </p><p>Sex was truly the superior way to deliver mana after it went through Tantric treatment. </p><p>I said nothing, just lay on my back, my hands crossed under my head, enjoying the sudden conflicting expression on her face. She said nothing at first, nor did she move, which was interesting because it left the tip buried in her wetness. </p><p>“It’s wrong,” she murmured, but her voice lacked confidence as she suffered a mental battle about the merits. </p><p>I could have whispered her suggestions that it was nothing, claimed that it was a step she had to take to get my mana, or even blamed her for cowardice. Any of those options would have made her move faster, taking us to the next step. </p><p>But I kept my mouth shut. None of those options were as entertaining as watching her struggle with her emotions, failing to come up with an answer. Why should I abandon her delicious conflict for a lesser entertainment? </p><p>Her plump ass started to tremble as she tried to come to a decision, going back and forth in her mind while her hips didn’t move at all, which would have been disappointing if it wasn’t for the crown of my shaft still buried in her entrance, allowing me to enjoy her warmth thoroughly, her wetness getting out of control. </p><p>She was a dragon, mighty, fascinating, and prideful, a combination that should have ensured the victory of her willpower. Unfortunately, she was also an unabashed hedonist with a weakness for finer things, not to mention her greed begging her to get more of my precious mana. </p><p>As much as watching her conflict had been fun, her decision was never in doubt. “Just the tip, there’s no harm in that,” she whispered. I suspected it was more about convincing herself than explaining it to me. </p><p>Her hands landed on my chest once more as her hips started to rock, making her beautiful tits sway to her rhythm, my tip slipping in and out. I expected her to be impatient, sinking deeper, but she showed incredible determination — for her standards — and managed to stay limited to the tip. </p><p>I was not above cheating, not when I could do it at the expanse of some more disposable mana.  I reinforced the mana coating my shaft, but this time, keeping the focus a touch lower than the tip. The perfect bait for a greedy dragon. </p><p>[-320 Mana]</p><p>It didn’t take long for it to show results, as her hips picked up speed. At first, she managed to restrict herself around the tip even with the increased speed, but then, in one of her rockings, she moved deeper. </p><p>It was a mistake that was corrected quickly, making me doubt the success of my strategy. Luckily, that doubts didn’t last long, as, after just a few seconds, the mistake happened again… And again… </p><p>Soon, she moved too far to define the situation as just the tip, even under the most generous descriptions. Not that I was complaining, not with my shaft parting her delicious pussy lips more with every repeat, even though it was a slow process, like she was trying to make me forget the previous limits by her rapid movements. </p><p> Suppressing the temptation to help her was extremely hard. Luckily, I had better control over my desires than her — when the said time was being measured in minutes and not days, if I were to be honest — and managed to keep my desires to grab her hips and sank myself into her depths. </p><p>Luckily, she was a very kind dragon, and her movements continued to escalate, my shaft parting her tight lips more and more. Slowly, the tip moved deeper as she took more and more of my hard cock inside her, drenching it with her wetness. </p><p>She closed her eyes as the pleasure started to intensify, like closing her eyes would allow her to reject the situation. Normally, I would have mocked her until she opened her eyes, but the sway of her tits as she quickened while she took even more of my shaft inside her was a good way of asking mercy wordlessly. </p><p>Her moans exploded louder and louder as my shaft continued to disappear, the pleasure reaching a high level, triggering my temptation as well. I finally let my hands move, grabbing her swaying tits — just to make she didn’t injure herself recklessly due to their extreme swaying, of course. </p><p>I was a nice boy. </p><p>As I squeezed her tits, the pain cut through the pleasure she was feeling, working as a reminder. Her beautiful emerald eyes popped open, looking down in shock, no doubt realizing just how far she let things escalate. </p><p>“I … I think that’s enough mana,” she muttered as she started moving, freeing my shaft of her presence. The only problem: it wasn’t the freedom that I wanted. Or she wanted, if her torturous slowness was any indicator. </p><p>I had no doubt that she would soon continue with her game even if she limited her actions slightly in the process. But I didn’t want to go through the same repeat again, not when things were just getting fun. </p><p>So, I cheated a bit. A simple Biomancy spell, weak enough to cost only a single point of mana — though it only affected her because the mana was already helpfully devoured by her, preventing her from resisting the spell — to make her leg twitch. </p><p>And just like that, her reluctant rise reversed, and reversed hard as she slid down, devouring the full length of my shaft as she slid down, her cry of pleasure worthy of a dragon. </p><p>Well, almost full length, I thought in amusement as I felt the head pressing against her absolute limit, not moving more, yet some of my shaft was still out. </p><p>After all, she might be a dragon, but in this form, she was still deliciously tiny… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 3942 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
