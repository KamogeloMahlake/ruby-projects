        <p>“Sorry about the delay,” I said to Naomi, who was still on the couch, zapping between the channels. “I remembered to pick up the laundry.” </p><p>“Not a problem,” she answered hurriedly, though I had noticed one important change. She had removed her coat, revealing her clothes underneath. Unfortunately, they were not the clothes we had picked today. </p><p>What a pity. </p><p>My plan was to have a quick stop by the laundry room before stopping at the kitchen, when the doorbell rang once more. “It must be the delivery,” I said to Naomi, and I found myself wishing that was the case. Not that I didn’t welcome Carrie’s presence, but the situation was tricky enough without having another visitor to complicate it further. </p><p>Luckily, this time, it was actually the delivery guy, giving me my food. “You’re lucky,” I said to Naomi as I went back to the living room. “Pizza just arrived.” </p><p>“At this hour?” she asked, her voice much sharper as she looked at the box in my hands. </p><p>“Hey, after all the training I had done today, I earned my cheat day.” </p><p>“I don’t approve cheat days,” she said, the health nut hidden in her pushing to the surface quickly, her earlier shyness forgotten. “They have a tendency to multiply.” </p><p>“Hey, I don’t cheat without putting in the extra effort,” I said, which earned a disbelieving gaze from her. I could see why the girls did their best to avoid the topic of food or nutrition from her. If that was her reaction to me, her attitude toward the girls must have been much more intense. “What’s with the disbelieving gaze,” I said, unable to hide my smirk. </p><p>“Well, I heard that many times,” she said, her tone turning smug, showing she had already won the discussion. That level of sanctimonious superiority in a discussion might have been annoying in other circumstances, but I was more than happy to make an exception for such a sexy girl. </p><p>Still, unlike her friends, I had no problems attacking her on the same topic. I played to win. </p><p>“Really,” I said as I removed my shirt immediately, throwing it on the side. “Why don’t you show me where I’m gathering fat if those cheat days are so dangerous,” I said. </p><p>My sudden revealing move seemed to destroy her attitude, mostly because she was too interested in ogling my muscular chest than actually trying to come up with a counter. That would not do, I decided even as I flipped open the pizza box, and took a large bite from the first slice. “Amazing.”</p><p>“J-just because your chest is perfect don’t —“ she started, but I interrupted her. </p><p>“Ohh, you think my chest is perfect,” I said in a teasing tone, even pushing my muscles to highlight the show. I wasn’t exactly a bodybuilder due to the position requirements, but I certainly provided a nice view, confirmed by the sudden hunger in her gaze. </p><p>“N-not the point,” she managed to stammer, though only after I took another bite from the pizza, goading her to action once more. “Just because you don’t have any fat on your stomach or chest, it doesn’t mean that you don’t have anywhere else. Problem area is often around the hips.” </p><p>“A good point,” I nodded, looking thoughtful, which made her smirk victoriously, though it only lasted until I pulled my pants down, leaving only my boxers on. Under her shocked gaze, I put the pizza on the table, and did a twirl for her. “See, no fat anywhere,” I said smugly. “I can remove the boxers as well if you’re not convinced.” </p><p>“No … need,” she murmured, but unlike her earlier exclamations, that came pretty slow, showing that she would have no problems enjoying the show thoroughly if I didn’t listen to her. Instead, I decided to follow her request, and plopped next to her. </p><p>Not bothering to put my clothes on in the process, of course. </p><p>Soon, Naomi’s gaze was dancing between my food and my body, unable to decide what to do. “You still shouldn’t eat junk food,” she finally decided to say. </p><p>“The occasional cheating helps one to focus better,” I answered. “Why don’t you take a bite instead.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured, but when I brought the piece under her nose, the smell assaulting her, her expression flickered, showing that it was easier to preach the benefits of healthy living without the tempting smell of junk food. </p><p>The temptation for the win. </p><p>“Maybe a bite,” she said, but when she tried to bite, I pulled it back at the last minute, earning a questioning gaze. </p><p>“I don’t like double standards,” I said. “You need to earn your right to junk food just like I did.”</p><p>She was a smart girl, realizing what I meant immediately. Her mouth opened like she wanted to argue, but no words got out, unable to find an appropriate reply to my absurd requirement. </p><p>I was shameless enough to use her shock to my benefit, and grabbed the bottom of her shirt, and started lifting it, revealing more of her beautiful milky chocolate skin, her mouth widening even more in shock. </p><p>Ignoring that reaction, I dragged my fingers on her stomach gently, making her shiver. “Good, you don’t have any excess fat on your sexy belly,” I said, my words hardly helping her composure. </p><p>“O-of course I don’t,” she managed to say, the compliment on her body once again allowing her to retreat to her most comfortable area. “I have a two-hour exercise schedule to prevent fat from accumulating.” </p><p>“Impressive,” I said, my smirk widening. “Let’s see how the rest of your body responds to your amazing schedule.” With that, I started dragging her shirt up, slow enough to be classified as lazy, giving her ample time to prevent it if she wished, though only because I knew she wouldn’t do so, not after our little fun in the dressing room. </p><p>Her shirt was a loose, boring one, but when its hem reached her chest, the bra underneath was more than enough to compensate for it. I expected another sports bra, and seeing the bright orange edge as I dragged upward, I assumed it was the case. </p><p>However, as I continued to pull up, I noticed the lacy nature of her bra, too thin to work as a sports bra, a mere decoration rather than providing support — not that her amazing globes needed any assistance in defying the existence of gravity. </p><p>“Beautiful bra,” I commented shamelessly. “Did you buy that today as well?” Shocked by my comment, she just nodded before realizing what she had just admitted, the equivalent of dressing for me, avoiding my gaze even as I pulled her shirt completely, her arms rising to allow it. “You should have asked me to help you there as well, I could have helped you to pick even more fun stuff,” I whispered into her ear, using our closeness better. </p><p>“Maybe later,” she murmured, barely above a whisper. “But now, I want to enjoy the pizza I earned,” she said as she grabbed a slice. </p><p>“Not so fast,” I said as I grabbed her wrist, and took a big bite from her slice. I looked at my own lower half pointedly first, before turning my gaze toward her sweatpants. “It doesn’t seem like things are equal, does it?” I asked. </p><p>“You don’t mean—“ she gasped, only for me to cut. </p><p>“That’s exactly what I mean,” I said even as I took another bite from the slice she was holding, amused by her incredulous reaction after what had happened before. “I said it before, I don’t like double standards.” </p><p>She stood frozen, and I used the opportunity to finish the slice, but I didn’t stay there. I started licking her fingers slowly, starting from her pinkie, slow and sensual. The way she was shuffling in her seat as I licked her fingers was beautiful, though not as beautiful as the subtle moans she was letting out. </p><p>She was yet to act when I finished with her fingers, so I started going upward. I had no problems teasing her until she reached her limit and decided to act. She could stay passive despite my subtle goading, of course, but that was hardly a horrible situation as well. </p><p>I started with a gentle kiss to her palm, making her shiver, before moving up to her wrist, then trailing up to her arm, leaving a lingering path of kisses. Her moans were delicious, though it took quite a while for her to finally act. Only when my lips pressed against her neck did she stand up hurriedly, no doubt realizing I had no problem moving even higher — or worse, lower. </p><p>Despite her hurried jump, however, the next steps of her action happened in a lingering slowness. She turned away from me as she grabbed the waistbands of her pants, slowly pushing them down to reveal her matching panties. They were modestly sized, but their bright colors, along with the incredible tightness of her ass, worked wonders to turn it into an amazing show nonetheless. </p><p>As the sweatpants moved down, revealing more of her toned legs, the show was getting better and better. Then, she finished and turned to look at me, only to find me showing off a full mast. Her gaze stayed stuck, her eyes wide as a doe.</p><p>I gestured her to make a twirl, and she did so after a slight delay, allowing me to devour the sight of her perfect body. “Slower,” I said, and she repeated, giving me an extended show of her beautiful body, clad in bright orange sexy underwear. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, not bothering to hide my smirk as I patted the seat next to me. “You have an excellent body, and you earned your slice.” </p>
