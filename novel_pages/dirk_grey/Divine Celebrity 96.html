        <p>My first inclination as she revealed yet another secret was to shout, and shout loudly, and the only reason I managed to suppress that anger was the habit of a lifetime. Pointless flares of anger were not something I could afford without anyone to rely on. </p><p>“Would you mind explaining to me what is Empowerment?” I asked instead. </p><p>“Simple,” she said dismissively. “You just cast a spell to increase their physical capabilities while spending some of the Intent you gathered, and they experience an increase of strength, just like what you’re gathering.”</p><p>“Interesting, and is it permanent or temporary,” I said. </p><p>“Both, but I doubt you if you could manage anything permanent with the broken state of the System. It needs to recover enough to allow you to properly attain Divine Traits first. And, to cast temporary empowerment, you need to learn more magic,” she added.</p><p>I was tempted to mention to her that, maybe, just maybe, she shouldn’t be devouring all the Intent I was able to gather so that the system could recover, but once again I swallowed my words. She was getting more and more dismissive of me after her recovery, and I didn’t want to show just how much that annoyed me. </p><p>At least, her careless words told me that the current cap of capabilities I had been dealing with was temporary, and my abilities would increase even further by default as the System recovered. </p><p>A fact that I wouldn’t have cared that much if it wasn’t for the constant assassination attempts of the mysterious shadows, with the potential of bigger and badder things on the horizon. </p><p>Still, even with that looming threat I didn’t confront her directly, but chose a different manner. “Magic,” I muttered. “Do you mind teaching me a bit, we have time,” I offered. </p><p>“It’s not the time yet,” she answered immediately, but she wasn’t a good actor enough to hide the tone of finality in her tone. It might be my suspicious personality, but it was hard to interpret her sharp answer as anything but a firm rejection. </p><p>“If you think so,” I answered amenably, acting like I had accepted her declaration without an issue, even as I typed a text rapidly. After all, just because I lacked the ability to confront her directly didn’t mean I was helpless against her. </p><p>I dallied in the storage room for a few minutes, putting the stuff back in their place, when I heard a knock on the door. </p><p>“Come in,” I called, and the door opened, revealing Kim, who I had texted earlier. </p><p>“What do you want?” she asked sharply as she closed the door, but her smile disagreed with her sharp tone. So did her sashaying hips.   </p><p>I liked her sharp attitude. “I just wanted to check how your little documentary is going,” I said. </p><p>“Already finished shooting and preliminary editing, and now our little genius is helping our Coach to record some of the lines again.” </p><p>“She’s not a good actor?” I asked. </p><p>“Not even close,” Kim answered as she walked forward, getting closer and closer, her hips dancing wildly. “They still need quite a bit of time to finish.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as she stood in front of me, her lips parted invitingly, begging for my attention. I had no intention of rejecting that invitation, not when I had called her for this in the first place. “So, you’re saying that you can afford a ten-minute break,” I said as I put my hand on her waist. </p><p>As I did so, I watched my guide from the corner of my eye, amused by her lack of attention as she focused on the book, unaware of what was coming. Which was well, as it would make react even more exaggeratedly.</p><p>An attitude that contrasted greatly with her sexy leather ensemble, one that she failed to change no matter how many times she tried, giving me a chance to enjoy her spectacular body. </p><p>“Oh, you think ten minutes will be enough?” Kim said. </p><p>“Considering you still need to walk afterward, definitely yes,” I answered. </p><p>Her lips parted, ready to deliver a scathing remark, but they were simply too tempting to waste speaking. I learned, capturing her lips in a heated kiss. </p><p>Kim’s spectacular moan was enough to get the attention of my guide. “W-what!” she stammered in shock as she gazed at me. “N-not again,” she added as she tried to move away. </p><p>She failed to move away as if she hit an invisible wall. Interesting, especially since she had no trouble moving that much away from me. Still, it was a welcome development, as she disappeared right after covering her face with her hands. </p><p>I felt her presence settle back into my soul. </p><p>Her sudden inability to move away was interesting, which felt rather similar to her inability to change her clothes, both contrasting greatly with her personality. However, I didn’t have the time to explore that. </p><p>With her gone, the presence of Kim had become useless from a strategic perspective — a detail that I chose to ignore temporarily as I leaned forward, intensifying the kiss even more as my hands had free reign over her body. </p><p>A fact Kim had no problem with, told through the way her fingers struggled with my belt to push my pants down. Never one to ignore such an opportunity, I responded in kind, my Agility allowing me to do so instantly despite the tightness of her pants. </p><p>She succeeded a moment later. “It seems that you win,” she gasped, her voice beautiful. </p><p>“It seems that I do,” I answered. “Now, it’s time for the reward,” I added, pushing her against the wall as she tried to come up with an answer. She hit the wall hard, but her only reaction was a gasp of approval. </p><p>She wasn’t the one that would mind a bit of rough play. </p><p>“Try to keep your moans down, we don’t want a scandal,” I warned her before I slid inside her. Normally, I would have teased her a bit more, but it was against the quickie etiquette. </p><p>And, I was a nice guy who would never violate such etiquette. </p><p>“Of course—“ she started bravely, only for that determination to disappear in panic as I pushed inside her, making her bite her lips desperately.  </p><p>“That’s not too much, is it?” I whispered mockingly. </p><p>“Of course — not,” she managed to deliver, choppily with her moans invading her tone. It was impressive that she was able to speak. Unfortunately for her, in her arrogance, she decided to push for more. “I can handle—“ she tried to say, only to die into a beautiful cry as my lips landed on her neck.</p><p>Her back arched in pleasure, hitting the wall hard. Her hands landed on my shoulders, but rather than pushing me away, she pulled me even tighter into her embrace. Her gasps exploded even louder as she grabbed me with a strength that was surprising for her to have in her thin frame.</p><p>“Not bad,” I whispered, which worked perfectly as a key, her hips parting open even more, showing that she was enjoying the situation even more than she was willing to admit. </p><p>Enough to be tamed temporarily. </p><p>She moaned, staying as passive as she could manage, enjoying my reckless assault, each push slamming hard. Luckily, the room was isolated well — which was the reason I picked it for training in the first place. </p><p>And, now, I was enjoying the ancillary benefits of it. </p><p>Her arousal continued to rise, her moans exploding deliciously in the storage room. Lost in pleasure, she didn’t resist even a bit as I pulled out for a moment and flipped her so that she was leaning against the wall, with her ass pointing at me. </p><p>I slid inside her wetness once again, the angle allowing me to repeat my assault even more aggressively. </p><p>“M-maybe a breather?” she asked. </p><p>“Not a chance, sweetie,” I said as I grabbed her beautiful red hair. “I still have to go and run the quarterback selection, so I can only give you five minutes. So, if  you are alright with waiting until the selection is over, we can stop.” </p><p>“You’re a fucking bastard,” she moaned. </p><p>I chuckled as I paused my hips for a second. “Should I take it as a request to stop?” I asked. She said nothing, just pushing her hips back to restart our little dance, her frustrated growl as beautiful as her warmth. “Just as I thought,” I whispered as I invaded her core recklessly, her moans rising to a spectacular degree. </p><p>She said nothing else under the invasion of my hips, each second driving her pleasure to a greater degree. As I continued rocking my hips, my length disappearing repeatedly inside her, it didn’t take long for her to reach the promised land. </p><p>Just I exploded inside her. “What a good way to take a break, right,” I whispered as I grabbed her waist, preventing her from collapsing.  </p><p>She just murmured, though her insults hardly had any power when lost in pleasure. I waited a bit for her to recover and dress back, then accompanied her to the nearest bathroom, allowing her to fix her looks before she rejoined the group. </p><p>I walked back to the stadium, to handle the quarterback selection.</p>
