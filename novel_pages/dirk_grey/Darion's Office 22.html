        <p>Darion had a smile as he walked forward, confident despite the fact that he was breaking and entering. He could have — and should have — returned to his home, but he was yet to arrange a new house for himself, and he didn’t want to go back to the dingy little studio apartment that was his official address, and his actual house was known to his gang. </p><p>A gang that he didn’t want to communicate with just yet. Not when he was having so much fun without any danger. </p><p>It was why he had returned to the same mansion he had arrived earlier, to visit his newest ‘friend’ to stay. </p><p>The same ‘friend’ who was rushing toward him, trying to look angry rather than aroused. He didn’t neglect to take her number after their earlier encounter, and just ten minutes ago, alerted her about his approach. </p><p>“Darion, I told you, you can’t be here. My host doesn’t allow overnight guests! You’ll get me kicked out,” she begged. </p><p>Darion smirked slightly as he took note of her looks. “Damn, you’re so sexy,” he commented. </p><p>She tried to hide it, but his words make her heart flutter. And, if the way she tightened her legs was any indicator, also made her core heat up, no doubt affected by the memories earlier. </p><p>“T-that’s not the issue. You can’t be here,” she complained, trying to act unaffected. </p><p>“Oh, really?” Darion answered. “It wasn’t what you said when I called and asked you for a date.” </p><p>She blushed even more. “Yes … but I thought you’ll bring me out … not a home date.” </p><p>“What’s the difference,” he argued. </p><p>“What’s the difference!” she gasped, her voice getting louder. “I just told you that my host doesn’t allow it, and I can’t afford a place of my own. I’m just lucky that I managed to find a rich woman who wants to support her alma mater and allowed me to stay just handle the cleaning!” </p><p>“As you wish,” Darion answered. “Just a kiss before I leave, then.” </p><p>“That would be —“ she started to answer before her word were cut.  </p><p>That was all Darion allowed her to say before he leaned forward and captured her lips in a searing kiss. She tried to push him back, but that only last a second before her hands lost their strength, her tongue responding to his invasion. </p><p>As he kissed, he let his hands down, testing his earlier guess about her core heating up. He found her core burning in arousal, confirming his earlier guess. Her core was truly burning. </p><p>He played with her for a while, letting her relax, then he suddenly lifted her up, her panties easily destroyed under his fingers. “What are you doing!” she gasped. </p><p>“Not so loud,” he reminded even as his fingers squeezed her naked ass, enjoying the way her hands clutching at his back panicked. “You don’t want our host to catch us, right?” </p><p>“No I — don’t,” she tried to say, unable to hold back her moan under his fingers. “You have to let me go!” </p><p>“Right now?” he asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she replied. </p><p>Darion did so, but only let her feet touch the ground while he hugged her from behind. “Better?” he asked. </p><p>She no doubt wanted to answer him angrily, but as his fingers started working on her clit, her argument died under her resolutely tightening lips. If she opened them, the only thing that would let out was an explosive moan. </p><p>Captive in her pleasure, she did nothing as Darion quickly shed his clothes without letting her go — not even stopping his fingers for more than a second as they danced at her core. </p><p>“Is this your —“ she tried to ask as his shaft pressed against her naked ass, but that argument died while his fingers worked on her core, each second making her tremble more and more. </p><p>“Yes, sweetie, that’s my surprise gift for you, one that I prepared to give at the end of the date. And since the date is canceled…” </p><p>She might have argued against it, but she was busy trying to keep her top on. “What if she comes…” </p><p>“I doubt it’ll make such a difference,” he said as he pushed her down. “Now, start working on your gift.” </p><p>He chuckled as she was quick to follow that comment. She knelt, taking his shaft deep inside her mouth. He didn’t let up for even a second as he fucked her mouth roughly and deeply as they lie together. </p><p>As he watched her enthusiasm, the little amount of doubt he had was quick to disappear, enjoying her process. There was no way she would stop now, he recognized, already enjoying the treatment. “Someone didn’t take her full treatment this morning,” he said, chuckling. </p><p>“Well, with that whore Lily dragging you away…” Mary said for a moment before slipping inside her mouth once again, showing her animosity toward her best friend. </p><p>Amusing indeed. </p><p>Unfortunately, before he could really get going, he heard some kind of voice approaching them. </p><p>“Oh, no, she’s coming, you need to hide,” she gasped. </p><p>“No, we need to be clever. If she asks who am I, tell her that I’m your swimming coach, and you’re trying for the team!” </p><p>“That doesn’t make sense,” she gasped. </p><p>Darion knew that it didn’t make sense, but then he had also seen her watching them with great interest from her bedroom window, so he was confident that she would accept that explanation. </p><p>“Of course it does,” he said as he lifted her up, and she wrapped her arms around him panicked, still wearing her gloves but nothing else to make the situation even more entertaining. </p><p>“Darion, please,” Mary gasped, but he ignored it as he moved toward the pool, and jumped in, their naked bodies sinking into the water. </p><p>“You told them that she’s a very concerned alumni, I’m sure she’ll accept that explanation. Just make sure you stay buried,” he explained. </p><p>“But—“ she started, but Darion cut her off as he grabbed her ass. </p><p>“Too late, she’s already here,” he said as he watched her approach. Though, as he watched her approach, his smirk widened. </p><p>At a distance, he hadn’t been able to get a good view of the owner of the house, and he had assumed she was just another old housewife, too ugly to get any action other than peeking at a bunch of young people. </p><p>But, as she walked closer, wearing nothing but a semi-transparent nightie, Darion was happy to correct that assumption. </p><p>She was an exotic beauty. </p><p>Just the perfect after-dinner dessert.</p>
