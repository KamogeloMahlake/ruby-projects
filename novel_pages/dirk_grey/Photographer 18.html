        <p>Stating that everything we had gone thought until now had been a warm-up had the nice effect of puncturing her little bubble of self-confidence, and she looked at me with a dash of fear. “Let’s see how you handle a real challenge. I want you to rest your hand on the edge of the couch, acting like you’re alone and deep in thought.” </p><p>“I can do that,” she said rapidly while she walked the designated spot just as quickly, missing the fact that her bosom was doing a nice dance under the insufficient restraint of her fragile bra. She stood still, an exaggerated confusion on her face while she tried to follow my commands. She followed them without an issue when focused on cycling her through a few simple poses, she even obeyed silently when I asked her to slide her nightie to reveal her naked shoulder, though with quite a bit of delay. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said. “Now, I want your expression to look like you’re thinking about something naughty,” I directed. </p><p>That was enough to bring her insecurities back to the surface. “Naughty?” she repeated, gasping like she was being strangled. </p><p>“Yes, naughty. Kissing, licking, penetration, that kind of naughty,” I repeated mercilessly. I pushed hard, because I wanted her to be unbalanced for the next step. </p><p>“But-” she tried to interject, her panic blooming, but I cut her off. </p><p>“No buts. It’s an underwear catalog, and the idea of sexiness is a big part of the sale. I need to make sure you can reflect a sense of casual sexiness that would work well.” She looked no different than a little rabbit, caught in a trap. Unfortunately for her, she was getting advice from a hungry wolf. She nodded, and I continued. “Good, now, I want you to imagine yourself walking through a mall while wearing these exact clothes.” She immediately turned crimson. “No, no, no!” I cut in. “You look too shy, I want you to own your sexiness.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to interject once more, and once again, I interrupted her.</p><p>“No buts! One more but, and I stop,” I warned, making her nod rapidly, afraid of losing her opportunity. I continued with a kinder tone. “I  understand that it’s not easy to pinpoint the exact emotion I want for your first time, but you’re an actress, and I’m sure you can be successful if you focus on your job rather than a pesky sensation of shame.” </p><p>She nodded resolutely despite her blush, and did her best for the next few commands. She was decent, definitely not a natural model like Nicole, but still much better than the second-rate stuck ups I usually had to work with. It was probably all the acting classes she received. It was still insufficient for her to be anything more than an extra in a TV show, but it was sufficient for a photo set, especially since my clients weren’t particularly picky. She just needed to learn how to listen to my directions better. </p><p>And I had an excellent way to teach her that particular lesson. “Now, sit down on the seat,” I said after several more poses, and she followed instantly. That was the simple part. “Now, cross your legs, and put your hand close to your core, like you’re about to pleasure yourself, but I want you to look surprised, like you’ve been caught.” A blush invaded her face as expected. “Not that much. I want you to imagine that it’s your boyfriend that caught you. You’re a bit embarrassed, but you’re also horny, and you have no problem letting him know.” </p><p>She opened her mouth, no doubt to deliver the forbidden word, but I raised my empty hand warningly. She did the smart thing and made no noise. To her credit, she even tried to reflect the emotions I wanted her to do for the next minute, but, ultimately, she failed. I sighed exaggeratedly as I put the camera down, though she didn’t know that I had already turned it to video recording mode, the lens pointing at her direction. Panic appeared on her face as I stopped taking pictures, getting the wrong impression. “No, Stephen. Please give me another chance! Please! I can do it.” </p><p>“Relax,” I said as I walked toward her, and stood behind her while she was still sitting on the couch, She made an attempt to turn, but I put my hands on her shoulders, preventing her movement. “I can see that you’re still a bit stressed, and it’s understandable. I’m going to give you a massage so that you can relax,” I said even as I started rubbing her shoulders. She stiffened, which was understandable considering the forced intimacy she found herself in. </p><p>She turned her head to catch my face, unable to handle the sudden intimacy, but I just chuckled with a calm expression before gesturing her to turn back. “Do you think it’ll help?” she asked. </p><p>I answered instantly. “Definitely. From what I see, the biggest problem is you’re too self-conscious around me. You shouldn’t be, I’m just the photographer, and you should treat me as I don’t exist.” </p><p>“But, that’s impossible-” she answered before I silenced her once more, this time by pressing my finger on her lips.  </p><p>“What did I say about that infernal word,” I reminded her. She dipped her head, lacking the courage to confront me about my overreach, instead of dipping her head shyly. “Still, if you’re having trouble ignoring my presence, then, we have only one option. We’re going to make you comfortable with my presence.” </p><p>“How?” she answered even as I dashed away, and I came up with two more bottles of beer before she could even stand up from her seat.</p><p>“Simple, we’re going to sit and talk,” I replied as I passed one bottle to her, while sipping the other myself. </p><p>She let out a relaxed breath as she tried to stand up. “Okay, that’s perfect. Let me go and change.” </p><p>Her attempt to leave was prevented by my arm wrapping around her waist before pulling her back. I was hoping that the sudden movement would dislodge her bra, but this time, luck failed me. “There’s no need to change. The aim is to make you comfortable around me while dressed like this,” I reminded her. “And I have already seen you in it, what’s the harm if you continue to wear it.” </p><p>“I guess,” she murmured, but took a large sip to compensate. The second bottle of beer wasn’t enough to make her drunk, and it wasn’t my aim in the first place. I just wanted her to relax a bit before the next step. When I asked her a question about her previous acting experience, she immediately started a long monologue about some insignificant role she had on a short film, something she classified as a groundbreaking opportunity. I listened to her drivel, because the more she talked, the more excited she got . Though, the way her bosom tingled whenever she made an exaggerated motion paid a role on my patience as well. </p><p>In the throes of excitement, she barely reacted when I pulled one of her legs to my lap and started rubbing her soles. She tried to complain, of course, but those didn’t last long once I argued it would help her to relax, not to mention I was an expert when it came to massage. She continued her tale, and I ignored her slowly intensifying blush, this time little to do with her shyness. </p><p>“You seem much more relaxed, maybe we can give it another try,” I said, and she nodded excitedly. “However, one of the techniques you mentioned, method acting, was really interesting. Maybe we should try that first to make sure you’re ready for the real shoot.” </p><p>“Excellent idea,” she nodded, missing the implications of it in her excited state. Method acting required her to immerse herself in the role completely, and the role she was going to play was the naughty girlfriend trying to seduce her boyfriend after being caught in the midst of a naughty session. </p><p>“Good, then from now on, I expect you to act like a total professional no matter what happens. I’m going to play the boyfriend,” I said, which reminded her of the nature of the scene we were about to shoot. But it was too late. I put my hand on her thigh, dangerously close to her sensitive spot, and murmured. “Oh, honey. I wasn’t expecting to find you at home at this hour, or with such a surprise.” I dragged my hand across her legs. “Are these new, I have never seen them before?” </p><p>She looked like she was about to cut our little game short, so I sent her a sharp glare. “Yes,” she managed to stammer. “I bought it for you.” </p><p>“Such a nice girlfriend,” I said as I caressed her cheek suggestively. “But I interrupted you unfairly. Why don’t you finish it first before we can move onto the main event.” She failed to understand what I was driving at until I gently grabbed her wrist and led her hand to her core, her fingers resting on her panties. Her eyes grew in shock as she understood what I was driving at, but once again, she lacked the willpower to make me stop. “Continue,” I ordered, and her eyes closed while her fingers started dancing over her entrance, probing her lips over her panties. And I doubted the presence of her panties helped any due to the soft, almost nonexistent fabric. </p><p>“Excellent,” I whispered as I leaned forward, letting my breath to fall on her skin, adding a shiver to her stiff stance. I caressed her with my breath, but I avoided touching her at first, waiting for her to get in the mood. I watched as the occasional shiver broke her stiffness, and when her lips pressed with the determination of not making a sound even as her fingers caressed her soft spot gently. </p><p>The first moan she let out was a sign. I leaned down, and put a fleeting kiss on her neck. Her eyes popped open in shock, but once again, her arguments were prevented by a finger on her lips. “There’s no harm if a boyfriend kisses his sexy girlfriend once, right,” I murmured, waiting for her to nod before kissing her neck for a second time, this time for an extended duration. “Or twice.” I waited until another nod before landing another kiss. “Or thrice,” I added. For the fourth one, I didn’t bother waiting for her to say anything. Or the ones that followed it. </p><p>Her moans weren’t a surprise. I took them as an invitation to climb up, trailing her jawline with kisses, even her chin, but avoiding her lips despite them getting parted invitingly. Instead, I used the distraction to slowly untie her nightie. It might be sexy and transparent, but still, it was a barrier against my touch, therefore it was not welcome. Luckily, Penny was too distracted by the kisses landing around her lips to pay attention to such a small detail. </p><p>She only noticed it when my lips drifted down bypassing her neck to rain kisses on the edge of her breasts. I could see her watching worriedly, but arousal was also there. I decided to enhance the latter part without unduly raising the former, so I skipped her breasts temporarily and landed on her belly, kissing, licking, and blowing to my heart’s content. Her worry was still present, but it was helpless against her rising arousal, evidenced by the quickening dance of her fingers. </p><p>When I moved up to her breasts once more, I was accompanied by a string of moans rather than her disapproving gaze. Confident with my progress, I focused my attention to the valley between her breasts first, kissing, licking, and caressing to my heart’s content. Then, I started to move left, my kisses getting closer and closer to the center of her left breast, until I hovered above her nipple, erect enough to threaten to rip through the fragile fabric of her bra. I wrapped my lips around the nipple, not even bothering to push the fabric away, and put a gentle pressure behind my teeth. </p><p>“Yes!” she moaned in joy as the pleasure filled her, marking an opportunity to push to the next level. Pulling down the bra took no effort, as the poor thing was barely able to keep its position in the first place. My lips clamped around her nipples, this time without a barrier to reduce the impact, allowing my tongue to dance around the area my teeth softly marked. Penny just moaned more, probably already forgetting that it was supposed to be just an acting exercise. </p><p>Not one to miss such an opportunity, my fingers slid down until they were wrapped around her wrist once more. She didn’t even put up a token resistance when I led her fingers in her panties, bringing her self-pleasure to the next level as her panties strained to contain her hand. I wouldn’t bet on those panties to survive until the end. We continued like that for a while, with her fingers dancing over her core, while my hands gently explored her body and my lips attended her firm breasts.</p><p>I could guess that she wasn’t too far away from a climax, because she put up no resistance as I peeled her nightie off her completely, her body rising obediently to allow the light fabric to slide away from her body. Her bra would have suffered a similar fate, but I liked the view of it bunched under her chest, still present while failing to cover anything. It added a bit of color to her deliciously pale skin.</p><p>It was time to move onto the next step. Once again, my lips climbed upward, passing her neck after a gentle pause and arriving at the destination, her lips. They were already open invitingly, so I had no trouble slipping my tongue inside even as our lips were engaged in a gentle dance. She moaned, but my lips were in place to muffle her sound. Orgasm impending, she lacked the ability to resist my insidious assault, especially when my hands started exploring her body hungrily, learning every nook and cranny of her body. Her only reaction was her tongue wrapping around mine in an ineffectual display of arousal and desire. </p><p>She finally reacted when I grabbed the edge of her panties with the intention of pulling them down, trying to prevent me from doing so in a moment of lucidness, but that backfired. Her panties were too fragile to resist a tug-of-war and were torn with a sharp sound. Her hands found my shoulders, intending to push me off, but I turned up the intensity of the kiss at that moment. That shock stalled her for a moment, giving me the opportunity to take the place her fingers were busy at just a minute ago.</p><p> Unlike her, my fingers didn’t dally around her knob gently but slid in her entrance, bunched together to create an even more impactful penetration experience. “That’s too much,” she managed to murmur when I pulled back from the kiss in favor of watching her glorious body, but that was the only resistance she had been able to gather under the merciless pumping of my fingers, changing the pace of the dance completely. Her hands found my shoulders, but rather than trying to push me off, her fingers dug into my flesh hard enough to leave a mark. It was a pity that I couldn’t do the same for her, but unfortunately, I needed her skin to stay pristine. We had a long underwear session tomorrow. </p><p>I only pulled out my fingers when she collapsed into a shuddering mess, moaning my name deliriously. My shaft was throbbing, begging for a release, but unfortunately, I was not in a position to fulfill that particular need right now. Instead, I helped her to pull her nightie back on, its front haphazardly tied together, and dashed for my camera. “Smile,” I ordered her as I rapidly snapped several photos, and in her dazed state, she followed my commands for several minutes, creating a nice range of softcore photos, and a few that pushed the boundaries. </p><p>“Stephen, stop,” she murmured dazedly when she finally managed to beat the joy and excitement. A glance revealed just how much she was revealing. With her panties absent, only the way she crossed her legs as preventing her most intimate spot from being photographed. Her bra was still dislodged as well, and her transparent nightie was a bad choice to hide anything, especially something as attention-catching as her rather large bosom. </p><p>“Don’t worry, sweetie, these are just private reference photos, no one will see them except you and me,” I answered with a dark smirk. She looked like she was about to argue, so I chose to distract her with the good news. “If you don’t have anything to do tomorrow, we can take the underwear catalog tomorrow.” </p><p>“Really!” she exclaimed, though she hadn’t pulled her arms away. </p><p>“Yes, we’re going to do a full day shoot, so rest well tonight. Actually, you can just go upstairs and catch an afternoon nap if you want. I want you to be rested and ready tomorrow. It’s going to be a grueling day.” </p><p>“I won’t disappoint you!” she exclaimed as she jumped up her feet and she hugged me, though her excitement didn’t survive for long when she realized the exact way she had been dressed, and dashed away, giving me one last show of her plump bottom, free from the oppression of any kind of coverage, as she climbed the stairs, leaving me alone with a raging boner. I sighed and quickly gathered my equipment and put them in my car, my raging boner a source of supreme discomfort. </p><p>Luckily, I knew exactly where to go to get rid of that boner. </p>
