        <p>I had sent away Camilla after a brief stop in my apartment, where I delivered a small bag to Camilla - to be used in the evening activities with Megan. Only then I went back to my room to sweep through, making sure there was nothing incriminating laying around, and also placed a couple of bugs and secret cameras, just for insurance in case things went off rails. </p><p>It was already evening when I finished, so I sent Camilla a message, telling her to be at Megan’s room in ten minutes, and after a brief shower, I took my seat in front of my computer, waiting for Camilla to arrive. While I waited, my gaze danced on Megan’s delicious body, wearing only a tight tank, her panties the only other piece of clothing on her body, revealing her delicious legs for my viewing pleasure. </p><p>I would admit that watching her lazing around the room with a complicated expression on her face was tempting, especially after enjoying the way these legs had wrapped around tightly. For a thin girl like her, her legs were able to put out a surprising display of strength as they wrapped around me. I could have just sent her a message, and she would end up in my room once again, ready to follow my directions. </p><p>But I managed to resist the temptation. After all, I had promised my cute assistant that she would have been the one to teach Megan a little lesson after all the times she had been used by her, and it would be rude to change the plans at the last second; especially after seeing her excited expression after seeing all the toys. </p><p>Though, resisting that temptation when Megan sat on the edge of one of the chairs, my name on her lips while her fingers disappeared inside her panties turned out to be a challenge; though it was always nice to see that the time we had spent together was rather memorable. Luckily, before my willpower was strained any further, a knock was heard on the door, and Camilla entered the room, a bag in her hand. </p><p>“What are you doing here,” Megan asked Camilla, surprised at her sudden arrival, and barely had enough time to pull her hand out. </p><p>“Somebody dropped it in front of my door. Apparently, it’s supposed to be yours,” Camilla answered calmly rather than in her usual almost-whisper tone, making me proud. She was starting to develop a backbone under my treatment, and that was something every teacher wanted to see. </p><p>“Who! Who gave you that?” Megan asked as she jumped up to her feet, the sudden movement having a delicious impact on her breasts. </p><p>“What part of being dropped in front of my door is unclear?” Camilla asked, once again making me proud. “They were already gone when I managed to reach the door.” </p><p>“I see…” Megan answered, a frown on her face as she looked at Camilla’s face. “Do you know what’s inside.” </p><p>“A bunch of toys,” Camilla answered. But before Megan could inquire further, I had already sent the first message. ‘Have you checked the present I had painstakingly prepared for you, my dear leader,’ I wrote. </p><p>When the phone buzzed, Megan stopped Camilla’s interrogation for a moment, and turned her attention on her phone, a frown appearing on her face the moment her gaze fell on the screen. ‘The bag is from you?’ she wrote back in answer. </p><p>‘What do you think?’ I wrote. </p><p>A frown bloomed on Megan’s face while she wordlessly walked towards Camilla, and pulled the bag off her hands. Camilla gave a knowing smirk, though even through the camera, I was able to read the flash of anger in her eyes. But she was a smart girl, and she had no trouble keeping it hidden from a distracted Megan, especially when she knew the next step of my plan. </p><p>Meanwhile, Megan went through the content of the bag, her expression darkening with each sifting of the contents. Soon, her face had turned into a fiery storm. ‘What’s the meaning of this! You can’t expect me to use all of them,’ she wrote. </p><p>‘Do you want to bet,’ was my answer. ‘I have gone all the trouble of collecting these, and I won’t be happy if you just go and ignore my efforts. My feelings would get hurt, and that’s the last thing you want.’ </p><p>‘You can’t ask me that!’ was her answer. </p><p>‘I can, and I will. I have already given you a simple task, seduce one little measly professor, and you failed your task. This is punishment.’</p><p>‘But I already seduced him,’ she wrote even as an indignant expression on her face. </p><p>‘… and you have the evidence for that?’ I asked. </p><p>‘My phone malfunctioned,’ she typed rapidly, but from her expression, I could easily read that her hopes of getting out of the situation were disappearing. </p><p>“So, what was inside,” Camilla asked, but went ignored while Megan was busy furiously typing her answers, giving me a litany of reasons why it was unacceptable or unfeasible, each easily punctured as balloons trying to resist a combat knife. </p><p>A while later, I gave her a final ultimatum. ‘Make a decision, either you use these toys with the assistance of your little slut and send the resulting video evidence to me, or I inform our previous esteemed leader that just how badly you have failed on your task.’ The sullen expression that appeared on her face was amusing to see, tempting me to send one last message. ‘And don’t forget to act properly submissive. I had put a lot of effort into putting these tools together, and I don’t want it to go to waste.’ </p><p>Megan looked at the screen for a couple of seconds, but when her fingers touched the screen her phone, the last embers of her rebellion was already extinguished. ‘You win,’ she wrote in surrender before turning to Camilla. “These are for a bet with a friend, apparently, she was being funny by dropping them with you,” Megan said as she pulled the first few items from the bag, namely, a pair of handcuffs, a lacy blindfold, and a velvet paddle colored in an ominous black. </p><p>“It must be an interesting bet,” Camilla countered, the smirk on her face highly unusual. She took a step forward, her fingers squeezing in anticipation. “So, should I leave you alone so that you can focus on your bet.” </p><p>“Actually, no,” Megan answered, a frown appeared on her face as she tried to process Camilla’s uncharacteristic confrontational attitude, but with everything else going on, the important details managed to slip through. “I was thinking maybe you can help me fulfilling the bet.” </p><p>“Definitely not if that means that you’re going to use them on me,” Camilla answered with an exaggerated, her breasts dancing wildly with the motion, her bra absent since I had confiscated it in our previous encounter. </p><p>This time, Megan’s frown was even more pronounced, finally realizing that something was significantly different from Camilla. She stood indecisively, looking like she was preparing herself for a confrontation, so I decided to help my assistant a little, and sent her another text, asking whether the show had started. Megan sighed, deciding to focus her immediate problems first. “Actually, no,” Megan explained, keeping her frustration in check reasonably well. “The bet means that I’ll be the recipient.” </p><p>“It’s alright then,” Camilla answered cheerfully even as she reached for the handcuffs. “What’s the safe word?” </p><p>“There’s no need for a safe word. I would not need one,” Megan answered, her chest pushed out pridefully. The safe word part was a part of my orders, but her unnecessarily prideful display came to me as a surprise. Maybe she was trying to act dominant against Camilla to remind her of the proper balance between them. But if that was the case, that was a rather poorly thought-out idea, as it only galvanized Camilla further. </p><p>“So, you’re saying that for the next couple of hours, I’m allowed to whatever you want, and you have no right to reject?” Camilla said, as enthusiastic as a little lioness going for her first hunt. </p><p>Her enthusiasm made Megan do a double-take, unhappy that her statement only provoked her previously-submissive girlfriend. At that point, the reasonable thing would have been to give her a safe word nevertheless, but Megan was too prideful to take a step back. “Exactly, do your worst,” Megan answered even as she put her phone on the bed, video recording already engaged. </p><p>“Really?” Camilla countered. “Then, lay on the bed,” she said even as she started going through the stuff in the bag. When she pulled back, she had a pair of silk ribbons in hand, and slowly walked towards Megan’s side, gesturing her to give her hand. Megan looked uncomfortable at the prospect of losing her freedom at the first minute, as the lack of safeword had much more implications when she lacked the freedom of movement. Still, her pride was strong, so she maintained her silence even when Camilla tied her other arm. </p><p>But when she pulled another pair of silk ribbons from the bag, Megan finally reacted. “Isn’t it a bit too much?” she asked even as Camilla wrapped the soft fabric around her ankle. </p><p>Her answer was a slap on her thigh. “Did I ask for your opinion?” Camilla said, trying to look impervious and domineering — but only with limited success. Still, combined with the shock of the unprompted spank, it managed to shut Megan up enough for Camilla to finish tying her up. Then, she took a step back, enjoying the sight of the redheaded beauty, forced into a spread-eagle position with midnight-black ribbons. “Now for the last touch,” she said before placing the lacy blindfold of the same color on her eyes, the sight delicious enough to make me wish I was there. </p><p>“Camilla…” Megan murmured, her voice trembling, but my assistant ignored as per my suggestions, and instead, walked towards the fridge to pull a bunch of ice cubes. Then, she went back to the bag, and pulled out a scented candle, manufactured for bedroom activities, and a silver blade. A gash escaped Megan’s mouth as she felt the cold blade against her skin. “Is that a knife!” she asked. </p><p>“It is, so I recommend you not to move,” Camilla ordered. Megan opened her mouth to argue, only to receive a flick on the lips as a warning, though she got the message only when Camilla pressed the blunt side of the knife against her wound once more. The knife took a scenic route between the valley of her breasts, slowly trailing down, leaving the tank top in pieces in its wake. When the task was finished, Camilla pulled away from the top with a negligent pull and tossed it away, then subjected Megan’s panties to the same treatment with a simple slash, ultimately, leaving her completely naked. </p><p>The next thing Camilla grasped was an ice cube, pressing it against Megan’s chest to do a small circle, earning another gasp from her. When she pulled away, her eyes fell on the candle that was resting in the middle of the other tools, and for a moment, I thought that she had forgotten the crux of my lessons. But only after a step, she stopped, and instead started undressing, slowly and sensuously, giving an amazing show despite her lack of awareness about the recording. She was giving a show, because I had explained to her it would help her get into the correct mood. </p><p>The top went out first, revealing her spectacular breasts, unrestrained by a bra, their taste still on my lips after our brief but an intense encounter. Her shoes were gone next, flying away with a swing each move. Only then she slowly slid out of her skirt, leaving her completely naked. At that point, Megan was getting a bit restless, so she dragged another ice cube over her body, earning another gasp in the process, before walking away towards Megan’s wardrobe, following the second part of my advice. </p><p>If you want to be in control, you first need to dress the part. </p><p>With that in mind, Camilla dug through the wardrobe until she pulled a little red g-string, which only helped to display her shapely bottom even better, and a transparent red robe that looked rather striking against her caramel skin. I would have liked her to complete the set with a sexy bra, but it wasn’t really likely that she would be able to fit one of Megan’s. She pulled a pair of black stilettos to complete the ensemble before walking back to Megan, each step creating a distinctive click on the floor. </p><p>Her changes were obvious. Just by changing her clothes, she transformed into a new, much more confident woman, her gait confident and domineering. And just to display that confidence, she lit the sensual candle before raising it a bit higher than the distance I recommended, therefore allowing it to cool a bit more before it contacted with Megan’s skin. Though, ultimately, it wasn’t really surprising. It was the first time Camilla was displaying her bondage skills, and a bit of reticence was to be expected. </p><p>And it’s coldness was relative. After all, it was still hot wax, and a shocked cry escaped Megan’s mouth the moment one of the red drops connected with her previously-flawless skin. “What the hell, Camilla!” she yelled in shock, but in response, she just received another drip of hot wax. </p><p>“We’re playing, of course,” Camilla answered with a calmness that even surprised me, so Megan’s shocked expression was understandable. “Though, if you think you can’t handle, you can always beg for me to stop.” And just like that, Megan’s complaints were cut like a knife, unwilling to tarnish her pride for just a bit of pain. Camilla let out an excited smile as she grabbed another ice cube, and drew a gentle circle around her belly button, making her shiver helplessly, caught flatfooted by the sudden change of temperature, something Camilla quickly leveraged by dripping some more hot wax on her, making her gasp in shock. </p><p>She alternated it a couple of more times, but meanwhile, slipped a couple of ice cubes into her mouth, sucking them gently to cool her mouth, then she leaned forward to capture Megan’s nipple between the cold prison of her lips. Megan gasped once more, but this time, it was quick to turn into a moan when Camilla stayed stuck around her nipple, gently sucking while her free hand danced over her skin, enhancing her moans. </p><p>As the minutes passed under Camilla’s patient treatment, Megan slowly started to forget that it was supposed to be a punishment. “It feels amazing! Make me cum!” Megan moaned, but only to receive a spank for her trouble. </p><p>“You’re my toy for the night! How dare you try to order me!” Camilla bellowed in a surprising display of confidence, and underlined her statement by grabbing the velvet paddle, and landing three quick beats on Megan’s hips. Playing to dominatrix was definitely helping her to find her confidence. </p><p>“I’m sorry!” Megan exclaimed in shock, caught flatfooted by Camilla’s stiff punishment. “Please forgive me, mistress.”</p><p>Megan’s last sentence surprised me just as much as it surprised Camilla. After all, neither of us was expecting Megan to fold this easily, even for an empty display. Maybe the earlier kidnapping attempt shook her more than I first presumed. </p><p>“Good girl,” Camilla answered, patting her head softly as if to reward a small child, but then her hands started travel lower, passing through her neck, and arriving at her breasts, gently digging into Megan’s suppleness, though she was still merciless enough to let another drip connect with her skin whenever Megan opened her mouth in preparation for another sentence. And with each drip, Megan moaned louder and louder, her excitement starting to increase when Camilla’s hand started to travel lower until it arrived at the treasured location between her legs. </p><p>Since Megan was already gushing her wetness, all it took was a soft caress for her to shudder helplessly. “Please, I need it, mistress. Please let me cum!” Megan begged, the passing of time hadn’t been particularly gentle on her while she was wrapped tighter than a Christmas present, helplessly waiting to be untied. But Camilla ignored her begging in favor of gently caressing her entrance, each passing second making Megan moan louder, particularly intensified when Camilla occasionally dipped her hand into the ice bucket before continuing her intimate massage, her other hand still holding the candle, occasionally dripping wax on Megan’s skin, marring it further with temporary red patches. </p><p>“Do you think you deserve a reprieve?” Camilla suddenly asked, not stopping the treatment Megan was receiving even for a moment. </p><p>“Yes, mistress,” Megan moaned, this time, her statement much more genuine. </p><p>“Wrong!” Camilla exclaimed, her hand, rather than caressing Megan’s core, landed a string of painful slaps on Megan’s breasts, destroying her equilibrium even further. </p><p>“Mercy,” Megan called, though her cry wasn’t purely pain. I was even willing to bet that it was more pleasure than pain, marking a perfect time to push into the next stage of the proceedings. And Camilla, fittingly for my prized student, managed to recognize it as well and stood up, extinguished the candle, and placed it on the side. Then, she removed the blindfold from Megan, who instantly turned a pitiful needly glance towards Camilla, her arousal dominating her mind. </p><p>However, heedless of her looks, Camilla walked towards the bag of toys once more… </p>
