        <p>I couldn’t help but feel amused as Sophie pulled me to the bed violently. It was a rare experience for me, as I preferred to be in control … but considering her most recent ordeal, I was willing to make an exception. </p><p>“You will never speak of it, and there will be no repeat,” she ordered even as I landed on the bed, she was on top of me, not letting me answer before she started kissing. Which was good, as I had no intention of accepting it. </p><p>Not speaking of it was easy, but as I watched her bathrobe part completely to reveal what lay underneath, I disagreed with the idea of no repeats. But it was a discussion for the future. </p><p>I enjoyed her lips while she shuffled on my lap, humping me wildly. The kiss was sharp, intense, and needy, tinged with a desperate need to control. I yielded to her pace, enjoying her kiss, and feeling her aura flare even more. </p><p>She pulled back a minute later, but not for a moment, I thought that she wanted to stop, not after seeing her expression. Or her first act that followed, getting rid of her bathrobe, leaving her completely naked. I took a moment to enjoy her beautiful body. Lithe, yet muscular enough to show that she was a regular at the gym. Her breasts weren’t big enough to fill my palms, but they were beautiful enough to be amazing. </p><p>Her skin was flawless, the benefits of her most recent healing, and her blonde hair danced on her shoulders freely, still messy after her shower. </p><p>As I examined her beauty, I noticed a hint of shyness entering her face. She opened her mouth, to ask a question, but she squashed that instinct just as quickly. “You’re overdressed,” she growled instead, her sharp tone overcompensating for her earlier shyness. </p><p>She was a beautiful mixture of hard and soft. A real masterpiece. </p><p>I heard my t-shirt rip even as she pulled it desperately, her eyes locking on my naked torso. “Not bad, very chiseled,” she said, doing her best to sound sarcastic, but the desperate way she caressed the lines of my chest showed her true feelings. </p><p>“Benefits of endless training,” I said even as I watched her slide down, temporarily vacating my lap as she untied my belt, her fingers desperate as she pulled them down as well. A moment later, I matched her in the amount I wore, my presence long reached its peak. </p><p>“You’re a handyman to keep around,” she whispered as she approached once again, positioning herself between my legs, her tongue already darting out. My eyes widened. I couldn’t help it. It was not exactly something my occasional lady friends from the sect liked to do, finding it undignified. </p><p>Sophie’s face showed that it was certainly not a favor to me but for her pleasure. Her attention was focused on my shaft as she gave a long lick from the side, filling me with anticipation. Right at that moment, I felt like I was on a vacation once more, impatient for pleasure. </p><p>Luckily, Sophie was just as impatient, her lips parting open immediately to devour my length, her back arching desperately as she devoured half of my length, her beautiful green eyes still open, catching mine. </p><p>She was breathtaking. </p><p>For a moment, she paused, showing a hint of insecurity infusing her gaze as she searched my expression. Whatever it was, it was enough to make her aura shiver with indecision, showing it was important. Luckily, whatever she had been searching for, she found it, because that insecurity was gone a moment later, and she sank even deeper, devouring more of my length, still keeping eye contact. </p><p>I kept our gaze connected, enjoying her expressions as much as the way her throat wrapped around my girth … well, almost as much, to be honest. </p><p>Her back arched as she continued moving up and down, showing that she was capable of holding her breath for a long while, her eyes widening in struggle. Yet, she continued, clearly enjoying the physical struggle just as much while she imprisoned my shaft with her lips and her throat. </p><p>However, as she continued without a break, the first sign of struggle arrived soon. She closed her eyes, trying to gather her strength as she pushed herself further. The way she dealt with that sign of weakness was even more entertaining. She grabbed my legs for leverage, pushing herself down deeper and deeper until it disappeared into her mouth completely. </p><p>Despite the exertion, she managed to keep it up for almost two minutes, and even when she took a break, it was for a few trembling breaths before she repeated the following, just as determined. </p><p>Three more repeats, and she was getting more and more ragged, while my pleasure climbed up, begging me for a release. </p><p>One of the biggest benefits of the cultivation was that I had incredible control over my own body. Refusing the call of pleasure was uncomfortable, but it only increased the intensity of the pleasure. I would have preferred to extend my pleasure a while more, but even with her eyes closed, I could see Sophie determined not to move away until she received her victory. </p><p>Getting suspended from her job, narrowly dodging a summary execution, and discovering the true depth of the supernatural was far deeper than she had initially assumed; all capped with an actual brush with death.</p><p>She deserved a reward after her busy day. </p><p>I let my body react right as she pushed down once more, filling her throat with my seed, which she captured smoothly. Then, with a victorious expression on her face, she swallowed. </p><p>It took all I had not to flip her down, but I had already decided to leave the control to her. “Well, that was nice —” she started, signaling that she wanted to finish, which I had to accept, at least for today. Tomorrow, I would teach her how true seduction worked. </p><p>However, before she could even step down the bed, she realized my shaft was yet to go down. “You’re still hard,” she commented. </p><p>I shrugged with a smirk. “Perks of cultivation, sweetie. You have to work harder to defeat me.” </p><p>“Oh, that sounds like a challenge,” she said, her voice tense, but the way she licked her lips showed she was more than ready to greet it. She was slow and controlled as she climbed on my lap, doing her best to hide her enthusiasm. </p><p>She failed on that part.</p><p>I said nothing as she finished climbing, aligning herself on top of me. Her hands landed on my chest, ready to ride me, her eyes once again pinned to mine to show she was in control. Once again, I let her, no matter how tempted I was flip her and take her aggressively, for her moans to fill the room. </p><p>Instead, I waited until she took a surprisingly shaky breath like she was trying to gather courage before jumping off a cliff, and her warm frame started sinking, my girth wrapped by an even more intense hug.</p><p>She let out a small gasp as she moved down faster than I expected, and immediately bit her lips to keep the next one in. For me, keeping my chuckle down was an even bigger challenge, but I succeeded. I had a feeling she wouldn’t have appreciated it. </p><p>Luckily, there were a lot of details I had to distract me. Like the way, her beautiful breast jiggled as she rocked back and forth, the way her tightness wrapped around me, or the passionate dance of her fingers like she was preparing to make a bust of my chest. </p><p>Her eyes stayed closed as her hips rocked faster and faster, soon reacting to a wild speed, her beautiful blonde hair dancing with her sharp movements. An amazing sight already, but as the pleasure rose, so did her aura, getting even purer. </p><p>That was the reason for my selectiveness when it came to my partners. I loved the carnal aspects of it, certainly, but such an intimate way of experiencing pleasure had a way of lowering the defenses, even for other cultivators. Good or bad, ugly or pristine, everything was magnified. </p><p>Sophie’s aura was sharp and beautiful even as the pleasure invaded her body, all the small concerns that tainted her aura washing away, leaving its place to a blinding brightness. </p><p>She tightened around me, her arousal finally bringing her to a climax. I followed with my own, filling her. She collapsed against my chest. “So warm,” she murmured, the aftershocks of pleasure hitting her hard. “I never felt such an intense orgasm,” she muttered. </p><p>“Sleep,” I whispered even as I carefully laid her down and tucked her in. I even grabbed a wet wipe to clean her up without waking her up. After all, her collapse was partially my fault, as no matter how much I wanted to control, and despite the seal, I was still a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and it was difficult to prevent our souls from resonating for a fleeting moment.  </p><p>Not enough to comprehend the truth, but enough for the resonance to trigger a spectacular orgasm. Combined with the stress of the day, no wonder she collapsed. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean I wouldn’t tease her in the aftermath. </p>
