        <p>Despite my fatalistic perspective, I examined the briefcase for a moment while I overcharged my power for a second — at the cost of that stabbing headache returning — to make sure there was no bomb or listening device. </p><p>Not that I expected either. They looked too professional to make such an amateurish move, especially when they were convinced that I was working for a mysterious villain that gave me enough confidence to threaten their organization without fear. </p><p>After making sure, I grabbed the briefcase and walked in. “Come to my office,” I ordered her. “I need my secretary.” She stood up, but rather than following me, she started walking upstairs. “Where are you going, follow me,” I ordered. </p><p>“To wear my uniform,” she whispered confused, but I could also hear a hint of disappointment in her tone. </p><p>“No need. You’re already overdressed for a private meeting,” I said. I walked, and she followed, her disappointment replaced by another dose of excitement. I said nothing else until I sat behind my desk — making a note to replace the furniture at the first possible opportunity — while Tara stayed on her feet, her hands crossed. </p><p>She looked more like a misbehaving student who received a detention than a secretary, but that didn’t matter much. She would learn. </p><p>“Now, let’s see what our new friends sent me as an apology to me,” I said, wanting to use the opportunity to impress Tara a bit. After all, the higher they paid to apologize to me, the more it would underline my power. </p><p>And I didn’t want to miss such an easy opportunity to score a victory on Tara. Not that it was needed, but there was no harm in adding some extra. </p><p>As for fearing whether they actually didn’t send enough to be impressive, it wasn’t even a concern. I recognized the brand of the briefcase — and my power confirmed it as a genuine one rather than a counterfeit.  </p><p>The briefcase alone could probably buy my bar outright.  </p><p>I finally opened the briefcase, and Tara gasped in shock. I wanted to admonish her for reacting excessively, but that would be unfair considering how much my eyes widened as I took in the contents. </p><p>Two million in cash, a glance enough to confirm it as genuine, and a small line at the side with a line of gold bullion that was probably worth half a million. </p><p>Hell of an apology. </p><p>I still managed to maintain a presence of mind to examine the inside of the briefcase for anything out of order — not that I expected any, as it would ruin the whole point of an apology, and if they wanted to test me, they would have done so in a different manner — like listening devices or other bugs, my power once again a lifesaver in removing such concerns. </p><p>Slowly, I was warming up to my power. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I said loudly to Tara. “Now, why don’t you put them in the safe,” I said as I pointed to the small, rundown box that came with the office. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” Tara said, excited, but it wasn’t the money that excited her, but the trust I showed her by letting her handle the money. </p><p>I barely held back a chuckle. Like that mattered. If she actually decided to take the money, there was not a thing I could do to actually stop her. She circled around the desk, grabbed the briefcase, and bent forward, letting me enjoy the view of her plump ass straining her panties to the limit as she filled the safe. </p><p>I appreciated that. It made a nice contrast to all the other worrying thoughts, thoughts like just how rich and strong was this organization I didn’t even recognize to send such an amount as an apology.</p><p>Not just an apology, I suddenly realized. It was also a warning, reminding me that they were rich enough to throw around this much as an apology, and could spend much more for a fight. </p><p>Worse, I couldn’t even adjust my attitude toward them based on their signals, as the whole sense of power I managed to establish over them was based on the bluff that I knew everything about them … including the favorite cocktail of their negotiator. </p><p>And, I could hardly change my attitude just because their power seemed to be much higher than an organization that should be caring about the abandoned outskirts of the town.  </p><p>As Tara wiggled her ass, I decided to abandon those thoughts and focus on what was in front of me. I had made a decision, and it was too late to change it. I had to live with it. </p><p>“You’re overdressed, let’s fix it,” I said to Tara as I pushed down her panties. She stopped her work as she braced herself for some fun, but received a spank instead. Well, not something she hated, considering her moan. “Did I tell you to stop working?” I still said, my voice was sharp and domineering, working wonders on her already growing arousal. </p><p>“I’m sorry, s-sir,” she answered, her voice trembling as my fingers brushed against her wetness. </p><p>“Do better next time,” I ordered even as my fingers slipped inside her, making her fingers slip and one of the gold bullions fall on the floor. “Careful,” I said as I spanked her ass. Not that the fall mattered, I just used it as an excuse. </p><p>A delicious whimper escaped her mouth, showing she enjoyed it just as much. But still, the pleasure was not enough to make her fail intentionally. She carefully placed another bullion in the safe, stacking them carefully.</p><p>I pushed down my pants once again, my raging boner too uncomfortable as it hardened with her whimpers and moans. And, I would be lying if the fact that she was handling more money than I had ever seen in my life in my orders didn’t do a lot for me. </p><p>“Excellent work,” I said as I patted her ass again, but this time, I pulled away my fingers and replaced them with something thicker. </p><p>She let out a guttural moan that echoed in the room, one that was enough to erase every single concern I had, from the risks I was facing to the ways I could use my newfound wealth. </p><p>I just focused on invading her beautiful wetness once more, enjoying the way she tightened around me as much as I enjoyed her determination to continue with her task. I pushed deeper inside even as I cupped her tight ass aggressively, using her cheeks as the perfect hold as I let loose. </p><p>I didn’t play around with playful tricks like usual, instead invading her mercilessly as I ravished her. The sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room as I sank inside her mercilessly. She struggled to stay in her place, making it a challenging pose to maintain. </p><p>I shifted my hands slightly, invading her deeper and deeper into her core, enjoying her beautiful moans rising in the process. “So … big,” she moaned as I went more than halfway, enjoying the tremor that rose in response. </p><p>In response, I sank even deeper, the wave of pleasure forcing her to hold against the desk, the wood crackling under her pressure. She lost her ability to hold back her moans, making me glad that we had no customers to care about. </p><p>Allowing me to abandon everything and focus on my pleasure. I impaled her again and again, enjoying the strains of her moans as I drilled her. She did her best to continue to work as I invaded her, but her fingers trembled worse as her moans got louder, her beautiful face twisting to signal her upcoming orgasm. </p><p>In a different situation, I might have slowed down, keeping her on the edge to play, but under the circumstances, I did nothing else. I was still feeling unbalanced after the tense encounter, and I rather focus on our pure pleasure than anything else. </p><p>I grabbed her hips and lifted her, her immense supernatural power not making her any heavier, allowing me to use her like she was a toy. </p><p>Her moans showed just how much she enjoyed that dismissive treatment. As I raised her, she lost her ability to reach the safe that was on the side of the desk, which left her with two bundles of money in hand.  </p><p>I impaled her even harder, her moans rose unbidden, echoing in my office. I filled her just as she climaxed, momentarily losing control of her hands … and a twitch sent the money in her hand flying around, their fragile bonds snapping in the process. </p><p>I might have admonished her, but as her moans exploded, I found it difficult to do. Especially since, the sight of my floor covered in hundreds looked nice. Garish and boorish, but certainly nice, especially when combined with her moans. </p><p>For all the trouble it brought along, it was hard to ignore that success had brought a unique kind of allure with it. Rich, strong, virile, and currently filling the insides of a beautiful heroine that was slowly being corrupted. </p><p>Altogether, for all the challenges it brought with it, it was hard to argue that the life I had accidentally stumbled on was amazing. </p><p>Dangerous, but amazing. </p>
