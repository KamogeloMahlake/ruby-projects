        <p>My smile was hard to contain as I walked into my kitchen, preparing a huge pitcher of iced tea. </p><p>It was out outside, but not enough for me to finish a huge pitcher alone. Luckily, I wasn’t alone, far from it. I smiled I listened to the laughs coming from outside, from my pool. </p><p>Ten minutes ago, I hadn’t planned to do anything but watch some tape for my Saturday, to make sure I was sharp. It was a plan that had been ruined once my doorbell rang. I wasn’t expecting anything, so assumed it was delivery. </p><p>I certainly wasn’t expecting five beauties, each wearing sun dresses. Surprise, Sarah said as she pushed me away — a bit harder than I expected, probably still annoyed about our last encounter — while Naomi explained that they decided to surprise me with a midday pool party. </p><p>It was hardly a point to reject that statement after all the time we spent together — with all of them, in various combinations — so I just pulled the aside and told them to feel at home while I dealt with the preparations. </p><p>And, I had to admit, having the girls over for a fun pool party wasn't exactly the worst idea ever. </p><p>As I prepared in the kitchen, I could hear them jumping down into the water one after another. I was yet to see what they were wearing for the pool, but I didn’t hurry up. Sometimes, pleasure required some seasoning. </p><p>I carried the tray with all the glasses as I walked toward the garden. </p><p>Carrie was the one I had noticed first, sitting on the grass, her incredible breasts proudly supported by a black bikini top. The contrast of the dark fabric against her alluring exposed cleavage was spectacular. The top wasn’t supposed to be revealed based on the cut, but her breasts clearly disagreed. </p><p>The bottoms were even more modest, and combined with her position, gave nothing but her beautiful legs. And, since our earlier encounters showed that she was certainly not body-shy — at least not yet — it was not hard to imagine she had another ploy in play. </p><p>In contrast, Irene went with a relatively plain white one-piece with black patterns. Well, at least, it was supposed to be. The situation was even worse —  better — than Carrie’s swimsuit, because unlike Carrie’s, Irene’s swimsuit was clearly designed for someone with less generous sizes. </p><p>Though, knowing her, it was referring to an obscure fictional character or something. </p><p>I could have spent half a day watching her, if she wasn’t swimming next to Naomi, who had decided to go with something rather more playful. Bright orange, and more revealing than the other two, but nothing that would cause a scandal on a beach. Of course, her tight body and her glistening skin would have gathered all the gazes. </p><p>At the corner of the pool, I could see Ida, who had decided to go radically more conservative than the others. A green top with absolutely no hint of cleavage from any side — which was impressive as she certainly didn’t have small breasts — and her bottoms were more reminiscent of shorts than bikini bottoms, joining the latter category only in a technicality. </p><p>Though, without her camera in hand, even that was enough to make her blush as she caught my gaze and dipped down. </p><p>Her bipolar attitude was simply sexy — especially since she didn’t go between two extremes of crazy, but two extremes of hotness. </p><p>Only one was missing, though, considering the footsteps from behind, it wasn’t hard to guess where she was. “Don’t make her have an aneurysm, she’s a bit shy,” Sarah said. </p><p>I turned, and couldn’t help but whistle in appreciation. Because, unlike the others, Sarah was wearing an absolutely maddening piece of swimwear, the kind that more fitting in sexy magazine covers than on public beaches. Her set was dark scarlet, yet the suggestiveness of the color took the second piece. </p><p>She was wearing a crazy set of a string bikini, with two tiny triangles to cover her nipples that required only half an inch to create a scandal, and the bottom was only slightly better. As she passed me, I caught sight of the bottom, which was a string, and nothing else.</p><p>I said nothing, because if the gasps coming from the rest, I wasn’t the only one that was ambushed by it. I chuckled as I watched their gazes, in various shades of jealousy and frustration. None of them were innocent alone — or even in various duo combinations — but clearly, they had been planning to play the pool party more casually. After all, with the exception of Carrie, none of them had the full view of the situation.</p><p>Sarah broke that implicit covenant. </p><p>And, I thought as I kept my gaze on her hips, which were swaying far too aggressively to be a natural walk, broke that spectacularly. </p><p>Only in Carrie’s gaze, I could see a hint of satisfaction, clearly appreciating the opportunity to push the situation even more while looking like she was blameless, though that didn’t mean her jealousy was fake. </p><p>That was very much real as well. </p><p>My devious little blonde. </p><p>I had the ability to hide my gaze, but where was the fun in that. Instead, I kept my gaze on her dancing hips, curious just how much that little trick would push the rest. </p><p>Naomi coughed playfully, hiding one word. “Showoff.” </p><p>Sarah just smirked at her as she slowly slid into the water, and started swimming. </p><p>“Now, I feel perched,” I said loudly. “Who else wants some ice tea.” </p><p>“Me,” Irene said, and she started swimming toward the edge. As she swam, she fixed her swimsuit. It felt weird, as she didn’t seem shy enough to fix that.</p><p>I realized I was mistaken when she held to the edge, which gave the sight of her cleavage, the perfect view revealing that her earlier playing didn’t reduce her cleavage but increased even more, to the point of revealing a hint of the areola. </p><p>What a naughty little sexy beast, more than daring to join the game once it started. </p><p>“Thanks,” she said as she started sipping on the side, but none of the others were daring enough to join the game immediately, so I walked toward the table with the tray, leaving them to frolic in the water — or in Carrie’s case, stand on the side. </p><p>I had great hopes for an amazing party…</p>
