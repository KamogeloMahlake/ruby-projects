        <p>Greetings my dear readers, </p><p>With the last chapter, we could more or less say that we finally completed the first book (considering it's around 100k words, which is longer than the average size of a commercial fantasy book, it's very justified). </p><p>Once again, I want to ask about the general direction of the story, and how to develop it further. </p><p>Also, feel free to drop your reviews in the comments, if you have any other opinions about it. </p>
