        <p>The ability to weaponize lust was an interesting concept, I realized as I started to tease the buxom girl on my lap. It was probably about the nature of it, but even as I pushed the transformed Intent, I could feel it finding only a limited purchase on Miriam. </p><p>I suspected it was the same reason the echo had disappeared. I thought about focusing on re-establishing that, but after some consideration, I changed my mind. I had some interesting ideas to shift Miriam’s perception — an edge play that would take half a day the mildest of my ideas — but my current location was hardly the place to apply those. </p><p>Yet, that was the less consequential of the two reasons. I was afraid that, if I pushed Miriam in that direction too much, her reaction would start to be qualified as worship … which was not something that I wanted to try. </p><p>I still remembered the cursed fires and the mysterious disappearance of the cult. </p><p>In moments like that, I pitied that my guide was available to be consulted. Unfortunately, her attitude assured her that her current imprisonment was still the best idea. Her initial ditzy mood had been bad enough, but the way her attitude changed as she recovered was certainly not a helpful direction. </p><p>No, it was best that she would stay locked until an emergency forced my hand. </p><p>Miriam let out a moan, making me focus on the present. “Naughty girl,” I whispered as I let my hand move higher on her thick thigh, making her squirm even more, while the players still continued to draw the tactics as I requested. </p><p>“Draw faster,” I ordered even as I teased Miriam even more. </p><p>“Yes, faster,” she said as well,  not bothering to hide the needy quality in her tone, making the players snicker in amusement. But, it was evidence of the hold I had over them that none of them even raised their head, working as requested. </p><p>Teasing Miriam’s delicate thighs was fun, but it was not something I wanted to get stuck on for an extended period of time … not when I would soon leave for the promised match. I let my fingers climb further, finally touching her wetness, her lack of panties making it much easier.</p><p>She managed to hold back her moan, which was admirable, but it didn’t last long as my Lust-intent touched her, elevating her sensitivity even more. “Oh, that’s—“ she managed to whisper before she let out a beautiful cry, one that was probably enough to be heard from outside. </p><p>That was enough to make several players raise their heads to see what was going on, but they found me looking at the screen with rapt attention even as Miriam desperately wiggled on my lap … and, I felt the echo of the Command Domain getting even stronger on them. </p><p>An interesting development. </p><p>Curious, I decided to push that aspect even further. While my fingers disappeared into Miriam, pushing her display of arousal to an even more intense level, I rewound the basketball play that was on the screen. “Now, who can tell me why the opponents chose to drive at this moment despite the paint being crowded?” I asked.</p><p>The sudden question startled the players, but I managed to use that subtle sense of Command sensation mentally, making them focus on the play.  “I …” one of them murmured. </p><p>“Because our pivot was a step behind the location he was supposed to stay, creating an easy jump shout opportunity. He can’t contest it without risking a foul,” another player commented after some thinking. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said, using the laser pointer with my empty hand and drawing three lines. “Actually, despite the crowd, we have three safe lines of approach, and the attacker could have taken any of them with a good success percentage,” I explained. </p><p>They nodded seriously, showing that I was somehow pulling the wise coach act even with the squirming beauty on my lap. </p><p>“Continue drawing,” I ordered even as I turned my focus back on Miriam, my empty hand landing on her top to aggressively maul her tits, which, unlike what was going underneath, wasn’t blocked by the desk. The only sacrifice I had did was to keep my hand over her top to maintain a semblance of propriety. </p><p>Not that it was critical. She had shown that she wasn’t particularly torn-up about nudity considering she had been a volunteer stripper during the victory celebration, and her dressing choices while coming here hardly disagreed with it. </p><p>When she first came, she was determined to tease me, but that determination experienced a rapid death as the climax hit her, and hit her hard. </p><p>She moaned and trembled on my lap helplessly as the players snickered, her reaction intense enough to suggest that she had stopped caring about our audience and the camera she had arranged already. Luckily for her, that already stopped. </p><p>The moment she recovered, her hands reached down, trying to pull down my shorts. Unfortunately for her, that was not something I planned to allow. </p><p>Yet. </p><p>“W-what?” she stammered, drunk with pleasure, as I pushed her hand away. </p><p>“That’s not allowed, honey,” I started, and her eyes widened in panic … and that moment, I felt the flicker of Lust growing in her once more, confirming my earlier guess about it being linked to being unattainable. </p><p>Luckily for her, I didn’t want to experiment further on that aspect. I smirked as I dragged my finger on her pouty lips, then pointed to the large space under the desk. “You need to earn that first, sweetie,” I said. </p><p>I expected her to follow that suggestion, but I didn’t expect her to follow it with a shocking speed, her knees actually hitting on the ground hard enough to injure her. I actually had to flood her body with some recovery energy to prevent the pain. </p><p>She pulled down my shorts, the echo of lust disappearing at the same time her lips wrapped around my shaft. </p><p>I leaned back on my chair, closing my eyes to enjoy the sudden assault of pleasure. Miriam started far faster than I had expected, taking my shaft to her throat with shocking aggression ... not without a cost, her gagging filling the room. </p><p>Mixing with the snickering of the players. “Let’s start going through your tactics,” I ordered, gesturing for the one nearest to completion to walk forward to me. </p><p>“Right now, coach?” he asked, surprised.</p><p>“Yes,” I said even as I pushed my chair forward slightly, ensuring that Miriam would stay safely under the desk, not adding any visual to her amazing vocal show, her gags mixing with her slobbering as she delivered an amazing deep-throat show. </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed with her show. The smoothness of her action showed that it was not something that she was used to, but her enthusiasm was more than enough to compensate for it. I looked at her, her hair covering my lap, her lips straining around my girth as she bobbed her head repeatedly,  each enthusiastic push straining her throat even more. </p><p>Yet, her enthusiasm only increased further. </p><p>I was impressed with the speed she adapted to her new station, showing her willingness to endure some punishment as she did her best to devour the entirety of my shaft. </p><p>“Now, let’s go through what your old coach was calling tactics,” I declared mockingly, my expression relaxed as if nothing was going on. With the noises coming under the desk telling the story of what was going on, my calm expression further reinforced my authority — as evidenced by the pull of the command I could feel from them. </p><p>“As you wish, coach,” he answered, and we started going through the tactics. I made sure to give an insightful comment on every single tactic, using the teaching ability I had developed due to my old Tutor Trait to make sure those stuck. </p><p>Watching his expression change with each comment. I had seen the exact same expression on the face of the football players many times as well, something that was supposed to be complicated and hard to understand clicking in their minds, leaving them shocked that how they didn’t understand it before. </p><p>“Thanks, coach,” he said, and went back to his seat. The next player arrived, repeated it … and the following half an hour passed in that routine. Not only I had learned the tactics they were competent at, but also enhanced them and used the opportunity to teach the most promising ones to the rest. </p><p>Of course, it would have ordinarily taken days of dedicated film study to properly communicate those nuances, but my System made that process far more efficient. </p><p>“That’s all,” I said. “We have the game in fifteen minutes. You can go and start warming up, I don’t want you to pull a muscle.” </p><p>“Yes, coach,” they said, and started to walk toward the door, but noticed I was sitting. </p><p>One of the braver ones looked at me. “Aren’t you going to join us, coach,” he said, his tone mocking. </p><p>“Go ahead, I have something to finish,” I answered with a chuckle, not bothering to admonish him. After all, during the whole session, they had been listening to Miriam’s gags and moans, yet the suppression of Command prevented them from making a comment. </p><p>Especially since it didn’t stop for a moment — mostly due to my excessive usage of Recovery on Miriam, which kept her from collapsing under exhaustion or the strain of her activities — making it truly torture for them. </p><p>They chuckled as they left, their fingers already on their phones — and the following burst of Intent suggested that they were already gossiping about what had happened. </p><p>Just what I needed, I thought even as I pulled back suddenly, grabbed Miriam, and pushed her onto the desk. “You worked hard, honey. Let’s give you your reward!” </p>
