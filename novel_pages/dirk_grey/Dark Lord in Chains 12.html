        <p>As Aria cummed under the assault of my fingers, I paused the music as well, letting the silence rule the room, broken only by Aria’s desperate breathing. Emma stilled once more, unable to pull her gaze away from the sexy blonde on my lap. I didn’t blame her, as with her eyes fluttering under the pleasure, her body covered with the marks of my rough treatment, still unable to speak thanks to her panties stuffed in her mouth, Aria made an impressive sight. </p><p>I waved my hand, and Aria hovered toward the chair, making Emma flinch. Making someone float was not a difficult spell if the target didn’t resist, but it drove my freedom even deeper. After putting Aria on the chair —and making sure she wouldn’t fall off in her daze— I turned my attention back to Emma. Another spell later, the music filled my cell once more, but this time, it was a softer, more sensual melody. </p><p>Smart enough to understand the implied order, Emma started swaying under the rhythm of the music once more, but one of her arms stayed locked around her corset, preventing it from falling down. She danced for a minute, and I enjoyed the sight, as much as she enjoyed my naked erection —as much as she tried to hide it. After a few minutes, she realized that I had no intention of breaching the topic as long as she danced, and spoke. “You were talking about possible avenues of cooperation.” </p><p>“Right,” I said, making a show of being shocked. “Sorry about that, but I was distracted,” I added, letting my gaze jump between Aria’s half-naked figure and her sexy dancing body. “Can you blame me?” </p><p>“Please stay focused on the topic,” Emma reminded sharply, ignoring the temptation to lash out. She even stopped dancing to glare at me. </p><p>I chuckled. “Sorry about that,” I said. “While revealing the location of Eternal Core is impossible, I can reveal you guys several important secrets of the Dark Faction, such as defensive weaknesses of the key fortresses, their magical secrets, or even spies the Empire who are actually double-agents that’s feeding false information.” </p><p>“We don’t have spies,” Aria countered immediately from the side, finally breaking through her daze, and earning an incredulous glare from Emma, and a chuckle from me. Aria looked shocked, so shocked that she had forgotten to cover her breasts —or maybe she decided not to bother, but I was willing to believe it was the former. “Do we?” she added in a trembling tone. </p><p>“It’s an interesting offer, if a bit thin,” Emma suggested, trying to sound uninterested, but it was impossible for her to hide the shine in her eyes. What I had outlined was very valuable intelligence, and gaining that would have given Emma a lot of credit to establish herself in palace politics. “Still, not a bad start. What do you have in mind in return?” </p><p>I would have liked to say I was impressed with her poker face, but that would be a lie. Still, I let her think that she succeeded. “You can start by finally dropping that corset.” </p><p>“In exchange for what?” Emma countered, showing that her greed was stronger than her modesty. Though, to be fair, she was smart enough to realize that she couldn’t extract herself from the situation just by dancing in her underwear, not after she watched Aria’s rough treatment, which included everything but penetration. </p><p>“In exchange for me not escaping. Did you think that poor Aria was going to be the only one that’s going to suffer for your mistake,” I said, which made her freeze once more. “Still, I might decide to reveal the name of a low-level double-agent if you can impress with your initiative,” I added. </p><p>Emma stood still, an expression of concentration on her face as she thought about my offer. Meanwhile, I spared a glance to Aria, who was watching us with shock, partially due to the way my discussion with Emma was going, and partially due to the realization of what her passive acceptance had led to. I met with her gaze and send her a salacious smirk, and she replied with a blush. A second later, her arms jumped to her chest, trying to cover her half-naked state. She tried to follow up by reaching for her dress, but I shook my head, vetoing the idea. </p><p>She followed my command, and stayed on her chair, using her arms to cover her deliciously perky chest. </p><p>“I agree,” Emma said decisively, getting my attention, though I was more interested in the way her corset finally hitting the floor, revealing her breasts, which was beautiful, though not enough to rival Aria’s. Still, the rest of her sexy and toned body went a long way to compensate for an earlier loss, especially her perfectly toned stomach. </p><p>“Then, impress me, red,” I commented as I parted my legs, revealing my throbbing shaft fully. Her statement was confident, but the same confidence wasn’t reflected in her expression, which seemed hesitant. I doubted that without the courage from her foray into my memory, she could even accept the deal I suggested, so it was a win. “Don’t forget that only by really impressing me you can earn the name of the slimy bastard that’s feeding your side dangerously-falsified information.” </p><p>Emma didn’t appreciate my reminder, but that didn’t prevent her from closing in with a sexy sway, following the sensual rhythm of the music, under my entertained and Aria’s shocked gaze. </p><p>I had assumed that my opinion of Lancelot couldn’t get any lower, but watching her desperate strut, he managed to achieve the impossible. After all, he somehow managed to leave such exquisite examples of sexiness unfulfilled despite months of campaigning. Luckily, he had a good friend like me to help cover his mistakes! </p><p>Emma closed in slowly, her body swaying as she danced with each step, while Aria watched her in shock, and if I was seeing correctly, a flickering hint of jealousy. How interesting, I noted, as I kept my attention on Emma, well-aware that it would enhance Aria’s envy further. It was inevitable after I spent all the time flaming it further. </p><p>“Speak,” Emma whispered as she stood in front of me, and started delivering a delicious dance. Her body was like a gentle wave, her beautiful ass rocking with every move. I wished there was a pole that she could lean on to deliver some more impressive moves, but was infeasible, at least for the moment. Instead, she crouched down, her knees on the cold stone floor of my cell, her tits dangling sexily as she slithered forward, closing in the distance between us. She raised her body only when she stood directly in front of me, but she was still on her knees. An impressive show of dancing, I noted, enough to fuel Aria’s flickers of jealousy into a raging flame, giving a rare light to her blue eyes. </p><p>Suddenly, I was struck with a desire to include Aria in a different way than a passive observer. Luckily, I had the perfect way to do so. Just as Emma was about to stand up, I grabbed her wrist and pulled her close. Then, I lay her on my knees, just like a naughty schoolgirl who earned a punishment. “What the hell-” she started, only to be silenced by a spank to her barely-covered ass. </p><p>“Before we properly start, there’s still your punishment to be addressed,” I reminded her even as I spanked her ass again. </p><p>“Punishment for what!” Emma gasped. </p><p>“For your thoughtless action of freeing me and leaving poor Aria to clean your mistake, of course,” I explained, accompanied by yet another spank. </p><p>“Why are you punishing me for that,” Emma asked in shock, which, technically, was correct. After all, while I didn’t owe her for freeing me, I did owe her for giving me such an excuse to reveal my status. </p><p>“You’re right, I shouldn’t punish you for that,” I answered, and she relaxed, but it was short-lived, because I waved my hand to conjure a small paddle from the thin air. Emma stiffened as she felt the strong flare of magic. Conjuration was not a simple discipline, and I doubted that many mages could afford to use it frivolously. “Aria should be the one that’s punishing you,” I said even as I threw it to Aria. </p><p>“What!” came the double exclamation. </p><p>Emma stayed on my lap, too shocked to move, while Aria reached to grab the paddle, leaving her tits naked in the process, only to fumble badly. “Sorry,” Aria gasped as the paddle hit on the stone floor with a crisp sound, and she leaned to get it. “Do you really want me to…” Aria continued, blushing badly, but despite avoiding my gaze, I could see the excitement in her eyes. </p><p>“That’s nonsense,” Emma shouted while I nodded to Aria, struggling to stand up from my lap, only to fail under my strong grasp. She wasn’t putting her full strength in the first place, and under my iron grip, she was quickly dissuaded from her decision. </p><p>“Really,” I said even as I gestured for Aria to move closer. “Is it more ridiculous than you risking the capital itself in your foolish desire to look for a dirty release, only to leave my chains unlocked carelessly, leaving the poor princess to sacrifice so much just to keep the big bad Dark Lord sated?” I said, making eye contact with Aria in the process. Despite my words, I made sure to hit Aria with my most seductive smile, making her skip a step and stumble, blushing furiously. Her innocence was addictive. </p><p>“It’s not my fault that the blonde bimbo decided to whore herself-” Emma started complaining. I understood where she was coming from. She was clearly feeling that she was losing control, so, she lashed out to her only viable target, thinking that she was safe from retaliation. Not a bad assumption considering Aria’s record when it came to defending herself. Unfortunately, she made one big mistake. </p><p>Aria wasn’t defending herself, but following my commands. And under the circumstances, my words were heavier than hers. </p><p>All it took was a nod from me to Aria to cross the remaining distance and hit Emma’s ass, protected by only her flimsy lacy panties. “Good attempt, but try to hit harder,” I said to Aria. “It was supposed to do more than just tickling.” </p><p>Aria just nodded while Emma spoke. “Wait a minute-” she tried to say, only to be interrupted by another hit from Aria’s paddle, this time hard enough to force a cry, leaving a pink mark behind. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said even as I caressed the mark Aria’s assault left, amused by the sudden hint of jealously awakened in Aria’s eyes whenever I touched Emma tenderly. An emotion I had no problems using to goad her further. “Again,” I reminded her, and the paddle exploded on Emma’s skin once more. </p><p>“Hey, that’s-” Emma tried to say, only to be interrupted by another slam, this time without my explicit order. I examined Aria’s face, her enjoyment clear, mixed with surprise. She was finally retaliating in some manner in her sheltered life, and learning the joys of standing up for herself, no matter how much it shocked herself. </p><p>“You need to take your punishment obediently to earn the identity of your double-agent,” I said to her, even as I loosened my grip on her body. “So, stand up and walk away if you want, but this is the deal.” </p><p>Suddenly facing an ultimatum, Emma fell silent, proving that she was a poor negotiator. A more experienced one would have been aware of the fact that I needed extended cooperation, and was not in a position to enforce such an ultimatum if she had pushed back. At worst, she could have argued that it was an extension of the initial deal, and requested additional benefits. </p><p>She twisted her neck to meet my gaze, and to my surprise, I felt a surface probe trying to analyze my mood, yet another thing proving her utter lack of experience. It would have been trivial to destroy her mind using the connection she provided, but she leisurely assessed my surface thoughts nonetheless —or more accurately, the fake determination I showed to her in lieu of my true amusement. </p><p>It wasn’t only tactics of negotiation that she needed a detailed lesson, but that wasn’t as important as the nod she gave to me, accepting my demand. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I ripped her panties with a pull and stuffed them into her mouth, using the same method I had employed against Aria earlier. Emma stiffened in anger, but she didn’t make any attempt to escape the situation. I turned to Aria. “Continue,” I ordered, and she did so immediately, hitting harder than I expected. </p><p>“She deserves it,” Aria defended herself when I hit her with a mocking grin. I shrugged, not bothering to say anything, too amused by the way Aria finally touched her angry side, not dark, of course, but slightly gray, which was a vast improvement considering her usual personality. Aria slammed the paddle to her ass once more. </p><p>“Try to alternate cheeks,” I said, guiding Aria even as Emma’s ass started to glow under her treatment. I had ulterior motives for that, of course. Immediately after Aria spanked her ass, I started caressing Emma’s ass, with a hint of soothing magic wrapped around my fingers. The contrast it provided with the stinging sensation of Aria’s assisted slaps was amazing, evidenced by the sudden increase in Emma’s wetness. </p><p>She was aroused before as well, but it was just gentle dampness. Now, she was literally gushing, hints of arousal trailing down her thighs. I decided to take pity on her. “Poor girl,” I said as I caressed, but unlike the previous times, my target wasn’t her tight ass, but her wet lips, quivering in anticipation. She let out a surprised cry, one that her panties proved inadequate to properly suppress. </p><p>I ignored her reaction and started massaging her most sensitive spot, dancing around her clit, again and again, to build up anticipation, and slipping into her entrance to release a part of the said tension, so much that she started wiggling on my lap, trying to moan in protest. </p><p>However, the real surprise came from Aria. Her spanking suddenly picked up speed, the paddle exploding on Emma’s skin hard enough to echo in the room. I met Aria’s beautiful blue eyes with a questioning look, only to earn a shy hesitant look. “Are you jealous,” I said, unable to keep myself from chuckling. </p><p>“What! No!” she answered, surprisingly loud, but equally unconvincing. </p><p>“Really,” I said even as I let my gaze caress her body. Since she was naked other than her dress, which was bunched around her waist, so watching her blush was spectacular. It started from her neck, then started spreading in both directions. Her face turned into a delicious shade of red, and a moment later, her bountiful breasts followed them, looking deliciously red. She nodded, but it was a resigned nod, aware just how unconvincing it was. </p><p>“Don’t worry, sweetie, I have another hand,” I reminded her even as I reached and touched her dress, and pulled it hard, ripping it off her body, leaving her naked, discounting her shoes. She gasped in shock, only to be followed by a moan of pleasure when my fingers found her entrance, fingering her wetness once more. Her eyes widened at my action, no doubt thinking it excessively, which was rather ridiculous. Considering everything I had already done, this one wasn’t a lot. “Continue,” I said, reminding her of the task at hand. </p><p>Just like that, Aria continued paddling Emma’s bottom while I fingered both beauties at the same time, pushing them steadily toward orgasm. Even that part gave me a bit of a surprise. I was expecting Emma to climax first, considering I had been working on her for a while, but Aria exploded surprisingly quick, proving that she had been enjoying her new task a bit more than it was respectable. She collapsed on the chair, gasping for breath. </p><p> Though, to be fair, Emma was not too far behind, trembling like she was experiencing a spectacular earthquake. Unlike Aria, however, Emma stood up immediately despite her trembling legs, and pulled her panties out of her mouth, looking at me with a furious glare. “I have held my end of the deal, now it’s your turn,” she said. As she spoke, a sudden warm wind started flowing in the room, suggesting that she was angry enough to lose control of her elemental capabilities. </p><p>“Sure,” I said, deciding not to push her more today. Unlike Aria, Emma had a tendency to react explosively without thinking, and I could feel that I was already bordering a disaster. “And since you have been such a good sport, I’m going to give you the reveal the identity of a double-agent, and as a bonus, I’ll also reveal a spy in the capital.” After all, it was never a bad idea to establish more rewards for exemplar performance. </p><p>I quickly gave a rundown of two unimportant spies that belonged to some minor Dark Factions. Even without my loyal soldiers, I wasn’t afraid of the major factions, but I didn’t want to destroy the political landscape before I could get a better understanding of the new balance. Meanwhile, Emma dressed. Aria tried to dress as well, but unlike Emma, it didn’t go as smoothly since I had ruined her dress. </p><p>As I spoke, my mind was already focused on the next stage of my plan. After her display, holding Emma back was not an option. But should I hold Aria back for a private session, or let her go as well? </p>
