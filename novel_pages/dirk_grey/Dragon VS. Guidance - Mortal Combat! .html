        <p>Hi, everyone, I'm slowly coming to the end of my short break from the Dragon's Tale. After the break -and some history research- I feel ready to continue Dragon's Tale. </p><p>However, I just want to check your opinions about how to progress rather than making an unliteral decision, I want to ask the opinion of your guys.  </p>
