        <p>I had to wait for long for Tara’s arrival for a while, but I wasn’t concerned about that. Today, we had purchased quite a number of outfits for her, and it would take her a while to dress properly. </p><p>I didn’t waste that break, but instead started exploring the ways to spend the sudden riches I found myself owning. </p><p>Renovating the bar itself was not an option. I didn’t want people starting to ask questions about the sudden renovation, and whether it was about our earlier lack of money. There would be several good explanations for such a question. </p><p>My situation was like a magic trick, the fewer questions asked, the better. </p><p>Luckily, I had no visitors in my apartment upstairs, and I was free to change that however I wanted. </p><p>As long as we did it with no outside help. </p><p>With our display, every single low and medium-tier villain would be watching us, meaning there was absolutely no chance we could trust a contractor. Not to keep their mouth shut, and not to refrain from dropping a few bugs in the foundation. </p><p>No, I rather do all the necessary renovation myself, especially since Tara’s super strength was revealed, and had no problem being used. </p><p>Renovation was easy … security, not so much. Better cameras, alarms, and motion sensors were a must, maybe lasers and some more exotic detection tools in case I had to deal with a super thief. Luckily, my power helped me to make such design choices easily. I had made several purchase orders on one of the national companies, with an expedited delivery order to a different name and location.</p><p>I didn’t expect our local villains to have any sway on a company of that size enough to make them send faulty products, but it was better safe than sorry.  </p><p>The last thing I did was to write the owner and purchase the building … only to receive an answer, receiving the place as a gift in less than five minutes. Just like that, I was the owner of my bar and my house. </p><p>My reputation helped … and I did my best to ignore how it would bounce the other way.</p><p>All those took an hour, which would have been enough to worry if I couldn’t hear Tara moving upstairs, no doubt trying to pick the perfect outfit. I could have gone and interrupted, but I chose to let it slide. She had just got her wardrobe changed significantly, and. It was better for her to feel confident about it. </p><p>And, it wasn’t like I didn’t have anything else to do. </p><p>I was going through the city plans and wondering if we could dig a tunnel through the office, one that could be used both as a way to smuggle stuff in, and a way to smuggle stuff in. We might even add a basement, both only viable strategies due to Tara’s powers. </p><p>It made sense. </p><p>Once I put the finishing touches on the plan, I had nothing to do. I pulled on the puzzle, and started to play with it once more, once again failing to understand why I was so fascinated by it. Since the night was over, I decided to overcharge my power again. </p><p>As I overpowered my ability, several details I had only caught on a subconscious level became apparent. “No wonder I’m so fascinated with this puzzle,” I murmured as I took in the details, which were ten times more intricate than I had realized before. </p><p>No wonder my power caught it among all the other toys. </p><p>I twisted and manipulated until the puzzle parted. Inside, there was only a paper. </p><p>‘I’m a hero, and I’m being kept prisoner. Please help,’ the message read, which was the only handwritten part. The rest of it was two parts. First, it detailed the location of a small safe house hidden in a junkyard on the opposite side of the town, with a list of inventory showing weapons and other devices, that could be used to free her.</p><p>I knew she was a woman, because, I could somehow detect that from her handwriting. My power might not be incredibly powerful, but it had its perks. </p><p>However, the second part of the message sent chills through me and I wanted to burn it. It was her current location, which was right under a well-known building in the city. </p><p>Famous, even. </p><p>The headquarters of the New Giant Force. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured. I wanted to believe that it was a joke, but overcharging my power — despite the headache — allowed me to confirm that whoever wrote the message was in genuine distress. I didn’t trust the guilds, that much was certain, but I didn’t expect them to be keeping people captive illegally. </p><p>There were a lot of questions, like how and why … but then I heard a knock on my door, I just folded the message back and put it in my drawer with the solved mechanical puzzle. I had a horrible headache from overusing my power, and I didn’t want to think about the implications of such an illegal action coming from the premier guild of the city. </p><p>No, I just wanted to be distracted from my pain. </p><p>“Come in,” I said. </p><p>“S-sir… I’m here for our … scheduled meeting,” Tara said, her face glowing red, suggesting that it was her attempt to roleplaying. </p><p>Distraction was a success. </p><p>She looked fascinating, her innocent expression contrasting greatly with the huge cleavage she displayed thanks to her mostly unbuttoned shirt, and the red bra she had underneath made the contrast even more incredible. </p><p>Her skirt was even better. She wore the shortest one we purchased, already small enough to be scandalous, and the slit on the side made it even sexier while also showing off her stockings and garter belt, also red.</p><p>The black stilettos were high enough to make me doubt whether she could have walked on them if it wasn’t for her powers, but considering the way they enhanced her ass, I wasn’t complaining. </p><p>When taken together, her outfit left no doubt about exactly what was about to happen.  </p><p>I was so glad about that shopping trip, especially since all the money we spent there suddenly turned into a pittance. </p><p>“You’re late,” I said, the headache making my voice harder than I intended. She opened her mouth, but I gestured her to be silent, which worked excellently. She looked confused, trying to understand whether it was part of the role or genuine. “Come here, you need to be punished,” I ordered. </p><p>She was still hesitant as she approached, which was a funny expression on the face of the super who had just scared a lot of villain organizations around us. </p><p> “I’m sorry, sir. I was just-” she started, delivering no doubt a prepared explanation, which died the moment I pushed her against the desk, her skirt riding up with the motion … showing that she didn’t wear panties.</p><p>“No talking,” I said as I pulled my belt and wrapped it around her neck, using it to pull her back while I freed my shaft. It was hurried, but I didn’t want to waste any time with the foreplay. Not only I had a horrible headache I wanted to distract myself from, but also I could see just how wet she was. </p><p>She didn’t need any foreplay either. </p><p>I pulled my belt, forcing her to a difficult position that had the risk of being painful if it wasn’t for her powers, and slid inside. </p><p>Her eyes widened at the sudden invasion, followed by a moan that the belt around her neck was unable to prevent — once again her powers interfering — as I enjoyed her unique beauty, giving me an excellent boost of pleasure in the process. </p><p>She said nothing, too overwhelmed by the sudden invasion as I invaded her aggressively. At this moment, she was nothing more than a secretary, here only to serve my most immediate needs. </p><p>And, her cries made it clear just how much she loved it. </p><p>As I climbed toward an explosion, she wasn’t too far behind. Her voice turned strained in barely a minute, the aggressive impaling she received working wonders. </p><p>I could have slowed down to make sure she climaxed, but with my headache, that was not an option. I just invaded her aggressively, for once prioritizing my own pleasure before hers. Of course, after overusing it, my power didn’t give me constant small inputs — it might have, but I actively suppressed it to keep it from happening, hoping it would help me to recover faster. </p><p>Luckily, Tara wasn’t particularly hard to read even without my power. Our short yet fruitful partnership gave me a lot of practice in knowing just how she reacted to an impending climax. </p><p>I impaled her for another quick yet intense minute, finally marking that with an explosion. </p><p>“Yes, sir. Fill me,” she moaned, orgasming as I filled her, which was faster than I expected … showing that I wasn’t as good as I hoped to read her without my power. </p><p>Well, we had a lot of time to practice… </p>
