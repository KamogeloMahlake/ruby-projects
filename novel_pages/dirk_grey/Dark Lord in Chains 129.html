        <p>I let my dazed, naked ruin explorer have a chance to breathe after our searing kiss before getting her attention. “You just need to make a decision, sweetie,” I said as I caressed her thigh. “Do you want to have more time, or make a decision?” </p><p>I grinned at her uncertain expression. “I…” she said, almost as a whisper, just barely audible despite the silence of the ruins. </p><p>As the silence stretched, I moved to sit on a nearby rock. “It’s not that hard, sweetie. Three options. Yes, no … or you earn your delay, by starting to dance.” She looked indecisive still. “You’re the one that tempted me, sweetie.” </p><p>Audrum stood there in her naked glory, and I didn’t bother hiding my eager expression from her, or the fact it got wider as she let out a defeated sigh which she somehow managed to look sexy. As she approached, I watched her with my full attention. </p><p>There was no music, but she seemed to be uncaring of that particular detail as her hips started swaying steadily. Her hands ran up her hips, moving in front of her until they were raised over her head, giving her an alluring feeling. </p><p>She was clearly lying when she said she couldn’t dance. </p><p>“Not a bad start, sweetie,” I said while she turned, swaying as she crossed her legs to hide her wetness. A strategic move to restrict the full view of her beauty … which I let her continue. Her body swayed as she bent backward, far more than I expected her to succeed. </p><p>Her flexibility was important. No wonder it helped her in the ruins in case of an emergency. </p><p>I was happy to get the welcome side effects. “Wow, impressive flexibility,” I commented.  </p><p>“Oh,” she whispered in response to my compliment, but she slowly leaned more and more until she created a complete arc, her hands pressing the ground. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I commented as she slowly stood up, the excitement on her face impossible to hide as she dragged her hands over her chest and her hips once more, before sliding her palms down to her thighs. “Show me more, baby.” </p><p>“A-as you wish,” she stammered, her shy tone a great contrast to her confident movement as she turned her back to me and she started sliding down, grabbing her ankles while her bare ass pointed straight at me, revealing her core, which she had been working hard to hide. </p><p>She stayed there for a moment, shaking her ass for my enjoyment. And, when she stood up, she took a step forward and she was again facing me, even closer. </p><p>“It seems that you have already made a decision,” I commented as she started sinking down until she was crouched in front of me, spraying my legs as she moved even closer to my shaft. She looked at it with her lips parted. </p><p>She said nothing as her hands moved over my thighs and knees. ”Not yet,” she whispered slowly as she leaned forward close enough that I felt her breath over my shaft, but that was the closest she got before she started rising once more. </p><p>I expected her to pull back and took a step back, but she managed to surprise me once more. She continued to sway as she stayed in a half crouch, then moved closer. </p><p>And, just like that, she was rubbing her ass against my leg. I put my hand on her hips. She said nothing, just smiling as her hips never stopped swaying. She leaned back as she raised her hands through her hair, slowly letting it fall around her shoulders like a black blanket as she continued dancing to an imaginary tone.</p><p>Her hands slowly moved down to her chest, squeezing her tits hard. I reached to add my hands to hers, but she slapped them away. “I … I haven’t made a decision yet,” she said as she rose up once more. </p><p>She moved in front of me as her bare breasts swayed to her movement. It only stopped as she began stroking her breasts once more, then moving to her waist as she turned around. </p><p>Even from the distance, I could see her nipples standing straight out, begging for my attention. She must have realized that as well, as soon, as her nipples tightly held between her thumb and forefinger.</p><p>I had to admit, I was getting surprised by how blatant she was getting with her dance. What was supposed to be an excuse to give her a chance to make a decision turned into an erotic show, which I was quite happy about. </p><p>I didn’t know if it was a deliberate choice, or she was lost in her own excitement, but I was happy to get the fruits either way. She bent down toward me once more, and I locked to her bare breasts swinging freely in front of me. </p><p>This time, when I reached for her tits, rather than slapping my hand away, she lowered herself into my lap, rubbing her ass up and down my leg, simulating a nice dance. I pressed my palms against her breasts and massaged them. </p><p>As I squeezed them mercilessly, her hands moved over to mine. But, once again, rather than dragging them away, she helped me to massage her breasts. I was amazed that, even as I started pinching her nipples, her response was to lean forward to make me grab that even better. </p><p>Soon, she stopped helping me with her breasts, and instead slid forward, trapping my shaft against her naked body, rocking her hips, humping me without completing the fun. Meanwhile, my hands had free reign over her body. </p><p>With her head tilted back, she started to moan, her breasts thrust up. I leaned forward to bury my head between her breasts, my hands clenched to her soft flesh.</p><p>She just moaned loudly, her composure completely lost. </p><p>I was amazed. Lost herself in her moans, her hips began moving faster and faster, her entire body thrumming with anticipation as arousal draw closer. </p><p>I decided to help her a bit, and one of my hands slipped into her wetness, finger fucking her aggressively. “Oh, that’s too much,” she moaned. </p><p>“Really,” I mocked as she leaned back, though her hips stayed in place, moving back and forth as I continued to finger fuck her, even faster. “But I don’t care. Feel free to make a decision if you’re not happy with how the dance is developing.” </p><p>“I … not yet,” she whispered. </p><p>“But the time I gave you is already over. You need to do something more interesting if you want me to wait.” </p><p>“As you wish,” she whispered immediately as she departed my lap. For a moment, I thought she was calling a stop, but a glance on her face, contorted with pleasure, was enough to change my mind. </p><p>She fell onto her knees, her hand already wrapped around the base of my shaft. I used the chance to grab her breasts once more, massaging them slowly as her hips parted open. </p><p>I licked my lips, mesmerized as she leaned forward to show her appreciation. A loud groan escaped my mouth as her head started to slide up and down between my legs.</p><p>I watched in amazement at the sight in front of me, my naughty explorer sucking my cock without hesitation, amused by just how far she had come. She worked on my dick like she had been denied one for ages. </p><p>Maybe she was. </p><p>However, rather than asking her that, I decided to enjoy the enthusiastic show, still having trouble believing just enthusiastically she gobbled my shaft. </p><p>“You definitely look cuter with something in your mouth," I laughed, earning a furious gaze. But, that didn’t prevent her from working faster, leaning hard enough to take it to her throat. </p><p>I stood entranced as she ran her tongue up the base, her hands cupping my balls. “Better?” she asked. </p><p>“Oh, certainly more interesting,” I answered. She smiled as reached the tip, again engulfing the whole thing in her mouth, moaning the whole time as I guided her head up and down.</p><p>A spectacular fun … certainly worthy of the wait. Now, I needed to decide how to continue.  </p>
