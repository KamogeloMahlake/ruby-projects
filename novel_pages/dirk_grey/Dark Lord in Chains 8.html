        <p>After my ‘discussion’ with Vradan’s spy, I decided to return to my room. Under the circumstances, I had already pushed my luck too much tonight, going as far as to leave the palace itself and going to the inner city. Any more, and the risk would become too much. </p><p>With that in mind, I sneaked back into the palace. Luckily, since it was already late, the lights in the corridors were dimmed, giving me the perfect opportunity to use my shadow magic to make myself effectively invisible. I was a bit afraid when it was the time to sneak into Emma’s room —not knowing about the other entrances yet— but my luck held strong, and when I picked the lock and entered, a soft singing was coming from her bathroom. </p><p>I tried to catch a glimpse from the keyhole, hoping that she was showering, only to see her buried in a sea of bubbles, hiding her body effectively. Pity, I thought as I opened the entrance of the secret passage. She owed me some sexy material after molesting me, thinking I was unconscious.</p><p>Still, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of annoyance as I returned to my cell. It was a bit ungrateful considering my previous condition, but I couldn’t help but resent the need to return back to my cell. Even with the ability to finally escape, I didn’t appreciate the need. I especially didn’t appreciate the oppressive feeling of the magic-blocking chains, even when they were damaged. I could remove them whenever I want, of course, but my magic still got somehow restricted as I wore them, giving me a claustrophobic sensation. Still, I managed to sleep… </p><p>Only to wake up to a pleasant view when I heard the creaking of the cell door as it opened. It was Princess Aria, wearing a simple dress which nonetheless failed to restrict her beauty. Even better, she was carrying a tray of food in her hands. As I examined it, the smell of it reached my nose as well. </p><p>“Good morning,” she said, barely above a whisper, as she looked at me. I smiled as I looked at the tray. “I brought you some breakfast,” she added. </p><p>“Thanks, you’re as kind as you’re beautiful,” I replied, which made her blush rather thickly. Meanwhile, my mouth watered, because, since my capture, I had been being fed by alchemical nutrition pills, which tastes as good as a piece of rotten wood, and during the last night, everything was too chaotic to stop for some food. “So, am I going to be fed by a beautiful princess’ hand,” I said, amused. </p><p>“Well,” she murmured as she threw a blanket from her bag and threw it next to me. “It’s not like I can let you eat yourself,” she added with a soft smile, though that little quip seemed to hit the limits of her courage, as she avoided my gaze afterward. </p><p>“Even if I promise to be a very good boy, listening to your every command?” I asked. </p><p>“Every command?” she repeated, her voice climbing high to join her blush. I just snickered at her reaction, not wanting to scare her off before she had the opportunity to warm up. I had my morning wood to do that for me, something she had noticed the moment she entered, but pointedly avoided gazing except a few quick ones when she thought I wasn’t looking. </p><p>She cut a small piece of buttered toast using a knife, and used a fork to bring it to my mouth with a motion more graceful than other people could achieve when dancing. I bit it, smiling slightly as I did so. “It’s delicious. Thanks,” I said, which was true. It was a simple breakfast, but I missed the opportunity to eat solid foods, not to mention that being fed by an actual princess made it even better. “But aren’t you going to be in trouble if others see it?” I asked, my tone of concern not entirely faked. </p><p>“No, no one else is going to visit today, they have more important things to deal with.”</p><p>“Good to hear that we don’t need to hurry to avoid another interruption, that would have been inconvenient,” I said, but even as I delivered it calmly, it didn’t prevent her frustration and shame. Understandable, considering she was in the midst of delivering a hand job when Emma had interrupted the last time. </p><p>“How are your injuries?” she asked after the lengthy silence I let linger, giving her an opportunity to remember what had been happening in vivid details. Or at least, that was what I assumed she was doing when she started to examine the walls with great detail, avoiding me pointedly. </p><p>“Not bad,” I answered. “The pain is almost gone, but deep breaths still cause a stinging sensation.” Of course, I had cured myself last night after I got rid of the chains. A mundane injury was a simple thing to cure without the chains, and I certainly wasn’t stupid around to run around all night with a dangerous injury. Luckily, with the chains on, Aria was unable to use her diagnostic magic, and had to rely on simpler ways to diagnose, something I knew well enough to fake. </p><p>“It’s good news, it means that we can finish the healing session today,” she said. </p><p>“We can,” I said with a shrug. “Or we can stretch it to two days and fill the time between with something more interesting,” I answered. </p><p>“W-what! No!” she stammered. “Not that!” </p><p>“Well, as you wish,” I said with a shrug. “I’m just trying to help, but if you’re going to be ungrateful about it…” I said dispassionately, letting anger linger in my tone just for a moment. </p><p>“Sorry!” she said immediately, too afraid of confrontation to resist even such a small, passive-aggressive rebuke from her prisoner. Lancelot really screwed up by letting his innocent fiancee hang around alone in my lair. She was like a poor little lamb trying to cook a vegetarian dinner for a wolf, an amusing but ultimately vain activity. Though, like the wolf in that story, I was very much happy about it. </p><p>I let her stew a few seconds before looking at her kindly. “It’s okay, but I don’t appreciate your tone when I’m the one helping you,” I said, once again twisting the situation to make her even guiltier. “It’s your call.” </p><p>“Please, I’m sorry,” she said even as she put her hand to my thigh and squeezed, a surprisingly forward physical action considering her demeanor. Even better, that action caused gaze to fell down to my shaft, reminding her of my raging arousal. She continued with a guilty whisper. “Did it stay like that the whole night?” she said. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I answered, but put a slight strain in my tone, just enough to give the impression that I was bravely resisting discomfort just to spare her feelings. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured, looking at me confusedly before her expression took a steely expression. “No, it’s not fair for you too fell discomfort for my needs,” she said even as she grabbed my pants, and pulled them, revealing my shaft. </p><p>It took quite a bit of willpower from my end to prevent mocking laughter. Her words were nice, but her response had come too quickly, especially for her, meaning that I wasn’t the only one that was lamenting about Emma’s interruption —though Emma managed to earn my forgiveness by her idiotic lack of caution.</p><p> Her tongue darted out, slowly licking her lips in an effort to moisten them to combat her excitement, but her hand was quick to meet around my shaft, and even quicker as it started moving up and down. “You’re a good student,” I said even as I turned my gaze at her beautiful blue eyes. “You remember what I had told you about the pressure perfectly. Most girls struggle with that.” </p><p>“Most girls…” she whispered, her hand coming to a sudden spot. “Have you…” she tried to ask in an even softer tone, only to fade away. </p><p>“Well, you can say that a few would be an unfair classification,” I said. “But a gentleman doesn’t kiss and tell.” </p><p>“I … see,” she uttered, trying to process it, but I was more interested in the way her hand started to move once more. She was still gentle, but this time, there was an edge of sharpness in her movements. Somehow, she was feeling jealous. </p><p>It was ridiculous, but amusing, so, I said nothing about that, letting her continue. I still made some small corrections about her technique, of course.</p><p>“So, how does it compare to others?” she said almost five minutes later with a surprising amount of scorn in her tone. Or maybe not, I suddenly thought. The parallelism in the situation was obvious. She was trying to improve herself just to defeat other women to get Lancelot’s attention, so hearing that she was competing against a lot of women in my past couldn’t be easy.  </p><p>“If I’m going to be honest…” I said, letting my tone linger a bit before continuing, “A bit dry. You’re following my directions, but it best works with a lubricant.” She looked at me questioningly. “You can just spit on it.” </p><p>“S-spit on it!” she stammered, her outrage clear —and understandable considering she was a sheltered princess. </p><p>“Yes, spit. Sweetie, marital relations include a lot of bodily fluids. You need to get used to it quick.” </p><p>The resulting blush was so spectacular that I was afraid that she was going to faint. She closed her eyes, taking a deep breath, but interestingly, her hand continued to move up and down on my shaft. Her expression cycled for a moment, then she brought her free hand to her mouth. </p><p>I couldn’t help but gasp in pleasure as her other hand wrapped around my shaft as well, delivering the much-needed lubricant. “Keep it in there, it’s better with both hands,” I reminded her, and she did so, delivering a double-fisted hand job, but once again avoiding my gaze. “Excellent,” I said, and once again continued to give her various tips and tricks. </p><p>“Is it supposed to take this long?” she asked. “According to what I have overheard from the maids, it was not supposed to take this long. I feel like I’m doing something wrong.” </p><p>It lasted long, not only because I was more experienced than the pathetic lays a maid could find, but also Emma was kind enough to take the edge off my suffering last night. “Well…” I said, but let it slide without continuing. </p><p>“I’m doing something wrong, aren’t I?” she said immediately, once again her deficient self-confidence showing itself as she immediately blamed herself. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I answered, which was effectively an evasive confirmation, something that earned her attention. “Well, some visual stimulation would help things to go faster,” I reminded her. </p><p>“Like what?” she asked, this time somehow without any obvious stammering. </p><p>“I still remember the cleavage I had woken up to,” I told her, wiggling my eyebrows playfully. </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured, but considering her hands were still moving along my length, I didn’t take that statement seriously. “This dress doesn’t have an open front,” she added. </p><p>“Are you wearing a corset underneath?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, her tone once again hesitant. </p><p>“Well, a corset is a pretty conservative piece of underwear, Even if you let the top of your dress to fall, I won’t be able to see a lot.” </p><p>That managed to shock her enough to pull her hands away, wrapping them around her chest. “That’s too much!” she exclaimed. </p><p>“Is it?” I countered. “Sweetie, it’s not really much considering what we’re doing,” I said. “And I already seen your cleavage in that dress, I doubt that your corset reveals any more.” </p><p>“No, but that’s different…” she murmured, but she made the mistake of meeting my gaze, her already shaky determination melting immediately. I said nothing, just let my gaze slowly trail down to my shaft, which was still glistening with her indirectly-delivered spit. “Or not…” she added with a sigh, and reached for her zipper. </p><p>I watched with rapt attention as she pulled her dress down to her waist, revealing a blue and white corset underneath that complemented her body perfectly. More importantly, it ended just above her nipples, enough to give me a glimpse of her areolas. The sight of her amazing breasts, trying to pop out of the constraints of her corset was even more amazing. “You look beautiful,” I said, the awe in my tone was not faked. She was truly one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen, and her innocence made her even tastier. </p><p>“I hope that’s enough,” she said, trying to sound exasperated, but unable to hide her own excitement. It seemed that caressing my most intimate body parts gave her a bit more courage about the way she dressed. </p><p>“Definitely,” I answered, enjoying the way she tried to turn her torso a bit like she wanted to avoid my gaze, only to give me a better view. She said nothing else as she turned her attention back to my shaft, both hands dancing along my length. “Don’t forget to lubricate,” I reminded her. This time, she didn’t waste any time before she raised her hand and spit on her hand. </p><p>Her cleavage was amazing, but I couldn’t help but want to see even more of her beautiful breasts. Luckily, with the cracks in the chains widened further, casting simple spells was trivial. Spells like a simple telekinetic touch to loosen the lacing on her back. </p><p>Unhappy with their imprisonment, her breasts were more than happy to make an attempt to freedom the moment I loosened the lacing, giving me a better view of her areolas, along with a hint of her nipples. The view it created was simply spectacular, pushing me closer to climax. Pity I couldn’t loosen them completely without making her suspicious. She was gullible, but even she must have her limits. </p><p>I turned to examine her face, wondering whether she noticed the trick, but I realized I wasn’t the only one feeling arousal. Her face was contorted with an innocent eroticism as she struggled under a sensation of arousal that she had never felt before.</p><p>“Lean forward,” I ordered, curious of her limits in her distracted state. Surprisingly, she followed that order without the slightest hesitation, not even bothering to look at her own chest. The angle was perfect, giving me a complete view of her amazing tits, her corset essentially turning useless under the circumstances. I couldn’t help but push my luck even more. “Lean more,” I said, and she did so, her lips just inches away from mine, temptingly innocent. “Now, give me a kiss.” </p><p>“What-” she started, shocked, but not shocked enough to lean back or stop playing with my shaft. </p><p>“I said, give me a kiss. As your teacher, I need to test how much you remember from your lessons,” I explained in a matter-of-fact tone, a tone that indicated that my words were not only rational, but also completely normal, no different than a teacher asking for his pupil to solve a simple problem. </p><p>A miracle happened, and she completed the motion, and I felt her lips over mine, panicky and hesitant, moving with a shaky slowness. Still, they delivered a delicious kiss. I really loved seducing innocent girls. The initial challenge was high, but thanks to their lack of experience, once their initial hesitation was broken, they didn’t know how to put new barriers, easily swept up at the moment. </p><p>The kiss turned even more beautiful when I probed her lips with my tongue, and they widened reflexively. I didn’t push my tongue in her mouth aggressively not to scare her, but gently coaxed out hers instead, until our tongues started dancing like gentle lovers. All the while, her hands continued to pump up and down, pushing me steadily toward a climax. </p><p>The kiss lingered for a long while, until my own body decided to interrupt, suddenly exploding, covering her corset with my seed. Even then, she was so distracted by the dance of our tongues, she failed to notice until the third burst, when it managed to hit her amazing cleavage. As she pulled out of the kiss, I used my magic to tighten the lacing of her corset, not wanting to alarm her even more. </p><p>“Excellent work, you’re really an amazing student,” I stated just as she pulled back, watching her first male orgasm with a great shock, failing to prevent her corset from getting drenched in my cum. </p><p>“Thanks,” she stammered, her blush getting so thick that I was worried about the possibility of her fainting. “Should we start healing,” she murmured even as she reached for her dress. </p><p>“Sure, but you should keep the dress down until it dries,” I reminded her. “You don’t want it to be stained.” </p><p>“You’re right,” she whispered as she put her hands on my torso, immediately infusing my body with healing energy, using it as an excuse not to talk about what happened. Not that I was unhappy about it, not when it gave me an excuse to enjoy her beauty. </p><p>The only question was, whether I should push for more, or should I let it be for today?</p>
