        <p>When I had started teasing her, I hadn't expected much, but her absolute lack of protest as I rolled up her robes had done quite a bit to change my mind about it. I spanked her once more, enjoying the way she trembled on my lap. </p><p>In a way that had absolutely nothing to do with fear. </p><p>Only anticipation. </p><p>I spanked her again, and this time, a whisper escaped her mouth. “How much longer?” she whispered. </p><p>Her question earned me a big smile. Pity, she couldn’t see that from her current position. “Well, do you want me to stop?” I asked with a chuckle, a question that she left without an answer decisively. “Excellent,” I added, and spanked her once more. “After all, your tactical failure needs a big punishment.” </p><p>She didn’t answer, silent as my hand stayed on her ass after the spank, dancing on her skin. Curious, I decided to push a bit more. A flare of mana, and two vines burst out of the ground, one wrapping around her wrist, the other around her legs. </p><p>“W-what’s going on,” she gasped. </p><p>“Well,” I said, intentionally extending my murmur as I did so. “A part of your failure is about your abject failure to control your mana, so I have a little control exercise for you. You need to free yourself from your impediments, but you’re not allowed to flood it with your mana and destroy it. You need to overcome my control.” </p><p>“I…” she whispered. “What if I can’t… Will I be … punished?” Her tone left no doubt about what she was asking about. </p><p>“Of course not,” I answered with a smirk, and pulled my hand away, stopping to touch her. “I’m not going to touch you … at all.” </p><p>“At … all,” she said, her voice starting from a whisper and turning into a panicked gasp halfway. </p><p>“Of course not, you have been already punished, this is the training part. Aren’t you happy that you have such an enthusiastic helper, priestess?” I said with a chuckle as I crossed my hands behind my head. </p><p>But the state of her robe was enough to convey my true intent without the slightest doubt. After all, why would I leave it rolled, breaking the whole point of her conservative robe to reveal her surprisingly toned legs? </p><p>Which was a truly glorious sight, even with the monstrosities she wore as underwear. </p><p>“I see,” she whispered, but that was all she was able to say as she froze on my lap, unable to act.</p><p>Her inaction lasted a full minute, frozen with indecision, no doubt overwhelmed by what had just happened. She had already accepted my implied invitation, but the following twist was enough to freeze her. </p><p>Passively accepting was different than taking an active role. </p><p>It took a while until I felt her mana. Her magic gave her a lot of options, some allowing her to cut herself free from the vines, or at least fix her dress, but she ignored all of those possibilities, and soon, her mana danced in the vine, probing against my mana. </p><p>I responded to her tricks to take control, treating that as a fun way to experiment with controlling nature-mana, which was a great way to kill time as she tried to process the situation. </p><p>As we battled for control, both of us experienced a significant jump in mana-related abilities, and we were surprisingly balanced. I had the advantage in terms of pure power, but she was certainly more familiar with how nature-mana interacted with actual plants. I was just brute-forcing control most of the time — though, it was more the equivalent of wild bribery in vegetation terms.</p><p>She managed to steal control of the one around her arms after a while. I might have tried to steal it back, but when I felt it wrap around my arms instead, I decided to let it slide, curious about where she would go. </p><p>I smiled, but I was unable to hide my curiosity as she managed to push herself off my lap, instead ended up in front of me, kneeling due to her legs, still wrapped. Our little competition stalled with her focus shifting to keep me bound rather than trying to pull back. </p><p>Curious, I let that happen, enjoying my height advantage as she looked up silently. She was already a bundle of nerves, which gave me some nice ideas about how she might follow the situation, but I didn’t dare to ask. </p><p>I didn’t want to scare her off — not to mention, I wanted to see what she would do of her own volition.</p><p>“It seems that we’re locked in a stalemate,” she whispered, her soft tone promising a lot of interesting things about the situation. </p><p>“It seems that way,” I answered with a chuckle as I shrugged and raised my hands, highlighting my helplessness. It wasn’t an intense situation, especially since I could get rid of my bindings a dozen ways, and I suspected she knew that as well. “What are you going to do?”</p><p>But she didn’t say anything, busy biting her lips while avoiding my gaze. “I guess … I have to cheat a bit, then,” she whispered. Her words were ambiguous, but the way she put her hands on my thighs certainly was not. </p><p>I had several words on top of my tongue, ready to go out to tease her about her choice, but since I wasn’t a complete moron, I held them back to see what she would do. </p><p>“Let’s see if you can … handle it,” she said, this time louder like volume would give her confidence. It worked, though only until her hand landed on my lap, and felt the hardness underneath. “This is … wrong,” she whispered. </p><p>“It’s fine to admit it if you can’t handle it,” I said, giving her a little help. With my teasing, her anger flared. Not the softest of emotions, but an excellent way to suppress her hesitancy and push her toward an ill-advised decision. </p><p>The anger wasn’t enough to completely cure her hesitancy, but it was enough to let her hand continue its climb rather than stalling, and soon, she was pulling my pants down. “See … I can handle it,” she whispered, her voice dreamy as she looked at it. </p><p>I used that opportunity to counter-attack her, and the vines around my arms loosened for a moment. “Hey,” she gasped as she remembered to control them, and soon, they were once again tight. </p><p>“Well, as you said, distraction is a fair game. I can’t do anything if you can’t handle it.” </p><p>Her frown of frustration was simply beautiful, especially since it was accompanied by a twitch of her pointy ears. “I’ll show you distraction,” she gasped. </p><p>“Excellent decision,” I whispered as she dragged her hand up once more, this time touching my pole to remove any ambiguity about what was about to transpire. </p><p>She said nothing as her hands started to dance on my length, hesitant yet impressive, though her lips parted open in shock as she realized one important detail. “It’s … growing,” she whispered. </p><p>“That’s how it works when it’s … being used as a tool of distraction by a gorgeous beauty, honey,” I said with a chuckle, enjoying her shock. </p><p>“I’m gorgeous…” she whispered dazedly before focusing on its size. “But … it’s too big,” she whispered as she leaned back, her face contorted with shock. </p><p>“No, sweetie, just big enough, don’t worry about it,” I answered, enjoying her tremble, but her conviction proved stronger as her fingers started moving, her fingertips unable to touch. </p><p>“If you say so,” she whispered, doubtful, but too focused to care. As her hand danced, our magical struggle continued, though with less intensity. I could have used that to reverse the situation, but with her hands picking up speed, I decided to let that go. </p><p>It was nice to see her passion growing slowly. The attraction was a dangerous weapon, especially when combined with the rush of a near-death experience. She said nothing, but her moans lingered as her hands danced. </p><p>I said nothing, enjoying the sight. With her on her knees in front of me, her fingers wrapped around my erection, squeezing slowly with an intense look of concentration on her face. A little more forward than I expected of her, but certainly more attractive. </p><p>She looked at me occasionally with rapt attention, slowly squeezing her hand, while watching me for signs, her skills developing rapidly as she put her phenomenal perception abilities to the limit, her pressure soon reaching a perfect degree. </p><p>It was nice to see her newly improved abilities to excellent use. To her credit, she didn’t forget why she was trying to distract me in the first place, her mana battling against mine, and suddenly attacked with a mana rush.</p><p>“A good attempt,” I said with a chuckle as I blocked her. “Pity you failed to distract me enough…” </p><p>“Oh, I failed to distract you enough,” she whispered, the way her lips curled in challenge simply spectacular…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 12</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 7352}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2050}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>
