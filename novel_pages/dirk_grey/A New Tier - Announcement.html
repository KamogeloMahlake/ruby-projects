        <title>A New Tier - Announcement</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hi everyone, I have just created a new tier, as several of you was asking me to create it. And after some thought, I decided to offer a CYOA adventure as a reward for that tier. The story itself, as well as the weekly actions, will be voted, and the chapter created as a result. </p><p><strong>Of course, it goes without saying that it will not affect the current rewards for the existing stories. </strong><em><strong>On the contrary, it means some additional reward, because like the 5$ tier, ultimately some of the chapters will be accessible to all patrons. (Public posting schedule is currently undecided) </strong></em></p>
