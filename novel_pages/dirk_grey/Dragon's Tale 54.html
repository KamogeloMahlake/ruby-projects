        <p>The gasp Atia let out as I grabbed her waist, lifting her easily before throwing her on my shoulder, a move worthy of a barbarian carrying the rich noble he had just kidnapped. Atia’s delicious moan suggested that she wasn’t unaware of that particular connotation, nor she was against it.</p><p>However, the same acceptance didn’t apply to our location. She seemed to be shocked that, rather than ending up in a bedroom, we arrived at the bathroom, a huge room bigger than houses of the lower class nobles, every inch covered with high-quality marble, further enhanced by a generous application of gold, the only metal that wouldn’t corrode under the presence of constant humidity. </p><p>Despite her shock, however, she didn’t complain, because my hands weren’t idle as we walked toward the bathroom, a journey that took considerably long as I intentionally took a couple of wrong turns. My hands rested on her bottom, three of my fingers dancing at her entrance, teasing her while using the extensive range of tricks I had discovered during my mountain retreat, with the help of Lillian and Astrid. </p><p>I was betting that Atia was far inexperienced to be suspicious about the finesse displayed by a barbarian. And considering her endless moans, it seemed to be the case. </p><p>When I finally stepped into the shallow pool of warm water that functioned as the main bath —infused with many enchantments to keep the water clean regardless of the number of people inside— I removed Atia from my shoulder, deposing her on her feet in front of me, inches away. </p><p>The delicious dash of arousal that filled her beautiful blue eyes disappeared a bit when I decided to sit down into the pool rather than continuing to focus on her wet entrance like she had expected to. “Wash me,” I ordered, determined to enhance the sense of submission she was feeling toward me, especially since Olivia wasn’t here to help her if things started to get too absurd. </p><p>It was not an opportunity to miss. </p><p>She stayed silent for a moment, looking down in shock. “W-what?” she stammered. “You want me to wash you? Like a servant?” </p><p>“Are you having trouble hearing?” I countered casually. “Yes, I want you to wash me before I could take you properly like the bitch in the heat you are.” Her fists contorted tightly in anger, though her expression was filled with disbelief. Clearly, no one had ever talked to her like that, certainly not an uppity slave like me. </p><p>Then, I decided to move on to the final move. “Now,” I said, but it was much more than a simple word. It wasn’t magic, but for its effect, it well might be. It was a perfectly calibrated tone that worked wonders reaching a primal part of everyone that heard it, triggering their submissive instincts. </p><p>A naturally shy and hesitant person like Atia didn’t even have a chance, not with her raging arousal and confused mind, away from the safety net of her best friend —who was still distracted by the lips of another woman to realize the unique risk her friend was facing. Before Atia could properly react, she was already on her knees, her hand reaching toward a linen pouch used to clean the skin. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said, this time underlining my word with a caress of her head, the sudden positive reinforcement pushing her confusion even further. She stayed silent as she started dragging the pouch on my chest, her gentle touch sending shivers across my body. She wasn’t exactly cleaning, more using it as another opportunity to caress my muscles, but I wasn’t exactly against that. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I didn’t desire to mirror her actions, but I didn’t want to destroy the authority I had established over her. Instead, I stayed motionless as she slowly cleaned my chest and shoulders, even when she sat on my lap, close enough that her nether lips were rubbing against the side of my shaft with every move, her excitement growing by the second… </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel infected by her excitement. The perkiness of her movements as she danced on my lap, occasional fleeting glances she sent down like she was trying to make sure she wasn’t just dreaming, the way her body throbbed with sexy energy, driven her arousal out-of-control arousal… Even her magic was flowing with a weird alacrity, about to go out of control in excitement. </p><p>And the heavenly view of her body, her supple skin covered with water droplets, didn’t exactly help me stay away, even after the amazing orgy I had experienced, which, despite all its fun, was an inferior experience, because ultimately, it was under Olivia’s control. </p><p>Atia’s family background, with all the danger it implied, made the moment much tenser, and much more delicious as a result…  </p><p>Luckily, I knew exactly what she desired, and it was time to give her that. Even though, she had no idea what she was about to experience. </p><p>I didn’t bother asking her —she should have rejected my attention rather than rubbing against my shaft if she didn’t want to go forward— before grabbing her hips and lifting her, before skewering her with all the mercilessness that was fit to a gladiator slave. </p><p>Her lips parted open with great contrast to her eyes, firmly shut, and an earth-shattering cry exploded out of her mouth, my aggressive invasion enough to push her on the other side of the cliff, making her tremble in arousal. </p><p>Her explosive climax wasn’t a reason for me to stop, of course. I held her hips tightly and directed her to jump on my lap up and down, aggressively. </p><p>Nor the sudden rush of footsteps was a reason to stop me, even when it was followed by a shocked gasp from Olivia. “By the holy tits of Venus,” she whispered in shock as she looked at the moaning figure of her previously virgin best friend, being rammed repeatedly. </p><p>Admittedly, her shock was surprising. Like there was any other realistic outcome once I carried her friend out of the main party area on my shoulder. Maybe she had overestimated my fear toward the House Junia, or she underestimated my recklessness.  </p><p>Either way, I ignored the presence of the sexy redhead in favor of tightening my grasp further around Atia’s hips, the slapping our flesh filling the room despite the supposed barrier of the water, her blonde hair flailing wildly. </p><p>As I picked up the pace, it took a while for Atia to realize we had a voyeur in the room, but eventually, she did notice her. “Olivia,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Well, that was not a sight I was expecting,” Olivia murmured as her footsteps came closer, making Atia lean back like she wanted to escape from the closeness. “If I knew all that needed for you to change your mind about having fun was to invite a strapping gladiator, I would have done years ago.” </p><p>“It’s not like that,” Atia murmured as she leaned back even further, but considering she made no attempt to actually pull out, the range of her movement was significantly limited. </p><p>Olivia said nothing, just slid next to me to watch Atia’s expression, trying to look confident. Unfortunately for her, I was better at reading body language than she was at concealing it, so her attempts to hide her growing panic failed spectacularly. She was finally realizing that giving full access to a wild gladiator might not be the best idea… </p><p>Luckily for me, after things grew to such a point, she was too proud to actually admit her mistake. She maintained her silence as I continued to ram into her best friend, even making an occasional teasing comment to Atia, pushing her even further. </p><p>I wondered just how I needed to actually make her intervene. Too curious to prevent myself from testing, I slipped a finger into Atia’s tight hole, only for her to mix a pained cry between moans of joy. Atia’s shocked expression faded quickly, but Olivia’s lingered, destroying her attempts to look unaffected. </p><p>“It’s getting a bit much,” she said even as she grabbed my wrist, trying to pull out my finger, somehow, the anal invasion of her best friend, even by a finger, overwhelming her insistence of keeping things under control. Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of actually catering to her flimsy sense of control until things had reached this point. She tried to dislodge my finger, but failed spectacularly. </p><p>“Why don’t we ask your friend?” I countered, before turning to Atia. “Sweetie, tell me whether you want me to continue,” I said even as I pushed my finger deeper, which she reacted with another cry with hints of pain, but also with overwhelming pleasure. </p><p>Atia stayed silent, too shy to actually answer —but certainly not shy enough to shake her hips with gusto as I pushed inside her repeatedly— so I decided to push her a bit more. “I think silence means you’re unhappy with it,” I commented, even as I pulled out my finger. </p><p>“No,” she gasped reflexively. She seemed to be shocked in her own response, a mood that intensified even further as she made eye contact with Olivia. “No,” she gasped, but this time, the reason was her shame. She buried her face to my neck to hide her expression, her hips not missing a beat. </p><p>I slipped a second finger into her tight hole to reward her, even as I turned to Olivia with a smug expression. “She doesn’t seem to mind it as much as you do,” I said mockingly, enjoying her scandalized expression. </p><p>Since Olivia was too shocked to say anything, and Atia was busy hiding her face, I focused on bringing Atia another climax. I slid one hand to the small of her back, pushing her even deeper with each repeat, the other hand busy fingering her tight ass. </p><p>Under the combined assault —not to mention the scandalizing presence of her friend— it didn’t take long for the inexperienced Atia to taste another climax, this time even more explosive. Her moans rose unbidden as she raised her head, the presence of her friend forgotten under the rush overwhelming rush of pleasure. </p><p>As her orgasm subsided, she was already tethering on the edge of unconsciousness, so it was easy for me to add a weak flare of magic to push her toward the other end of the line that separated the awareness from unconsciousness. She collapsed against my chest, her breathing calm. </p><p>I gently grabbed her waist and put her on the edge of the pool, before turning my attention to Olivia, examining the conflicted expression of shock and arousal on her face. </p><p>“It’s finally your turn, mistress,” I said —with a mocking tone on the last word— even as moved in front of her, my muscular arms on both sides of her to prevent any attempt of escaping, my bulky chest creating an overwhelming sight. </p><p>The real fun of the evening was about to begin… </p>
