        <p>Hi everyone. </p><p>Just a few updates about how the future of the updates will continue. </p><p>First, Blacksmith vs. the System will continue to be updated with at least the current frequency. I have realized that, focusing on one or two stories rather than splitting my attention into multiple stories, it's smoother to write.</p><p>That means, Wild Dragon of Rome will not be updated until I finish Immortal Freeloader, and once that happens, it'll take its place. However, that also means that Immortal Freeloader will occasionally receive longer updates. </p><p>As for Blacksmith vs. the System, at least 7 chapters will be updated every week, but occasionally, like this week, there'll be 10 chapter weeks. </p><p>I hope you're all happy with the changes. Â </p>
