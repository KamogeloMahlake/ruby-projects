        <p>I didn’t do anything, and just watched as she struggled with my jeans, freeing my presence after a lengthy effort.  </p><p>“E-four,” she whispered with a trembling, soft whisper that worked excellently to harden me even more, working perfectly in combination with her soft fingers, wrapping around my length. I responded, and it launched another heated game. </p><p>One that I had committed more than one blunder, even with all my advantages. In my defense, it was very difficult to focus when a raven-haired beauty wearing a stripper’s rendition of a teacher's outfit that left very little to the imagination — especially after she stopped paying attention to her blazer, giving me many glimpses of her beautiful breasts. </p><p>The fingers that hesitantly danced up and down only made it more difficult. </p><p>Luckily, those blunders didn’t cost me the game, as my opponent was even more distracted, ending in a catastrophic defeat. </p><p>“That was better,” she muttered shyly as she glanced up, which was only technically true. She managed to force mistakes, but utterly failed to leverage those. </p><p>Still, as she looked up with a smile that was striking despite its softness, I chose to let that description slide.</p><p>Instead, I started another quick game, and her fingers moved again, their hesitancy slowly disappearing as she picked pace. In parallel, the naughty angle of her smile grew, showing she greatly enjoyed the new addition to our chess game.</p><p>Masterful.</p><p>“Focus on the game,” she murmured even as she dragged her finger over my erection, starting another game. Her smile grew as I shivered, her moves getting even more passionate — both physically, and in-game. </p><p>“As you wish,” I answered in exaggerated obedience as I leaned back, launching a strategy that was the exact opposite of my usual style. </p><p>A thick, complicated defensive net, similar to what I had used during the last game, one that she didn’t miss. “This style again? Why don’t you play defensive games more, you’re clearly good at them as well.” </p><p>“They are boring,” I said with a shrug, which wasn’t exactly inaccurate. The bigger problem was the amount of study such a style required, but even with my traits making that precondition much easier, it wasn’t a style that I enjoyed. “I approach chess defense like I approach football defense. You’re doing something wrong if your opponent doesn’t feel like a mistake would end up in a lot of pain.” </p><p>“Too bad you can’t simply tackle the loser in chess.” </p><p>“Usually, no,” I said with a chuckle as I looked at her with a naughty smile. “But certainly not always…” </p><p>Under my needy gaze, she turned her head shyly, but that didn’t prevent her fingers from moving even faster. </p><p>She continued playing, though as my ultra-defensive strategy proved to be impenetrable, the game extended to thirty moves, then forty, then fifty… That wasn’t particularly long for a game, and even playing blind wasn’t too much of a problem for someone at her level. </p><p>However, playing blind while splitting attention with her other task was much more difficult. And, I didn’t need to see her smoldering eyes to guess she had no intention of stopping that, no matter how harder that made her play. </p><p>“Maybe I should distract you better,” she whispered after another move, creating another useless attack. </p><p>“Maybe you should, if you can handle it,” I said, challenging her. She wasn’t a competitive person in daily situations, but that was different for chess. The frustration of losing three games in a row —  even with her solid excuse — was enough to overwhelm her usual shyness. </p><p>She didn’t answer as her position shifted. She sat next to me, which was not as amazing as her earlier position. Thankfully, she was quick to compensate, leaning down. Her hair sprawled, cutting my view, but that mattered very little as I felt a very particular wetness around my girth, showing her commitment to distracting me. </p><p>I didn’t bother to suppress the moan that found itself in my throat. I had no problem encouraging her. She pulled back momentarily to give her response before her pretty mouth wrapped around my shaft once more. </p><p>And just like that, our game fell into a beautiful balance, with me making defensive moves, and her trying to attack. Though, as the game continued, the distance between her moves got longer and longer, to the point that it would have cost her the game if we were using clocks. </p><p>Did I have any problem with that? Certainly not. Not when she was doing her absolute best to keep me entertained, and succeeding spectacularly. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, the same didn’t apply to the chess part, her moves getting more and more frantic. From a numerical point, she wasn’t too far behind, but as she surrendered the center of the board to me, her pieces locked to the sides with no hopes of ever attaining victory.</p><p>Absent of a monumental blunder from me. </p><p>She didn’t surrender, clearly putting her hopes off earning that blunder.  In her defense, she focused on creating that blunder very passionately, her lips going up and down without stopping. The game continued,  her lips were more interested in exploring my length than revealing her next move.  </p><p>I let her set the pace as she bobbed her head up and down, giving her a chance to savor the taste, letting out occasional moans to show just how good of work she was doing. </p><p>It might not be the most perfect blowjob I had ever received, but it was one of the rare things in life where enthusiasm always won over technique. And enthusiasm, she had in spades, her bobbing getting faster and faster, and the distance between the moves getting longer  — not to mention the quality coming down seriously. </p><p>Time had turned into a special construct, slow yet fast at the same time as the chess game turned into an even more insignificant prop for our fun, the occasional gags she let out as she experimented on her limits far more interesting than her lackluster moves.  </p><p>Soon, I could feel her lips passing the halfway mark around my shaft, her gags turning more commonplace. </p><p>A little help wouldn’t go amiss, I decided as I put my hand on her leg, climbing up, dragging the skirt along. She shivered as I arrived at the end of the fishnet and revealed her naked thigh. But it was clearly not that urgent considering she didn’t bother interrupting her task.  </p><p>That changed when I managed to push enough to reveal her panties. Initially, they were already transparent, and her growing wetness hardly helped to increase the coverage they provided, turning transparent. </p><p>“That —“ she whispered as she pulled back, only to turn into a beautiful moan after a strategic flick of my finger. </p><p>“What?” I asked. “I’m just using the same tactic. Don’t be angry just because I cheated as well.” </p><p>She looked at me, arousal and indignation battling, only to be ambushed by pleasure as I flicked my finger. “J-jerk,” she gasped, though her moan was more honest. </p><p>“Oh, let me show you how to cheat properly, then,” I whispered as I moved my fingers once more. She moved back to a sitting position, but her attempt to close her legs failed spectacularly, her trembling muscles rebelling against her orders. </p><p>“Knight to E-six,” I whispered into her ear even as I repositioned myself in front of her, my fingers dancing at her entrance, pushing the pleasure to the next stage. Her chest pushed out as her back arched, finally letting her blazer to the sides, giving a perfect view of her naked breasts and erect nipples, nicely framed by the black lace. </p><p>It took a while for her to manage a response, especially when I leaned forward to capture her nipple, my tongue dancing around, her moans rising. She managed to whisper a response only a minute later. </p><p>One that was objectively horrible, showing that it was time to finally finish that game. I stopped teasing her nipple for a moment, rising to whisper another move into her ear, one that locked her into an obvious defeat. </p><p>She didn’t give a response,  so I leaned down to kiss her neck, the gentle touch of my lips contrasting with the speedy dance of my fingers. </p><p>Her moans rose unbidden, explosive and loud, showing her immense confidence at the noise insulation of the penthouse. She moaned louder and louder, turning her voice into a great supplement to the amazing show her body was putting together. </p><p>Her chess move was delayed between her moans, not that I cared much about the little gap.  Her beautiful moans were much more interesting than the horrible caricature of a game that had long lost its meaning.  </p><p>She must have thought that as rather than trying to come up with a move, she let out a beautiful string of moans, ending up in a collapse as she leaned back, gasping and trembling. </p><p>“May I take this as a resignation?” I asked with a chuckle, receiving a gentle nod. “Excellent, then it’s time to get my reward” I whispered as I grabbed her panties. </p><p>Easily ripping them off with my enhanced strength, leaving her eyes widening.</p>
