        <p>I spent the rest of the month after the lucky break with the library wards alternatively between studying the precious information trove and practicing my new spells, pushing my lightning abilities to the limit. Luckily, I had two companions who were enthusiastic about dealing with all the stress resulting from studying. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one that saw incredible improvement in my power. Lillian had adapted to her new mana manipulation technique with great enthusiasm. According to her claims, it was like finally eating proper food after starving for days, even though I doubted she even starved in her life. Regardless of the accuracy of her metaphor, there was no doubt about her improvement. </p><p>Though in terms of improvement, Astrid’s record was far more impressive. Lillian got stronger, but she already had decent control over her magic, so her improvement, however impressive, was limited. Not so for Astrid, who never had systematic training. Having a holistic mana technique allowed her strength to skyrocket, to a point that she was able to strain Lillian during their practice duels, not to mention her own druidism-based skills had shown a marked improvement. </p><p>I doubted their improvement just because of their new mana technique, as I could still feel the connection between our magic whenever we had sex, but since I was unable to discover anything solid about it, only some fractured clues. </p><p>But our long retreat had other benefits, almost as important as the power improvement. After our long escape, it finally allowed us to relax, to a point that I was starting to hope the mystery of the mountain convinced Lillian’s kidnapper about our death. </p><p>And what a delicious retreat it was, I thought even as I pushed Lillian’s head down, forcing her to swallow more of my shaft while Astrid’s lips pressed against my neck, treating me with a delicious massage. She gagged and gasped around my girth, but after a month filled with debauchery, she was showing impressive ease as she swallowed me deep enough for her nose to press against my skin. </p><p>“Demolish this bitch,” Astrid murmured gleefully between kisses, her naked tits deliciously pressing against my back. </p><p>“Still bitter about the duel,” I countered, which earned a hard bite on the soft skin that connected my neck to my shoulder. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” I warned her even as I pushed deeper into Lillian’s throat, her grip soft and snug. Another stab of pain hit me, this time with Lillian digging her fingers to my leg, trying to regain my attention. I pulled her hair hard, but she only moaned harder, her blue eyes shining with pleasure whenever she was able to crack them open. </p><p>“Please,” Lillian begged as I pulled her hair, forcing her to stand up. Astrid was quick to take her position while I made eye contact with Lillian, her huge tits wrapped around my wet shaft, the crown captured between her lips. “Slut,” she murmured, looking at Astrid with playful anger. </p><p>Astrid didn’t even bother to use her words to answer her, scoffing lightly when she slid her fingers inside Lillian, easily invading her depths with three. Lillian moaned, which earned another derisive chuckle from Astrid as she collapsed next to her. </p><p>Astrid pulled her fingers out of her wetness, only to plunge them into Lillian’s mouth. Lillian moaned with glee. “Yeah,” I commented in amusement. “Clearly, Astrid is the only slut here.” </p><p>“Shut up,” Lillian managed to stammer as Astrid alternating between dipping her fingers inside her forcing her to lick. She was already charged with the earlier deep throating, and the familiar invasion of Astrid’s fingers worked wonders. Soon, her song changed. “Harder,” she begged. </p><p>It was another facet of our growing relationship that Astrid didn’t reject her, or tried to mock her for her weakness, instead teasing her core mercilessly. She had learned her lesson the hard way that what came around went around, thanks to an hour-long edge-play from Lillian while she begged for a release. </p><p>But when Lillian collapsed backward, trembling, her legs parted open, I had no more time for amusing introspection. Instead, I gestured Astrid to pull back, and took my position between her legs, my shaft widening her entrance. </p><p>Astrid kissed me furiously while I stopped pushing, just enjoying the position. Lillian tried to push herself forward —which was hard with her trembling body— when I actually pulled back, maintaining the status quo. </p><p>“Please,” Lillian begged, while we stopped the kiss and looked at her mockingly. “Please push your giant weapon inside me, ravage me, invade me-” Lillian begged. I was curious how long I could make her beg this time, but Astrid silenced her by sitting on her face. </p><p>“Loud bitch, isn’t s-SHE!” Astrid tried to mock her, only to end with a cry of her own as Lillian’s tongue traced her entrance. After a month of leisure sex sessions, Lillian had learned many tricks to silence Astrid as well.  </p><p>Still, based on the loudness of Astrid’s cries, I could see that Lillian was pulling all the stops, the magic in her tongue thick enough to be noticed as well. “Such a dedicated slut,” I mocked, and Lillian moaned in anticipation as I started pushing into her wet slit. </p><p>I gripped Astrid’s tits, enjoying their firmness as well as her cries getting louder, appreciating my involvement as much as Lillian enjoyed my thick girth forcing her to widen once more. </p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck!” Astrid moaned as she struggled under our combined assault, joining Lillian’s muffled yelps as I pounded her hard enough to make the bed crack dangerously. I even stopped to cast a repair spell just to make sure the bed that suffered under such a heavy strain for the last month would survive our naked cuddling afterward. Sleeping together had become a norm, which added a domestic twist to our otherwise extraordinary life. </p><p>Weirdly, I enjoyed it almost as much as I enjoyed drilling Lillian mercilessly while she licked Astrid to an explosive climax. I alternatively quickened and slowed down, making her struggle even more poignant, her wetness dripping down to drench the bed, while Astrid’s juices covered her face. </p><p>“Damn, I’m getting close,” Astrid moaned, her pouty lips begging for a kiss, which I was happy to fulfill. I kissed her hard, my tongue dancing inside her mouth while Lillian’s tongue danced inside her. </p><p>Under attack from both sides, it didn’t take long for her body to lose its tightness, and she collapsed next to Lillian, gasping and trembling. “W-weak-” Lillian tried to mock her, only to stop when I leaned down to steal a kiss, ravaging her mouth while enjoying Astrid’s remaining aroma.  </p><p>“I’m going to turn you into a mess,” I promised her between kisses. </p><p>“And I’m going to drain you until you are nothing more than a shriveled husk, kept for my amusement,” she moaned as I exploded into her, which triggered another climax. “I love when you fill me up,” she moaned even as I lay between them, enjoying their heat as I recovered. </p><p>Despite Astrid collapsing earlier, I was up before her. “I want you on all fours,” I ordered Astrid. </p><p>“So he can fuck you like the bitch you are,” Lillian gasped, but moaned in appreciation when Astrid positioned herself so that she could devour the cum sliding out of Lillian, that playful annoyance was replaced by enthusiasm. </p><p>I started thrusting inside her, when fate decreed a change of pace. </p><p>I was pounding Astrid mercilessly while she munched Lillian’s treasure, when she gasped in a type of pain that didn’t belong to our bedroom. “D-danger,” she stammered as I pulled out of her and helped her to stand up. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” I asked even as I put my hand on her head and let my magic mingle with hers, feeling the turbulence of her magic, followed by another difficult trick. I let my mana mix with hers to calm her turbulence. “Tell me,” I said. </p><p>“A-attackers,” she murmured. “They killed a totem wolf before I could react.”  </p><p>Lillian gasped in panic, but calmed when I grabbed her hand. It was a testament to our growing relationship that I could calm her with just a touch. Then, I focused back on Astrid. “Warriors from the tribes?” I asked hopefully even though I knew it wouldn’t be the case. </p><p>“No, the legionaries,” she answered, her voice still strained. “The wolf was killed before I could get a better view of their numbers.” </p><p>I nodded even as I stood up, even as I thanked Eros for our luck. While the mountain was an amazing place to hide thanks to its chaotic magic, it was not without its drawbacks, the biggest being the impossibility of setting any kind of warding. The city had its own wards, of course, but they were erected by an impressive number of sorcerers working in tandem, after spending decades working for the most famous general whose reputation owed quite a bit to the quality of his temporary magical forts.</p><p>We were lucky when we discovered the magical storm didn’t interact as strongly with Astrid’s nature-based abilities. It wasn’t a complete immunity, of course. With her improved powers, Astrid could easily maintain total control of dozens of animals after she acquired them through a ritual. Outside of the wards, however, she could barely connect with half a dozen, with no chance to actually give them command through the interference. Despite all its limitations, it gave us what we needed, an early warning system. </p><p>“It’s time,” I warned them as I dashed toward the pile of clothes and put on my leather pants and tunic, both made from the skin of the ethereal wolves, giving me a limited magical resistance. I doubted it would match the enchanted armor of the centurions, but it was better than nothing. </p><p>“Maybe we should come with you,” Lillian offered as she dressed as well. </p><p>“No, we talked about this. There’s no chance that they are risking to explore this place without a sorcerer, and having you girls there will limit me tactically. With the magical nature of the mountain running interference, trying to ambush them is the best tactic, but if it doesn’t work, I will lead them away from the city. I can’t guarantee that they wouldn’t order some of the stronger mages to spread around.” </p><p>“I remember, ambush them using the wards, and never let them retreat,” Lillian answered. </p><p>“Exactly. I don’t know who is trying to kidnap you, but regardless, but just the presence of the city in such a unique environment is a treasure no one could reject, not to mention the treasures hidden inside, or the collection in the library. If discovered, we can never defend against the forces that would come for it.” </p><p>“We’re not losing this place,” Astrid stated determinedly as she stood up, pushing through her magical headache through sheer willpower, and despite the dangerous situation, I rewarded her with a kiss. It was a mistake, as her voluptuous —and very naked— body was very hard to pull away from. </p><p>“Careful,” I reminded them one last time, kissed Lillian as well before I departed for battle. </p><p>It was time to test the limits of my learning. </p>
