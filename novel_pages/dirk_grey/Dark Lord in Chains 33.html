        <p>I was feeling rather exhausted after watching Queen Sapphire walk away after our interesting negotiation. Luckily, she was as exhausted as I was, which made it very unlikely for her to check my cell. So, I stayed in the private room for a long nap, enjoying the forgotten feeling of sleeping on a bed rather than the hard stone floor of my cell. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t dare to ignore the sunrise, and left the room early after a quick breakfast rather than lazing around, a luxury I sorely missed, and slipped back to the secret tunnel that connected the club to the palace, intent on returning to my cell. </p><p>That intention didn’t survive for long, overwhelmed by the temptation as I passed in front of Aria’s room. </p><p>A simple flare of magic was enough to disarm the protective wards that isolated the crown princess’s room from the dangerous darkness of the secret tunnel, and I walked in. </p><p>Aria was sleeping on her bed, buried among the white covers, which had slipped just down enough to reveal her pale shoulder for my hungry gaze. She was beautiful and helpless, a sleeping beauty waiting for her prince to wake her up. Unfortunately, she didn’t get a prince, but a dark lord. </p><p>Though, her luck all wasn’t bad. I could have slipped in her bed to wake her up in an erotic manner, but that would have been rude of me. She was being such a nice sport accepting the change between us, so much that she deserved a reward. </p><p>So much that I decided to surprise her pleasantly. </p><p>I moved toward the rest of her private wing. Being the princess had perks, one being a dedicated room complex that was essentially a small house, including a dedicated, well-stocked kitchen to serve her private guests. Such rooms existed so that royal children could keep their political ploys concealed from any spy that might be hidden among the kitchen staff. </p><p>And for me, it gave me the chance to prepare a nice breakfast spread. </p><p>I started whistling softly as I grabbed a knife and a few ingredients, before starting to chop them in a manner that would make a professional chef jealous. It was partly about my combat skills bleeding, but it mostly came from the earlier days of my climb to the power, where I disguised myself as a chef to assassinate several of my opponents in one big feast.  </p><p>And now, I was using those skills to create a delicious breakfast for Aria. Though, I had to admit, as I whisked and chopped and fried, I felt oddly calm. It had been years since I had done anything that could be remotely classified as a domestic task, and it gave me a weird sense of accomplishment. </p><p>Admittedly, it might be more about the fact that I was cooking in the heart of the Empire rather than the act of simple cooking, but I decided not to waste too much time on that particular fact. </p><p>Half an hour later, I walked back to Aria’s bedroom, this time carrying a tray filled with a delicious smelling omelet,  freshly squeezed fruit juice, and a spread of other freshly prepared food. And since I was pushing it to a different point, I put a beautiful pink flower in the center to add a bit of color. </p><p>I woke Aria up with a gentle kiss to the lips. “Good morning, sleepyhead,” I murmured. </p><p>Her eyes fluttered open with a dazed smile, only for her gaze to widen when she realized it was me who woke her up. “B-Byron,” she stammered in shock as she got up. The covers slid down as she did so, revealing her misaligned nightie. It was a white piece, one that would have been conservative if it was fitting perfectly, but with a couple of buttons open and not properly fitting to her shoulders, it showed a tempting cleavage. </p><p>“It’s breakfast time,” I said with a smirk even as I raised the tray. “I hope you like fruit juice in the morning. Or would you prefer a cup of tea?”</p><p>“J-juice is fine,” she stammered, unable to erase the incredulous expression on her face. “Is this - is this all for me?”</p><p>“Nothing less than you deserve, sweetheart,” I said even as I caressed her cheek gently, adding a domestic quality to the moment. She blushed furiously under my touch. “I assumed you would be hungry after working hard yesterday.” </p><p>The remainder of the exhausting threesome we shared the earlier day didn’t help her blush any. “But how?” she stammered. “Did you ask a maid to cook?” Her panic was justified, as even if I managed to hide my identity, the fact that there was an unknown male in the princess’ room, asking for breakfast would have been excellent rumor mill material. More importantly, it might bring the fury of the Queen. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I cooked them myself,” I said with a smug smile. </p><p>“Made everything? You can cook?” she asked in shock. </p><p>“I’m a man of surprising depth,” I answered even as I placed the tray in front of her and sat next to her. Just to push the domestic angle further, I grabbed a piece of fruit and raised it for her to bite. She did so, using the chewing as an opportunity to think. Unfortunately, she wasn’t really good at dealing with surprises, and finding the scary dark lord next to her bed, feeding her breakfast was understandably surprising. </p><p>The silence stretched for a while as I hand-fed her, and she stayed on the bed obediently, being fed. As she got used to the shocking nature of the moment, however, her chewing got faster. Clearly, yesterday’s exertion helped her appetite quite a bit. She started fighting a growing smile, only to fail spectacularly, creating a stupidly adorable scene. </p><p>When I sat next to her, she leaned against my chest, enhancing the domestic quality of the scene. She fought off a smile, only to fail miserably as she enjoyed my cooking. She was so endearingly adorable, tempting me to push her down and use her bed the way it was destined to, having a repeat of yesterday's adventure in a more intense manner, but I kept myself back. I had worn her out plenty, so she needed the breakfast.</p><p>“So, it seems that you worked up quite an appetite, princess,” I said cheerfully as she took another bite. “You’re lucky that I’m here to help you burn that off to protect your delicious figure.” </p><p>She blushed prettily. “Help me burn off? How?” she asked. </p><p>“Really,” I said even as I let my arm around her waist tighten. “You don’t have an idea how I’m going to help you burn off?” </p><p>She tried to make eye contact, only to fail after the barest contact. “Maybe I do,” she whispered. </p><p>I said nothing, but helped her bite a piece of fruit, while simultaneously kissing her neck, making her shiver. After that, the silence stretched, while she enjoyed the double assault of the delicious taste of the food I prepared and my gentle caresses. </p><p>I outdid myself. </p><p>She nuzzled against my chest as the breakfast was about to finish. “It feels nice,” she whispered as she buried her face in the crook of my neck and rested her chin on my shoulder, taking a deep breath. Luckily, I smelled rather nice after the pampering I received in the club, affecting her even more. </p><p>Not wanting to destroy the domestic quality of the moment, I smiled and wrapped my arm around her while brushing my lips across her cheek. </p><p>She whispered something, which was too soft even for me to hear despite our closeness as she tilted her head. Then, without any prompting, she pressed her lips to mine, initiating a tender, lingering kiss.</p><p>The kiss lasted for a while before she pulled back, trying to act like nothing extraordinary had happened despite her furious blush. To deflect, she focused on her breakfast once more, attacking the remaining scraps with surprising enthusiasm, even as she leaned against me for full support.  </p><p>I toyed with her hair for a while before pushing it aside to run my lips over the back of her neck. She shivered helplessly as she continued to eat her breakfast. Meanwhile, I was getting more and more tempted to devour her. “So, are you getting full, or do you need any help?” I asked, and she shivered again. The fact that she could recognize the innuendo was a huge improvement compared to innocence before she fell into my not-so-tender mercies. </p><p>“So, do you have any plans for the day?” I asked. </p><p>“N-not particularly, no,” she stammered. </p><p>“Hmm, good to hear,” I whispered. “I can think of a few things to keep you busy for the day.” </p><p>She said nothing, but the fact that she let herself buried into my arms indicated that she might not be against the idea. She played with the cutlery distractedly as I kissed down her neck, letting my breath fall on her shoulder. </p><p>She giggled cutely, before her shyness dominated her once more and she fell silent. For a while, she maintained that silence before speaking. “What do you want to drink?” she asked as she suddenly pulled out of my arms as she was suddenly overwhelmed by the tenderness of the moment. </p><p>“I wouldn’t say no to a delicious cup of tea,” I said, giving her some time to recover from the tenderness of the moment. She left, taking the tray with her as well, and I lay on her bed, enjoying the comfort. The bed back in the private room was nice, but unsurprisingly, the quality was not comparable to the luxury in the royal quarters. </p><p>Aria disappeared for a longer time than I had expected. She walked back in fifteen minutes later, just as I was considering whether to follow her. Though, the sight I met was more than enough to compensate for her disappearance. Apparently, she had a change of clothing in the meanwhile. </p><p>She was still wearing a nightie, but unlike the previous functional long white nightie, she was wearing a black negligee, both too short and too thin to sleep in it comfortably. It didn’t display cleavage, but with her amazing breasts stretching the surface, the lack of cleavage didn’t hurt her sexiness in any way. </p><p>She avoided looking at me, keeping her eyes firmly on the tray she was carrying as she walked closer. The way her already short negligee rode up high enough to reveal her absolute lack of underwear awakened a rather urgent erection. </p><p>All that remained was, how to proceed. Sweet, aggressive, or even, a walk in the royal gardens… </p>
