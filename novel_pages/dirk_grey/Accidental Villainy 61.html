        <p>“Why so surprised —” she started, which was all she was able to say before I grabbed her wrist and pulled her to my lap, delivering a short yet searing kiss. </p><p>“W-wow,” she stammered with a beautiful expression of shock, though hers was more interesting than mine. As she sat on my lap, I enjoyed her smell. </p><p>“Looks like I’m not the only one that’s shocked,” I answered. It was fun to reverse the situation after letting her get one victory. “But, I can always shock you more…” I added, but the cute brunette waitress returned. </p><p>I didn’t need my observation to notice she had unbuttoned her shirt somewhat to get a better cleavage to bait for more tips. A good indicator that she was a poor waitress, considering she used that tactic while I was waiting for a date. </p><p>Maybe she just assumed Emily wouldn’t arrive soon, and wanted to try if she could bait for more tips. Either way, her expression was beautiful. I said nothing to Emily about our waitress to hide the fact I noticed her. Instead, I kissed Emily again before pulling back, allowing her to catch a glimpse of our voyeur. </p><p>I was curious about how she would react, by hesitation, or by daring. </p><p>The moment she noticed the waitress, she pulled back, her eyes widening. I tightened my eyes enough to make her think I closed them, giving her a chance to process the fact that our kiss, far too naughty for a public space due to her blouse, was being watched by a stranger. </p><p>She might be an exhibitionist, but she had also been shy enough to not dare explore that part of hers before we met, so I wasn’t sure how she would react to a real-life presence. At the same time, I watched the gaze of the waitress from the mirror. </p><p>Was what I had been doing necessary for Emily’s eventual recruitment. Certainly not, but I had spent most of my day walking around the electronics stores and digging through both the new and second-hand offerings to hide the source of my purchases. It had been a long and annoying afternoon. </p><p>I deserved some entertainment. </p><p>Emily and the waitress locked eyes for a moment. Emily looked shocked, which added to her beauty with the state of her blouse. The waitress was caught flatfooted. Slut, she mouthed to Emily, but there was no hiding her jealousy. Interesting. I didn’t expect our short contact to develop into a small crush… </p><p>Though, as I watched their silent stand-off, I realized it was less about the slight crush she might have developed toward the generous customer, and more about a personal hang-up. As she watched us, her gaze drifted to the left upward with a dazed expression, while her expression flashed with a momentary anger. </p><p>She was remembering something of her past. No wonder she reacted to the situation that badly. Interesting. I couldn’t help but wonder exactly what had been going on. </p><p>I expected Emily to flinch, but instead, her smile grew as she grabbed my head and pulled to her bosom, reacting to the waitress’ challenge more explosively than I expected. The waitress’s face blanched, her memories doing wonders. </p><p>Entertaining indeed. </p><p>Being buried in Emily’s incredible bosom made it harder to observe my surroundings, but not entirely impossible. I could still hear the waitress’ footsteps, hitting the floor harder than necessary, yet her gait was shorter than her usual walk. She wanted to confront Emily, but she was afraid to do so. </p><p>She came to an abrupt stop a couple of paces from us, and after a momentary silence that was only broken by her hands moving, no doubt making some gestures, she walked away, apparently disconcerted. Even with my power, I wasn’t able to read the gestures by the sounds they made, but luckily, the situation wasn’t hard to decipher. She tried to intimidate Emily, failed, and retreated. </p><p>I wondered if she would have made a move if she hadn’t been risking the promised six-hundred-dollar tip. </p><p>I stayed buried in Emily’s bosom, content to act passively while Emily enjoyed the stage I had set for her to fulfill her exhibitionist kink. </p><p>Even I hadn’t expected things to evolve this way, certainly not this quick. </p><p>Emily let me go only when the waitress had turned away, leaving us alone in the relatively concealed corner. “Not that I was complaining, but what was that for?” I asked, acting like I didn’t even notice the waitress. </p><p>That earned a smug smile from Emily, happy that she distracted me enough to completely conceal the waitress’s presence. “I just missed you,” she said as she finally left my lap, and took her own seat. She closed two of the buttons for her blouse, turning it back to merely erotic instead of downright obscene. </p><p>“Maybe I should keep you away for a few days more, and see what kind of greeting I would get,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“Well, maybe I should stay away and see!” she admonished me, but it was just for show. </p><p>“Staying away will be hard, but rewards might be worth it,” I said, letting my gaze devour her beauty. She played with her hair, her blonde locks landing on her cleavage. </p><p>“You seem to be fascinated by my … hair,” she teased. </p><p>“What can I say, you have excellent … hair,” I responded. “An excellent pair.” </p><p>“You’re so bad,” she chuckled, though her tone was louder than usual, making sure the waitress heard it as well. We chatted for a while. While I called her for an important mission, there was no harm in delaying it more. It would feed her ego that she was able to make me forget a critical issue. </p><p>I cared about the mission, but not as much as converting her to my side full-time. With continuing to collapse, superpowered tech support was an invaluable potential… </p><p>And, it wasn’t like a date with a sexy blonde that was in the process of discovering her sexuality was some kind of great torture. </p><p>She smirked when we heard the footsteps, ready for the next confrontation with her accidental rival. It was different than her usual smile. Arrogant, yet sexy. It was also fragile, as if she was trying a new dress at the tailor before adjustments. Eager yet hesitant, ready to slip away at the slightest tremble, more show than substance, yet promising. It did interesting things to her lips. </p><p>I liked her new smirk. </p><p>Paradoxically, I liked her expression just as much when that smirk faded just as quickly, leaving only fragility behind. </p><p>The reason: our waitress. </p><p>Honestly, if it wasn’t for my experience hiding my true feelings, which had been perfected against deadly villains that would have no problems killing me if they caught a glimpse of the truth, it would have been difficult for me to hold back. </p><p>She had changed her clothes. Gone was the sensible jeans and shirt combo, replaced by a set of gym clothes, the kind that was designed not for people that actually exercised, but people that decided to treat gyms as a location to share their sexy photos. </p><p>It was supposed to be a simple combo of yoga pants and a crop top with spaghetti straps. Relatively modest, if it was not for one important detail. They didn’t belong to her, but someone with more modest curves. Therefore, the elastic of the yoga pants stretched to the limit, to the point that it turned slightly transparent, so that, even without my power, I could easily spot her lack of underwear. </p><p>Daring. </p><p>Her top was the same. It was already designed to leave the stomach of the wearer bare and stick tightly to not to impede the movement, but since they were designed for someone with smaller tits, it stretched badly, and the cleavage was deeper than intended. Her rock-hard nipples didn’t make its job any easier. </p><p>As she walked closer, her gaze was turned to Emily, answering her earlier challenge.</p><p>I had to admit, she was beautiful, but just like Emily, her confidence barely hid the fragility behind her. As she approached, I continued to read her attitude, making some conclusions about her past. Her talent at music, combined with her reaction to Emily — and a hundred little details that were picked by my power — told a cliche story. </p><p>She almost certainly experienced an ugly duckling story. She had gone most of her childhood and teenage years with relative invisibility, and focused on her instrument to combat her loneliness. Then, at some point, probably near her graduation date, she started to change, thinking that she could join the clique of the beautiful now that she was one, but learned that the popular people circle was far more merciless. </p><p>I was mostly sure that she started dating one of the popular boys, only to catch him together with a blonde cheerleader with certain … assets. Probably from an angle that was similar to ours, which would explain her visceral reaction. </p><p>I was also sure that she had another waitress inside who knew the story, and just goaded her to change and teach ‘that bitch’ a lesson. </p><p>Once again, as she approached, I was fascinated. Not by her beauty — though it was certainly admirable — but how much people had revealed about their past when they were frustrated and angry. I decided to tease them further, to see what else I could discover. </p><p>Was that the best way to train my power? Maybe, or maybe not? </p><p>But it was the most entertaining one. </p>
