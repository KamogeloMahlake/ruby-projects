        <p>As Mary looked at the intertwined bodies of her host and her … friend, she didn’t know how to feel. Disappointment battled with arousal. </p><p>“I can’t believe I had slept through this,” she murmured as the said disappointment invaded her whole being. Not because she was suddenly worrying about Darion’s chastity — the way they met permanently removed that option, not that she was delusional enough to think she could tame a man like him — but because she missed watching the show. </p><p>Watching a shy older woman learning the taste of a proper fucking would have been an incredible show. She said that she missed it. </p><p>“Oh, I wonder what kind of an expression you have made, Miss Fatima,” Mary murmured, getting more and more excited as she imagined her bent over the couch, being taken, her body posed invitingly. It would have been an excellent opportunity to join </p><p>“Luckily, that’s not the only thing I could do,” she murmured as she got rid of her panties. Then, she let her hand drag down and let her fingers disappear between her legs, the touch enough to make her shiver intensely with the view in front of her. </p><p>Even if she was still a bit sore after the fucking she received the night before. </p><p>“I wonder just how loud your moans were, Fatima,” Mary moaned desperately as she played with herself desperately, her legs losing strength soon. She needed to eat something, she was revenously hungry … but not enough to stop her fun. </p><p>She barely managed to throw herself on the seat, enjoying the way her fingers disappeared into her core, her wetness incredible. She felt like she was lost in her mind as she played with herself like a desperate nerd who never had any fun.</p><p>But the last night felt so distant with the show in front of her, unable to qualify the situation she found herself in. It felt like a dream, one that she didn’t dare to wake off. </p><p>Not because she was afraid of Fatima’s reaction, unlike the last night. Then, she had been afraid of her reaction, thinking that if she had been caught, she would kick her out and forced her to find a new place. Paying for rent would be bad enough … especially since it would replace the mansion she was living in with a shitty one-bedroom apartment at best. </p><p>No, she was afraid of waking them up, because she was afraid of Darion. The pool adventure had been fun, but also left her throughly used, and she was afraid that, if she managed to wake Darion up, she would find herself dealing with a task she couldn’t handle. </p><p>It was much better to leave that amazing morning wood to the exotic beauty he was hugging.</p><p>But those thoughts quickly fell to the wayside as she continued to push, invading her core inch by inch with her fingers, the phenomenal level of wetness she managed to acquire was the only thing that was keeping the pain away.</p><p>She knew she should stop, but the struggle only made it better.  </p><p>Yet, she found herself opening her legs even more, turning into a show. She wondered what would Fatima say if she had gotten caught. </p><p>“I wonder if you get away running or join,” Mary commented, her hands desperately dancing on her body as she rode toward an orgasm … one that came far quicker than she thought to be possible. </p><p>But then, she never played with herself while enjoying such a spectacular visual feast. </p><p>Even with the pain that accompanied it, it was the greatest solo pleasure she had ever felt, and she found it impossible to stop halfway. </p><p>Turning her into an observer in her own body, until her cries exploded. </p><p>She expected Fatima to wake up, but she continued to lay on the couch, still sleeping. “Pity,” Mary murmured, slightly disappointed that the accident hadn’t happened. </p><p>As she walked around, she was still unable to pull herself from the gaze. “Maybe I should wake you up,” Mary murmured as she leaned forward, her fingers wrapping around his shaft, aware of the risk she was taking. However, the temptation to feel his monster, standing attention in the morning, was simply too tempting to ignore. </p><p>It twitched in her hand, and she froze for a moment, afraid — and excited — that she had woken up the sleeping giant. </p><p>It was not the case.  </p><p>“Too bad you missed the chance to fuck me, sir,” she murmured, and shame hit once more as she slowly pulled back. Just like a desperate virgin, she was teasing a sleeping man … For a moment, she thought there was an earthquake, but it turned out to be her trembling legs, and without the couch to hold on to, she would have fallen painfully. </p><p>“That was fun, visit again, and maybe this time, you can fuck me properly,” Mary murmured, feeling naughty as she walked away, aware that she could never dare to give that challenge if he was awake. </p><p>Then, she walked away … unaware of his naughty smirk, promising exactly that. </p>
