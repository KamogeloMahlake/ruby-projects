        <p>As she watched her boss’ sister rush toward her with anger, Sakura wanted to follow her first instinct and apologize. Only the presence of Darion behind her stopped her. Not because she expected him to protect her … but because she was frozen after getting squeezed between two direct aspects. </p><p>What if he got angry if she tried to argue. As much as Lily scared her — mostly due to her sister’s power — it was nothing compared to the sheer desire to obey that Darion awakened in her. </p><p>That didn’t mean she was happy by the way Lily grabbed her neck and pulled her away. “You bitch, how dare you,” she growled in anger. </p><p>“I’m … I’m sorry,” Sakura apologized, giving the easiest and most convenient answer she could deliver. The moment she noticed Darion’s mocking smirk, she wished she could say something else, but her instincts to obey were simply too strong. </p><p>And she hated herself for it. </p><p>“Do you even know what you are sorry for, you blue-haired whore,” Lily growled, roughly forcing her to turn. She faced the cafe, mostly naked. “You’re lucky that we don’t have a guest that could watch your humiliation,” she added. “Now, tell me, what are you sorry for?” </p><p>Lily froze. She realized the answer she had been expecting, but it was not one she could give. She was not sorry by the way she got caught … as she was obeying her real boss during that. She was just sorry that she had to suffer a direct confrontation. </p><p>Nothing else. </p><p>She didn’t know if Lily was trying to date or seduce Darion … but it didn’t matter. It wouldn’t have even mattered if they were married. “Speak, you little whore,” she growled, her anger getting thicker. </p><p>Ironically, that made Sakura less likely to actually follow her command. The shift in her tone reminded Sakura that Lily was not Mia. She wasn’t her boss who could cut her down with just a word and destroy her sense of worth … </p><p>Lily was just a petulant child. </p><p>As that realization hit, she caught Darion’s gaze, watching the show with a rare smile, clearly enjoying her struggle. A struggle that she didn’t need to lose, Sakura suddenly realized. </p><p>As she realized that, however, Lily started to act even rougher. “I asked you a question, bitch,” she growled, trying to replace her lack of control with physical violence … too bad it had even less of an effect on Sakura. </p><p>She was not bad in self-defense, and her weak grab was nothing compared to some of the hits she received during sparring. It was her habits rather than her lack of physical capability that prevented her from resisting while Lily pushed her down to her knees. “Stay there and sulk if you’re not going to speak,” she ordered. </p><p>Lily wanted to stand up and resist. She was even determined as she shifted, but once she looked up to see her confident pose, that determination died quickly. “Lick my feet if you want to apologize,” she ordered. </p><p>Sakura fidgeted under her gaze, but managed to resist … for a total of three seconds. Then, her hands rebelled, and she grabbed her feet and delivered a soft kiss to the topside of her foot. </p><p>“Show your enthusiasm,” Lily ordered, giving her a good, long stare. Sakura could see that she was shocked by her obedience as well, but pushing happily as she failed to order. Sakura continued kissing her feet. </p><p>“That’s enough dilly-dallying. Now, let’s go to your real punishment,” Lily ordered, but her voice was already panting, showing her desire as she pulled her toward her wet lips. Sakura started licking … ironically, every moan Lily let out weakened the hold she had over Sakura. </p><p>She was about to get free from her incompetent dominance…</p><p>Any moment now.</p>
