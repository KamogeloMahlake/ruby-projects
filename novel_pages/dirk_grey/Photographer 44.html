        <p>I woke up to the sound of a doorbell that I didn’t expect. </p><p>Under normal circumstances, being woken up by an unexpected visitor was certainly not a pleasant experience. Waking up on a couch wasn’t supposed to help as a flashback to the unlucky time after I had lost my job. </p><p> Yet, the couch didn’t feel as bad as it was supposed to feel. For once, the painful back pain that plagued me in those times was absent thanks to the amazing quality of the couch that I was lying on, one that was significantly better than my current bed. </p><p>Still, the great comfort of the couch was nothing compared to my amazing blanket, one that was amazingly comfortable even though it was significantly heavier. A beautiful, blonde blanket.  </p><p>It was good to see Penny had other abilities than being an excellent model. </p><p>I shuffled in place, feeling the soft weight of her beautiful breasts against my chest. But before I could close my eyes again and fall back to sleep, the doorbell rang again, putting a snag into my plan.</p><p>It seemed that I had a determined visitor. I decided to stand up and answer the door before the girls woke up as well, when my plan hit another snag. This time, it came in the form of her beautiful globes pushing against my palms, tempting me to stay on the couch rather than stand up to answer the door. </p><p>They made a compelling argument, especially when combined with the amazing strength of my morning wood. </p><p>Yet, the doorbell rang once again, ruining that little plan. This time, it even managed to wake Penny up. </p><p>Unlike me, her first reaction was too look shocked and panicked, though a quick kiss worked wonders to remove her momentary panic. Then, the doorbell rang again, the presence of an impending visitor enough to resurrect the shy parts of her personality. “Are we expecting any guests?” she managed to stammer as she pulled back panickedly, looking around to find her robe. </p><p>“I don’t remember any,” I answered, but I couldn’t help but have a niggling feeling that I was forgetting something. “It must be a mistake,” I said as I squeezed her breasts. “But since we’re already awake … why don’t we start with a morning exercise,” I suggested as I squeezed her breasts, which earned a delicious moan, showing she wasn’t entirely against the idea. </p><p>The doorbell rang yet again, showing that our visitor was rather determined. </p><p>“Give me a moment to send them away first, sweetheart,” I whispered as I grabbed her waist to lift her, easily depositing her next to me. “Why don’t you put on your robe while I send away our impatient visitor to prevent any accidental glance, and we can focus on our morning exercise when I return,” I said, my smirk getting bigger. “Not to mention, I love slowly getting rid of them.” </p><p>Then, I walked toward the door while Penny was busy blushing. </p><p>My annoyance didn’t survive for long, when I looked from the peephole, only to see a familiar face. </p><p>The brunette from the reception, one that I promised to have a test shoot in the morning. </p><p>I was tempted to reject her and go back to help Penny exercise, but the peeping hole give a view wide enough to reveal not only her cute face but also her striking dressing — a naughty crop top and a skirt that was significantly shorter than reasonable for a first-time visit too a stranger’s room — was good enough to change my mind. </p><p>The cart she was pushing, filled with some very expensive silver trays, was just a bonus. A nice one, of course. She clearly had a reason for her early appearance. </p><p>I turned to Penny, who was just pulling her robe on. I waited for a second, enjoying the glimpse of her nude body before speaking. “Oh, I forget that I promised to have a test shoot with an aspiring model. Our morning exercise needs to be canceled,” I said, which made Penny reflect a look of disappointment. </p><p>Normally, a petulant look like that wouldn’t have been an attractive attitude, but like most things in life, it looked significantly better on a barely-dressed busty blonde, trying to stuff her beautiful body into a robe that was too small for her amazing curves, a blush of arousal on her face. </p><p>“We have two options,” I decided to explain. “First, you can go to the bedroom and continue sleeping…” </p><p>“And what’s the second option,” she asked, rather quickly. </p><p>“You can stay here and help me assess the new model,” I whispered, my tone leaving no doubt about the limits of the things I had in mind. “Would you be interested in that?” </p><p>Penny didn’t say anything, too busy blushing, but the fact she was still sitting was sufficient as an answer. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said before I turned my attention back to my new visitor. </p><p>“Good morning,” I said as I opened the door, facing a cute brunette, blushing as she realized I was only wearing a robe. “I hope nothing is wrong. We don’t need to check out early, do we?”</p><p>“N-no, not at all,” she managed to stammer. “I t-thought you could use a breakfast, complimentary!”  </p><p>“How kind,” I answered, intrigued by her stammer. She had been much more confident while she was in the reception. A part of it could be blamed to change of meeting location, from public to private, and the importance of the way I dressed, only a robe, was hard to deny. </p><p>Yet, there was something else as well. </p><p>“Please come in,” I said as I took a step back, gesturing her to walk in. She did, pushing the cart as well. Naturally, when she entered, the first thing she noticed was Penny, wearing a robe that was already too small for her beautiful curves before ceaselessly ruffling and displacing it in our little game. </p><p>I had no doubt that her face was contorted with a beautiful panic, but since she was frozen in shock and looking the other way, a casual observer like our aspiring receptionist could mistake that for dismissal. </p><p>“I-I shouldn’t interrupt,” she murmured as she pushed the cart panickedly before turned back. </p><p>“Where’s the hurry,” I said as I gestured for her to stay, not willing to miss such a beautiful moment and opportunity. “Penny and I can’t really finish all of it together. If you don’t have anything to do, why don’t you stay and help us?” I offered. </p><p>“I…” she murmured as she glanced at Penny, her eyes wide. Penny still looked the other way, inadvertently giving the impression of haughtiness. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you have work to do, you’re clearly out of your work clothes, so your shift should be over.”  </p><p>“It… It is,” she whispered as she closed her eyes, doubtlessly measuring the perks and challenges of making such a choice. She then opened her eyes and glanced around, focusing on Penny for a moment before her gaze slipped toward the half-open bedroom door, the angle just enough to notice the naked leg of an exhausted Nancy. </p><p>It was a rather exaggerated view about my approach of mixing business and pleasure. While I certainly enjoyed seducing the models I had worked with, I had never actually used that as a condition for their job. It only cheapened the beauty of the conquest.  </p><p>She was more than free to reject my advances, as long as she was a good model, I would continue work with them — which was, I had to admit, a rarity in the industry. </p><p>And, in my current persona-non-grata state, I was more than willing to drop the skill requirements for my models as well. As long as a model was beautiful and enthusiastic, I would work with them. No perks were necessary. </p><p>Of course, from the perspective of the cute brunette whose name I was yet to learn, the situation looked markedly different, so much that, I expected her to stammer an excuse and walk away. </p><p>Instead, she continued to push the cart toward the sofa. “Thanks,” she murmured, her stammer replaced by determination. </p><p>Interesting, I thought until she had pulled her phone to write a quick message, but on that message screen, I noticed a photo she had shared with a friend. </p><p>The cover of a global magazine, carrying a famous supermodel stuffed into a tight bikini. I was able to recognize it with a glance, because it was the single most high-profile job I had done — unfortunately, the celebration for said job managed to destroy my connections in the industry. After seeing that, I understood the sudden shift of attitude she was displaying, erroneously assuming I still maintained that level of career, and was determined to prove herself. </p><p>The question, just how determined she was for that proof of ability. </p><p>And while I never pushed it as a condition, I was more than enough to accept the benefits of such offerings directly. </p><p>“Why don’t you take a seat, I’ll handle the service,” I said as I gestured for her to sit next to Penny, who had a stony expression and a confident posture. Panic was still dancing in her beautiful eyes, of course, but it was hardly noticeable by another aspiring model. </p><p>She made eye contact, and after receiving a nod from me, changed her posture, not bothering to fix her clothing as she shuffled in place. </p><p>Interestingly, even a day before, Penny would have folded completely under such a surprise development. A day that started with sexy modeling and ended with a threesome clearly had some positive impact for her confidence, at least under the situation where I was there to help her mood.  </p><p>“This is Penny,” I said, gesturing at my beautiful busty blonde model. </p><p>“And I’m Laura,” she answered, looking hesitant as she gazed at Penny. An understandable attitude, as Penny was an impressive woman even when dressed casually. Dressed in an ill-fitting robe, her cleavage peeking beautifully, she looked more like a dream, the kind that would remind the other women of every single deficiency they possessed — and conjure a wreath of imaginary ones in the process. </p><p>The perfect view to blunt the confidence of an aspiring, determined model.</p>
