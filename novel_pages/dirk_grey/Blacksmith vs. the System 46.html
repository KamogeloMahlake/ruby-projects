        <p>“Time to return,” I said to myself serenely, and started walking back. </p><p>Of course, I knew it was not true acceptance. However, once the heat from the realization was gone, I was able to put it back into the pile of things I would deal with in the future. It was a big disaster, one that could potentially change the world, but it wasn’t something I could deal with blindly. </p><p>And, the first step was to confirm that it was actually the situation. Admittedly, studying it wouldn’t have been too easy. Even the simplest experiment I could think of, which was to give two groups some kind of tricky problem that was disguised as an IQ test, required me to access at least a hundred people, and hold experiments in two different locations. </p><p>Observing the new town was not an option, as there were too many variables to come to a conclusion. Maybe if I had the data from at least a hundred new towns, and a proper computer to process it —</p><p>“Not the time,” I said. While it was tempting to spend the next month coming up with fascinating observation methodologies that might solve my issue, it would have been ultimately counterproductive. Even the cheapest setup I could envision required a lot of money to run. More importantly, it would have been too obvious. </p><p>There was one important question about the peace fields: Whether they were intentionally there to control the society, or if that was just a side effect. As much as I wanted to dismiss the first option as a crazy conspiracy theory, I couldn’t. And, until I could, I didn’t have the luxury of experimenting freely. </p><p>I was even happier that I hid my Mana Forge and Mana Repair after this revelation. </p><p>Instead, I needed to use the opportunity to experiment with environmental mana. We wouldn’t stay here for long, and I had already wasted most of my time. It would be even more annoying if Eleanor wrapped up her business with Rosie. </p><p>Luckily, I could always use the excuse of getting inspired about sword technique if she was angry. It should mollify her. </p><p>Meanwhile, I found a nice concealed corner, leaned against a rock wall, and started using Meditation to gather mana. </p><p>To my surprise, it was slower than using the monster parts to refill my mana. Considerably so, but it didn’t take long for me to understand the reason. I barely ran the technique for a minute before the Mana density around me had dropped considerably. </p><p>That hadn’t been a problem with the monster parts. I could always shatter more. </p><p>I stayed like that, absorbing more and more mana, while the density around me continued to drop.  Reaching back up to three digits took more than fifteen minutes. There were certain ways to increase Mana density, that much was common knowledge, but guessing how effective they would be was something else. </p><p>”Alright, that explains why mages don’t stick around in small towns,” I said. That fact alone had changed multiple plans I had about my future. However, that didn’t mean my experimentation was over. Instead, I broke a few silver coins even as I dug a pit and snapped a few branches. </p><p>I was just about to reflexively reach into my pocket when I remembered I had a more convenient way of creating fire. And, casting a spell was faster than slowly releasing it back. </p><p>I raised my hand, ready to lose a hundred mana. </p><p>[-68 Mana]</p><p>“Alright, that was interesting,” I muttered even as I noticed the relatively small drop in the number. But, I didn’t need to think about the reason. </p><p>Even as the spell was in progress, it started pulling Mana from the environment as well, faster than I could manage with my meditation. Not only that, the spell had actually gathered faster, almost four seconds rather than full five. </p><p>Interesting concept. </p><p>It also explained why they couldn’t defend the town with Maria. I had assumed that it had been just the cost of Mana regeneration items, but clearly, it was also about resource efficiency and casting speed. </p><p>“Ignore the implications,” I said even as I threw the broken silver coins into the fire and melted them, and bled on them with my Health, followed it with mana. </p><p>[-85 Health]</p><p>[-9 Mana]</p><p>“It doesn’t work,” I muttered even as I had attempted a few times. But, the same experiment that had allowed me to create a Mana alloy for the first time didn’t work when there was some Mana in the atmosphere. </p><p>Even following the System recipes were harder, forcing me to isolate the environmental mana. It was doable, but even that was slower. An environment without external interference was much better. </p><p>I stayed in the concealed spot for one more minute, draining my remaining Mana in the form of a Mana Blow. For that, environmental Mana had no impact. Mana simply stuck around the blade until it lost its cohesion.</p><p>I practiced until I had made enough progress to support the excuse for my sudden inspiration. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 73 -&gt; 76]</p><p>Then, I paused, thinking if there was any other experiment I needed to run. I did not. </p><p>But, I had an observation I wanted to make. On the way back, I drifted near one of the farms that supplied the town with most of its fresh produce. </p><p>“Hey, this is private property,” someone warned as I walked toward the nearest tree. </p><p>“Don’t make a big deal. I’m feeling peckish,” I said. He looked ready to fight, but when I flipped a silver coin his way, he was quick to change his attitude. </p><p>I went to the nearest tree, and snapped an apple. Meanwhile, I just wanted to examine the tree from close up. The tree was draining some Mana from the environment. Very slowly, probably not amounting to more than a point every hour, but looking carefully, the movement was clear. </p><p>A stronger evidence was the greenhouses deeper into the farm. Unlike open fields, they had multiple guards around them, who wouldn’t have appreciated my presence, no doubt. However, I didn’t need to get closer. Even from a distance, I could see the way Mana gathered toward the building. </p><p>They likely had some kind of enchantment to increase Mana density. </p><p>Of course, I watch not just the greenhouses, but also the way some of the night workers operated, trying to get  a better sense of the process of farming. I didn’t learn anything other than Mana also playing a significant role in farming, but it was a good exchange for a silver coin. </p><p>Also, the apple was delicious. </p><p>When I reached the door, the guards didn’t allow me inside because of the curfew. I could have mentioned Eleanor’s name and entered, but it made a good excuse for my disappearance, so I just shrugged and walked back. </p><p>While I didn’t think I could avoid stepping into another peace field forever, I didn’t want to do that. Not before I could properly process the realization that I had been magically drugged for years. Though, the scariest thing had been the effects. </p><p>And, how easy it had been to excuse any stupid decision, staying in the town and working obediently, waiting for a convenient break rather than doing everything I could. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t some kind of fear that kept me away. I knew that, after three years of exposure, another night wouldn’t be harmful. However, going back into the town also meant talking with Rosie.</p><p>And, that woman was far too sharp to deal with such a thing. </p><p>I wanted to browse some of the Basic and Common skills I wanted, and maybe purchase a few of them, but it wasn’t critical enough to force myself. For once, I decided to be lazy and indulgent, rather than being drugged to behave so. </p><p>While waiting for her, I pulled my sword once more to practice, this time without killing the monsters. It was still more relaxing than calming exercises and ordinary meditation. I hated sitting around doing nothing. </p><p>Eleanor returned almost an hour later, and when she did, I was much calmer. “Hey, where were you?” she asked. </p><p>“Sorry, I know I was supposed to be joining you, but I had been hit by a sudden bit of inspiration,” I said, trying my best to sound excited. “It increased by three whole points, reaching seventy-six.” </p><p>Luckily, Eleanor was far more excited about the prospect to question the tone of my voice. “Wow, that’s amazing news!” </p><p>I was strangely glad when she drew her sword and charged at me, and we started sparring. It was even better than practicing, as it forced me to focus fully. We sparred for almost twenty minutes before she reluctantly pulled back. “I still have a meeting at the camp about the construction of the second layer of the town. We need to go back,” she said. </p><p>“Alright,” I said. “How was the meeting?” </p><p>“Typical, filled with more bean counting than I’m happy with; but we do what we must,” she said. </p><p>“And, how did Rosie react to my situation?”</p><p>“She didn’t,” Eleanor replied, which surprised me. “Since you didn’t come, I assumed you changed your mind about revealing that to her. We can go back and tell her if you want.” </p><p>“It’s not really that important,” I said. “We can always meet the next time.” </p><p>“But, it means that you flew for nothing. I know how you … don’t like flying.” </p><p>“That’s true,” I said, amused by her attempt to tiptoe around my almost crippling fear of flying. “But still, I benefited from the visit more than I expected. It’s worth it.” </p><p>“You’re right. Three points of proficiency in a couple of hours, particularly when it reaches seventies, is no joke. It’s worth a little distress.” </p><p>It was not what I meant, but I wouldn’t have corrected that even if I wasn’t intentionally trying to mislead her. Instead, I joined her on the griffin. </p><p>For the first time in my life, I was actually looking forward to flying. Any distraction from the shocking revelation was welcome. </p>
