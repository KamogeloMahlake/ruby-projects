        <p>As I looked at the beautiful redheaded figure, lying prone on the bed, her beautiful bottom quivering helplessly as my fingers invaded her core once more to push her dangerously close to the edge, but not allowed to push forward. </p><p>Despite the seriousness of the situation, and the preciousness of the information she held, I was tempted to stay silent, testing just how long she would be able to stay on the edge before collapsing into a helpless heap of moans. </p><p>Unfortunately, even with the beauty of her form, I didn’t have the luxury of fully focusing my attention on that kind of stuff, not when I had to get more information about the mysterious organizations that were doing their best to infiltrate not only the palace, but also the dark factions. </p><p>All that I needed to decide was which side to focus on first, Elves, or Phoenixes. </p><p>A momentary consideration later, I decided to focus on Elves first, for three reasons. First, I already had a rudimentary understanding of the Phoenixes, making the incremental information less valuable, especially since I had direct access to one of them. Second, I could focus on Elves while letting Emma think that she had managed to trick me about her real employer, which would have been useful. </p><p>However, the most important reason was that Emma only knew about one Phoenix, who, clearly, was not aligned with the real faction, which was currently with dark families. </p><p>“Tell me everything you know about Elves,” I ordered her even as I pulled my fingers out once more, glistening with her juices. </p><p>“I - I don’t know much—” she stammered, only to be cut when she received another spank. </p><p>“I didn’t ask you how much you knew, I ordered you to tell everything you know,” I said, squeezing her reddening flesh — just slightly, as too much pain could easily trigger her climax as well thanks to her growing streak of submissiveness. </p><p>“Elves are the rulers of an Empire that spans over many worlds,” she spilled. “However, they don’t rule most of those worlds directly, but through puppets, and they want to make Empire a puppet as well.” </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said. “And how strong they are?” </p><p>“They are supposed to be much stronger than us, but other than that, I don’t know,” she answered. “They are experts of magic, however.” </p><p>“How interesting,” I said, impressed by the confidence that radiated from her tone as she shared the information. I guessed she learned those details from the Phoenix, which, ultimately, making the accuracy of the information doubtful. </p><p>Still, it was much better than anything I had before. And, seeing the wards they had left in the palace, I had no doubt about their individual strength. However, the strength of their nation, especially when combined with their already existing access didn’t make much sense. </p><p>Unless there was something that was preventing them from bringing their full power, or even a decent fraction of their power, against our world. I wondered whether Emma knew about the reason. “And, pray tell, why don’t they just come and attack us if they are that strong?” </p><p>“I - I don’t know, but my guess is there are other races in similar strength, helping us to resist their invasion,” she suggested. </p><p>I barely held back my laughter as she said those words. She was clearly insinuating that Phoenixes were responsible for defending us without actually telling me so. Luckily for her, I could recognize the sudden shift in her tone, marking that as a lie. </p><p>At least, she wasn’t stupid enough to actually believe Phoenixes were some kind of benevolent force to counter Elves. That level of stupidity would have made her a big liability, rather than her current self-serving traitorous instincts, making her easy to predict. </p><p>Stupid was impossible to predict. </p><p>“I see, we might be lucky, then,” I murmured, letting her think that I had believed her argument. There was no point arguing about the intent of the Phoenixes, especially since Emma was in no position to know what really drove those two giants. </p><p>However, as she answered my questions, she was slowly getting used to the weight of the pleasure, her answers turning more coherent. </p><p>Unacceptable, I decided with a smirk, even as I let my fingers caress her body, slowly climbing up. When I reached her chest, however, my hands slipped under her body, my fingers landing around her beautiful breasts, massaging them softly. “Good girl,” I whispered into her ear, combining it with a strategic squeezing of her hard nipples. </p><p>The moment the combined assault of my whisper and my fingers hit her, she started to tremble, helpless under the deluge of pleasure as the climax I had been denying her for the last several minutes hit her. </p><p>It took a few seconds for her to recover, and even then, it was just her gaze as she managed to turn just enough to catch my gaze while I hovered over her body, positioning myself strategically. </p><p>Despite the trembles that were holding her hostage, she managed to raise her hips, prepared for my invasion. “Good girl,” I whispered again even as I slipped inside her, enjoying the way her wetness wrapped around my girth. </p><p>A moan escaped her lips as I pushed deeper into her core, wet enough to easily swallow my presence after the earlier treatment. Her hands landed on her pillow, squeezing them hard as the pleasure of my movement hit her. </p><p>I grabbed her shoulders, tightening my grip before I suddenly exploded into motion, drilling her without a warning. The sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room as I rammed her as fast as I could manage. Her moans were quick to rise, mixing with the clapping sound, despite her attempts to bury her face to her pillow to muffle her cries. </p><p>“No, I want to hear your voice, slut,” I ordered even as I grabbed her beautiful hair, pulling back painfully, which only enhanced the intensity of her pleasure-filled moans. And just to drive the moment even deeper, I conjured a mirror in front of me, allowing me to make eye contact with her. </p><p>Her beautiful emerald eyes met with mine for a fleeting moment before she avoided my gaze, dazed, not knowing where to look. It was amusing that despite everything, she was too shy to maintain eye contact at the moment. </p><p>“So, where were we?” I asked suddenly, not reducing my pace even slightly. </p><p>“Where we, what?” she managed to stammer. </p><p>“About this Elvish Empire that was about to invade us, of course,” I said. “They clearly want to invade us, but other than another, mysteriously altruistic, inter-dimensional Empire, what’s stopping them from directly invading our lands?” </p><p>“I don’t—“ she started, her expression shouting a lie, so I spanked her ass preemptively, warning her. “There’s something about some kind of path, they need to be open for them to enter.” </p><p>That caused me to stop for a moment, a chill spreading through my heart, remembering Sapphire explaining to Aria how she needed Eternal Core to open the Pathways, so that she could deal with the crisis at the North. At that moment, I was ready to dismiss that as a part of her political struggles and nothing else. </p><p>After all, the sudden silence — and possible destruction — of a few tiny forts was nothing too important for me.</p><p>A chill filled my heart as I realized that, without noticing those wards in the throne room, I could have easily lent the Core to her at one point for her to handle — or more likely, might have used it myself to access to North, hoping to use the information as leverage against Sapphire. </p><p>What a fucking close call. </p><p>Luckily, I was more experienced in suppressing my emotions than Emma was able to detect them, so, after a fleeting second, I started moving with a renewed heat. </p><p>And I would be lying if the pleasure helped me to suppress the fear of a close disaster. There was no guarantee that her claim about the Pathway was correct — she believed that she was telling the truth, but her source was doubtful — but sometimes, interrogation and spy work was more about instinct than certainty. </p><p>And the possibility that the Pathways were a great trap, waiting to be strong was threatening enough as a possibility. </p><p>“How interesting,” I murmured instead. “And do you have any idea about what this path is?” </p><p>“N-no,” she moaned, struggling as the pleasure invaded her being whole. Unfortunately, I believed her, which essentially ended the interrogation. </p><p>Well, the functional part of the interrogation, I corrected even as I sped up, enjoying her moans.  Just because I was out of questions to ask without spooking her didn’t mean that I had to stop, after all… </p><p>x</p>
