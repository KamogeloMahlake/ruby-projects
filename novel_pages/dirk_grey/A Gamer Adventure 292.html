        <p>“Someone has spent too much time with Cornelia —” I started, which was all I was able to say before Helga waved her hand, and her magic closed my mouth, silencing me. </p><p>“It’s punishment time, no talking,” she warned even as her hips started moving, riding me. I let out a muffled chuckle at the setup. Naturally, even if the spell she used was genius, she currently had access to a very limited amount of mana, and it couldn’t be compared to my reserves — and the less said about my ability to convert the mana from Aether, the better. </p><p>However, I didn’t use them, instead just struggled against the bonds physically. </p><p>To my shock, they were able to resist even as I applied enough Strength to reach twenty points. Impressive. </p><p>“You can’t escape without cheating with magic,” she declared smugly even as she put her hands on my chest, going back and forth, showing she was strongly underestimating my new physical abilities. </p><p>I let her continue to believe that. She earned the right for it, and I was happy to play at her own pace.  </p><p>Particularly, considering the enthusiastic dance she was conducting on my lap was less of a chore and more of an excellent sexy dream. It took her several moments to get into a pace and control her initial pleasure. </p><p>A cheeky smile bloomed across her face.</p><p>She raised her hips and brought them down with a sudden change of pace. A jolt of pleasure shot up my spine while she looked down at me smugly. “It’s not fun when you’re the one being played, is it?” she asked. </p><p>I certainly disagreed. I was having a lot of fun, but my mouth was blocked, so saying that was difficult. Instead, I looked up, enjoying the dance of her tits while her legs splayed on both sides of me while her wetness spread along my length. She had pulled out, and limited herself to gliding along my length after her initial desperate ride. </p><p>She clearly wanted to play with me just as well. </p><p>“Patience,” she delivered, trying to sound smug as she slid down even more, and took my length into her mouth, teasing the head. Pity she just sounded needy. She needed her orgasm even more than I did, her body trembling in anticipation. </p><p>She was cute, beautiful, and sexy at the same time. </p><p>God, I really missed her. </p><p>Unaware of my thoughts and focused on my shaft, she pulled back and breathed over my shaft, the sudden change making me shiver. Then, she returned sucking the sensitive head, treating it as a particularly sweet dish.</p><p>“ I figured you need some lazy pampering,” she whispered, though as I shifted my leg slightly so it rubbed against her wetness, she followed by a deep moan. “Naughty,” she gasped as she waved her hand, and two more chains appeared, this time along my legs. </p><p>Satisfied with her achievement, she went back to licking and suckling on my shaft, her fingers focusing on the base. </p><p>I tugged at the restraints playfully, acting like I was using the full range of my strength. She just chuckled. “You can’t escape those with brute force,” she whispered. “Too bad you’re behind in your magical studies, you naughty boy.” </p><p>The bindings had almost no give, holding my wrists spread, but it was her tone that made me shiver. She played the sexy yet disappointed teacher very well. </p><p>My body acted on its own, pushing my hips high just as her lips wrapped once again, touching at the entrance of her throat. She pulled back, and patted my chest playfully. “No need to be impatient,” she whispered, repeating my treatment earlier. </p><p>She clearly enjoyed having me tied and under her mercy.</p><p>I was tempted to let her play more. After all, she deserved a lot of rewards. Unfortunately for her, her last words made me even hornier than I expected … and more importantly, I knew she would enjoy the reversal just as much. </p><p>I tugged the magical chains once more, and she grinned smugly. </p><p>A smug grin that disappeared when her magical chains shattered. “I-impossible,” she gasped, but that was all she was able to say as I ripped off my gag as well. “Not impossible,” I said as I grabbed her and rolled, and she ended up under me, her wrists grabbed by my hands. “Just difficult.” </p><p>She smiled, which turned into panic as she realized a very important detail. There was no mana around her, not even a point she could use. “N-no,” she gasped. </p><p>“Did you know this barbarian discovered a way to create an anti-mana field,” I whispered. “A bit difficult to use in a practical manner, but very useful to teach a smug mage a lesson she couldn’t forget. </p><p>She flexed her muscles, trying to get out, her eyes wide as she stayed pinned. Though, as she struggled, it wasn’t despair that appeared on her face, but resignation. </p><p>And, intense arousal. </p><p>Even knowing it was impossible, she struggled to get free, each second making her feel a more intense arousal. She moaned as I pressed my shaft against her entrance, but she didn’t tense, clearly expecting me to tease her just like she had been doing. </p><p>I had a different plan in mind, one that was worthy of a barbarian who just captured a princess. I pushed hard, and her wetness swallowed me. </p><p>“It seems that you’re overestimating yourself against a barbarian warrior, you pitiful princess,” I said loudly. She might have answered, if it wasn’t for the moan that occupied her mouth. Instead, she undulated as best she could and squealed in delight as I impaled her mercilessly.</p><p>Invading her body with Tantric mana was almost an afterthought, hastening her binding. Too bad I couldn’t help her absorb Purified Spark without risking diluting the conceptual integrity of her merging. </p><p>Instead, I continued rocking my hips mercilessly, a simple move that I nonetheless turned into an art form despite its inherent simplicity. It wasn’t just an animalistic push, but a rough dance, the pace, the strength, the distance, all adding to her pleasure while I invaded her in reckless abandon. </p><p>There was only so much pleasure her body could endure before it succumbed to another orgasm, especially when she was as tense as she was. She closed her eyes, moans filling the room as the orgasm hit. </p><p>The healing spell I used ruined the barbarian role I was playing, but keeping her conscious was more important. </p><p>Her bleary eyes opened. “You haven’t blacked out and missed the fun, exalted mage,” I said mockingly, my grin wide enough to annoy her even under the circumstances. However, with my hips drilling ceaselessly, she didn’t have time to comment on that. </p><p>“You’re merciless,” she gasped. </p><p>“I know,” I whispered. “But you haven’t seen anything. After all, Strength is not my biggest stat…” </p><p>“And, what’s it?” </p><p>“Endurance,” I whispered. “Currently, it has sixty points.” </p><p>Her breath hitched when the implication of that number hit her, tensing in anticipation of pleasure. I continued banging her repeatedly, not giving her a chance to delude herself so that she could tire me out. </p><p>As her eyes closed to focus on the pleasure, she didn’t seem to be particularly against the idea. </p><p>I impaled her again and again, reshaping her wet hole for my presence once more. She just groaned and moaned, her body losing every hint of energy it possessed. She was limp and obedient. </p><p>Until another orgasm hit, and she involuntarily bucked against my hold despite the impossibility of getting free, earning a chuckle.</p><p>“You’re still acting out, maybe you deserve another punishment,” I whispered. Another small spell to cheat, this time to ready her backdoor entrance for my invasion, I pulled out, and slipped into her tightness. </p><p>The sudden intrusion was enough to earn a cry from her, which was a perfect mixture of pain and pleasure. “You’re nothing but an anal slut for my barbaric cock, you pitiful mage,” I growled. </p><p>“No, I’m not pitiful,” she gasped. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, and suddenly, I flipped once more before letting her hands go free. “Here, I stopped. Are you saying that you have the willpower to just pull back?” </p><p>“You’re a fucking bastard,” she growled, but that was all she said before she put her hands on my chest, using it as leverage as she rode me desperately, doing her best to climax from anal penetration. With her panting and trembling, it didn’t take long for her to reach another climax. </p><p>This time, she wasn’t alone. As the orgasm hit her and her ass tightened around me, I exploded in her as well, filling her with my seed. </p><p>She collapsed against my chest, barely conscious. “You’re such an evil man,” she growled. “You’re lucky that I love you.” </p><p>“I love you too,” I answered, hugging her as she fell asleep, the emotional highs and physical challenges finally catching up with her. She earned her rest. </p><p>I closed my eyes as well, but for me, there was no sleep. </p><p>I still needed to plan her divine domain. We could afford no mistake with her fate. </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 45</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 33269}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 700  Mana: 2000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>
