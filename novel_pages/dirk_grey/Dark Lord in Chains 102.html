        <p>While Cinder froze at the sole option of involvement in the way Isolde was being punished, I was busy deciding what to do if she chose not to join. </p><p>But, after some consideration, I decided to write off ordering directly if she decided against it. Not because I was afraid of the way she would react against me. With our intimate magical connection, I didn’t fear any kind of rebellion or betrayal, even if I forced her to do something she found distasteful. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same protection didn’t apply to Isolde, and there was no doubt that Cinder was vindictive enough to target Isolde, even when in a situation I was to blame — a decision that was made particularly easy with Isolde’s attitude toward anything magical. She would just respond in kind.  </p><p>I would prefer two of my newest loyal followers not to try to kill each other the moment I turned my back. </p><p>Luckily, ordering her directly was not the only option I had to galvanize the flaming beauty in her knees, frozen in indecision. </p><p>I twisted Isolde’s nipple, making her let out a moan charged with arousal, magically-enforced edge play fulfilling its role as a torture tool excellently. </p><p>“Of course, you don’t have to help. It’s only fair not wanting to force her too much,” I said as I looked down. “Mercy is a perfectly admirable emotion.” </p><p>“What mercy!” Cinder gasped in protest, her scandalous expression amazingly intense, the implication that she was feeling a hint of mercy treated the same as the greatest insults I could even imagine. </p><p>“Such an interesting personality, right?” I whispered in Isolde’s ear, soft enough to be missed by Cinder in her distracted state as she leaned forward, her head disappearing between Isolde’s legs. </p><p>Isolde tried to answer, but I would never know what she would have said, as a moan was all she was able to create, once again showing that pleasure could be even more effective than pain as torture. </p><p>Her moans rose loudly, filling the little meadow we occupied, beautiful yet pitiful. But, unfortunately for her, Cinder wasn’t the only one who was deficient in softer emotions, leaving me to mercilessly enjoy the beauty of her moans. </p><p>I squeezed her breasts hard, treating her in a rough manner she clearly enjoyed, adding another flood of arousal to her dammed pleasure, growing to a disastrous level, making her moans even sharper. </p><p>But, as I glanced forward, I noticed Cinder wasn’t being particularly aggressive as her tongue lapped around Isolde’s wetness. It was time for some indirect encouragement, I decided. “I admire your willpower, even managing to resist our double assault without collapsing. Maybe I should let you decide your own reward if you can resist it for five minutes,” I said, a simple magical hourglass appearing in front of us the moment I uttered those words. </p><p>Isolde moaned at that, but the delirious quality in her tone showed she didn’t register the promised reward properly, too busy resisting the invasion of pleasure. Which was well, as she was not the target of my words. </p><p>Cinder was. </p><p>She was vindictive enough to take any chance of Isolde winning a challenge she was involved in as a personal affront. Though, as she pulled back for a moment to take a deep breath, I caught a glint of panic in her gaze, probably with the realization that Isolde might target her with the reward. </p><p>Admittedly, it was very likely. Isolde was no less vindictive than Cinder, and would gladly waste an opportunity to request something important from me to immediately make Cinder back. </p><p>Such amusing personalities, I thought as I watched Cinder lean down, her lips pressing against Isolde’s core with a renewed determination.  </p><p>Isolde reacted to the sudden increase of intensity predictably, with her moans exploding loudly, and her body trembling. </p><p>I cast another spell, this time loosening the chains around Isolde’s legs, enough to give her some mobility. Lost in pleasure, she didn’t notice it, needing my order to make her act. “Put your legs on her shoulders,” I whispered. </p><p>She followed that automatically, though it was an indicator of the depths of her pleasure when she just put her legs on her shoulder loosely rather than tightening around her neck — a little opportunity of physical revenge Isolde would have never ignored if the pleasure hadn’t already reached to an overwhelming level. </p><p>Her blush burned with a shocking intensity while Cinder pressed her head tightly, showing that her tongue was dancing there with surprising intensity, even with the encouragement of her ‘revenge’.</p><p>Interesting, but something that needed to be examined in the future, I decided as I turned my attention back on Isolde. After all, it would be rude if I didn’t properly handle my own role while she was dealing with hers. </p><p>One of my hands stayed on her breasts, mauling and caressing with irregular intervals, the confusing nature pushing the situation even more intensely. </p><p>Her nipples hardened even further, showing that the unpredictable assault I was mounting on her was working excellently. There was no need for me to do anything else. It wouldn’t take long until her punishment reached its completion. </p><p>Well, no need if I discounted my raging boner, begging to be released. Keeping the pace the same would mean I was torturing myself as well, which was rather silly, especially when my naked shaft already pressing against her bottom. </p><p>I pulled my hips back, and before Isolde could react to the change, pushed forward again, sliding inside her core with a merciless invasion, though, with her phenomenal wetness, it slid inside without the slightest resistance. </p><p>Cinder pulled back in shock at the sudden change of pace, but I caught her gaze. “Come on, sweetie, we’re almost about to win, no need to stop,” I said, my chuckle making her blush. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she stammered before leaning back, her tongue once again teasing her knob, the circular dance of her tongue contrasting with my reckless drilling, the lack of coordination intensifying Isolde’s beautiful torture even more. </p><p>I abandoned my determined focus on Isolde’s punishment, focusing on my own pleasure, reinforced further by Isolde’s subtle hip movements — the most she could do in her dazed state, showing that, even at the edge of being overwhelmed by pleasure, she didn’t lose her desire to serve. </p><p>What a beautiful servant, I decided, decided to have mercy on her. I cast another spell, dispelling the spell that was holding her back, but not instantly. Instead, I cast a spell to weaken that relatively slowly, constantly weakening, to be dispersed completely the moment the hourglass emptied. </p><p>Which was just enough for me to attain my own completion. </p><p>But not without some help. “Faster,” I ordered even as I spanked her ass hard, the jolt of pain enough for her to disperse the haze of the pleasure for a fleeting moment, reminding her enough to follow my order.</p><p>The movement of her hips got more pronounced, swinging back and forth easily as she used Cinder’s shoulders and her own chains for leverage — which was a more difficult movement to do than it sounded, but she had the physical capabilities to do so. </p><p>Our hips started to clap loudly, creating a backdrop to her constant moans, the delirium in her voice getting stronger and stronger with each second, the pleasure battling against unconsciousness. </p><p>And losing badly. </p><p>Yet, despite the inevitable direction, she stayed focused on her task, her hips grinding against me as intensely as she could manage under the circumstances, which definitely counted as a successful resistance. </p><p>It seemed that, despite all the adversity, she would win the little reward I had promised. </p><p>But, I wasn’t the only one that noticed it. Cinder raised her gaze and took a glimpse of the hourglass, already two-thirds empty. “It seems that she will earn her reward,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Don’t be so sure,” Cinder answered, her face determined as she leaned down once again, but this time, targeting a different location. Her tongue moved lower, directly teasing her entrance, but paying great attention to my rapidly disappearing shaft as well. </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed with her clever solution. I could have slowed down to reduce the impact of her addition, of course, but that would have been rude after the great initiative she displayed.</p><p>After all, it was something to be encouraged. </p><p>I reached my limit before the hourglass, and exploded inside her, the sudden invasion enough to trigger Isolde’s climax a second later despite the spell that was supposed to prevent it — though weakening after my timed display. </p><p>It seemed that, with my explosion, her pleasure reached a point to overwhelm the tethered spell. </p><p>I pulled back even as I waved my hand, dispelling the hourglass, leaving Isolde hanging with the chains, the climax enough to make her faint. </p><p>Cinder pulled back, still on her knees, her beautiful lips curled in a smirk, stained with Isolde’s juices.</p><p>Altogether, a very successful session of punishment…</p>
