        <p>There is only one chapter left until the photographer reaches end of its first complete arc. Before that, I wanted to ask everyone whether you prefer me to continue it in arc 2, which will be in a similar size, or would you prefer me format the last chapter as an ending, and focus on my other stories. You choose.Â </p>
