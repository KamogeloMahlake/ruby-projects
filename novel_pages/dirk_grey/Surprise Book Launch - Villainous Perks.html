        <p>Hi, everyone. I have a little surprise for you all. I have just published a brand new story on Smashwords, a LitRPG system novel, this time on a superhero driven sci-fi/fantasy world. </p><p><a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1095584" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1095584</strong></a></p><p>The reason I'm publishing this book in Smashwords instead of Patreon is the possible content guidelines. Smashwords has looser guidelines for certain topics, allowing some of the themes I'm actively avoiding in my other stories to be handled more freely. </p><p>Some of you may have (justifiable) concerns that it might affect my other publishing state. Let me guarantee that, it'll not affect my Patreon schedule in any way, so no worries about that. Actually, assuming a reasonable sales number, it might push me closer to my dream of becoming a full-time writer. </p><p>So, fingers crossed.</p><p>And if you're curious about the general tone but don't want to pay immediately, you can read the first half for free, or wait for promotions. (I'll eventually reduce the price for the first book, when I have finally published a few more on series, of course. Unfortunately, that might take something between a few weeks and a few months, depending on my other commitments).</p><p><em>Also, just to give an idea about its length, it's approximately as long as 4-5 of my Patreon releases.</em></p><p>Feel free to message me about anything, be it negative or positive. </p>
