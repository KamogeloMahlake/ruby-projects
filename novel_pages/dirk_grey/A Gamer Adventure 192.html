        <p>After I left the workshop, it didn’t take long for me to decide on my next destination. </p><p>I wanted to go visit Janelor, and not to have some fun with my petite dragon. Or, more accurately, not entirely for fun.  </p><p>I wanted to question her more about the other planes and traveling in between. Not that I didn’t trust the headmistress’ explanation, at least in the general strokes as she had no reason to lie to me about those, but that still left the question of Janelor had a more recent experience in those dangers as she somehow found herself in here. </p><p>On the contrary, I didn’t even know whether the headmistress even traveled, or was around since the beginning of the system, making her explanation about interplanar traveling not entirely reliable. </p><p>And I prioritized exploring that for one important reason.</p><p>I could still feel Aviada’s presence through her Companion node. Her presence was weak, blunted, a faint flicker compared to the bonfire of Helga and others, yet, without a doubt, she was still alive. One that wasn’t supposed to be the case if traveling between planes was as impossible as the headmistress mentioned.  </p><p>I wouldn’t abandon her while there was still hope. </p><p>Janelor represented an alternative source of information for me to validate. </p><p>But one didn’t simply visit a greedy dragon without an appropriate tribute. </p><p>So, I first stopped by the kitchen, taking a considerable amount of ingredients — using the authority granted by my new role — before finding an unoccupied corner and creating a couple wards to keep me concealed before I started cooking a veritable late breakfast spread, from light cheeses to cooked meats, and even an impressive number of desserts… </p><p>Naturally, every single bite laced with an incredible amount of mana, enough to change the fate of an actual battlefield if used appropriately, though, luckily, my mana recovery filled my reserves before I finished cooking.  </p><p>[-4680 Mana]</p><p>Not all of the mana went directly to the food, of course. A considerable amount of it went to create a temporary barrier around the food, forcing the food to keep that much mana in its confines and block the System from absorbing it back directly. </p><p>Only after that, I went to her room, once again putting myself under the suffocating sensation of darkness wards, weakening my connection with the System. Once again reminding me that, for all the power it had provided, the System was not something completely reliable. </p><p>The door was locked with an intricate ward, one that had been cast recently. The excessively delicate nature of the ward showed that Janelor was the party responsible for its existence. It would have been a strong ward if it wasn’t for the deterioration it experienced as the mana evaporated easily from its structure… </p><p>Without the deterioration, unlocking it without triggering an alarm would have been challenging, but at the moment, it was as effective as a castle gate connected to broken walls. A momentary effort was all that was needed to bypass them. </p><p>I entered the room and found my cute ‘mistress’ sleeping, her petite body sprawled over her huge bed, still in her human form. Her beautiful body was not naked, but considering the thinness of the nightwear she was wearing, she might as well be naked. </p><p>I said nothing as I walked toward her bed with the tray in hand, wondering whether sleeping that much was the habit of all dragons, or it was just something unique to her due to her laziness. </p><p>She woke up before I could cover half of the distance, though the way her cute note twitched suggested that it was not my footsteps that pulled her out of her sleep but the smell of the amazing food I had prepared for her. </p><p>“Good morning, mistress,” I said, intentionally lingering at the last word while letting the smile on my face twist beautifully. “Did you have a nice sleep?” </p><p>For a moment, she just looked at me, beautifully dazed. Then, her gaze bounced between me and the door, no doubt trying to understand how I entered despite the ward — suggesting that she was yet to understand the full impact of the System on her spells despite the time she spent here. </p><p>While she dealt with her mental question, I continued to close into her bed. Distracted, it took a while for her to remember what she had been wearing, her blush intensifying as she glanced down. </p><p>The best part, her pride prevented her from asking me to turn, or even cross her arms around her chest to hide. The only thing she did was to cross her legs, and even that, she did with the excuse of shuffling. “W-why are you here?” she asked, unable to prevent herself from stammering. </p><p>“I brought your breakfast in bed, of course,” I said, with a tone that might be considered respectable if it wasn’t for my widening smirk. I took a step back and turned slightly. “But I can always throw it away if you don’t want it.” </p><p>To her credit, she managed to resist the temptation of my delicious cooking. </p><p>For three whole steps. </p><p>“Stop,” she gasped. If someone else heard the desperation in her tone, they might have assumed that I had been torturing her, and she finally shattered under my merciless assault. </p><p>Such a gluttonous little dragon. </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I said as I turned back, an exaggerated smile of satisfaction on my lips, intentionally big to make her notice. Yet, under the fascination of the food, she let that slide, her gaze carefully following the food. </p><p>Her eyes even momentarily flickered, turning slithered before gaining back their usual emerald quality, glowing whole with no whites. It would have been an intimidating sight if it wasn’t for her sexy nightie — or the memories of the same eyes forced to shut under the endless invasion of pleasure. </p><p>“You can leave,” she said the moment I put the tray on the bed. Yet, when she reached, I pulled the tray back, and climbed on the bed as well. “What are you doing?” she asked. </p><p>“I’m going to feed you, of course. As a good servant, the satisfaction of my mistress is paramount. You can’t be asking me to be a bad servant, right? It would make me depressed.” I paused for a moment, my smirk widening. “Maybe even depressed enough to throw away the food I had gone all the trouble of making.” </p><p>The beautiful expression of frustration on her face was amazing as she considered my threat. “Alright,” she accepted defeat with a nod, but then she raised her hand in warning, the attitude coming across quite clearly as her hand turned into a claw. “No funny business.” </p><p>“I promise, no funny business,” I answered. After all, there was nothing funny about what I had planned to do, especially compared to her so-called threat. </p><p>Her threat amused me significantly because of one very important reason. It was a great contrast to earlier, when she had been feeling very uncomfortable showing her transformation next to me. Yet now, she was very comfortable, proving our growing closeness… </p><p>Even when my mind was busy with the implications of her threat, my hands started working, slicing a small of cheese and brought to her lips, even using the opportunity to inject it with more mana. </p><p>[-93 Mana]</p><p>She tried to keep her face expressionless as she swallowed the piece, but that proved to be a bigger challenge than she assumed. Her tastebuds rebelled, followed by her throat, letting out a moan of appreciation. </p><p>Her fascinating emerald eyes turned to a tornado of petulant confusion, unhappy with her performance. Though, not unhappy enough to reject the next slice I had prepared for her, her pouty lips parting immediately the moment I raised the fork. </p><p>Another moan escaped her mouth. </p><p>She closed her eyes, enjoying every bite fully while doing her best to ignore my presence. </p><p>That would not do. </p><p>After several repeats, the fork I was carrying trembled accidentally — as it was very normal for someone with forty points on both Agility and Precision to experience — dropping a big blob of jam on her nightie, right at the nice valley between her breasts. </p><p>“Oh, mistress, I’m sorry,” I gasped, using my ability of speech and charisma to the limit to make it convincing just to mock her. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s —“ she started, reflexively responding to the anguish in my tone before her mind caught up with the absurdity of it. Her eyes opened, catching my wide smirk. </p><p>“Nonsense, mistress,” I answered, this time using my exaggerated servant tone once more. “It’s my fault I had ruined your nightie. Sorry, let me help you handle it,” I said as I grabbed her nightie, and ripped it off her body. </p><p>“Yes, you definitely saved it from ruin,” she answered, unable to help her sarcastic tone even as she shuffled, unable to resist the temptation of covering her breasts. After all, while the earlier nightie hid nothing due to its transparency, it still gave her a clutch to convince herself that she wasn’t naked. </p><p>A clutch that I got rid of with extreme prejudice. </p><p>Yet, as I prepared another slice for her, she opened her mouth obediently rather than making me leave…  </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
