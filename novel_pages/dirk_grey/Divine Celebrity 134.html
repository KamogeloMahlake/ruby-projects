        <p>“What’s the difference,” I murmured dazedly as I dropped a bill on the table and left the cafe, wanting to drive away. I didn’t want to be in a public location if the situation developed dangerously. </p><p>I drove for ten minutes, as fast as I could manage without getting a speeding ticket, and soon, I parked into a desolate emptiness. I closed my eyes and focused on my internal world, trying to understand what was the difference that was tickling me at the intent flow. </p><p>It was a subtle difference, the kind that I would never even notice if I didn’t have my most recent improvement… Even now, it was more of a feeling than anything else. Soon, I realized the difference. The Intent flow was a mixture of two different directions. One was just directly targeting me, flowing in the same usual pattern, which I was used to. </p><p>The second was more interesting. It came from a distance … like it was flowing toward a different target first before bouncing off from there and pulling toward me. I tried to follow the direction, but it soon faded. </p><p>I might have had trouble understanding what was going on, but the timing was too accurate to be related to anything but my most recent achievement of creating a scandal. A scandal that was already picking some national renown as some of the national news picked it. </p><p>Very fascinating, I thought as I realized what was going on, the possibilities significant enough to make me giddy. </p><p>I didn’t care much about the amount of intent I had been getting from it. It was even less than the little scraps I had been collecting from the chess tournament when I had first received the System. </p><p>I was excited by the method I was collecting it. </p><p>The Cloaked Hero. </p><p>A made-up hacker name that had no link to me, and couldn’t be traced to a different source … yet somehow, it still provided Intent for me. “Fascinating,” I thought as I started going through the other videos, and posted a few more — once again through bots that couldn’t be traced back to me. </p><p>It showed several more prominent people from the city, this time including Coach Spencer, intensifying the scandal. With the scale growing, some bigger news agencies soon picked up the news … and the Intent flow got several times higher. </p><p>Still negligible compared to the other sources, but only because the majority was dispersing at a distance. Wasting that was a little frustrating, but. I ignored that loss quickly, focusing on the possibilities. I had always thought that Intent was linked tightly to my identity. </p><p>And, my latest discovery revealed a completely different path for me. Of course, I needed to discover a way to somehow pull more than a fraction of the generation … but still, the possibility itself was enough to add a completely new layer of challenge… </p><p>Truly fascinating. </p><p>Of course, that meant a lot of work, not only to create a legend that allowed others to focus on, but also finding ways to focus on it. </p><p>But maybe, repairing the System would help. </p><p>[Intent Pool: 8.7%]</p><p>I turned my attention toward my pool of Intent, wondering if I could trigger the Repair process the second time. But, while I tried to repeat the process several times, it didn’t work as I intended. Stubbornly, I tried again, but this time, I received a warning. </p><p>Not as a notification, but more of a feeling, hard to describe and illusory. It told me that, if I tried to repair the System again, it’ll take much longer. Something that I had no intention of repeating, not when considering even an accidental discovery of a Totem Animal function gave me such an incredible benefit.  </p><p>Using the previous example as Benchmark, while I would be able to use the previous functions, I would lose the ability to acquire new abilities, which was not exactly preferable. </p><p>I wanted to explore Acolyte and Domains functions in depth before triggering the Repair and putting the System back to its sleeping state. I hoped that they would be able to help me generate more Intent one way or another. </p><p>And even if they didn’t work as well as I hoped, I would still wait until Megan’s business plan started. I wanted to see if being a model would give me some extra benefit in terms of Intent generation, so that even without any possible advantages from Acolytes and Domains, the repair would take much less. </p><p>“A decision for the future,” I murmured, shrugging as I walked to my car. With the nature of the mysterious Intent flow solved, I didn’t need to stay here for more. </p><p>Instead, I decided to handle what Coach Juana asked of me, and visit the other teams. Maybe I could find a way to generate more intent. </p><p>I wanted to see if the other sports could generate some more Intent. Before starting to drive, I sent a quick message to Megan, to check if it would work for her plans. Normally, I wouldn’t have bothered, at least not if she hadn’t used one of the favors I owed her,  but the fifteen percent cut I would receive from the success of the enterprise made kindness much easier to display.   </p><p>Earth didn’t just orbit around the sun, but also around the benefits. </p><p>Megan’s response came almost instantly, calling me. “Tell me, are you going to create another commotion?” she asked, not even bothering to ask for a greeting. </p><p>“Me, a commotion?” I answered, acting like I had been insulted greatly. </p><p>Megan chuckled at the other end. “Yes, I can’t imagine why I suddenly have that impression. You’re a man of humility and perseverance. Like a monk. I can’t even imagine you raising your voice.”  </p><p>“As long as you understand it,” I responded, then continued seriously. “You don’t mind if I go around a bit, right?” </p><p>“Depends.” </p><p>“On what?”  </p><p>“Whether you can actually make an impact or be defeated. You might not know just how exaggerated your reputation became. I’m sure the players would challenge you to a game while making their friends stream it…” </p><p>“And, considering my general reputation among the coaching staff, I doubt the coaches would do anything to intervene,,” I completed. </p><p>“Exactly, so don’t go and ruin my marketing campaign if you’re not confident.” </p><p>“What if I’m confident,” I countered. </p><p>Megan paused. “Are you serious?” she asked, her voice sharp. I just chuckled. “Then, wait half an hour, and I’ll ask Kim to visit you. She’ll make sure to get a better recording of the show, and bring some samples. Make sure to wear them while playing. It’ll help a lot for the campaign.” </p><p>“So, we’re launching faster than you first predicted,” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Megan said, her voice cheerful. “The scandal couldn’t have happened at a better time. Normally, even under the best of circumstances, it would have taken a couple weeks for me to get into the production schedule, but the scandal made Marl’s company cancel their production orders immediately, leaving the workshop in a lurch. They are willing to give me a deep discount as long as I start the production today.” </p><p>“Excellent news,” I answered with a chuckle. </p><p>“One more thing,” Megan added, sounding hesitant. “We have to break up.” </p><p>“Oh, already discarding your poor boy toy,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>Megan chuckled as well, responding to my jovial tone. “Exactly,” she said. </p><p>“As long as you don’t get a boyfriend for a month or so, it’s alright,” I said. Ordinarily, I wouldn’t have cared that much considering ours had been a deal of convenience in the first place, but my reputation for virility was an official part of my System, and I didn’t want to deal with some gossip about not being enough. “I have a reputation to maintain, after all,” I added.  </p><p>“No worries,” Megan answered. “I can’t be dealing with rumors of a reputation now that I’m going to change my outlook to a serious businesswoman. I’ll even make sure that everyone knows the only reason I broke up with you because it’s not appropriate to date while we work together.” </p><p>“Therefore distinguishing further yourself from the current scandal, maybe even turn that into your own marketing, smart,” I said. </p><p>“It’s good that you know,” Megan said smugly, ending the call, clearly happy with the way her business ambitions were developing. </p><p>I was as well. At this point, breaking up with Megan was better for me. Not that it stopped me when it came to having fun … but it had limited my actions seriously when it came to making some public spectacles. And, those, I needed to test Lust Domain further. </p><p>Still, the progress was fun… Especially since that progress came with some significant earning potential.  </p><p>I wished that I could take full credit for the smooth development, but it was just vindictive revenge against a man who tried to insult me by trying to tow my car … the rest was just a beautiful coincidence. </p><p>As I drove back, I felt a flicker in the backseat. I checked the mirror, only to see my tortoise pet looking at me. “Are you bored?” I asked, ignoring the ridiculous feeling coming from talking to an animal. Considering he nodded seriously,  it was not a particularly big misunderstanding. </p><p>“Good, come watch me play some ball, then,” I asked. He made a subtle movement, one that was hard to decipher, but from the feeling it gave, it felt like the tortoise equivalent of a shrug. I looked at him, then paused. “I didn’t give you a name yet, did I?” I said. “Do you want one?” </p><p>He nodded. </p><p>“Excellent, how about Death, Destroyer of the Worlds,” I said, and exploded in laughter. The sight of a tortoise in the back seat, giving me a deadpan stare was too amusing. “How about George?” I followed. Negative. “Mike?” Negative. “Rex?”</p><p>This time, I received a frustrated glare as he leaned forward, put his front leg on one of my books, and flickered. I saw him outside of the car before he blinked back, but the book ended up discarded. A strong protest. </p><p>“Okay, no dog names,” I said, raising one hand in surrender. Then, I looked at him, and noticed a detail. His shell had darkened considerably since yesterday. “How about Mr. Black?” I asked.  </p><p>This time, he paused a bit before nodding. He found the name satisfactory. A beast of simple tastes… </p><p>And, just like that, a notification popped into my sight. </p><p>[Totem Animals, category updated. (Black Tortoise [1])]</p><p>Interesting, I thought. It felt like a significant change, one that needed to be analyzed more.  </p><p>I added it to my ever-growing mental list of tasks to be done… </p>
