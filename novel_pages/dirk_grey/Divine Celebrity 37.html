        <p>“She’s a bit of a slave driver, isn’t she?” I said as I turned my smirk toward Megan, but I didn’t bother keeping my voice down. “Should I be afraid of our date?” </p><p>“You should definitely be if you don’t start moving,” Kim ordered from the side, yet, despite her sharp tone, a fleeting smile was on her face.  </p><p>“What a taskmaster,” I murmured, which earned an amused glare from Megan. “Oh, man. It’s such a big chore,” I murmured even as I hooked my arm around Megan’s waist, pulling her against my chest. The pressure on her breasts was very pleasant. </p><p>The camera started to take our pictures. Yet, Megan clearly didn’t appreciate my flippant tone, another growl left her lips, and for a moment, I thought that I had pushed her too much. Yet, she stayed silent as my fingers started dancing on her back. </p><p>A minute later, Kim commented. “Not bad, but give me something more impressive. Maybe a kiss. </p><p>“Good idea, but I don’t think Megan could handle that. We don’t want her following me like a puppy once we break up—“ I started, only Megan’s fingers to dig into my shoulder. While I considered whether I pushed too far even with the assistance of my Traits, Megan had already grabbed my chin… </p><p>And pulled me into a searing kiss. </p><p>My eyes widened as her tongue slipped inside. Ironically, the movement of her tongue was sharp and aggressive, suggesting that, yes, she had been annoyed by my action, but not as much as canceling her plans. That didn’t mean that she was unaffected, as the movement of her tongue suggested that she wanted to dominate me as a payback — maybe even leaving me on the edge as we finish our little game as she did the last time in her car after the lap dance. </p><p>Such a vindictive blonde. </p><p>Admittedly, her attitude was hardly a deal-breaker for me, especially with her legs wrapping around my waist, pressing our bodies even tighter while her tongue ravaged my mouth. </p><p>I wasn’t the one that cared about the audience, but the constant clicks of a huge, professional camera as Kim walked on the edge of the pool, working to record our show, was enough to give me a hint of self-consciousness. If it wasn’t for the tangible benefits in the form of Heroic Traits I might receive as a result, I might even balk at the prospect. </p><p>Even with that, I was tense. </p><p>Then, Megan’s tongue slipped even deeper, working wonders to make me ignore the sexy redhead doing her best to record our display. My tongue joined the fray as I retaliated against her aggression, with no intention of accepting her claim for dominance easily.</p><p>I didn’t want a repeat of our car adventure.  </p><p>Since her legs were around my waist, keeping her in place, my hands were free to wander on her body. After some dance, they landed on her hips, giving her ass a hard squeeze, enough to leave a small yet lingering mark. </p><p>A gasp of pain left her mouth. “Careful!” she warned, her expression cross. “You’re going to leave a mark.” </p><p>“Isn’t it better,” I answered shamelessly even as I squeezed her ass again, earning another small yelp. “Some bruises would help you sell the story even more. Isn’t this right, Kim?” I asked. </p><p>“Definitely,” Kim answered, her smile getting wider as she enjoyed her friend’s predicament. </p><p>“Assholes,” Megan murmured, though, despite her tone, a distinctive blush slowly spread her face, showing she wasn’t as unaffected as my little additions as she wanted us to think. Her quickened breathing, pushing her barely covered breasts forward was just another evidence of her mood. </p><p>Excellent. </p><p>She leaned for another kiss, and my hands returned their mission to squeeze and caress her ass, the combined assault of my tongue and my fingers working wonders, especially with my Seduction Trait enhanced my instincts for timing and teasing. </p><p>With that improvement, even the idea of her staying completely unaffected by our passionate kiss would have been insulting. </p><p>As our battle continued, my tongue soon took the dominant position. Megan was clearly split about how to feel about that. On one hand, her fingers were digging into my shoulders, wordlessly threatening me to pull back. Yet, on the other hand, her hips started to rock, which, considering our bodies were only separated by our swimwear, represented a considerable source of pleasure. </p><p>When she pulled back for another breather, she was gasping desperately. While she was catching her breath, I caught Kim’s gaze for a moment, only to see Megan wasn’t the only one starting to feel hot and bothered. I could see signs of a blush creeping up her beautiful neck, though her face was covered with her camera. </p><p>She might be aroused, but she continued to take our photos with absolute seriousness despite what her body might be feeling. She was taking her job seriously more than I expected. </p><p>Yet, as I looked at her, she lowered her camera momentarily, revealing her face was blushing as well. Catching my gaze, she winked at me before speaking in a serious voice. “Try to look a bit sexier, Megan.”  </p><p>“What do you mean, try to look sexier,” Megan answered as she turned to her friend, insulted by the insinuation that she might not actually be alluring. Yet, even as she looked at her friend, her hips continued to rock, testing my willpower. “Who do you think you’re speaking to?” </p><p>“No need to act out, honey,” Kim answered, Megan’s aggressive retaliation only making her smile bigger. “Everyone knows that you’re beautiful, but the passion is not coming out properly on the camera. You need to work harder. Give me something that would look good on the camera.” </p><p>“How?” Megan asked. “I’m doing my best, it’s not my fault that I’m dealing with the equivalent of a boring statue.” </p><p>I was tempted to answer her personal attack, but since it was a scuffle between friends, I decided to stay silent even with the occasional pot-shot I received in the process. “There’s no problem in your chemistry, sweetie. You look good on the camera. The problem is that, even with the attraction between you two, it looks dull on the camera. We can’t sell the story of a secret recording like this. I need more.” </p><p>“And what do you propose?” Megan murmured, looking at her friend suspiciously. “Should we try a different pose?”  </p><p>“No, we need something simpler. Your top needs to go,” Kim offered. </p><p>“No,” Megan countered immediately. “I’m not going to put my tits for everyone to ogle. Having a topless picture on the net would damage my prospects significantly.”</p><p>“I know how the business works, sweetie, and it’s not what I’m saying. You don’t have to show your tits to the camera. I can’t take a direct shot of them with that hunk’s chest on the way. Of course, if you want that bitch to win and ruin everything…” </p><p>Megan closed her eyes as she considered her words, but her legs, tensing around my body, gave a much better indication of her action, even before her hand sneaked toward her back. </p><p>Since I was a gentleman, I decided to help her. “Let me get it,” I whispered with a chuckle as I reached the little knot that was keeping her top in place, and tugged it off. It came off with surprising ease, leaving her almost completely naked, though the existence of her bottom, barely more than a collection of strings only counted as a technicality. </p><p>Pity I wasn’t able to catch a good glimpse of the show, but considering she had prevented me from getting a good view by pressing her chest against mine, it wasn’t exactly a big loss. The feeling of her naked breast was more than enough to compensate for it. </p><p>“Let’s continue,” I said as I pressed my lips against her, one hand massaging her ass, the other dancing on her naked back, the lack of a top allowing a smooth journey. A smoothness that I rarely experienced, in a way I could easily recognize as the assistance of the Traits, a feeling I had experienced in many different areas, from Intimidation to Pattern Recognition. </p><p>Yet, regardless of the source, my fingers danced over her back, triggering her pleasure enough to make her tongue stagger in my mouth, drowning in pleasure.  </p><p>However, even as her lips staggered, her hips started to move faster. </p><p>Her little photoshoot was getting more and more interesting… </p>
