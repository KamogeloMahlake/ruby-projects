        <p>Sarah froze at the words that came from behind her, while I examined her. Said Miss Warrick was still blushing, but it was less intense than her earlier reaction, which was enough to confirm that she had no idea what was going on. </p><p>After all, what was going on under the table was much more impressive than the little kiss she had stumbled upon.  </p><p>Carrie didn’t wait before answering. “This is Chad, Miss Warrick, a transfer student that joined our school the last week.” </p><p>“Oh, last week,” she said with a shy chuckle. “I see that you’re making your best to accommodate him.” </p><p>Carrie froze for a moment, thinking that she realized what was going on. “She’s talking about the kiss,” I whispered to her. “Well, you know how it goes…” Carrie said, relaxed, but not enough to sound calm. </p><p>Miss Warrick chuckled. “Don’t worry, I remember. I was young before.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” Carrie immediately retorted. “You’re still young.” </p><p>She blushed. “I don’t know about that…” </p><p>Sarah didn’t react, still busy trying to contain her moans as my toes landed on her panties, gently massaging her core to push her closer toward the climax. </p><p>I chuckled. “I agree with Carrie, you have nothing to worry about,” I said as I caught her gaze, putting a naughty smile on my face. Admittedly, such a trick was more effective on enthusiastic young women like Carrie rather than a mature woman, but…</p><p>Miss Warrick showed that, while she might be a mature woman physically, her mentality wasn’t too different from Carrie, blushing under my gaze. Never miss such an opportunity, my smirk widened even as I let my gaze down, taking a lengthy glimpse of her body. </p><p>And she just froze under. </p><p>I wondered how long it would take for her to give a reaction. Pity, it was not something I would be able to learn, interrupted by Carrie, in the form of an elbow thrust to my ribs, digging painfully. </p><p>“Do you girls know when Ida will return, or will she stay with Irene?” Miss Warrick asked, clearly anxious to change the topic. “I can’t reach her, again.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” Carrie said with a shrug. “You know them, one distracted by her camera, the other distracted by her costumes.” </p><p>“I know,” she said. “Still, she should be more thoughtful. As long as she’s here, I’m responsible for her. I don’t want to badger her much but…” </p><p>“You’re right, Miss Warrick. I have another talk with her,” Carrie said. </p><p>“Thanks, sweetie, you’re the best,” Miss Warrick said, then turned back and disappeared once again, doing her best to avoid my gaze. </p><p>“Miss Warrick is the host for Ida, since she’s an exchange student,” Carrie explained at my questioning gaze. “Since she plans to continue college here, her family decided it was a good way for her to acclimatize.”  </p><p>I nodded, finding the explanation rather sufficient, and silence ruled the group for a moment. Carrie tried to focus on the books sprawled in front of her, which was harder than usual as I continuously squeezed her beautiful hips, challenging her ability to stay silent.</p><p>Sarah was suffering a more difficult challenge with my foot dancing over her core, her thin panties losing their already limited ability to isolate my touch as they got wetter and wetter. She kept her head lowered, making a show of checking the screen of her phone. </p><p>She could have stood up easily, of course, but doing so would mean admitting defeat. </p><p>But that was not an option she took. If she wasn’t headstrong enough to jump to such challenges — no matter how ill-advised — we wouldn’t have been in this position in the first place. </p><p>As we continued, she had occasional failures, one or two muffled moans escaping her mouth, but Carrie kept her gaze on the books sprawled in front of her, acting like she hadn’t noticed that. </p><p>It was supposed to be suspicious, especially with Sarah’s growing suspicion, but amusingly, it wasn’t, and that wasn’t too surprising. I had seen Carrie showing a remarkable ability to block what was going on around her as she focused on her studying. Once she focused on her book, there was a fifty-fifty chance that she would miss a truck barreling into the store. </p><p>In comparison, missing a few moans was nothing out of ordinary. </p><p>“Any plans for the week, Sarah?” I asked, teasing her. It was a naughty move, but remembering how she treated Naomi when we were together, it was hard to argue she didn’t deserve it. </p><p>She looked at me, her eyes wide. “I plan to — focus on my history project,” she murmured, interrupted halfway by a panicked widening of her eyes as my foot moved, but managing to suppress her moan in the process. </p><p>“I thought the delivery is three weeks later,” I asked. </p><p>“So?” Sarah answered, not comprehending the question. </p><p>I just chuckled, her attitude reminding me that while her attitude might be rougher than her friends, ultimately, she was no less focused on her studies. “Nothing,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>She might have followed that up, but under the insistent wiggle of my feet, she soon gained other priorities like trying to suppress her voice. </p><p>I could see a small smile on Carrie’s face, satisfaction mixing with arousal as she watched her friend struggle, no doubt enjoying the switch of the fates. Before my arrival, Sarah had been the one to push Carrie, trying to understand what was truly going on, and the switch was, without a doubt, extremely entertaining. </p><p>Her smile widened when a beautiful grunt escaped Sarah’s mouth, followed by a beautiful tremble. A bit quick, but considering the public location, I wasn’t shocked by her over-stimulation. </p><p>I pulled my foot back. Sarah looked at me with gratitude, thinking I showed her mercy, but she was wrong, at least about the reason. </p><p>I just didn’t want to destroy the layer of plausible deniability earlier than necessary. I wanted to enjoy the situation as much as possible before the inevitable fallout hit. </p><p>“I need to go visit … the ladies' room,” Sarah murmured a moment later as she stood up, and stumbled to the bathroom rapidly, not waiting for an answer. Meanwhile, I turned my gaze toward Carrie, enjoying her growing smirk. </p><p>Carrie watched her leave, snickering. I looked at her once Sarah disappeared. “I see that you’re pushing your luck,” I said. </p><p>Which earned a shocked glare from her. “Really, you’re saying that?” she countered. I had several answers to that, but I decided against it when my phone buzzed with a message from Ida. </p><p>“Oh,” Carrie said. “I forgot to ask, how did it go.” </p><p>I said nothing as I unlocked my phone and checked the message, which had no words, and just a photo. </p><p>A beautiful photo of a panicking Irene, once again wearing scraps of her costume — which covered even less than before after the challenging process it had gone through.   </p><p> “Not bad,” Carrie murmured, impressed. “I see that Ida is once again a dictator with a camera.” </p><p>“Oh, yeah, the switch is very impressive, almost unbelievable as someone else,” I said. </p><p>“Wh0—“ Carrie asked reflexively, which was quick to die under my gaze. “I’m not like that,” she defended. </p><p>“Oh, I must be remembering a different busty blonde who went from getting shy from a kiss to arranging the seduction of all of her friends in a week,” I said. </p><p>“You better not,” she warned, trying to sound angry, but it came as intimidating as a cute kitten trying to be loud.  </p><p>I chuckled as I grabbed her hair, pulling her for another searing kiss, one that was only interrupted by another photo from Ida, giving us some time to appreciate the bound figure of her redheaded friend. </p><p>I was curious just how far she would push, but before we could make a decision, the bathroom door opened once more. “I need to go back home to continue my research, Carrie, do you mind dropping me?” she asked.  </p><p>“Oh, I thought you said it wasn’t urgent,” Carrie said, amused by her sudden change of attitude. Justified considering Sarah had forcefully intruded into her study session to dig into her secrets. </p><p>“I realized I miscalculated. I still need to finish my application essays, and since I came here with you…” </p><p>“I don’t know, I still need to study,” Carrie murmured.</p><p>“Why don’t I drop you,” I answered, interrupting Carrie. “I don’t have anything to do.” </p><p>“I don’t want to bother you—“ Sarah started. </p><p>“Nonsense,” I cut her short. “It would be my pleasure.” </p><p>Sarah looked hesitant. “I don’t know, a bike is not the safest.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I can borrow the car if you’re afraid of riding a bike,” I suggested. </p><p>The stab at her pride worked excellently. “Nonsense, of course, I’m not afraid,” she declared, her reaction almost automatic. </p><p>“Excellent, then we can go,” I said, and walked away from the table after leaning down for one last kiss, intense enough to add jealousy to the confusing mess of emotion Sarah was trying to deal with. “Let’s go,” I said as I passed her, and she followed me outside…</p>
