        <p>It was good that my little princess — an actual one with connections with the Imperial Family rather than just a fancy noble with titles to boost her name — was too distracted by her loss of virginity as she sank herself into my shaft, her eyes firmly closed to enjoy the feeling. </p><p>I appreciated it, as it gave me a chance to think.</p><p>From a certain perspective, I wasn’t wrong. After all, I had already guessed she was an unlucky noble who found herself on the run due to house politics, and during her escape, lost her already limited support during her escape, until she had become prey of the slavers. </p><p>I just didn’t expect her family to be the Imperial one, the only entity that was stronger than the Patrician houses that I was trying to infiltrate. </p><p>That wasn’t to say the Eastern Roman Empire was stronger than the Republic, but in the Republic, the highest power was distributed among not only several Patrician families, but also to the rest of the Senatorial class — quite a number of them coming from lower families, including some commoners that distinguished themselves through military service. </p><p>In comparison, the Imperial family’s power was much more centralized, but as the story of Theodora suggested, that centralization also made them a target. Even in Britannia, I had heard when Emperor Zeno had been deposed in a bloody palace coup, with some very dangerous consequences for his supporters. </p><p>Theodora’s identity meant that she was on the top of that list, either to be captured and imprisoned to make sure she could lead no rebellion, no matter how unlikely, or discreetly executed. If it was earlier in my journey, when trying to escape a few pirates were consuming my full range of abilities, I might have run away with a scared cry. </p><p>At this point, while repeatedly infiltrating Patrician houses to access their libraries, it would be weird if it was my reaction still. Especially since, while the Imperial Family might be stronger than any single Patrician house, they were also hundreds of miles away, making them significantly less dangerous in comparison. </p><p>Ultimately, the decision was clear. </p><p>Although, I was honest enough to admit that the enthusiasm Theodora was showing as she jumped up and down on my lap was making that decision much easier. Also, it made it much easier to focus on the way her beautiful tits were jiggling rather than the long-term implications of a runaway member of the previous Imperial Dynasty. </p><p>She was absorbed by the explosive sensations of her first time, failing to notice the small mental break I had to take due to the incredible nature of her reveal, but she was quick to notice when my hands landed on her breasts, preventing their enthusiastic jumps even as I squeezed her nipples. </p><p>An enthusiastic moan escaped her mouth as her eyes opened, catching my gaze through the mirror. “Look at yourself,” I whispered into her ear. “Is this the face of an imperial princess?” </p><p>She said nothing, but the panicked gasp she let out as her eyes widened was beautiful. “No!” she gasped. </p><p>I chuckled. “Don’t tell me you just realized the implications of your answer,” I said with a chuckle. She nodded in panic, but when she tried to pull herself off my lap, I waited until she was almost successful before pushing her down, skewering her even deeper than she had been playing herself. </p><p>“No changing the seat,” I whispered even as I hugged her waist, enjoying the way she shivered against my touch. “Just tell me what’s the problem.” </p><p>“What’s the problem?” she repeated, her shock was clear. “I’m hunted by the whole Empire. Isn’t it enough?” </p><p>“Obviously not, considering I’m happily enjoying the way you’re wrapped around my shaft rather than running away, or whatever paltry bounty the old general might offer,” I said, even as I lifted her up, only to slam her down again, earning a delicious moan. “Constantinople is a long way away.” </p><p>“It can’t be that simple.” </p><p>“It is.” </p><p>“Not all people that would love to capture me lives there,” she countered, though her hips rocked gently even as she said so, showing despite her panic, the pleasure was not forgotten. “Any of the senators would love to have me as a bargaining chip against that traitor, or give me back for a favor.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Why are you still focusing on that? Are you trying to make me sell you to one of those snotty assholes?” I said, even as my fingers danced on her soft skin, enhancing her pleasure further and further. </p><p>“Of course not,” she whispered. “But I don’t want you to misunderstand the danger you’re in because of me.” </p><p>“Oh, such a thoughtful princess,” I whispered even as I grabbed her chin gently, making her turn. “But don’t worry. If I’m reckless enough to disguise myself as a slave to raid Patrician houses, I’m reckless enough to keep a beautiful princess to myself despite the risks,” I added, just before I leaned forward to capture her lips. </p><p>Her beautiful lips were hesitant to respond, making it an awkward kiss at first, her lips frozen in shock, still trying to understand the enormity of her slip, and my reaction. </p><p>Though with her core still tight around my girth, her hips rocking subconsciously, it was hardly stole anything from the eroticism of the moment. </p><p>I let the kiss continue, my lips slowly moving as I tried to coax her lips to join the dance. It took several breaths for her to react. Hesitant and slow at first as she tried to process the monumental mental shock she was struggling with, but soon, her primal desires started to overwhelm her concerns. Her lips started to answer. </p><p>I pulled back a minute later, leaving her gasping and panting. “Wow,” she gasped. “That was…”</p><p>“Delicious,” I completed her words, happy that her focus on the political side of the issues disappeared. She was still excited, flushed, and trembling, but when I leaned against her lips, she responded much stronger. </p><p>It was the time to push the envelope a bit, I decided as I gently grabbed her face, my tongue pushing forward aggressively. Her lips opened immediately,  inviting inside. Her tongue tried to copy mine, starting a battle, only to be dominated aggressively. </p><p>Not that she had any problems with it, if her hips, rocking faster and faster was any indicator. </p><p>The whining plea that escaped her lips despite the kiss was even more beautiful. I let my hands drift down, caressing her beautiful tits in the process before I arrived at my ultimate target, her beautiful, tight ass. </p><p>A gasp escaped her mouth as my fingers sank into her flesh and assisted her movement, turning her gentle rocking into a furious dance, ramming my shaft into her harder and harder, her body responding to each thrust with growing enthusiasm. </p><p>A shocked gasp escaped her mouth when I pulled out of her suddenly, only to throw her on the bed, on her hands and knees before taking her from behind just as quickly. “Who’s a good princess?” I growled even as I held her hair. </p><p>If I was going to take the risk of harboring a fugitive princess, I was going to enjoy it immensely. </p><p>“I am,” she moaned. </p><p>“Louder,” I ordered even as I slapped her ass, only for her to tighten even more. </p><p>“I am a good princess,” she moaned, even louder, as I invaded her insides with increasing aggression, tightening more and more to earn her ultimate reward, spanks landing on her skin more. It was delicious to see just how fast her arousal and hero worship to fold into total submission. </p><p>My own princess. </p>
