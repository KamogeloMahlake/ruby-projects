        <title>Wild Dragon of Rome - End of Book 1 notes</title>

        <p>Hi, everyone. </p><p>The battle is finally over, and our dear bastard Marcus has finally taken the first step of his revenge. </p><p>A few quick notes about the schedule. First, the schedule. I'll stop publishing Wild Dragon for a while to plan the second book and tidy up the first book for publishing publicly on Royal Road and other platforms. </p><p>That means I won't be publishing new chapters for a few weeks. I'll probably start publishing it somewhere mid August. Meanwhile, you'll be getting Blacksmith vs. the System chapters as a bonus. </p><p>I hope you all enjoy what I planned for the future. </p>
