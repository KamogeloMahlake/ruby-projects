        <p>“Well, beautiful. Did you decide how you’re going to pay?” I asked while she continued to tremble in my seat. </p><p>“Pay for what,” she muttered, still dazed. </p><p>“For my skills as a photographer, of course,” I replied as I grabbed her waist once more to pin her against the bike. I had already gathered all the information I could safely get from her from the moment, but I didn’t stop the seduction. While technically it was about making sure I could replicate the trick …</p><p>The real answer was it was incredibly fun. After all, even discounting our identities, she was still a busty, extremely sexy redhead who was currently dressed in nothing but a misaligned skirt and leather boots. Hardly a chore to interact with her. </p><p>“Give me your number,” she whispered. I did, and a moment later, my phone buzzed. I received a photo of her from her back, my body pressing against hers. It showed the beautiful arc of her back as I pulled her head back, but didn’t show her face. </p><p>“One that doesn’t show your pretty face contorted with pleasure. Maybe I should ask for another,” I asked. </p><p>“You have to buy dinner first for that,” she quipped, and I chuckled. She managed to stand up. “I think I need to visit the bathroom first before we go…” she started as she looked at the shop, only to freeze. “D-did you know we had a voyeur,” she whispered. </p><p>“Sweetie,” I said as I slapped her ass. “We have just done it in the parking lot. We’re lucky that we had only one voyeur and the camera is broken,” I said. Her face suddenly lost color, showing that, it was less about exhibitionism and more about losing control. </p><p>I had to admit, the idea tickled my pride. </p><p>“I’m going to the bathroom,” she repeated, blushing. </p><p>“Well, if you say so,” I said. “Do you want to watch as I punish our voyeur,” I added. </p><p>“Punish, how?” she said, her voice suddenly gaining an edge. I realized my misstep. She might be playing along for her own fun, but she was still a hero, and she wouldn’t let a civilian come under harm. Of course, my mistake wasn’t to harm her but to use an ambiguous statement. </p><p>Going forward, I needed to be more careful. “Taking what we are owed, of course,” I said. “She had watched a show of ours. Don’t you think she owes one to us as well?” I asked. </p><p>“You can’t force her,” she said. </p><p>I put my hand on my chest, acting like she had just hit me there. “Honey, you’re insulting me. I never once forced a woman to do that,” I said, then smiled. “You have just sampled my services, do you think I need to? Maybe I misread, and your shouts were a call for help. They were loud enough to qualify, particularly when —” I added, each word making her blush even more. She interrupted me with a punch to my shoulder. </p><p>“That’s enough, I got it!” she said, her head dipping down. </p><p>“Violent much,” I whispered, then I grabbed her chin. Not hard, but gently. “Also, I don’t like being attacked, even jokingly, so be careful,” I whispered, doing my best to be dark and threatening, knowing full well that she would only feel arousal and no threat, once again thanks to her power. “Understood.” </p><p>“Yes,” she whispered, her legs parting slightly, showing that she would be very amenable to another show. </p><p>“Excellent. Now, do you want to punish our wayward cashier,” I whispered. </p><p>At the peak of her arousal, there was only one answer she could give. “Yes.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I hugged her waist and led her inside, not even bothering to give her time to fix her clothing. She tried to do so on the way, pulling and pushing, but she was too distracted to use her power for it, and she was still a sexy mess when we were inside the shop until we stood in front of the sexy blonde cashier. </p><p>Dressed in leather, the cashier was certainly delicious, and her deep blush as she realized she had been caught made it even more fun. The way my current partner looked, didn’t help her contain her blush any.</p><p>A glance was enough to confirm that getting that show wouldn’t be particularly difficult. “You owe us a show,” I declared even as I hugged Daria from behind. </p><p>“I … I beg your pardon,” she replied, looking shocked. </p><p>“My pretty friend here saw you watching us. Didn’t you, sweetie?” I said as I hugged Daria’s waist. It was another subtle trick, making sure she was not just a passive observer but an actual contributor. </p><p>“Y-yes. You were watching us,” Daria said, her tone far too hesitant to be coming from the Lady of Destruction, showing that she was not ready for such a confrontation. </p><p>Not ready, but still wanting, as the arousal was still present. </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I caressed her belly, climbing up until the edge of her breast, which was not covered by her hastily fixed top. She moaned as the pleasure spread through her aching body, and she lost her ability to speak. </p><p>I turned to the cashier. “As you see, she’s very insistent that you have to pay back for seeing her in such a slutty, undignified manner, giving herself to me like a two-dollar hooker in a parking lot,” I whispered, each exciting my sexy redhead even more. </p><p>She once again lost herself in excitement, abandoning herself to the role of a rich girl, the impact of my earlier gaffe gone. Excellent. </p><p>“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do,” the cashier whispered, but she was clearly enjoying our show. </p><p>“Well, you’re a smart girl. You’ll figure it out,” I said, easily reading that she was at the edge. Everything was perfect —</p><p>Until our fun was interrupted by a phone ringing. Daria’s phone, but the ringtone was different. Her eyes popped open as she reached for her phone. Any other girl, any other time, I would have interrupted to not ruin the excellent fun. </p><p>But, one didn’t get in between a superhero and what was clearly an emergency call. “I need to take this,” she whispered as she walked out. I let her go. Outside, she had a brief talk, and mentioned several codes, though it felt more like emergency service codes than spy ones, aiming to condense information rather than hiding it. </p><p>“You’re lucky … or not,” I said as I looked at the cashier, and watched her expression dance between relief and excitement. It looked like she didn’t know which either. “I wonder what you’ll do if we return. Ignore the offer, or decide to continue…” </p><p>With that, I left the store, just as Daria ended the call. “I need to go back to my apartment. It’s an emergency,” she said, her voice leaving no doubt she would seek alternative methods if I didn’t comply. </p><p>“Sure, hop on. What’s another ride,” I said. She didn’t react to innuendo. I didn’t expect her to in the first place. I just said that to keep her from being suspicious. “Do you want me to go a reasonable pace, or as fast as I could go?” </p><p>“Even faster,” she said as she put her helmet on. I put the newly purchased helmet on as well, wondering about the exact nature of the emergency. Since she was willing to drive with me instead of flying directly and ruining her cover, it was not an extreme emergency, but it was clearly not a leisurely task either. </p><p>“Alright, hold on,” I said as I pushed my bike to its limits as I ripped through the city streets. I didn’t even bother with the sudden sharp turns unless they were necessary, though, I noted that while she was afraid of them, she had a far easier time ignoring them when she was focused on the mission. </p><p>It made me realize just how great the difference was between her mission mode and casual attitude … reminding me not to underestimate her even with my incredible success. </p><p>Soon, we parked in front of an apartment building that was even worse than the others that surrounded it, showing that her financials for the mission were even worse than I had expected. “Thanks for the ride,” she said as she jumped down. </p><p>“Not without a kiss,” I said as I removed my helmet, feeling like pushing my luck. Her expression flickered in confusion for a moment, but then she leaned forward, capturing my lips in a kiss. </p><p>It was an aggressive, domineering kiss. It felt very different than the passive and excited kisses she delivered while in disguise. But, as her tongue invaded her mouth, she still gave a lot of signals of attraction, showing that, even in her hero mentality, the attraction wasn’t gone. </p><p>Too bad it didn’t last long. She bounced away soon after, leaving me with an excellent view of her ass as her skirt bounced, the absence of her panties paying incredible dividends. </p><p>I rode away with a big smile. The emergency call might have ruined my plans somewhat, but the day still had been an incredible success… I made contact with the Lady of Destruction, gathered her contacts, and discovered her home. </p><p>And most importantly, I discovered her mission. Now, I needed to decide what to do about it. </p>
