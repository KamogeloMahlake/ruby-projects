        <p>Pearyin’s arms were tight around me as we kissed, seeing the comfort of the physical release. The opportunity to tease her was tempting, but I decided to ignore it. With everything going on, she was too fragile, and required comforting more than pleasure…</p><p>I started kissing her neck gently even as I rubbed her back, signaling to her that I would not go. Her arms around me stayed strong even as she shuddered with pleasure. It was not like her, showing just how much she was unsettled by it. </p><p>“Sweetie. I can’t comfort you if you don’t let me go,” I whispered, but only after a few minutes. A blush crept to her cheeks, and then her arms around me weakened.</p><p>“Sorry—“ she started, but I interrupted her with a searing kiss that left her breathless. </p><p>“Nothing to be sorry for,” I replied, happy to see her losing that desperation. “But, if you want to pay back, why don’t you put on a little show for me.” </p><p>She received the message as she took a step behind, and started dancing. It wasn’t the first time I asked her to put on a show for me, but this time, it was more beautiful, more enchanting. Her cultivation added a flexible charm to her dance. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I whispered as her hands traveled down, caressing her breasts over her clothing, while subtly unlacing its front. Her cleavage widened slowly along with my smile, tempting me to interrupt her dance. </p><p>I ignored that temptation for one important reason. I could see her desperation slowly receding as she danced and received positive reactions. Her thoughts were transparent. She was lost and afraid, and wanted me to stay with her. She also knew that I had important things to handle to ensure our security. </p><p>Unconsciously, she probably thought that, by proving that she could attract me, she could ensure my return. It was good to finally watch her trying to take some initiative, so I let her. </p><p>Not like watching an erotic dance that was somehow supernaturally enhanced was a punishment. </p><p>She continued dancing even as she shed her clothing, stripping to her underclothes. My eyes widened as I noticed, that rather than wearing something practical, she had been wearing a transparent silk shirt that looked incredible. </p><p>Someone had been prepared for my arrival. </p><p>I smirked, and her expression turned as delicious as her body covered with transparent silk. She blushed, feeling self-conscious about her attempt at planned seduction, but it made her dance even more alluring. </p><p>She was innocent and sexy at the same time. The perfect balance. </p><p>Once she got rid of all her clothes other than the silk set, I gestured to her to move closer. She stilled. “Don’t stop dancing,” I asked. </p><p>She followed it while I picked a rock and sat. Once she approached, the dance turned into a beautiful mixture of lap dance and an epic show. I wanted to watch it for hours … but also, I wanted to unwrap my present immediately. </p><p>“I could watch you forever, but,” I whispered. </p><p>“But, you need to leave,” she completed, her desolation back. </p><p>“No, I can’t resist such a beautiful dance,” I said as I grabbed her silk dress and ripped it off aggressively. It was not only fun, but also it showed Pearyin that she was successful in tempting me. </p><p>“Oh,” she moaned as I grabbed her waist as tightly as her desperate hug earlier while I pushed my pants down. Her back arched as I wrapped her, her body begging for my touch more than anything else. </p><p>I could have slipped inside her easily, but that would mean ignoring another opportunity for her to ‘serve’ me. I  pushed her on her knees. “Open your mouth, and serve me,” I ordered. </p><p>Her lips parted open readily, her smile beautiful before it was destroyed by my push. I was immediately between her lips, pushing back and forth as I invaded her throat mercilessly. Another benefit of cultivation, she took it like a champion despite her inexperience, her moans rippling around my shaft. </p><p>Spectacular. </p><p>Her lips tightened, increasing my pleasure even more. I grabbed her hair hard, pushing her down, which only made her moan harder as I tickled the depths of her throat. </p><p>I couldn’t help but appreciate the difference between her and Aisnam. With Aisnam, even if we played around sometimes, there was no doubt she always believed herself to be the dominant and superior party. </p><p>Not a complaint, as it was still incredible, but I appreciated the variety. </p><p>I soon abandoned that track and returned to the present, letting myself be distracted by the pleasure. I focused on what mattered. </p><p>Our pleasure. </p><p>When I pulled out, I pushed her against the cave wall and took her from behind aggressively. She moaned as I invaded her wetness, the way our flesh clapped making me glad that we were in the middle of the wilderness. </p><p>“You’re beautiful, and you’re mine,” I whispered even as one of my hands trailed her spine, climbing gently with great contrast to my merciless invasion. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she moaned back. “I’m yours.” </p><p>I pulled out and flipped her so that her back was against the cave wall. I slipped inside her again, but I came face to face with her. “Then, believe me when I say I won’t discard you,” I whispered. </p><p>Everything until now suggested that there was some kind of supernatural higher power that saddled her with me, so there was no guarantee that I would succeed. From one perspective, the feeling of being toyed with was annoying … but considering everything fate could deliver, some kind of sexy super cultivator obsessed with pleasuring me was hardly the worst. </p><p>I would even say it was very near the top.  </p><p>“I believe you, sir,” she said as her legs wrapped around me. At the same time, her hips started to rock with a shockingly alluring pattern that was supposed to be impossible with her current leverage, showing another benefit of her new cultivation. </p><p>I soon exploded inside her, but her hips didn’t slow down even for a second. “More, sir. Please,” she begged. </p><p>I complied. “Five more minutes,” I whispered, but I had a feeling that it would be even longer… </p>
