        <p>The challenge of unlocking her phone was not exactly simple, particularly since I didn’t have the luxury of taking it with me. I would have only one chance to unlock the screen protector, and even then, I would have to find a position that would keep her looking in a different direction.</p><p>The worst, all the while, I would have to maintain my attention on her completely to make sure she was lost in her ecstasy and not notice what was going on. Well, at least from a mission perspective, as otherwise, railing a sexy redhead dressed as a horny biker chick on top of a working bike was closer to the purest definition of heaven even without the ego boost from taming the famous Lady of Destruction.</p><p>“Do you feel like repeating your words, princess?” I said as I put my helmet on the bike, with her phone still inside, making sure it stayed in my reach for the eventual opportunity. “Because if you say those again, there’s no turning back.”</p><p>Only after seeing her flinch, I realized my mistake. I had called her the Lady of Destruction in my mind, forgetting her official name as Blue Princess.</p><p>I decided to distract her directly. I pushed my pants down to reveal my arousal and pressed against her wetness. “Looks like I’m not the cowardly one, miss the spoiled rich girl,” I followed, using an alternative to make her feel it was just an accident. “I shouldn’t have bothered a spoiled little girl like you. I should have known that, when it’s time to —” I added, goading her into action.</p><p>It worked spectacularly. Her legs tightened around my waist once more as she skewered herself with my cock. “You — were — saying,” she gasped, gleeful in her victory.</p><p>“Yes, you win. I don’t know just how I could live with such a great loss,” I teased her even as I moved my hands to her hips, and started ramming her aggressively. As a culmination of everything we had been doing, she was already at the edge, and the thrilling location didn’t make it any easier for her to resist the explosion of pleasure.</p><p>She looked spectacular as her body trembled, a beautiful dazzled expression on her face. I continued to impale her, enjoying her tightness, the mission to break into her phone momentarily shelved. I wanted to enjoy the first few moments of my time with the famous Lady of Destruction properly, etching the details in my mind.</p><p>She should have stopped me, thinking that we had gone too far, but instead, she parted her legs even wider, allowing me to access her core as she treated the thin seat of the bike as the most luxurious bed possible.</p><p>She said nothing as I continued ramming into her, her face filled with pleasure, which, unlike some of the aspects she was faking, was perfectly fitting for a spoiled rich girl to wear as she banged by a big bad biker.</p><p>She embraced her role.</p><p>I grabbed her top and pulled it down, the fragile fabric giving up a bit. ”How careless of me,” I muttered. “Let me cover them up!”</p><p>“Jerk—” she said as she saw the huge smile on my face, but that was all she was able to say before I started playing her with her nipples. I had learned exactly how to treat them to trigger her pleasure further, and her planned admonishment died a premature death just like her top did.</p><p>I could see that she was surprised by my reckless actions, but not enough to ask me to stop, or even slow down. She was already lost in the land of pleasure, as if she had been drinking from a fountain she had never tasted before.</p><p>Maybe she never did, I realized. It wouldn’t be a stretch to believe her other partners were aware of her identity, therefore couldn’t even imagine treating her like a bored rich whore looking for a proper fucking to calm down.</p><p>Even with my power, I doubted I would have dared without the circumstances forcing me. After all, my power was not omnipotent, capable of making mistakes — just like my failure to recognize her before catching her using her powers on the camera — and moreover, it wasn’t capable of seeing the future.</p><p>There was nothing preventing her from returning a few days later, and decided that since she regretted her brief stint as a biker girl, I should spend the rest of my extremely short life feeling regret as well.</p><p>Still, there must be something wrong with me as well, as I realized that thought didn’t scare me. Instead, it excited me further. “Let’s give you a proper dicking, whore,” I said as I flipped her. Her belly pressed against the seat, turning the position into some kind of enhanced doggy.</p><p>I slapped her ass without thinking.</p><p>“Hey, be careful—” she moaned, which lasted only until I slid inside again, her words cut sharp with a wave of pleasure as I invaded her. I spanked her again. “Hey,” she moaned, but said nothing. I spanked again, falling into a beautiful rhythm, her deficient skirt doing nothing to reduce the blows.</p><p>Soon, even her half-hearted complaints disappeared, leaving their place to high-pitched moans, lost in pleasure. And, I wasn’t too far away.</p><p>I was ashamed to admit it, but it took me a long time to realize the current position was absolutely perfect to snoop through her phone as I wished. I was too distracted by the way her red hair stuck to her sweaty back, moving with her every desperate moan.</p><p>I grabbed her phone, leaned forward, and pulled her hair back. “How about a selfie, slut,” I said as I pulled her head back. She tensed. “Don’t worry. It’s your phone, I can’t spread it around,” I said, which was a reasonable concern.</p><p>Too bad it distracted her from the most important thing. As an undercover agent, she had just given me access to her phone to me. I took a few photos, and they looked amazing. “Look how slutty you are,” I said as I showed her the picture, and she tightened around me even further. “Do you want to see your ass?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said.</p><p>Excellent. It gave me a chance to browse her phone, and even better, it did so with her permission. Too bad I didn’t have too much time. Thirty seconds, maybe a minute was alright … but I couldn’t keep holding her phone for ten minutes without making her suspicious.</p><p>Luckily, my power was perfect browsing through a lot of information. The first thing I did was to check her messages. Most of them came from a woman called Rosa, who even had a picture attached, making it an absurd security risk.</p><p>As I checked the messages rapidly, I learned a few valuable things, including her real name.</p><p>Daria.</p><p>A quick check of her messages confirmed some of my guesses. She was there to check the warehouse like I had suspected, and visited my bar only because it allowed a nice base to operate further. She was aware that it was a ‘villain’ bar, but she visited it despite Rosa’s pointed warnings telling her that it would make her a target, Daria refused to listen to them, confident in her success.</p><p>There were several mentions of her training, showing that Rosa was the one who trained Daria alone. That surprised me, as Daria had shown signs of pretty stringent and effective training — which turned useless due to her arrogance and recklessness, but that was another topic.</p><p>As much as delving deeper into their relationship was entertaining, I decided to focus on different topics. But first, an excuse to hold the phone longer. I took a picture of her reddened ass as I buried it in her wetness.</p><p>“Look just how sexy you look,” I said I showed her the picture, and she tightened even more, and pulled back with the excuse of taking another picture.</p><p>This time, I focused on the reasons for their interest in the warehouse, and how they discovered it. The answer surprised me, but also did not. Apparently, they had managed to discover the warehouse by tracing some kind of teleport that had been used to drop a weapon shipment.</p><p>I had been wondering why the Syndicate hadn’t moved away from the warehouse, which had been answered. The teleporter must have some restrictions.</p><p>However, the reason why they were tracing was even more surprising. Their messages showed that they didn’t care about the harm the weapons might deliver, but they were interested in discovering who was responsible for making them.</p><p>They wanted to recruit them for their mission … which they only referred to as the mission. A pity.</p><p>Still, I had learned far more than I had expected, and even better, what I had learned was to my benefit.</p><p>Was I happy with the prospect of a potential super battle right at my doorstep where I might end up as collateral, not necessarily. Was it better than any of these parties focusing on me — or god forbid, gang together against me.</p><p>Without a doubt.</p><p>I spent the last few seconds of my ability to browse through her phone going through the details about Rosa. There was not much. A picture showed that she was a Latina woman, likely in her late thirties, but still looked amazing with curves to die for.</p><p>I memorized her phone number before pulling out of Daria, and pulled her down as well. “Now, smile, beautiful,” I said as I covered her face with my seed, took one last photo, and passed the phone to her.</p><p>She absentmindedly locked her phone again, dazed and panting, while I enjoyed my beautiful artwork.</p><p>Stained Destruction…</p>
