        <p>Even as he threw Laura’s panties to the side of the bed, Mark couldn’t believe the strength of his own heartbeat, throbbing at his ears louder than drums. He was well into his thirties, edging forty, but he couldn’t remember the last time he felt excitement traveling in his veins like molten metal. </p><p>However, as he looked down at the beautiful figure laying underneath him, wearing a sexy black lacy garter belt set —minus panties, instead of relying on twisting her hips slightly to hide her delicious treasure— he admitted that his excitement was justified. </p><p>It wasn’t even the beauty of her —not that she was anything less than gorgeous with her doe eyes, beautiful face, and delicious body— but her reaction to his presence. She looked at him differently than all those other beautiful girls he picked up from bars, an expression that he was aware that he reflected in his eyes. </p><p>One night stands were little more than exercising, more enjoyable than lifting weights in the gym, but exercise nonetheless. But with Laura looking at him, he could feel his emotions stirring for the first time in a long while. It was not love; he was sure of it, at least not the way people described it, with roses and butterflies. </p><p>No, it was a different thing, something between a desire to protect her, and turn her into his own possession. He felt like a dragon looking at a nubile princess, struck with a desire to lock her into his tower, to declare possession forever. So, while it was not fairy tale love, but it didn’t come second in terms of intensity. </p><p>“Are you ready, princess?” he said as he sneaked his hands behind her back, his palm enjoying the silky feeling of her back while the back of his hand rubbed against his smooth, expensive sheets. The combination it created was amazing, but it quickly lost its significance as he unhooked her bra with a smooth, practiced flick, revealing her perfect globes to his sight. </p><p>Laura didn’t answer with her words, but the slight shuffling of her lower body, giving a glimpse of her core, explained her mood better than any word could. </p><p>How could people treat such a fairy-like she was ugly just because she was slightly nerdy —well, very nerdy if he’s being honest— he wondered even as he leaned, leaving a lingering trail of kisses around her nipple, following the route created by her rosy nipple, but the furious beating of her heart excited him even more than the delicious aroma of her skin. </p><p>His lips stayed focused on her breasts even as Laura lay on her back limply, giving him full access to her beautiful body. A part of him —the burning, primal part that was begging him to lock her in a room and never let out— was begging him to ignore the foreplay and plunge into her wet depths furiously, locking her tiny body with his enormous muscular frame. </p><p>He suppressed that desire. He would have liked to claim that he did so because he had promised her to teach about the pleasures of the flesh, which required a gradual effort, but he was honest with himself to admit that he was afraid of scaring her. </p><p>The possibility of her asking him to stop and leave scared him more intensely than he thought to be possible. </p><p>Luckily, slowly caressing her body while covering her bosom with kisses wasn’t a horrible alternative. Far from it. Especially when she started letting out a string of moans, showing her appreciation to his diligent attention, the last hints of her reticence slowly melting under his diligent care. </p><p>However, rejecting the temptation to take her was getting harder and harder to deny…  </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>Laura was forced to admit that things were developing in a way she hadn’t expected, much more intense, not that she had solid expectations about how the things would develop in the first place owing to her inexperience when it came to the matters of the flesh. She was lying on Mark’s bed, naked —worse than naked, even, no underwear but stockings and garter belt— enjoying as he tenderly worshipped her body. </p><p>Not that she was unhappy about the gap between her expectations and the reality, considering her expectations were an uncaring quickie at best —which would still be her best sexual experience by far— and him laughing at her childishness before sending her away at worst. Enjoying the smoothness of his decadent bed while he slowly explored the sensitive spots of her body, discovering locations that even she didn’t know in the process, was more than even her wildest dreams. </p><p>She had one problem, though, her core was burning with an urgent need, with an intensity she had never tasted before. As much as she enjoyed his treatment, she wanted to shout him to move faster. Pity that she lacked the confidence to do so, limiting herself to passive enjoyment of his control. </p><p>Her lips parted open, letting out a string of moans as he slowly traveled down, painting her stomach with his kisses, their rubbing against each other. She closed her eyes, focusing on his lips, but doing so, she had missed something important. When he started traveling up once more, she felt their legs rubbing together, but this time, only her stockings were on the way. </p><p>She opened her eyes and looked down, only to see a certain object, its size enough to doubt whether her body could even accommodate something as thick and long. Then, his lips pressed against hers, his tongue invading with a renewed intensity, depriving her mind of any rational thought. The only thing she could focus on was the warmth of his tongue and the texture of his muscular body rubbing against hers… </p><p>Then, a certain object started pressing against her entrance, earning a place in her thoughts. He didn’t plunge in immediately, clearly giving her a chance to back out. </p><p>She doubted that she could do something like that even if there was an earthquake, threatening to bury them. She answered the simplest way possible, wrapping her legs around his waist, and pulled him… </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>Mark was feeling proud of himself for successfully suppressing the desire to dominate her so thoroughly that she could not walk for a week as he enjoyed the smoothness of her body, when he felt her legs wrapping around his waist, trying to pull inside her… </p><p>And just like that, his ability to suppress his desire disappeared. </p><p>He was barely able to prevent himself from plunging completely in one move, and only because it would injure her. Still, he pushed steadily inch by inch, invading her core aggressively as he forcibly stretched her tunnel, forcing her to cry in a mixture of pain and pleasure, overcoming the ability of his lips to suppress her voice. </p><p>Though, if the tightness of her legs around his waist was any indicator, she wasn’t exactly unhappy with his aggressiveness. </p><p>He pressed his body lower, turning their innocent missionary position to prison for her where the escape was impossible, his hips slowly picking up speed, moving back and forth, steadily exploring her new depths. As the exploration continued, however, he pulled away from the kiss, unable to resist the desire to grunt victoriously. </p><p>His grunts mixed perfectly with her moans. </p><p>His chest still pressed to hers, and his arms found her wrists, forcibly pulling her arms to the side, completing her imprisonment. As he looked down her beautiful blue eyes, wide with desire, her ruby lips parted with an endless string of moans, he had so many flirtatious comments to make, but somehow, the only thing that he could manage to let out was a desperate grunt as he enjoyed her body, tiny in comparison to his, but still perfect like it was made to be loved. </p><p>He started to feel drunk despite not drinking a drop of alcohol, and slowly, the time started to lose its meaning as well, seconds and minutes melding with her cries of pleasure and the rhythmic movement of his drilling, turning into a surreal portrait. He lost the track of the duration, whether it was a second, or a year… </p><p>The only time their cries stopped was when their lips met in a frenzied kiss, his self-control loosening further whenever their lips connected. </p><p>For a beginner, she was showing amazing adaptability, easily ignoring the discomfort to focus on the pleasure as he cut loose, impaling her mercilessly as if to test her limits. She cried, she moaned, she begged… But her legs stayed around his hips, continuing to pull him closer. </p><p>She tried to whisper something whenever their lips parted, but the meaning of the words lost their importance in the delirium of moans. Not that he needed to understand, her body was telling everything he needed to hear. He pushed, she tightened, and the room slowly filled with the sound of flesh hitting flesh mercilessly… </p><p>The time lost its meaning, but the urgency of his bodily needs didn’t. He could feel a volcano burning in his loins, filling with an urgent need to explode. Only then he remembered one really important detail, one that managed to appear even in the depths of his pleasure. He hadn’t asked whether she was using birth control —and he suspected the answer was no— and he certainly wasn’t wearing a condom. </p><p>He needed to pull out, he decided, but despite his decision, his body continued to slam into her repeatedly, rebelling against his orders. He still had some hopes of turning things over until she let out a spectacular moan as she tightened around him, signaling an orgasm of her own, her legs still tight around his waist, her moans echoing in his ear. </p><p>With a grunt, the volcano exploded, filling her insides to the brim. He wanted to focus on the risks of such a ridiculous move, but as his shaft throbbed inside her, spurting load after load, it was impossible to focus on anything but the pleasure of the moment. </p><p>That was a problem for later, he decided as he shifted a bit, laying next to her, hugging her into a tender spoon, his shaft still inside her. </p>
