        <p>With each quick step toward the bathroom door, my smile widened in anticipation. </p><p>Who knew a simple walk could be so entertaining? </p><p>The entertainment I was feeling had two sources. The first one was simple, owing to the redhead on my lap, doing her best to keep her hold, her trembling legs wrapped beautifully around my hips, her face buried on the nape of my neck, doing her best to process the spectacular orgasm she had just gone through. </p><p>The pleasure I received from her presence was certainly not a mystery, not with every step effortlessly pushed my presence deeper inside her, her breasts rubbing against my chest. </p><p>The second source was more interesting. It was watching a hint of Megan’s shadow under the door. </p><p>Initially, as I stepped out of the shower with Kim in tow, there was little shift in her movement, but that changed when I started walking toward the door with rapid steps, only pausing for a second to pick up a towel, not even drying ourselves I pushed forward. </p><p>The shadow moved rapidly, yet the movement itself was erratic, as if she tried to stand up, only to fail at the first attempt. I wondered whether it was the fear of getting caught, or her legs trembling for another reason. </p><p>Discovering the answer to that little mystery hadn’t been too difficult. </p><p>It was the latter. </p><p>The evidence, as I opened the door, I found Megan still on one knee, desperately trying to fix her bra to hide her erect nipples while her panties were damp enough to make her last-second twist of her legs to hide it rather useless. </p><p>If I didn’t much about Megan’s attitude, I might have teased her about that. Yet, everything she did showed a desperate need to get more famous, And, while she did so with a cold-blooded determination that actually earned my respect, it didn’t change the fact that such an attempt was inevitably based on an intense desire to get recognized. </p><p>And, what better way to trigger someone that built her whole life around the idea of being recognized than ignoring her despite catching her in such a compromising position. </p><p>“You can use the shower now,” I said as I continued to walk forward, not even pausing for a moment. </p><p>Under most circumstances, such a move wouldn’t have been believable, therefore reducing the impact significantly. Yet, thanks to the naked redhead on my lap, busy moaning with each step as we got closer to the bed, my current status didn’t qualify as one of them. </p><p>As I continued to walk, Megan went into the bathroom, the loud slam of the door was enough to show that my little trick worked much more excellently than I expected.</p><p>Maybe I underestimated the impact of the earlier strip show on her mood.  </p><p>“You’re … evil,” Kim managed to mutter as we arrived at the bed, showing that she was able to process the invasion of pleasure, not to mention familiar enough with her best friend to understand the significance of my little trick. “You … know that she’ll pay back—“ she added. </p><p>Only to be interrupted as I threw her on the bed, face first. “I must have treated you too lightly if you are still in the mood to think about the others,” I said as I looked at her. </p><p>She said nothing for a moment, busy scrambling to change her alignment. Yet, she didn’t answer even after she completed her movement and lay on her back, instead choosing to occupy her time by staring at my glistening cock. </p><p>I didn’t move, letting her enjoy the show for a moment.  She earned that much. “I can’t believe you just shoved all of this inside me,” she grumbled for a moment. </p><p>I took that as a sign to move and climbed on the bed, smirking as I did so. “Hey, you’re the one that claims you can take all of it without the slightest issue. Feel free to ask me to stop or slow down,” I said, pausing for a moment to let my smirk widen even more. “You know what you need to say.”</p><p>“Never,” she growled, her anger quick to awaken as she remembered the exact words she needed to say to earn my mercy. </p><p>Admittedly, the way her legs parted open as she said so showed that it wasn’t just the indignity of uttering those words that made her avoid that direction. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I moved forward, but rather than sliding inside her, I moved a bit more so that her chest was under the valley created by my thighs on both sides of her. </p><p>Leaving her beautiful lips just inches away from my shaft. “You want—“ she started, but that was the only thing she was able to say before I grabbed her beautiful red hair and pulled her forward, skewering her mercilessly. </p><p>The resulting muffled cry as I invaded her throat was simply marvelous. “Feel free to tap my leg three times if you want to say the magic words that would make me stop,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>Despite the challenging situation she was in, she managed to raise her eyes to send me a threatening glare, earning my admiration. She recovered from her earlier climax, surprisingly so considering the intensity of it. </p><p>Not that I had any problem with it. </p><p>I grabbed her head even tighter before moving more, turning the blowjob into a merciless throat-fucking, but her hand stayed away from my legs decisively. </p><p>I continued ramming down, enjoying the signs of her arousal, curious whether I could make her climax in this position. She clearly had all the telltale signs of such a need, enough to make me think that it was a reasonable possibility. </p><p>Of course, it was also possible that she would surrender before reaching that point. </p><p>However, before that little experiment could be concluded one way or another, I felt a movement behind me. </p><p>It was not the System, but a combination of living in the streets, further enhanced by playing football. I could always feel someone approaching from behind. </p><p>Luckily, there was a convenient mirror on the bedside, allowing me to steal a sneaky glimpse behind me. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, it was Megan. Yet, while her presence was not a surprise, the same didn’t apply to how she looked. </p><p>She had a towel wrapped around her body, but it was barely large enough to cover the essentials. On the topside, it was barely high enough to cover her nipples, still leaving a hint of her delicious areolas. </p><p>But pulling it any higher was not an option with the situation downstairs. There, the towel ended just below her core, with no margin for error, even the slightest move would be enough to create a scandalously revealing glimpse. </p><p>The deficient towel she had around herself was completely accidental, of course. I had been in there just moments ago, and saw that there were several towels and bathrobes of various sizes. </p><p>There was no reason for her to limit herself to that little piece. </p><p>Not that I was unhappy with her choice. On the contrary, it was a beautiful show, especially since the towel she picked was soft and thin, wrapping around her body as beautiful as a tight dress, enhancing her beauty. </p><p>Amusingly, her beautiful blonde hair was only slightly glistening with water rather than getting completely wet, like she took a shower twenty minutes ago and it was in the process of drying. </p><p>With another subtle effort, she managed to enhance her allure even more. I had to admit, I admired her hustle, willing to use even the smallest advantage, showing a killer instinct that I rarely saw after I finally got free of the streets. </p><p>Pity that she decided to pit herself against someone with an even stronger killer instinct, and played with a rigged deck. The abilities the system gave me, such as Seduction and Taunt, worked wonders to read the nuances in her actions much more than I would be able to. </p><p>Especially through just glancing at a misaligned small bedside mirror. </p><p>I subtly watched her as she waited behind me, managing to give a sexy pose — one that still looked casual and random — even as her gaze fell down to watch the show that was going on. </p><p>The impact was clear from the way her nipples pushed against her top, showing just how much the little live-action show was affecting her.  </p><p>Yet, she didn’t waste much time watching and raised her gaze, and took a step forward, her step unnecessarily loud. </p><p>Since her whole aim was to get my attention, I took great pleasure in ignoring her not-so-subtle attempts to deny that. </p><p>I expected her to get angry as her attempt failed. Instead, a determined one took that place as she took a step forward… </p>
