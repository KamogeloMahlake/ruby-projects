        <p>Alone in a very dangerous ancient ruin, accompanied by a sexy leather-clad lady, I was having trouble focusing on the issue. I was tempted to push her against the wall, enjoying her against the ancient writings…</p><p>Ironically, the only thing that prevented me from doing so was her hungry gaze looking at my naked body. I had always liked a sprinkle of danger mixed with my fun … but Audrum’s expression suggested that she might have been suffering an even deeper variant of after-danger horniness. </p><p>My earlier, tantric-tinged mood setting pushed that sensation even deeper. </p><p>And, to see just how far I could goad her was too tempting to ignore. “Fascinating,” I said as I looked at the writings, acting like I wasn’t paying any attention to her. </p><p>At first, she appreciated my lack of attention, using the opportunity to ogle my body like her eyes were attached to my body with sticking spells, tracing the contours of my body, and lingering on the occasional splatters of blood to further remind her of the danger.</p><p>No wonder she was exploring dungeons despite her lack of magical capabilities. </p><p>However, as I continued not to pay any attention to her and instead stayed focused on the wall, she started to get frustrated. Of course, I made sure to shift ‘carelessly’ and accidentally made a show of my muscles, noticing her appreciative gaze, the low-key tantric aura fueling the area even more. </p><p>She took a step back, and while I felt curious, I ignored the temptation to turn and look. Then, a while later, she stepped back to my side once more, her tone frustrated. “You seem to be interested in the drawings on the wall,” she commented.</p><p>“I sure am,” I answered as I glanced at her, my great experience the only thing that kept me from gasping in surprise. She had used the small break to make some impressive adjustments to her outfit, particularly around the front area by pulling the zipper down significantly. </p><p>The view was shocking because I seemed to underestimate the tightness of her outfit. As she opened it, her breasts pushed forward recklessly, creating a deep valley cutting through the leather outfit. She looked incredibly sexy in her leather outfit already, and the deep cleavage just pushed it further. </p><p>“You don’t mind it, do you?” she asked as she pushed her chest slightly out and pointed at the same time, like there could be any mistake where she was pointing under the circumstances. </p><p>“Oh, go ahead,” I said, dipping my gaze down for a moment before pulling away, her smile dying prematurely. It was hard to balance between teasing and looking completely uninterested. Even with that cleavage, it was better not to give her the completely wrong idea. “We’re going to be here for a long time, and I don’t want you to feel stuffed.” </p><p>“You’re so kind,” she said. “So, do you want me to go through the drawings and summarize,” she said. </p><p>“Please, go ahead,” I said, and she took a step forward, her finger almost touching the drawings — but not directly, clearly trying not to leave a mark over them as a careful explorer. </p><p>“It tells a story of some kind of mystical war,” she said. “It’s clearly a story, as it’s talking about multiple worlds being destroyed, along with many different imaginary races like the phoenixes, elves, and other entities,” she said. “But there’s too much evidence to support the narrative to completely invalidate it.” </p><p>“Evidence like what.” </p><p>“The existence of this place, for example. It’s clearly designed as some kind of emergency shelter, away from any other ruins, and self-sufficient with correct magical applications. I’m guessing such a war really happened, but the teller is using the stories to hide the real parties.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said, which had two targets. The first interesting was the small breakdown of the evidence, which was clearly more accurate than she had assumed. Elves and phoenixes were real, and so was the existence of other worlds. </p><p>Making this ruin some kind of hiding spot of an old magical empire that was strong enough to rule both. </p><p>Having a guide was really convenient. </p><p>The second target of interest was her, or more accurately, the way she bent forward to display her ass in the best light, her leather pants stretching further, to a tempting degree. </p><p>I smirked, fascinated by her ability to combine a very serious lecture about the possible history of ruins with an erotic show. Certainly fascinating enough. </p><p>“Fascinating —“ I started, before I was interrupted by a sudden gasp. </p><p>“Are you alright,” she said, taking a step forward to stand next to me. “Do you need a change of bandages?” </p><p>“No, not that,” I said as I stretched my arms. “It’s my back. I think that I had hurt it while fighting and now it’s feeling stiff.”</p><p>“Oh, really,” she said as she took a step forward immediately, too enthusiastic to miss such an opportunity. “I’m not a bad masseuse.” </p><p>And, just like that, before I could even answer, she grabbed my arm and dragged toward a large smooth rock that could be used as a chair, and pushed me down. “Just enjoy,” she said as she moved to my back, and immediately grabbed my shoulder. </p><p>“I — are you sure that’s appropriate?” I asked, acting shy even as I let my eyes widen with disbelief, playing shy. </p><p>“Of course, I’m just keeping you in fighting condition,” she said as she held my shoulders, already too deep to turn back, but clearly, that just added to her excitement for her. </p><p>Soon, her hands were roaming everywhere on my back, which showed one thing. Her claim about being a good masseuse was complete fiction. It was a high-skill job, requiring to know exactly how much pressure to apply, which sequence to target, and how to address some health concerns. </p><p>She had none of those. </p><p>Admittedly, she seemed to be aware of that, as rather than trying to copy a professional, she just continued to caress my naked muscles for five minutes, happy teasing me. </p><p>Not one to let such an attempt go without retaliation, I hit her with another subtle yet effective tantric effect, one that spiked her arousal she was feeling a bit more … creating the effect of a nice glass of wine. </p><p>Already deep in her aroused state, that magical assistance was clearly what she needed. “It’s serious,” she suddenly commented in a serious tone. “We need to apply some heat, do you have any?” </p><p>“No, but we can start a fire—“ I commented halfway before she interrupted. </p><p>“No, too late, we need to address it immediately,” she said, followed by shuffling of leather. I couldn’t see her from that angle, but I was quick to recognize what were the two warm globes pressing against my neck. </p><p>“Is this —“ I started, but that was all I was able to say before she put her finger on my lips. </p><p>“Shh, it’s treatment,” she said, taking control even more as I acted submissive, which was an amusing reversal. I could feel her arousal from the hardness of her nipples. </p><p>“Are you sure it’s necessary? I can handle a little pain.” </p><p>“Yes, it is,” she said as she started moving up and down, the sensation spectacular. “We need to make sure you’re in top shape, “she added in a throaty tone. “I’m relying on you for my security, we need to make sure that you’re in top shape.” </p><p>Then, her hand moved down, grabbing my ass in a way that left no doubt about exactly what she was talking about. </p><p>I let out a squeal, which was absurd coming from me, but playing the role was too amusing to stop immediately. I acted shy and shocked, letting her molest me, curious just how far she would go.</p><p>For a minute, she continued the same treatment, making me think that she had reached her limit, but then, her hand moved forward, cupping my front as well. “Oh, we have a problem here as well,” she declared confidently. “Let’s fix it before it’s too late.”</p>
