        <p>As I walked toward the town, I decided on a simple role. A young man who decided to travel to escape an arranged marriage. I was handsome enough for it to be believable, and an overprotective family was the best excuse I had for any big mistake. </p><p>Hopefully, it would be still enough to make people pity me while throwing a few scraps in my way, and let the System upgrade it. </p><p>I had no idea what that divine voice was thinking when she granted the Freeloader System as punishment, but there were many ways I could use it. My little trick with the caravan guards showed that I could easily lie about my status and situation, and the System would still trigger. </p><p>Talk about playing for my strengths.</p><p>Before I arrived at the town, I pulled the silver that was granted at me from the System. It was much smaller than the copper coin, the text on it denoting it as one silver coin. I didn’t go into the town immediately, remembering the villager mentioning that it required two silver coins to enter. </p><p>Instead, I walk around the town, checking the buildings outside the walls. There were a few large buildings that functioned as inns, some with large enough courtyards for the caravans to wait. Additionally, there were several stalls around. </p><p>I walked around to find a stall with a tempting smell, while also listening the shouts and calls of the stall owners, giving me an idea about the general exchange rate. It was simpler than I expected. Ten copper coin was called copper piece, and ten copper pieces made one silver coin. </p><p>Most stalls were selling their wares for around a copper piece, which, to my best guess, meant that a copper piece was worth around a dollar. Though, even as I thought that, I could imagine the reaction my old Econ professor would have if I wrote that in an exam, responding with relative purchasing power and other pointless nonsense. </p><p> As I walked, I finally saw a stall that was being operated by an older woman. Likely in her late thirties, but she looked good for that age. Short black hair, a beautiful face that was free of makeup, a strong stature, certain parts that clearly defied gravity. The rich ladies I had been hanging out with would have killed to look that good.  </p><p>It was a good target to get some information. </p><p>Though, as I approached, I saw her eyes tighten slightly. I recognized that, from the women that was used to being hit on constantly. I didn’t change my target. Information was more important than seducing a beautiful older woman — no matter how much it hurt me to say that. </p><p>“How much is for a skewer?” I said as I approached. </p><p>“Fourteen coins,” she said. </p><p>“Three … no two,” I said as I pushed the silver toward her, but I noticed her examining my palms carefully before shifting her attention to my face, a thoughtful expression on her face. I understood what she was looking at. My hands weren’t exactly hands of a worker. They weren’t perfect and smooth after all the time I spent in the gym, but I kept them smooth and attractive for the happiness of my lady friends. </p><p>Still, it was interesting that a stall owner was attentive enough to catch that immediately. </p><p>She said nothing as she passed me two meat skewer and a lot of copper. I didn’t count them before taking them, playing on the lost rich kid with no idea how the world worked. Initially, I was planning to ask her a lot of questions, but she was more attentive than I expected. I didn’t trust myself to question her subtly enough for her not to catch up. </p><p>That didn’t mean I planned to do nothing. I played a role I had developed to perfection after my injury. Prideful yet vulnerable young man. I didn’t say anything as I ate my food, slowly savoring its taste like I hadn’t eaten for a couple days — which wasn’t hard to fake, because with the speed my body was burning food, I was already hungry, and just needed to exaggerate further — while I kept my expression stiff, but with occasional trembling. </p><p>A young, handsome man who had fallen into dire straits.</p><p>I noticed her adding another skewer to the fire, but she pulled it from a different drawer. It smelled much better than the other ones, reminding me of the boar leg I had received from the System. She added it closer to the fire, and inevitably, it charred too much. She turned her back, acting like she didn’t notice it. </p><p>“Heavens,” she grumbled exaggeratedly as she pulled the burned skewer of the fire. “It’s ruined.” Then she looked at me. “Why don’t you be a good young man and finish it. It’s a sin to waste food.” </p><p>“Y-you’re right, it’s wrong to waste food,” I said as I took it.  </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 20]</p><p>[50x Return - Savage Meat Skewer, Mortal-Peak]</p><p>Success. </p><p>A scary success, as the cultivation difference suggested she was quite a bit stronger than me. </p><p>Still, it was good to see my patented method of awakening the pity in an older woman of authority worked in a new world as well. A handsome face and a pitiful expression was an excellent combination.  </p><p>I might have baited the reaction, but I still appreciated the intent behind it. She not only gave me food that probably cost at least a silver for free, but also she went the trouble disguising it to not to hurt my pride. Not necessary, but still appreciated. </p><p>Also, her cultivation was high enough to give a thirty-times multiplier, which was another surprise. I might not know how it was measured, but I believed it was significant. She was hiding from something … or I misunderstood just how strong the people of this new world. </p><p>I shrugged as I finished the charred skewer, delicious despite its burned state. Unlike the other two skewer, it managed to break my hunger. </p><p>“It was delicious,” I said as I bowed slightly, then walked away. I was tempted to stay longer, maybe try to get some more, but frankly, I was intimidated by the cultivation difference between us. I knew too little about this new world to make a judgment. </p><p>However, as I walked away, I felt my skin crawl. Somehow, I knew that I was being watched. I didn’t give a reaction, but I didn’t dare to move too far away from the town, either. Instead, I found a tree with nothing around, and sat down.  </p><p>I was still close enough to the town that I would be heard if I shouted … as for whether someone would come to my support, I had no idea. If things really went badly, I would pull the cloak from the System space. Maybe it was strong enough to make a difference. </p><p>I squinted my eyes, doing my best to look like I was asleep, forcing my heart to slow down — something I was able to do since that weird breakthrough. Still, I had to wait for thirty minutes before my follower had shown herself. </p><p>The woman from the stall. </p><p>I didn’t react to her presence, but I still calmed down. She was stronger than me, and she helped me before. Combined, I didn’t expect her to do anything, so I didn’t react even when she was just a few steps away, sneaking without making a sound. </p><p>I didn’t expect her to pull a small book from her chest, put it next to me, and walk back. I didn’t react to that for almost twenty more minutes, before I faked a restless shuffle, and touched the booklet. I acted because I could feel that she was still watching me.  </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Tiger Fist Martial Art, Complete, Profound Middle-Grade]</p><p>Once I touched it, I made a show of jumping in fear. “Who’s there?” I gasped in fear as I pulled my blade, but there was no one. </p><p>Only after looking around carefully, I paid attention to the book. It was an old, damaged book, and even without opening, I could see the marks of battle over it, including some blood that was relatively new. Not as short as days, but not as long as years, either. </p><p>“This lowly one thanks the mysterious senior for the opportunity,” I said as I bowed to a random direction away from the town, my command of the knowledge giving me exactly how to thank for it. </p><p>While having no real idea what any of those actually meant. </p><p>I immediately started a fire and started reading the book, glad that the language jade I received from the System taught me how to read as well. </p><p>Once I started reading, the sensation of being watched finally disappeared, but I didn’t stop reading the book. It was the first real chance for me to understand how this world worked. </p>
