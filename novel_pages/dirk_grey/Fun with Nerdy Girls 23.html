        <p>“Mm, it smells amazing,” Carrie said as I carried a large tray, filled with a monstrously huge omelet and many supporting protein-rich condiments. </p><p>As she walked to the dining table, straining her bathrobe in all the right places, she looked amazing as well, but considering Sarah was walking behind me, I neglected to mention that. Not because I was afraid of making Sarah jealous — as it was far, far too late for that — but because I recognized the sudden mischievous glint at Carrie’s eyes. </p><p>I sat down, waiting for the show that would no doubt be about to come. </p><p>Why bother putting any effort into teasing when I could just lean back and enjoy the fruits of their weird competition? </p><p>Carrie didn’t disappoint me, and rather than taking a seat, she walked to Sarah, who was just putting a pot of coffee on the table. </p><p>“You naughty whore,” Carrie suddenly said, her voice tight. </p><p>“W-what?” Sarah stammered in shock, taking a step back in panic, thinking that she had been caught. She hadn’t been caught, though that was only a technicality. Being caught meant there was a point Carrie was unaware of what had been happening behind the kitchen counter.</p><p>Unaware of that particular interesting nugget, Sarah was afraid. </p><p>“You are very naughty,” Carrie said, taking another step forward, and when Sarah tried to retreat, she had found herself pressed against a wall. “You have been stuffing herself with desserts while preparing breakfast,” Carrie continued with a  sudden cheerful tone. </p><p>Sarah failed to adapt to the sudden change, especially when Carrie swiped her finger to her lips, coming up with a very distinct white liquid. Sarah’s eyes widened in fear as Carrie put her finger in her mouth, afraid of Carrie recognizing the taste.</p><p>“Hmm, delicious, though a bit salty,” Carrie said with a playful innocence before turning and leaving Sarah alone, who was busy trying to suppress her panic attack. Though her fear did some nice things to her nipples, especially with her bra removed in our earlier game. </p><p>Carrie’s innocent acting was too exaggerated, suspicious enough to be easily caught by Sarah if she was in a mood to focus on anything but her own fear. </p><p>A pretty mean move on Carrie’s part, though by no means undeserved. </p><p>But that turned out to be only the beginning of Carrie’s ploy. Rather than pulling a chair, she plopped on my lap, moving back and forth to settle on my lap, which, naturally, awakened my hardness to full power in quick order. </p><p>Sarah might have gotten jealous considering what she had been doing minutes earlier, but she was too relaxed what she thought as to be a close-call to care about that. “Coffee?” she asked instead, quickly serving it as an excuse to change the topic. </p><p>She didn’t want her best friend questioning her about the mysterious dessert she had tested on her lips. </p><p>“Thanks,” Carrie replied simply. But her movements as she reached for the coffee mug were nothing but simple. She leaned forward, leaving my lap for a moment, which was completely unnecessary as she could have reached without moving. </p><p>But that was not a thoughtless move, not when she had used the opportunity to pull my towel off. I expected her to drop it off on the floor, where Sarah couldn’t see from her seat, but she surprised even me by throwing that on a back of an empty chair. </p><p>Perfectly positioned for Sarah to see. </p><p>“By the way, have you finished the project for AP English class, we have to present that in Monday class,”  Carrie said, like sitting on my naked lap was something completely ordinary. </p><p>Sarah looked at her in shock, though the effects of our kitchen adventure worked wonderfully to prevent that shock from turning into anger. </p><p>“Sarah,” Carrie said, her smirk widening even as she started to rock back and forth gently. “You have finished your part of the research, right?” </p><p>“I did,” Sarah answered.</p><p>“Excellent,” Carrie said. “Then maybe we can put it all together this afternoon, before leaving,” she said. </p><p>“M-maybe not,” Sarah answered, noticing the way Carrie’s subtle rocking slowly picking up speed, smart enough to realize that the more they stayed, the more Carrie was going to torture her with her ‘sneaky’ horniness. “I have something urgent to do back home, we can do it afterward!” </p><p>“Oh, what urgent thing?” Carrie asked with a smirk even as one of her hands slip under the table and pulled the skirt of her bathrobe up. It was still on the way, but the area it covered was being reduced every passing second. </p><p>I decided to help Carrie, and lifted my foot, sliding directly between Sarah’s legs. Her skirt prevented direct contact, but considering she was not wearing her underwear, the impact was considerable. </p><p>Especially since Sarah was still burning with arousal after our latest kitchen adventure. </p><p>“Why are you moving your leg,” Carrie asked as she twisted her hips even more, her smirk widening. Smart girl, giving me an excellent excuse. </p><p>“Just a little cramp,” I said before turning to Sarah. “Don’t let me break your important discussion. You were telling something, Sarah,” I said. </p><p>“Just an urgent thing,” Sarah deflected, not appreciating the necessity to speak as her core got teased. My massage made it even harder to speak, adding arousal into her frustration and jealously. </p><p>I caught Sarah’s gaze while Carrie closed her eyes, and winked at her. Sarah smirked victoriously, once again enjoying the impression that she was pulling an impressive trick in front of Carrie, unaware of the escalation that was happening under the table. </p><p>And stuck between weird jealous competition between two nerdy girls, I was very happy. </p><p> Especially when, Carrie managed to pull her bathrobe up completely, allowing our naked bodies to touch, a strategic movement of her hips all she needed for her wetness to swallow my erection. </p><p>It was a credit to her growing experience that she didn’t moan explicitly as she took most of my length at once, which worked wonders to keep Sarah unaware of the escalation that was going under the table — though, the strategic massage of my foot helped that particular nugget impressively.</p><p>She even started to smile confidently, once again thinking that she was the one that was pulling one over her friend.  </p><p>Honestly, Sarah’s confident smugness as she misunderstood the situation was almost as delicious as the way Carrie tightened around my girth, so thick that even Carrie noticed the change of her expression, despite her own struggle to keep her expression smooth. </p><p>Carrie’s response was spectacular. She put her weight down, taking my full length. It made her grunt in pain, but she was smart enough to take a sip of her coffee, and blame it for its hotness. </p><p>I had my huge omelet to finish, allowing me to hide my expression by chewing, something that started to be more and more necessary as Carrie’s hips picked up speed if we were to continue enjoying Sarah’s misplaced confidence. </p><p> Luckily, she was far too fascinated by her own achievements to pay closer attention to us — well, our facial expression, as her gaze was awfully interested in the way Carrie’s body was jumping up and down, or my muscular arm. </p><p>… while the connected hand continued to climb on Carrie’s naked thighs, leaving a trembling surrender in its wake. Neither Carrie nor Sarah seemed to be interested in continuing their discussion, both too distracted by their physical pleasure. </p><p>I let that slide, accepting their departure as a fact. As much as their presence was fun, I still have a day full of exhausting exercise. </p><p>Which didn’t mean I couldn’t enjoy the last minutes of the breakfast fully, especially when Carrie lifted herself up momentarily, giving me a slight scare, before slamming herself back across my length, swallowing the full length again, her bathrobe dislodging enough to completely reveal her tits — though the table still enough to hide the full extent of our activities, leaving Sarah smug in her own victory.</p><p>Her gaze got more and more focused on our revealed flesh as time passed, until the pleasure got too much, forcing her to close her eyes to fully enjoy the orgasm hitting her, leaving her panting and moaning. </p><p>Carrie might have mocked her, but the show Sarah was putting, along with her tightness, triggered my explosion as well, allowing her to close the last bit of distance. She bit her lips, trying to hide her moans, replicating Sarah’s expression, while I gasped relaxedly, pulling my foot back as well. </p><p>Sarah was the first one to speak, recovering faster than Carrie. “Oh, I see that you have an accident,” Sarah said mockingly as she assumed my relaxation came from a dry lap dance. A rather inaccurate assessment, but that didn’t prevent me from marking that. </p><p>She earned a true punishment. </p><p>For the next time, of course. “Accidents happen,” I said even as I moved Carrie to the next seat and wrapped my towel around my waist. “Anyway, I need to start working out,” I said, leaning for Carrie for one last fleeting kiss before leaving, leaving the girls alone for whatever pointy discussion they might have before leaving. </p><p>Just as I was about to take a step into the stairs, I turned to them with a smirk. “By the way, it was an amazing game night. We should definitely repeat it.” </p><p>“Oh, definitely,” came the twin response, their glare competitive. </p>
