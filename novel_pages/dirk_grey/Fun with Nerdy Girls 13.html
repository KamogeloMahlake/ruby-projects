        <title>Fun with Nerdy Girls 13</title>
    </head>

        <p>I didn’t bother hiding my erection as I sat down. After all, there was no way I wouldn’t get one as my two nerdy friends who had been exploring the limits of their sexiness sat across me, displaying their bodies the best way possible as we started to play. </p><p>There was no doubt about Carrie’s sexiness. Her dress, with the absence of her bra, was sexy enough before she started leaning forward to pull the blocks, pushing the buttons of her dress and enhancing the cleavage even further. And while Sarah lacked Carrie’s spectacular curves that forced the limits of reality, she did make sure to lean excessively whenever it was her turn, showing off her hips the best way possible. </p><p>Even better, their gaze clashed with a unique aura whenever their eyes met, part competitiveness, part incrimination, and part guilt. Their gaze told me that while they were aware of the ridiculousness of their competitiveness, that awareness had precious little impact on their competitiveness. </p><p>And I had no problems enjoying the fruits of their growing competitiveness, leaning forward to pull blocks with a growing sexiness, Carrie’s careful clumsiness contrasting greatly with Sarah’s smooth pulls. I was certain that Carrie would be the first one to fail, which posed an interesting problem for her considering she was wearing precious little, only a dress and panties, even a bra absent. As the tower started to get wobbly, I was putting mental bets on whether Carrie would be brave enough to actually remove her dress to display her beautiful mounds, or slide under the blanket to retreat from the game… </p><p>Then, the tower of blocks toppled just as Sarah pulled, surprising both me and Carrie. “Ops,” Sarah said with a flat tone and a smirk, signaling that her defeat might not be as accidental as I presumed. </p><p>“Unlucky. It’s time for the forfeit,” I said with a matching smile.</p><p>“Is there no mercy for the first time?” Sarah asked flirtatiously, but considering she had already grabbed the edges of her tops and started to pull with a slow, sensual manner, it wasn’t hard to guess that she wouldn’t welcome any actual attempts to give her a pass. </p><p>Meanwhile, Carrie’s expression transformed into a scandalized frown, realizing that Sarah had cheated in a way she hadn’t been expecting, intentionally losing. However, as much as it might be fun to tease Carrie about that, the sight of Sarah shedding her tight black top to reveal her lacy black bra underneath, nicely wrapping her breasts while still giving a hint of allure, deserved my complete attention. </p><p>Sarah met my gaze, Her confident smile trembled as a sliver of rationality reappeared in her eyes as if to remind her that she was pushing their friendly competition to a weird point, but ultimately, it failed to find traction in her mind. Despite the trembling of her fingers, she threw her top to the side before leaning down and grabbing the blocks. Thanks to the absence of her top, the resulting cleavage was much more appealing. “So, the next round?” she asked with a smirk. </p><p>“Sure,” I said, not bothering to hide my gaze dancing on her body despite Carrie’s obvious displeasure. From her expression, it was clear that she was measuring the relative benefits of accidentally losing to balance the books. I smirked, aware that her lack of a bra was holding her back from replicating Sarah’s trick. It was ironic that she was being held back from showing off due to her desire to show off in the first place. </p><p>This time, Sarah acted before Carrie could even make a decision, and just when she was pulling a block for the second time, she toppled down the wooden tower once more. “Again, how clumsy of me,” she murmured even as her smirk widened once more. </p><p>“Yes, you’re very clumsy tonight,” Carrie said with an obvious distaste as she watched Sarah stand up. “Such a whore,” she added, but this time, she tried to keep her whisper inaudible. Focused in her own amateurish —though very satisfying— attempt to deliver a short but sweet strip show, Sarah missed the last part. </p><p>I didn’t, but I didn’t intervene, just watching as Sarah pushed her shorts down as she swayed to the rhythm of the song that was playing on TV. She turned her back and leaned forward, accentuating her already perfect ass to another level of existence while she slowly shimmied her shorts, giving me a perfect view of her lacy panties, matching her bra perfectly. </p><p>“Let’s play,” she gloated as she threw her shorts to Carrie, who threw them at the other side of the room, unable to hide her anger. “Hey, I’m the one who’s losing. Why are you frustrated?” Sarah asked mockingly. </p><p>“Just play,” Carrie said as she started setting up the tower, her fingers trembling with anger. Unfortunately, just like many proverbs warned, anger was a dangerous emotion. Despite her intention to play carefully —due to her limited excess clothing— she managed to topple the tower in her second attempt. </p><p>“Pity,” Sarah murmured as she looked at Carrie, but her tone didn’t carry the slightest hint of mercy. “So, what are you going to do, sweetheart, hide under the blanket like a little girl, or get rid of that dress.” </p><p>I watched from the corner as they gazed at each other, one angry, the other smug, more than happy to enjoy the fruits of their rather pointless rivalry. “Neither,” Carrie answered. </p><p>“Why, are you chickening?” Sarah said, her smug tone stained with disregard. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” Carrie countered as she stood up, and her hands disappeared under her skirt, pushing her panties down. It wasn’t as slow and erotic as it could have been, but the sudden annoyance of Sarah more than compensated for the lack of fanfare. </p><p>Also, watching Carrie struggling to sit down without flashing everyone was delicious, especially when she pulled down her skirt to hide her ass, only to inadvertently turn her cleavage from teasing into downright erotic. </p><p>Sarah didn’t appreciate my lingering enjoyment. “The next turn,” she murmured, seeming ready to take down Carrie. Unfortunately, Carrie wasn’t the only one that had been suffering from the adverse effects of emotional instability, especially when Carrie suddenly decided to be aggressive in a different way, and just as Sarah pulled her block and prepared to place it on the top. </p><p>Carrie’s legs parted open, giving me a momentary glimpse of her beautiful core. It was a fleeting glance, certainly nowhere near enough the amazing show I had received in our private entertaining evenings, but Sarah didn’t know that. From her perspective, Carrie had just flashed me for the first time. Her mouth parted open as her fingers trembled, which ended up bringing down the tower. </p><p>“Pity. So, what are you going to do, sweetheart, hide under the blanket like a little girl, or get rid of that bra,” Carrie murmured in satisfaction, shamelessly ripping Sarah’s earlier words while Sarah looked at the toppled down the tower in shock, realizing the cost of her earlier arrogance. With her disposable clothing sacrificed to make a point, confident in her ability to play the game, Sarah found herself without a safety net. </p><p>I looked at Sarah along with Carrie, while she was looking everywhere but us, before burying her face into her hands. “I’m out,” she murmured. </p><p>“Under the blanket, then,” I said, pointing at the blanket which was resting on the most comfortable couch of the house. “And don’t forget to pass the piece you want after you decide which piece to sacrifice.” </p><p>Neither girl said anything for a while, one ashamed of losing after her arrogant words, the other absolutely satisfied with the sudden victory she had managed to pull. And, I had to admit, she deserved her smugness, winning in a game which her opponent arranged. </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to tease Carrie, watching Sarah as she disappeared under the large blanket, shimmying uncomfortably as she undressed without the sense of victory she had been radiating earlier had the priority. Then, Sarah proved that Carrie wasn’t the only one that could surprise us when she threw her underwear out. </p><p>It was her panties. </p><p>“Daring,” I murmured as Sarah let the blanket fell, revealing her bra-clad chest. Carrie frowned, thinking that her perfect victory was marred through Sarah’s last-minute adjustment. </p><p>Luckily for her, I was fond of her, and more than willing to distract her. “Shall we play?” I said, not bothering to hide my playful smirk. After everything the girls had done, I couldn’t be bothered to hide my cheating, and toppled the tower at the first attempt. </p><p>“Damn, I have the worst of luck, getting undressed in front of two sexy girls, how could I handle that,” I said even as I grabbed the bottom of my shirt, and slowly slipped it up while dancing to the music. I wasn’t really a good dancer, but as my shirt slowly traveled upward, revealing my abs two by two, neither girl seemed to be particularly upset about my limited dancing ability. </p><p>I repeated the same trick the next round, this time getting rid of my shorts to reveal my boxers, which revealed my big pole. I was unashamed of my erection, as I doubted there was any straight hotblooded male that could avoid having an erection when facing a sexy buxom blonde without any underwear —and a loose dress to make that fact obvious— while a feisty brunette with no panties hiding under the blanket… </p><p>Not when a threesome was a distinct possibility, and the consolation prize was enjoying Carrie’s delicious tits around my cock once again. </p><p>“So, the last round,” I murmured as I set up the tower once more, sending a playful glare at Carrie, who was far too occupied by the pole in my boxers. “This one is for the victory.” </p><p>“L-let’s play,” Carrie said, her earlier confidence quick to melt at the sight of my erection. Sarah said nothing, but her gaze was no less affected, devouring the sight. I wasn’t surprised when Carrie toppled the tower in her fourth attempt, which earned a laugh from Sarah. </p><p>“Someone is going to join me under the blanket, it seems,” Sarah said. </p><p>“But the game is over,” Carrie said. </p><p>“You still lost,” Sarah gloated, with no intention of letting Carrie go after her own memorable defeat. “Come under the blanket, and lose that dress.” </p><p>Carrie looked indecisive until I sent her a playful wink, renewing her courage. Things had been clearly developing outside her initial idea for the evening, but Carrie was too lost in the sense of competition to limit that. </p><p>I wasn’t a moron, so I neglected to advise her about that. </p><p>Luckily, the blanket was large enough that Carrie could perch on the other side of the blanket, and still cover her body decently. Removing the dress took a bit more effort than Sarah’s easily slip, and gave us a couple of accidental glimpses of her skin, but ultimately, she sat on the other side of the couch, with only a blanket to hide her curvy body. </p><p>“So, Ms. Winner, would you mind passing back our clothes,” Sarah said. </p><p>“I do actually,” I said after throwing a glance at the TV, only to realize the music videos were finally having the change I had been hoping for. Instead of playful teenagers or aggressive guitarists, the screen was getting filled with half-naked ladies and gentlemen, rubbing against each other far too closely to classify it as dancing. </p><p>I slipped under the blanket, and a second later, threw my boxers on the other side of the room as well. “As a gentleman, I shouldn’t leave the ladies alone. It’s only fair, right?” I said with a charming smile. Girls were too overwhelmed with the fact that they were under the same blanket with a naked man to answer. </p><p>And just like that, three naked people under a blanket —almost naked in Sarah’s case, but definitely good enough— while softcore porn disguised as music video was playing on the screen… </p><p>A fun turn was ahead of us… </p>
