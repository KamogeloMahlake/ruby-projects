        <p>Dorothy froze the moment she ended up on my lap, which was not an absurd reaction considering she was wearing only her sexy red set that covered absolutely nothing. I didn’t push for more, letting her get used to the moment. </p><p>But also, I kept my arms around her waist, keeping her on. I wasn’t holding her tight to prevent her from escaping … just a little suggestion to keep her in place under the circumstances. It contrasted with my earlier decision, of course, but that was only so much teasing I was willing to handle. </p><p>Even from a heiress that was worth several billions. </p><p>Destiny threw a glance toward us, catching my gaze, but I just made a gesture, asking for her to leave and not send any other dancer. </p><p>I had my own stripper. </p><p>Dorothy stayed on my lap even as Destiny gathered her clothes and left, flushing as she tried to process the sudden shift. She wasn’t very good at handling shocks. “T-this wasn’t what I had in mind,” she whispered, still frozen. </p><p>“Oh. My apologies. I thought … of course you wouldn’t be interested in an old man like me,” I said. I wasn’t a particularly good actor when it came to acting pitiful, but poor lighting and the background music helped … and so did her mood. </p><p>“No, no, no!” she corrected in panic, which was a very beautiful panic considering her state of dress and her current location. </p><p>For a moment, I thought about stopping. She was beautiful, but was it worth all the risk. </p><p>But only for one passing moment, before it faded away and was replaced by the memory of her smug smile as she teased me. No, that would not do. “I’m happy to hear that, boss,” I said, deliberately using the title to make it look like she had control. </p><p>Well, technically she had the control, but as I leaned forward, slowly enough to give all the time she needed to move away if she wanted.</p><p>She didn’t make a move, captive of her own desires as I pressed my lips against her neck, squirming as the pleasure hit her. The way she reacted told me everything about her. She wasn’t a virgin, but she clearly wasn’t experienced either considering the amount of surprise her moans displayed. </p><p>“Why don’t you give me a proper lap dance, boss,” I whispered into her ear, my voice soft enough not to be threatening, like the whisper of a devil. She shivered as she turned her head the other way, not brave enough to meet my gaze. </p><p>But brave enough for her hips to start moving. </p><p>Warped priorities were the best. </p><p>Despite all the shame she was supposed to be feeling from the situation, she moved fast, showing that her hips were unaware of that particular fact. </p><p>I let her give me a lap dance, staying focused on the safer spots, only dipping down enough to nibble at her collarbone, or rising high enough for a few kisses to the cheek. I wanted to teach her a lesson, but I couldn’t be heavy-handled, not with everything at stake. </p><p>And, admittedly, listening to her while her helpless whimpers slowly turned into desperate growls was fun. It felt like fishing compared to my usual hunting, serene and patient … but ultimately, just as rewarding. </p><p>The song changed, and Dorothy said nothing. She didn’t ask me to stop, she didn’t question the absence of the dancers, nothing. She just moved back and forth, giving me a surprisingly good lap dance, getting better and better as her confidence started to recover. </p><p>It was halfway through the song when she finally spoke. “I … I always had a crush on you,” she whispered, barely loud enough for me to hear. </p><p>I could have let it slide, but I decided to turn that into a challenge instead. A bait, even, finally starting to reel her in. “What are you going to do about that, boss?” I said, my voice as suggestive as I could manage without sounding aggressive — once again, music helping to cover up my acting. </p><p>I expected that to work … but I didn’t expect to suddenly let out a low growl while she lashed out. I felt her grab my hair hard, desperately taking a firm hold and squeezing hard enough to hurt. I made no sound, not wanting to scare her. Luckily, I only needed to do so for a moment while her breath hitched, her beautiful eyes filling with lust. </p><p>Then, she leaned and captured my lips. </p><p>Her tongue jumped into my mouth, as aggressive as it was inexperienced, showing she wasn’t very used to taking the lead or showing passion. Luckily, the unintended foreplay destroyed whatever barrier that was keeping her from it. </p><p>Her passion was more important than her lack of experience. </p><p>More importantly, following my fishing analogy, the baiting was successful, and the hook was in place. All that was left to reel her in. </p><p>For the first time, my fingers dipped down lower than her waist, cupping her ass. Gentle at first to see her reaction, but quickly picking up speed once I ascertained there was no sudden panic attack coming — her tongue getting even faster was a good sign — I started to squeeze her ass harder and harder. </p><p>She tried to take deep breaths through her nose, her lips still locked to mine like she was afraid of pulling back. I had an inkling that her crush on me had at least a dash of daddy issues mixed in — expecting a billionaire’s family to be functional and loving was absurd — but I didn’t care the slightest. </p><p>Instead, I listened to the way she took her rapid, shallow breaths, low moans constantly hitting my lips … while one of my hands climbed up to escalate the situation. The sexy bra she wore was designed less for support, and more for easy removal. Combined with her distracted state, it took a few seconds to register her toplessness. </p><p>She squawked in shock. “Maybe—” she followed immediately as she pulled back from the kiss, but I didn’t want to bargain, not at this moment. </p><p>It was time to take control properly. </p><p>I leaned down to capture her nipple between my lips, my teeth and tongue doing their best to show the benefits of having an older, experienced lover to destroy her hesitation. With her body already overcharged thanks to her earlier exhibitionist show — compounded by the kiss — that didn’t last long, especially once my hands joined the mix and started exploring her body aggressively. </p><p>Her head bent back as she moaned, for once without obstruction, loud enough to suppress the music. </p><p>Lost in her pleasure, she didn’t realize the real aim when I led her to rise momentarily, more focused on the kisses I had been pressing against her belly, not asking the important questions, like why I was shuffling and shimmying … or why were was my other hand. </p><p>She might have not asked the questions, but she received the answer when she landed on my lap once more. </p><p>My naked lap. </p><p>She immediately tensed, the sudden escalation catching her by surprise. I could have penetrated her right there, but that would run counter to my most important objective. Instead, I caught her lips and pulled her against my chest, kissing her hard enough to steal her breath while she was subjected to the warmth of my lower body without anything annoying in place. </p><p>I let her pull back only minutes later, leaving her gasping for breath. “We … we can’t do this. We’re drunk,” she said, reaching for her strongest excuse … unaware that it had been depleted. </p><p>“Do me a favor and list the alphabet backward,” I said as I let her pull back slightly, but kept my hands on her hips to make sure she stayed immobile. She looked at me blankly, not registering the reason for the question even as she followed it. I followed with two more questions and a tongue twister. </p><p>She cleared all of them perfectly, but toward the end, it clicked. “I … I’m not drunk. How?” </p><p>“Did you think I would allow them to bring actual alcohol into the room when we had a pregnant guest?” I said, with absolutely no problem using Jenny as an excuse rather than explaining my well-intentioned — but ultimately useless, considering she was on my naked lap, wearing nothing but her sexy and sopping panties — attempts to keep her from acting like a whore. </p><p>She froze, her blush turning even thicker as she no doubt processed the night once again, this time without the excuse she had been using. Once the realization hit, she trembled desperately, her beautiful eyes wide open. </p><p>“Yes, boss. You did everything you have done to seduce me without the slightest influence?” I said even as I grabbed her hips, but before pulling her forward, I ripped off her panties, the sexy but thin fabric giving in easily, designed for such purposes. </p><p>Her eyes widened at the sudden aggression, but when she opened her lips, I was already close enough to slip my tongue, our bodies pressing together. Yet, no matter how tempting it was, I didn’t push my hips up to take that last step, once again giving her just enough leeway to leave no excuse. </p><p>Another minute of passionate kissing … and her lips lowered. </p><p>Just like that, she was reeled in completely. </p><p>It was the time for a feast. </p>
