        <p>While the unfamiliar guest looked at me, I looked at Natalie, expecting her to leave. However, it was the girl that I was struggling to remember who spoke first. “Just send them a message and delay it for an hour, we have a lot of things to talk about,” she said.</p><p>It was a weird declaration to order me to terminate my imaginary call, though, curious, I acted like I pressed a button and acted like I ended the call, even typed a message — even though it meant I let go of Tiffany’s head, expecting her to pull back. </p><p>She continued. Naughty.</p><p>Meanwhile, she sat down, while Natalie delayed until she could sit. Meaning, she was someone important — well, someone important’s wife or daughter, likely, but sometimes, that was all one needed — enough to make her hesitate.  </p><p>I glanced at Natalie, who nodded decisively. “I think it’s for the best if Nathan stays as well. His presence will be beneficial for the discussion. He has been instrumental in the recent surge.”</p><p>She looked at me and nodded … though her blush was unmistakable. She had a crush on me; probably relating to her expectations that I remembered her. “Of course,” she said, delivering it with only the slightest hesitation. “Not a surprise though. Nathan has an incredible reputation in our line of business,” she said as she looked at me. “I have even written a thesis last year based on our discussion, and it was the best in class,” she said, still confident that I remembered her. </p><p>“A fascinating achievement. I’m sure the chairman was happy that the company will be in your incredible hands once he retires,” Natalie answered … unknowingly resolving my dilemma. Now, I remembered her. </p><p>It was the owner’s daughter, who I met during some kind of company event during the acquisition; likely a year and half before my eventual exile. She had annoyed me for an hour with pointless management theories and other nonsense. </p><p>Interesting. She had been a mousy little thing back then, a brown-haired, slightly plump girl with more enthusiasm than smarts, desperate to show off her smart theories; which prevented me from seducing an incredible brunette. Of course, back then, I indulged her … as annoying the owner of the company with a net worth in billions hardly a smart move. </p><p>Naturally, the acquisition of my company — or even my eventual exile — was too small to get the attention of the chairman for longer than a summary paragraph, or a slide page in a presentation, but in the same vein, a sentence delivered with a frown would have been enough to destroy the sale. </p><p>So, I indulged his mousy daughter during dinner. </p><p>Interestingly, she wasn’t as mousy anymore. Her hair changed into a bright blonde, and she must have spent quite a bit of time at the gym, getting rid of her fat … leaving some very interesting curves, which her current casual dress framed very well. </p><p>Very interesting. </p><p>If only I could remember her name. Something with an ‘R’ … no, includes an ‘R’ … probably … maybe.</p><p>I shrugged. After decades in business, I was an expert in acting like I was good friends with people no matter how annoying the situation was, and my current state was nowhere near annoying. Distracting a sexy young woman while I had another sexy ally in the room was hardy a chore … and the presence of Tiffany under the table, still blowing me expertly could turn torture into heaven. </p><p>While I was thinking that, Natalie walked around the table to sit next to me, no doubt to give me some directions if needed … only to tremble the moment she caught what was happening. </p><p>“Is something wrong?” the chairman’s daughter asked. </p><p>“Just a message from my girlfriend. S-she’s pregnant, so I’m a bit worried,” Natalie answered, her shock not preventing her from coming up with an excellent lie. </p><p>Another benefit of life in a corporation. </p><p>“Oh, you should go and call her. It’s a special moment. Nathan can entertain me while you’re away,” she said. “And, how many times I have to tell you, don’t call me madam. It makes me feel old. Call me Dorothy.” </p><p>“Alright, Dorothy,” Natalie whispered, and after a warning glare at me, trying to tell me to be careful, she left. </p><p>It was so unfair. I was always careful… It was her fault to barge in when I was busy. </p><p>“So, how is college. Have you managed to make your mark just like I told you?” I said, watching her blush. Did I remember what I told her during that boring chat? Certainly not, but it was easy to imagine the kind of bullshit I would have told. </p><p>With her clear interest in business, I probably drew a convincing scientific picture about building a business, all about analyzing the market, tracking the financials, sprinkled with genius instincts and occasional inspirations … and avoiding even the mention of backroom dealings that truly drove my success. </p><p>All sprinkled with a lot of compliments. </p><p>However, looking at her eager expression as Natalie walked out, I realized that I might have overdone it slightly. “Oh, you remember our talk,” she murmured, her eyes brightening. </p><p>How interesting … and promising.  </p><p>Of course, I didn’t have a grudge against her, or even her father. She was a non-entity, and her father was pretty hands-on, his biggest crime was the new CEO he had brought. She turned out to be a penny-counting bitch, and decided that bullying me until I quit was a nice way to make some savings to impress the Chairman and the other minor shareholders. </p><p>“Of course, I remembered. Not every day a boring business dinner is interrupted by a budding genius with many ideas,” I said. Once again, I had no idea what she had said … but I was sure that it was genius. </p><p>Any idea generated by a pretty woman with more than a billion to be inherited was genius; as confirmed by people around her. </p><p>“Oh, you still remember my variation of the market analysis methods?” she said excitedly. “Actually, I have made some more changes,” she said, and launched a long explanation. Her excitement was intense enough that she didn’t notice when Natalie entered the room and sat back to me, listening to our discussion with a fascinated expression, treating her like a genius. </p><p>It had all the hallmarks of an extremely boring one hour … but Tiffany’s presence was enough to resolve that particular challenge beautifully, keeping the discussion very pleasant. Tiffany was an excellent cocksucker, her lips going up and down… </p><p>Natalie didn’t share my enjoyment, her expression tight and stony as she glanced under the table far too many times despite her outwardly pleasant expression, and whenever they glanced at each other, Tiffany’s eyes were bright with amusement. </p><p>Clearly, there was no love lost between them, and I suspected Tiffany was feeling like the current situation was a good way to take revenge. Tiffany clearly understood that Dorothy was Natalie’s superior … but I seriously doubted she understood just how high. </p><p>A word from Dorothy was enough to ruin their lives … even against me, it had the risk of creating a significant annoyance that would require months to clear. </p><p>Yet, that only made the dance of her lips more entertaining. “That’s an interesting theory,” I commented. After all, while I was humoring her, it couldn’t be done by just listening to her while nodding. That way, she would eventually get bored. “That’s actually one of the drivers of our recent growth. When I joined the local department, the managerial practices were outdated.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” Dorothy said, excited. “How exactly did you manage to implement them,” she said.</p><p>I smirked at Natalie’s panic, which was bigger than her earlier panic when she noticed Tiffany, mixed with betrayal. She clearly expected me to steal all the credit and leave her in trouble. </p><p>Admittedly, three months ago, I would have done it mercilessly, but now, things were different. She was going to be one of the mothers of my child, and while I might not be the most paternal, that would not work. “Actually, I was just the messenger, and responsible for some of the client-facing aspects. Natalie is the real genius, particularly when it comes to financials,” I said. </p><p>And, spun an excellent story about her expertise in accounting and finance, and how it helped to save the company a lot of money. Ironically, all the times I had worked on the financials to identify the money she had swindled from the company helped. </p><p>With that issue resolved, there was no harm in using those abilities to extol her qualities. I had no doubt that Natalie could continue explaining, as I wasn’t exaggerating her skills, just adjusting their origins a bit, and linking her genius to Dorothy’s ideas. </p><p>At first, it seemed like I was still stealing credit from Natalie and giving it to Dorothy, but that was not the case. If so, Natalie wouldn’t have smiled at me as Christmas had come early. </p><p>It was an excellent opportunity for Natalie to get a hefty promotion, and if she played her cards really well, a lifelong contact that would elevate her career to incredible heights. </p><p>“Actually, I’m not sure Natalie mentioned it because she doesn’t like bragging, but the next workshop is also inspired by your ideas. Why don’t you join and listen from behind.” </p><p>Admittedly, keeping Dorothy near to use against that bitch that was supposed to be the CEO was tempting … but I decided against it. </p><p>Ultimately, I just wanted to finish my contract and receive the promised high seven-figure bonus before disappearing. No need to get into contact with such a volatile element. </p><p>Young women with crushes on older men were volatile enough without having billionaire fathers… </p><p>“A good idea,” she said, blushing as she stood up, telling me the danger was not over. “And we can discuss it over drinks tonight. Though, it has to be early, as I have to fly away…” </p><p>But she seemed to have other ideas. I was lucky that she had plans. </p><p>The moment they left, I grabbed Tiffany’s head and started fucking her face mercilessly, driving for a quick explosion even as I punished — and rewarded — her for her hour-long torture… </p><p>Only after she swallowed every little drop, she stand up, a sexy smile on her lips. “You owe me a new dress as well,” she smirked. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said with a smirk and left. </p>
