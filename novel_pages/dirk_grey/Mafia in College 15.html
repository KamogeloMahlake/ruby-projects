        <p>I had always been a light sleeper, so it wasn’t surprising that my sleep was dispersed the moment I felt alongside my body, though my arms wrapped around its source reflexively. I heard a gasp the moment my arms tightened. I opened my eyes, only to find the agitated -and very naked- figure of my problem student Megan. </p><p>“Let me go,” she ordered me in a manner she obviously thought as commanding and cold, but she was too experienced to successfully hide the tremble in her tone. </p><p>“And what if I don’t,” I answered with a smirk. It was obvious that she was trying to leverage the practiced coldness of an heiress to push through the vulnerability. After all, it couldn’t be comfortable for her that she basically bared her soul -and body- naked for a professor she hated, even when saving her from the obvious kidnapping was factored. </p><p>“How dare you-” she tried to start, only to be cut off by a moan. The reason, my fingers, gently caressing a particularly sensitive spot on her neck, which I had discovered during the previous activities. “Cut it-” she tried, but her attempt foiled by yet another soft caress. </p><p>“Don’t be rude,” I ordered even as I brought my other hand to her thigh, squeezing suggestively. “You’re a guest, and it’s unseemly for a guest to shout like that.” </p><p>“I want to go,” she whispered, but this time, there was an easy-to-detect tremble in her tone, the same needy tone that she carried when she was in the shower, begging for my touch. </p><p>“Of course,” I said, even as I brought my hand higher, just an inch away from her slit, its wetness obvious for my eyes. “Do you want to go now, or would you like a repeat first.” </p><p>“I would like to go now,” she repeated, but the wavering in her tone was obvious. All it would take was a little push, and she would comply. Instead, I pulled my hands away and left her alone, much to her surprise. The reason was simple, I was curious about her reaction. </p><p>Her first response was a silent surprise, like she hadn’t been expecting her simple request to be fulfilled. And it would be a lie if I said that while watching her naked body, I wasn’t tempted to push her down and trap her between my body and the mattress slamming repeatedly until I broke the bed. There was something about taming arrogant rich girls in such a primal way that made it truly enjoyable. But also, it was the pursuit that made hunting fun, and I wanted Megan to run away to recover a bit before I pounced for the final time. I was curious about how long she would last. </p><p>She harrumphed in disdain after her surprise finally drained, and stood up, trying to take the blanket to cover her body, but after a snort from me, she realized the ridiculousness of it, and let it go. She walked towards the pile of discarded clothes, bent down to pick them up, and giving me an amazing view in the process. She noticed my attentive watch and cattily commented. “Do you mind?” </p><p>“I do mind, actually,” I commented, my eyes firmly on her body. “Why should I deprive myself of such a nice view?” </p><p>“Pig,” she murmured, but her actions were in contrast to her words. Not only she hadn’t gone to the bathroom to change, but also she maintained a sensual pace as she dressed, giving me a rather excellent show. “I’m going away now, you better never talk about what had just happened if you want to keep your job,” she explained, before stopping for a second. “Actually, you better forget that it ever happened, clear?” she followed, and I chose to nod, unable to keep away my amusement. </p><p>With that, Megan left my apartment, leaving me alone. The moment she disappeared, a serious expression appeared on my face. While spending time with her had been fun, the appearance of my old business partners was quite a risk. There was a limit of effectiveness for the plastic surgery, and if I continued to intercept them, it was a matter of time before I was recognized. I needed to call some old friends, no matter how inconvenient it might be. </p><p>With a sigh, I reached for my burner and quickly typed a familiar number. The voice on the other side was sharp and dangerous. “Who are you, and how do you have this number?”</p><p>I didn’t let the naked hostility in his tone to affect me. “Are you always this hostile when greeting old friends, chief,” I said amusedly, but my tone was different than what I had used while teaching in the college — yet another part of my disguise. </p><p>“Holy shit, that’s a familiar voice. Marcus, is that you?” said the voice on the other side, the hostility instantly converted into an amused shock. </p><p>“Sharp as always, chief. How are you? Still trying to teach a bunch of green detectives how to wipe their own asses?” </p><p>“I wish I could say otherwise, but that’s, unfortunately, the case. Even worse, the recruits are getting dumber every year? Does every smart boy have to go to crime instead of trying to prevent it.” </p><p>“Well, crime pays better,” I countered in amusement. “Still, look from the bright side, there are worse options. They might choose to be an investment banker, or if they were feeling particularly heartless, lawyer.” </p><p>“That’s true, there are worse things than organized crime,” said the other side from the phone. I smiled. It was the reason I liked the police chief, even when he was leading the organized crime, doing his best to destroy us. He was an old shark, alert and dangerous, but he had a sense of humor. Also, I was lucky that I had recognized the danger he presented, and chose to occasionally tip him about the operations of my rival -both in other organizations, and in my own organization-, and in turn, he wasn’t as rigorous while chasing me. All around, it had been a nice deal. </p><p>“It feels good to catch up, but I’m sure you have a reason to call, especially after the stunt you have pulled,” the old chief said. “By the way, I’m still angry about it, after you have pulled that shit, the mafia turned into an irritated wasp nest, creating chaos wherever they went.” </p><p>“Sorry about it, but you know how it is. I saw a chance, so I took a shot. The rest was just bad luck. But the reason I have called because I have seen some of my old buddies,” I said before giving a small breakdown of the event, though I made sure to tell the story like I was a passerby, not wanting to be identified. I didn’t expect the chief to suddenly change his operating mode and target me, but it was better to be safe than sorry. </p><p>“That’s a tough situation,” he murmured after I explained the whole situation. “Are you sure she won’t just accept protective custody.” </p><p>“Not likely. I have done a bit of digging, and her family started to have some dealing with my old buddies. At that point, I doubt if she even gives a statement without a soulless lawyer wetting her every word.” </p><p>“That’s too bad. I wouldn’t have minded having an excuse to go after the big boys, and trying to kidnap a rich white girl is exactly the case that would allow me to push things into upper echelons.” I understood his disappointment very well. For all its supposed duty, the police was a highly-political organization beholden to whims of old men who liked power and benefits a lot more than they cared about public good, but a case attractive enough to catch the public imagination would allow things to </p><p>“Why don’t you send an undercover agent to gather some information while also doubling as protection.” </p><p>“That wouldn’t work,” answered the chief. “Without the victim's cooperation, my detective can’t stay close enough to be effective, nor can gather information effectively.” </p><p>A smirk appeared on my face. “What if I told you that I have a way so that she can stay close to the target.” </p><p>“How are you-” he started before suddenly coming to a stop. “You know what, I don’t want to know. The less I know, the more distant I would be when it finally explodes,” he said with cheerful resignation. “And I don’t suppose you’re willing to do it for free, for the safety of the city?” </p><p>I snorted. “That’s a nice dream, but I want two things. First, I want a favor, which I’ll cash on a later date.” </p><p>“That works,” said the old chief without hesitation. After all, it wasn’t the first time we had such a deal. “What’s your second request.” </p><p>“I have a certain detective in mind for the assignment.” </p><p>This time, a surprised laugh came from the other side. “Damn, boy. I didn’t know you were suicidal. After your last encounter, are you sure you want her any closer than fifty miles.” </p><p>“What’s life without a bit of danger,” I answered even as the moments that led to that spectacular explosion popped into my mind, a smile appearing on my face. “Just arrange her to join the college as an exchange student, and give this number by saying it’s the number of her handler. I’ll handle the rest.” </p><p>A chuckle was my answer. “It’s your funeral,” he said, and we continued talking several minutes more, focusing on the details of the assignment, and its possible implications. Still, a smirk was on my face as I imagined her arrival. Things were about to get really excited here… </p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>The next few hours after dealing with Megan was rather annoying, especially when I went through my apartment to make sure nothing incriminating was lying around. It seemed prudent with the incoming presence of my rival. I wasn’t planning to have her as a guest in my apartment of course; I was aiming to stay under her radar despite the circumstances. But, safety was paramount under the circumstances, so I stayed focused. </p><p>My next destination was my office, with a similar thought in mind, but I stopped when I came across a happy encounter, namely, my new assistant Camilla, dressed in a long skirt and an equally-boring top, walking around in the gardens, alone and distracted. A smirk appeared on my face as I sneaked towards her, staying on her blind spot trivial after all the times I had stalked people, usually with much deadlier aims. </p><p>I moved even closer when she moved into a blind spot that lacked any cameras, which was also quite difficult to be seen from outside, I quickly closed the distance, still careful not to make any sound that would alert her. “Hello,” I whispered when I was just a step away from her, and she jumped in panic, a cry ready on her lips, only to be prevented by a searing kiss. I kept my eyes open, enjoying the sheer panic on her panic slowly melt away as she managed to recognize her assaulter, but mattered little against her out-of-control heartbeat. </p><p>Soon, it clicked to her that we were in a public place, lacking my understanding about the lack of observers. “What are you doing!” she whispered in panic as she tried to push me away. “What if someone sees us!” </p><p>“Then they see us,” I answered dismissively as I closed the distance once more. She took a step back in panic, only for her back to press against the wall. I followed immediately, locking her in place while pushing my foot between her legs, more to caress her inner thighs than to prevent her escape, as she was too docile to react like that in the first place. </p><p>“But…” she started, but her words were easy to cut when I leaned forward, my lips leaving a passionate yet gentle kiss over her neck, turning into a gasp when I softly nibbled her skin. She said nothing as I slid my hands under her skirt, slowly dragging them upwards, revealing more of her creamy-chocolate legs with each passing moment to any passerby that we might have, her heartbeat going out of control further. Her silence lasted until my fingers found the edge of her underwear — another boring piece, I surmised from the feeling on my fingertips. </p><p>“That’s too much!” she exclaimed in panic while I pulled her panties down, but a stiff glare was enough to silence her. And since my head was already raised, it was convenient to close in with another searing kiss that cut her breathing while her panties ended up around her ankles, and one of my hands started to traverse the same path under her skirt once more, this time, target location bereft of protection. </p><p>Her gasp when my fingers touched her nether lips was beautiful, but not as much as her wetness, proving that despite all the claims of fear, she was enjoying the sensations fully. With that in mind, my fingers slid inside her tunnel, and started pumping mercilessly without a warning, triggering a chain of helpless moans that was muffled by my lips. </p><p>Distracted by more important things, she didn’t react when I pulled her top up, nor I opened her bra -again plain boring- to throw it on the nearest trashcan. That managed to bring her out of her daze, and she looked at me with emotion what I might call anger on a kitten, cute rather than intimidating, especially when mixed with arousal. “I’ll discard any piece of underwear that I find boring, so either acquired better ones, or start walking around commando, your choice,” I explained, not stopping the merciless pumping of my fingers even for a moment. </p><p>“But…” she murmured with a sudden bashful expression before cutting her words halfway. </p><p>“Continue!” I ordered, curious about what she managed to feel ashamed under the circumstances. </p><p>“I…” she murmured while I slowed down my assault, but kept my fingers buried deep inside her. “I can’t afford,” she murmured after a moment.</p><p>“Not a problem, we’ll go shopping together,” I said, and she looked at me once more, her expression sterner than I had ever seen on her face, signaling that I finally managed to hit a critical spot. It was either a concern of accepting charity, or thinking it was a payment for sexual favors, but since both conversations would be unnecessarily boring, I cut it off. “Think it off as the stipend for your assistant role, because you’ll still be responsible for reading all the papers,” I explained her, which was enough to take the edge off her expression, the remainder melted under a renewed assault of my fingers, some buried in her while others mauled her rather spectacular breasts. </p><p>And with the risk of crisis resolved, I was free to push for more. “We’re going to go shopping tomorrow,” I ordered her while I grabbed her wrist, and brought her hand to my zipper, expecting her to do to rest. She didn’t disappoint, her fingers found the zipper, pulling it down with a great hurry before freed my shaft from the uncomfortable grasp of my boxers. </p><p>Her reward, obvious…</p><p>I pulled my fingers out her tunnel, their presence immediately replaced by my shaft, pushed deep without mercy, enough to force a cry of her, this time, without my lips to muffle. “You need to be careful, my silly assistant. What would have happened if someone heard that? Imagine the scandal, prim and proper scholarship student caught in the garden with a teacher.” </p><p>“No!” she gasped in mortification as I reminded her something she had ignored in the heat of the moment, that we were still in a relatively accessible public space, and all it would have taken was a bored student walking around to ruin everything. “We need to stop,” she begged. </p><p>“Not before I finish,” I countered, definitely not willing to cut things short just when they were about to get interesting. “So, if you want to reduce risk, start moving your hips more, and keep your voice down.” She nodded and tried to raise her hands, but that would have been too easy, so I grabbed her wrists and pinned her arms to the side instead. “No cheating, dear Camilla,” I reminded her with a smirk, awakening her panic once more. </p><p>The next few minutes passed in a mixture of amusement and pleasure. Amusement, because watching her struggle as she tried to keep silent, helplessly biting her lips, was amusing, while the pleasure I was feeling jumped up with the additional effort she started putting, her hips gyrating amateurishly, but with great fervor, compounded by the great view of her breasts, jumping up and down with each push in a way only a top-grade one could manage. </p><p>Soon, her gasps rose a point where she could contain, especially when a rather stiff orgasm hit her mercilessly. Since I was a merciful guy, I decided to help. I pulled out her, and let her arms go. Her legs, trembling with pleasure, wasn’t ready to carry her weight, so she slid down, which was perfect for my purposes. I grabbed the back of her head to prevent it from hitting the concrete while I slid the full length of my shaft through her thick lips, effectively silencing her. There wasn’t a lot of noise she could make while her throat was clogged with my shaft. </p><p>And since there was no risk of alerting others, I took my time enjoying the grip of her throat beat by beat, until I finally hit my limit, and pulled out at the last second, only to cover her amazing breasts and beautiful face with my seed. Her dash to the shower, acutely aware of the film that covered her body despite her attempts to wipe them down was too tempting to ignore. </p><p>“Good work,” I said with a smirk as I sat next to her, our bodies touching. “Now, let’s talk about tonight’s activities with Megan. I have an amazing idea for her punishment.” </p><p>The possibility of teaching her rich girlfriend/bully was enough to awaken her from her daze. She turned to me even as she tried to reach for a napkin, but stopped once when I gestured her to leave them in place. I wanted her to stay marked while we discussed the next stage of my plan, another small thing to destroy her shyness. With a smile, I continued explaining in great detail, because likely it was going to be the only session they would have before my dear rival arrived and complicated everything with her presence…</p>
