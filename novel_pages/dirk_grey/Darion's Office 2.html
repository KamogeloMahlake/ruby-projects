        <title>Darion's Office 2</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>His smile didn’t survive for long. </p><p>The moment he stepped into his new office, the elation he felt from his earlier victory was gone. He was not exactly like his peers, driven to crime by the dreams of expensive cars and condos, aware enough to know that it was nothing but nonsense. </p><p>But that didn’t mean that he was happy to find himself in a smelly dump, bright fluorescent lighting, a dirty mess, and only a bunch of broke crates to sit down on.</p><p>“You need to stick to it just a few months, Darion,” he murmured to himself, trying to calm down.  It was the best job he could find while still staying away from the gang. And he was not a fan of hard work, working in a place filled with sexy women was enough compensation. </p><p>He had needs. </p><p>But before he could even start cleaning, his phone rang. An unknown number, but considering it was a new phone, and he only gave the number to that sexy redhead, he decided to answer. </p><p>“This is your new boss, come to the office,” said a shrill voice, before slamming his face. </p><p>“As you wish, boss…” Darion found himself murmuring. He had a lot of criminals to attest that angering him was not a good idea. Not because he got angry quickly. Quite the opposite. He had the patience to wait before pulling the rug under the target of his anger. </p><p>He ignored the fact that the corridor leading to the bathroom wasn’t any better. Unlike his room, he had no intention of cleaning the other places. </p><p>He pick the longer road, walking through the inner garden — he had already checked the plans, and knew that there was a little path that would give a glimpse of the office. He wanted to get a glimpse of his new boss before he decided on his revenge. </p><p>He might use some sharper methods if his new boss was an old hag… </p><p>“Or not…” he muttered when he took a sneak peek through the window. A sexy, black-haired woman, well-endowed enough to rival her secretary. She was clearly aware of her sexiness as well, considering she wore a white blazer, but had no blouse; a fact that was obvious even with her arm covering her body.</p><p>As he walked toward the door, he sent a message — through his burner phone, obviously — to one of his friends that did almost no work with his gang; a relationship that Darion cultivated carefully. He was an accountant, one that also handled the financials — mostly money laundering — of his little coffee shop. </p><p>The answer didn’t come immediately, nor that Darion needed. He knocked on the door, ready to meet with his new boss. </p><p>He decided to give her boss a fun punishment, the kind that they could both enjoy. And he was sure that he could find a way to convince her of that, though it would be considerably easier if his friend could point in the right direction. </p><p>He didn’t believe anyone actually had a squeaky-clean business. Taxes were inconvenient for everyone. </p><p>“Come in,” came the answer from inside, and Darion did so, standing face-t0-face with his new boss. “So, you’re the new janitor,” she said. He noted both the distaste in her tone, and the wandering nature of her eyes, focusing particularly on his arms. </p><p>Not that he blamed her. He had a lot of time to work out in prison. </p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” he answered, though he didn’t bother to hide his smile, showing that it was more of a mocking tease than a genuine show of respect. One that was underlined by his wandering gaze, dancing down first, staying locked to her cleavage, then up again. </p><p>A clear expression of distaste appeared on her face as he examined her body, but it only made his smile even wider. “No one taught you that staring is rude,” she said, her voice challenging. </p><p>“They did, but some things are worth the risk,” he said as he closed in, enjoying as her distaste turned into a smoldering kind of anger. Not exactly a problem, as anger was a surprisingly easy emotion to mold into lust, a tool that most men were too weak to use. </p><p>Or lacked the assets to do so. </p><p>“Rude,” she answered, but that didn’t prevent her from sending an appreciative glance at his body as he closed in the distance, leaning toward her to give an even better show of his body. </p><p> “Maybe, but that doesn’t make it less true—“ Darion started, wondering whether he even needed any dirt to actually make any progress. Some women liked their chocolate bitter, and unless his game frizzled horribly, he was sure that his new boss was one of them. </p><p>Unfortunately, he was interrupted by an unwelcome knock. </p><p>“Or, not so unwelcome,” he muttered, too soft for his new boss to hear. </p><p>The reason, was the sexy redhead that walked into the room, one that was different from the sexy secretary he had dealt with earlier. He wasn’t sure which one was sexier, but the same challenge didn’t exist to measure which one was the sluttier. </p><p>The new redhead, with her absurdly high crop top — more of a large bra — and her transparent shorts, showed her assets to the best of effect. </p><p>“Oh, hello, handsome,” she said with a soft, alluring voice. “I’m sure you’re not a new employee, as we certainly don’t get anything as fun here.” </p><p>“I aim to please, but —“ Darion started, smiling wide, even though he didn’t miss the slightly mocking tone in her voice. She clearly had an angle more than his apparent attraction, but he was not the one to stop him from flirting with a woman with such clear needs. </p><p>Even if she was a bit to the younger side, barely in her twenties. </p><p>“Hell no, little sister,” his boss gasped, solving the small mystery about how someone thought that was a work-appropriate outfit. “You can’t flirt with the employees.” </p><p>“Oh, even when they are built like a castle,” she answered with a smirk, taking a slow, sauntering step forward, seductive enough to stir his pants despite knowing she was clearly trying to anger her older sister rather than trying to actually flirt with him. </p><p>“Working hard is a basic responsibility for any employee,” Darion answered, mocking in words, but throaty in tone, watching as her fake flirty smile tremble into something slightly more honest. </p><p>Maybe his little parole stint would be even more fun than he had initially expected — which was already a hard bar to clear with the two examples he had stumbled on. </p><p>Unfortunately, just as he took a step forward to see just how far she was willing to push that little game, her sister dashed between us, looking at me angrily. “Oh, hell no!” she growled in anger. “You’ll make sure to stay away from her, or it’s your job, understood!” </p><p>Darion ordinarily didn’t appreciate people threatening him, but he was willing to make an exception for his new boss, she raised her arm giving an amazing glimpse into her cleavage that continued the job that her sister started. </p><p>Behind her, the redhead was snickering in amusement, clearly more interested in angering her sister than making the flirting real. </p><p>Darion trusted himself to change that. </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” he said, even managing to keep his sarcasm concealed — though the entitled anger she displayed made it much easier to achieve. </p><p>“If you finished protecting my chastity, sister, we’re going to be late,” the redhead said — though with the way she dressed, Darion could see the intervention had arrived too late.</p><p>“Move, and don’t dress like a whore in my office,” she answered, and they left. </p><p>Allowing Darion to enjoy their exit perfectly. </p><p>He smirked, realizing that with the sudden distraction, she didn’t even tell him why she called him to his office. “For the next time, then —“ Darion murmured, only to be interrupted by his burner phone buzzing. </p><p>It was the confirmation of his guess. Not only his new boss was using some shady practices, but also she didn’t use anything digital for those ladders. </p><p>Excellent, he thought. All that remained was searching, a task that his janitor job was perfectly suited for.</p>
