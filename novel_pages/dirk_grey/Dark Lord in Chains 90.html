        <p>I spent some time, trying to decide on the most urgent direction to question her. Unfortunately, after her latest explosive statement, I had many directions to choose from: her transformation, the phoenixes and their strategic priorities, the objectives of the elven side, and the existence of the other dimension. </p><p>Whether she had any idea what this mysterious Threat was — albeit the naming sense gave me the impression that she didn’t… </p><p>Facing questions spreading to many directions, each more important than the others, I felt myself getting locked, losing myself in choice paralysis. It was not a common habit of mine, as I was more than capable of pushing through such arbitrary barriers and picking a direction to start first. Unfortunately, it took a moment for me to realize the reason for that uncharacteristic indecisiveness. </p><p>The growing sensation of power, spreading along my body, left a sensation not too dissimilar from getting tipsy, just enough to slow my decision-making. </p><p>How interesting, I thought, fascinated by the phenomenon. And, amusingly, distracted by that, I had failed to realize that my body continued its steady movement. </p><p>With a spectacular impact. </p><p>Cinder’s moan revealed that I wasn’t the only one getting lost in the baser side of the emotional spectrum. </p><p>And, if her delirious moans were any indicator, she wasn’t coping with it nearly as well as I was doing. Combined with my steady invasion, she was not too far away from another climax. Drunk with pleasure, any answer she might provide about my questions was suspect, requiring a follow-up later on to validate their accuracy.</p><p>Of course, pulling back and giving her some time to recover before I started asking those questions was an option… </p><p>Just an unappealing one, so I chose to go with a different option.</p><p>The exact opposite, in fact.  </p><p>“Since we started, it would be rude to stop halfway,” I murmured. Her response, wordless yet desperate, was enough to show her approach to that aspect. The combined pleasure of her transformation and her first time clearly had pushed her enough to compromise her ability to use words, but that didn’t change the intensity hidden in her desperate moan. </p><p>“You’re right,” I said with a chuckle, once again spanking her ass, enjoying the fact that, if I tried to do so an hour ago, she would have done her best to kill me rather than moan deliriously. </p><p>Let’s teach you the true meaning of pleasure,” I murmured even as I tightened my grip over her hips, pumping with shocking aggression that shook her beautiful body relentlessly, each second intensifying her beautiful moans, the pillow she buried her face in doing little to contain her voice. </p><p>Though, whether it was about the intensity of her pleasure, or the pillow’s compromised texture as it continued to burn was a different question — flames that we easily ignored thanks to the transformation. </p><p>Still, since I decided to finish our little encounter spectacularly, I didn’t show the slightest attempt to contain the reckless rush of my hips, showing the benefits of my enhanced stamina — which was already impressive beforehand — my hips moving like an enchanted drill, moving in and out, showing no signs of slowing down. </p><p>Which clearly earned her approval, as evidenced by the way her hips rose — as much as she could manage while pinned under me — to allow easier access as I slammed deep, my full weight behind every hit. </p><p>“Such a naughty phoenix,” I said with a chuckle even as I let my hands move in opposite directions. My left hand had a short journey, dipping down between her legs to massage her soft core, circling around her clit with a sudden yet relentless assault, adding another layer to her intense pleasure. </p><p>Which had been enough to trigger another climax, making another earthquake cover her beautiful skin, the flames that covered the full expanse of her body exploding intensely, enough to force me to refresh the spell that was keeping her bed intact — well, relatively intact. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the position of my right hand, that might have been enough to send her to the land of unconsciousness. My fingers tightened around her hair, the dancing flames tickling my skin as I tightened my hold and pulled her head back. </p><p>Hard enough for the jolt of pain to properly awaken her. </p><p>“Oh honey, it’s rude to leave the party early,” I said with a chuckle as I continued drilling without slowing my pace the slightest, her increased tightness elevating the already-spectacular pleasure to the next stage.</p><p>Her moans rose in response, soft and obedient. </p><p>“Let’s see your beautiful face,” I murmured after another minute as I suddenly pulled out and flipped her, not skipping a beat before skewering her beautiful core once more. </p><p>“N-no!” she gasped in shock, her voice colored with a beautiful tone of shame. She tried to cover her face with her hands, but I shifted my gaze and hold both. </p><p>Her response earned a chuckle. She folded her wings instead, which covered both her face and her breasts at the same time. </p><p>That would not do, I decided, no matter how beautiful the flames of passion that were dancing on the surface of her wings. Yet, rather than giving an order, I stopped grabbing her wrists and slipped under her wings, letting my fingers sink into her beautiful tits once more. </p><p>She gasped, and in her voice, I could hear an attempt to say something. Pity that died as I rammed into her core as hard as I could manage, her natural endurance making sure that it still stayed pleasurable rather than turning painful. </p><p>“P-please,” she managed to gasp after a while despite the combined pleasure. </p><p>“Please, what?” I asked, unable to hold back my chuckle. “Are you asking me to stop?” I asked. </p><p>Her response was spectacular. “No!” she gasped desperately, the intensity of desperation enough to convince a passerby that I was trying to kill her instead. The flames of her wings, exploding in intensity, just highlighted her frustration further. </p><p>“Oh sweetie, you need to show your beautiful face if you want me to continue,” I reminded her, and her wings twitched, showing that the intense emotions she was feeling weren’t enough to suppress the sudden bout of self-consciousness she found herself suffering. </p><p> Yet, that conflict only lasted a few seconds before she followed my direction, and slowly unveiled her face. </p><p>I had already seen the intensity of her pleasure on her face before, but that didn’t mean another glimpse was any less enjoyable as she revealed it once more, treating me to a beautiful mixture of shyness and joy. </p><p>“What a little horny phoenix,” I said as I twisted her nipples, occasionally interrupting with spanks on her beautiful tits. Unfortunately, that attempt was enough to destroy her partial recovery, and she found herself restricted to moans and grunts as the pleasure invaded her body completely. </p><p>She tried to shift to a more comfortable position, but I held her tightly, preventing her from moving as I once again alternated between her tight hole and her core. </p><p>It was about making her feel the full extent of pleasure, not lazy comfort. If I was going to stop my questioning, I was going to do so for a spectacular show.</p><p>My cock continued to jam into her tight hole, each push adding another small hint of intensity to her explosive moans, the little spaces in between barely enough for a desperate gasp to replenish her breath. </p><p>Yet, her desperate gulps of air didn’t prevent her from dancing at the edge of unconsciousness, even with the assistance of her supernatural resistance. </p><p>“That’s all?” I said with a chuckle as I spanked her breast once more, this time accompanied by a spell to enhance the stinging sensation, as she would have collapsed prematurely without that. “And here I am, thinking that the phoenixes are superior species, able to handle anything. Maybe I should seduce an elf next?” </p><p>Amusingly, the little dig worked much better than all my other tricks combined, triggering her flames — both literally and metaphorically — as she made an attempt to rose. </p><p>It was easily negated, the slightest pressure to her shoulder enough to keep her stable, but the renewed passion was enough to give her the necessary boost to stay conscious as I pushed forward once more, her tightness enough to bring me to the edge of a climax. </p><p>I pulled out of her tightness at the last second, targeting her face, spraying her beautiful face and tits with endless strings of my seed, the expression of outrage on her face beautiful as it mixed with her earlier flare. </p><p>Especially as one last twist of her nipple triggered a near-simultaneous climax for her, elevating the emotional cocktail to the next stage. </p><p>The confused expression on her face, resulting from a combination of arousal, exhaustion, and a sprinkle of sudden fury was amazing.</p><p>I watched her fall asleep, finally overwhelmed by the great challenge she had experienced, with a big smile. The flames that covered her skin slowly disappeared, yet the glow of her skin didn’t disappear completely, turning into a little soft glow…</p><p>It didn’t matter how many times it happened. Watching a pointlessly arrogant lady slowly losing all ability to resist pleasure, surrendering to me wholeheartedly, was always a pleasure.</p>
