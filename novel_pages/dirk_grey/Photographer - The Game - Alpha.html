        <p>Hello everyone, </p><p>I have yet another experiment in front of you, this time, an attempt of creating a proper Visual novel, based on my existing stories. What we have here is essentially a very short demo, with almost no content, just as an example of what might have been. </p><p>Currently, I can't promise a timeline, as not only I have to learn some more coding, rendering, and photoshop, it's also a significant time commitment, and I'm certainly not going to reduce my weekly chapter output. </p><p>Still, I would love to hear your opinion on the following survey.  </p>
