        <p> “Watch carefully, you need to check whether I’m making any mistake,” I ordered Oeyne even as I cast a spell, levitating the glowing glob of liquid silver, flying in the air under my control, even as I used my earth magic to create a casting mold for the design I had in mind, mixed with some ice magic to ensure rapid cooling. Meanwhile, I saturated the earthen construct with my mana, letting my mana fill the structure of the silver, essentially testing the limits of casting. </p><p>[-267 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Craft]</p><p>“That’s one way to optimize -” Oeyne murmured, her voice strained, cutting short as I plunged deeper inside her tight hole, stretching her further. </p><p>“Yes, a wide range of magical abilities doesn’t exactly hurt,” I said lazily as I slapped her ass once more, watching her vast flesh ripple. At this point in our relationship, I was intentionally revealing some of my abilities, with the full knowledge that she would mention those abilities to the princess. It was an indirect method of elevating my value. </p><p>Otherwise, the trick I had just done didn’t achieve anything that couldn’t be done by any normal blacksmith, but it did save me almost half an hour in terms of time. It was especially important because, unlike a normal blacksmith, I didn’t have multiple pieces I had been working on to leverage the waiting time more efficiently. </p><p>And while playing with Oeyne while waiting was certainly tempting, with the growing undead pressure, wasn’t really in the mood for that. The sooner I finish with this trinket, the sooner I could move onto the other items on my agenda. It was particularly bad, because I had no idea when the necromancers or their mysterious backers would react to our rather outrageous assault. </p><p>They might react later in the day before we could restructure our defenses to factor in the presence of their dangerous leader, or they might attack a week later, with a completely different plan. It was for the best if I prepare accordingly. </p><p>Oeyne was busy moaning under my repeated teasing as I broke the mold, floating the cold piece of silver toward me, along with a large hammer that would be used for shaping the silver further. Working on silver wasn’t as scary as it might sound, because, unlike iron and steel, most of the work was done through cold smithing, meaning there wouldn’t be inconvenient flying globs of burning metal or other dangerous features. </p><p>Not that iron smithing would have been too dangerous, as I was confident in my abilities to protect us, but still, it would have prevented me from enjoying Oeyne’s deliciously tight grip. </p><p>I raised the hammer even as I gathered a generous amount of mana, quite a bit more than what Oeyne had recommended earlier. “That’s too much-” Oeyne tried to speak, but I slammed the hammer down, leaving a strong dent on the circle-shaped silver piece, the ringing of the hammer suppressing her voice. </p><p>[-196 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Craft]</p><p>“Impossible,” she tried to speak once more as I raised my hammer, no doubt trying to communicate her disbelief as I raised the hammer again, the mana safely injected into the silver, obediently soaking into its internal structure. Her shock was understandable, as I imbued the hammer quite a bit more than what could be deemed safe. Any ordinary blacksmith —assuming one strong enough to gather sufficient mana in the first place— would have created an unstable explosion that destroyed the hammer along with a good part of their arm, and I doubted that even Oeyne could handle injecting that much amount of mana with one hit </p><p>Though, she certainly had the skill to create a stronger item with less mana. What I was doing was essentially bullying the mana through my exceptional mana control, which I owed mostly to Tantric, and skipping several necessary steps. Essentially, if I could perfect it, I could forge a decent magical weapon in minutes rather than hours and days others would require. That wouldn’t change the mana requirements, of course, which might be a reason why there was no such recorded technique. Usually, blacksmiths and other crafters lacked mana and materials, not time. </p><p>Still, I was glad that my experiment didn’t blow on my face. </p><p>Oeyne opened her mouth even as she watched the piece of silver, no doubt about to inquire more about the near-impossible success I had just achieved, only to gasp in shock as I impaled her hard, forcing her to deliver a delicious moan instead. And just as she was about to gather her wits, I slammed the hammer again, once again imbuing the silver circlet with more mana. </p><p>[-206 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Craft]</p><p>Oeyne attempted to speak once more, only to receive the same treatment again, my shaft invading her tight hole rather aggressively, until she let out a delicious moan, the sound of our flesh colliding mixing with her moans. The assault of pleasure worked even better than the sound of the hammer to suppress her attempts to talk. </p><p>Just like that, the moment fell into a predictable rhythm, each slam of the hammer imbuing more and more mana to the silver circle, strengthening the material both physically and conceptually, all the while I enjoyed Oeyne’s cries, indicating that the pleasure was building up spectacularly.</p><p>And what a build-up that was. As my shaft delved into the deepest recesses of her body, her moans turned into a boundless river, constantly flowing out, mixing with the silvery rings of the smithing hammer. There was only one problem with the position, as I couldn’t continue smithing and explore her body with my fingers at the same time. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean I was completely helpless. </p><p>It was difficult to split my magical attention further, but using a simple arcana spell was still within my limits. I let my spell free, squeezing her breasts aggressively through a phantasmal hand, intensifying her moans further. All the while, I continued to forge, until the silver piece I was working on had soaked as much mana it could structurally handle without exploding despite my efforts to keep it contained. </p><p>[-1206 Mana]</p><p>[+2 Craft]</p><p>It was finally time to shape the enchantments. If I had been creating a sword, it wouldn’t have been that challenging in terms of enchantment, because unless the aim was to embed an exotic effect, the strengthening conceptual strength would have allowed the sword to be sharp enough to cut through the defenses that would normally resist such a blow, even from magically-reinforced steel. </p><p>It was a bit trickier when it came to the choker. The effect I was trying to create was different, so when I changed to a fine finishing hammer, I also connected directly with the mana, tying the whole mana structure under a Biomancy spell, creating a permanent obscuring effect that would help her to hide from death-energy based detection spells, as well as giving her some protection against surprise attacks.</p><p> Facing the potential necromancer invasion, some extra protection wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>As I slowly shaped the enchantments, which required focus on fine control, both that I had in spades thanks to my monstrous stats, so much that I was once again able to turn my attention back to Oeyne, who had been watching my achievements with a dazed expression, the shock from my capabilities, combined with the pleasure that was filling her whole being, distracting her quite a bit. </p><p>Since she had no problems with my exceptional drilling, I continued the treatment, slamming harder and harder inside her, testing the limits of the lubrication I had applied earlier, while the arcana spell still caressing her body, pushing her closer to a climax. </p><p>Her moans rose even further, gaining a surprisingly melodic quality as she abandoned all attempts to contain her own voice even a bit. It was a pity I missed the expression on her face, as it was no doubt spectacular, but I didn’t conjure a mirror to watch her. Mostly because I was already dealing with too many things, and we were in a tricky part of the process. So, I let her drown in her own euphoria while I finished tying down the achievement, which stretched my capabilities to the limit. </p><p>I even added some precious reagents from my pack, including a core fragment from one of the crystal monsters, its diamond-like skin perfect for containing the pure spell. After a few soft touches, the item was done, other than polishing to add a spectacular shine, but once again, my magic helped me to skip that exhaustingly time-consuming step, replicating the effect with a simple earth spell. Since the enchantments were yet to settle, it was easy to repair it magically. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the case a few minutes later, hence the reason for the easily disposable nature of the magical weapons. Once the underlying mana structure was broken, it was near impossible to repair one. And even without being broken, while maintenance was simpler than crafting from scratch, it also carried a spectacular risk of backlash if the blacksmith failed at any step. </p><p>The satisfaction of completing my first proper magical item was overwhelming, but not as much as the way Oeyne tightened around my shaft once she saw the resulting item, climaxing spectacularly. Apparently, my successful display of skills had worked even better than my other seduction attempts. </p><p>A rare kink, not that I was complaining, as Oeyne’s tightness was enough to trigger my own climax, allowing her tightening bowels to milk me, my grunts accompanied her moans. And just to make things even more perfect, a notification rang. </p><p>[Achievement: Superb Smithing. Hard work and superb craftsmanship is its own reward, but sometimes with some extras. +1000 Experience, +3 Strength]</p><p>Once again, the achievement managed to put a smile on my face. It was nice to know that whatever the source of my unique variation of System, at least it had a working sense of humor. </p><p>“So, how was it?” I asked even as I pulled out of Oeyne, finally slapping her ass, making it jiggle. “Do I get a passing grade?” </p><p>Oeyne tried to stand up, which worked more or less as intended while she pushed against the stone surface of her forge, but hit a snag once she tried to rely on her legs exclusively. A sudden aftershock hit her, making her collapse on the floor, with her ass on the floor. “Would you mind helping me?” she gasped. </p><p>“Nope,” I answered even as I cast a water spell, quickly cleaning my shaft before I took a step toward her. Elemental spells were useful, and not just for skipping time-intensive aspects of forging. “I’m going to forge a few more trinkets to make sure I learned perfectly,” I said, then looked down with a teasing smile. “I’m sure you can find something to occupy yourself with…” </p><p>What I meant was rather clear, especially as when I took a step, my shaft stood inches away from her plump lips, growing rapidly as it begged for her attention. She was quick to follow the clue, and wrapped her plump lips around my shaft, devouring half of it with relative ease, while I started working on another set of silver jewelry, this time creating small bracelets, each with a different design. However, their design had one major difference, focusing more on defense and protection rather than saving them from detection, as for them, it was a higher priority. </p><p>I was lucky that the design of the others was relatively easier after the first attempt, which meant when Oeyne pulled back to leave my shaft free for a moment, only to rise just a bit and lean forward, only to capture my shaft between her caramel tits. With the soft skin of her breasts massaging my well-lubricated cock as she slowly moved up and down, it generated a lovely feeling, almost as lovely as the tight grip of her puckered hole. </p><p>However, it was even more distracting, because, unlike the previous time, I wasn’t the one in control, meaning whenever she leaned down to lick the crown of my shaft for some extra pleasure, it worked spectacularly. Under the entertaining distraction provided by her soft globes, the forging both passed too quickly, and somehow managed to extend in an eternity, her throaty moans almost as reliable as a clock counting seconds… </p><p>As she squeezed and loosened the grip of her breast to alternate the sensation, it barely took minutes for me to explode on her face, but luckily, using her advanced forge, it was more than what I needed to finish four protective bracelets. I groaned as I exploded, adding some milk to her caramel. </p><p>“It has been a productive lesson,” I murmured even as I grabbed her hand offered her help to stand up, but she shook her head, preferring to stay collapsed next to her forge, enjoying the aftermath of her latest climax. </p><p>“Yeah,” she murmured, trying to recover from the high of her arousal, but not being particularly successful about it. “Will you come again?” she suddenly asked. </p><p>“Well, that entirely depends on your skill,” I chose to answer, enjoying her blush against the double entendre that was created. “But yeah, I’ll make sure to drop by, to enjoy another beautiful lesson if nothing else. But make sure to send me the news if there’s any change with the princess situation,” I added, reminding her of the more serious aspects of our situation. </p><p>“Definitely,” she answered even as she tried to stand up, but I gestured her to rest. I didn’t need her help getting in, and leaving was even easier. </p><p>Just as I was about to leave, when I remembered something very important. I had lost my weapon against the death knights when I used it as an explosive weapon, meaning I needed replacement. And while I was getting more able, and could apply a number of really tricky effects without the assistance of an enchanter, I still couldn’t match Oeyne when it came to straightforward weaponsmithing. </p><p>“Also, please forge me another weapon, a sword this time, and maybe a couple of daggers,” I asked her directly, not even bothering to soften the request. Considering everything we were doing, a straightforward order wasn’t something to be discussed in detail. Especially not when I was concerned with price. </p><p>“Sure,” she murmured as she finally made an attempt to stand up, and I helped by presenting my hand. She grabbed and pulled herself upright. “I’m a bit beat, though, why don’t you prepare the materials, and I’ll start them as soon as I wake up.”  </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I caressed her cheek gently. She smiled naughtily before she stumbled toward her bedroom, somehow managing to add a delicious swing to her hips despite her trembling legs… </p><p>As much as I was tempted to follow her there, I stayed on the forge to process the required magical reagents instead. I still had undead to purge, and dangerous political intrigues to counter. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 442500 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 39    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 5010 / 5010	Mana: 1871 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [68/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17] </p>
