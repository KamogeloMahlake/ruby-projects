        <p>It didn’t take long for me to come to a decision. Making sure Isolde regained her freedom was important. However, making sure she fully understood her new role in life, while also making sure that she received all the perks that came along with her new loyalty, was even more important. </p><p>And certainly more fun for me. </p><p>I pulled back for a moment, enjoying the naked and gasping figure of Isolde, amused to see that even her amazing stamina was unable to handle the unfamiliar assault of pleasure. Yet, her beautiful chest, pushing out beautifully with each breath, tempting me to start the next stage as soon as possible was hard to resist. </p><p>Since I was facing a great time constraint, I decided not to deny the call of pleasure as I grabbed her hips and flipped her so that her ass — tight thanks to the endless ranger duties she fulfilled, yet still sufficiently curvy to enhance her charm — pointed upward. A flare of magic ensured the boring aspects like cleaning and lubrication had been handled. “Not a bad start, sweetheart,” I whispered as I dragged my finger around her puckered hole. “But do you think you can handle the real stuff?” </p><p>“I can handle everything you can dish,” she stated, her voice impressively combative, though her face was suspiciously absent of such emotions, instead of showing delicious anticipation. </p><p>I was tempted to delay my treatment, just to punish her assumption that she could manipulate me to go faster with such a silly provocation. Unfortunately, that wasn’t on the cards, mostly due to our environment. </p><p>It was hardly the most feasible location for some extended edge play, especially the kind that would teach someone as rebellious as Isolde to teach a lesson. </p><p>Another time, I decided even as I slipped a finger inside her tightness, enjoying the moan that escaped her beautiful mouth at the moment, enjoying her spectacular tightness as I quickly added a second finger. </p><p>A moan escaped her lips. Though, I had to respect her pain resistance, as her voice didn’t carry even the slightest hint of discomfort, filled with pure pleasure. </p><p>“Still, maybe I should not push you too much,” I whispered, trying to sound serious, enjoying the sudden widening of her eyes as she struggled to catch my gaze, her expression colored with disbelief. </p><p>“I can handle it,” she stated hurriedly, quick to dissuade me from that path. </p><p>“Really?” I said even as I pulled my fingers. “I’m afraid that you can’t handle it, maybe I should go and arrange your freedom first.” </p><p>“No need, not at —” she delivered hurriedly, her eyes wide in shock at the beginning, only to be interrupted as I slid inside her tightness without a warning, a moan escaping her mouth in response. </p><p>One that finally carried a hint of pain, not she seemed to care that part. On the contrary, I could see the pleasure getting even more intense in her eyes, suggesting that pain was not exactly a deal-breaker for her. </p><p>“Let’s see how much you can handle,” I murmured even as I pressed one of my hands on her back, pinning her in place, the other on her hips to stabilize her. “When you want to stop, just say that you’re too weak to handle it.” </p><p>“Never —“ she said, and that was all she was able to say before my hips started moving with a speed that would have been reckless if it wasn’t for her incredible physical strength. </p><p>There was something interesting about the physical strength of top warriors — or rangers, in Isolde’s case. It was not entirely natural. I was a decent warrior, but never pushed myself enough to classify as a master, preferring to cheat when necessary instead of trying to get an expert. </p><p>Yet, as one reached that limit, a significant endurance and strength came with it, one that surpassed the limits of the normal limits of a body. Therefore, I was not entirely surprised when Isolde was able to handle my reckless charge with only a tinge of pain in her tone, more than able to handle the pain. </p><p>“I told you —“ she started, only to be interrupted by another moan as I spanked her ass hard, hard enough to even draw a tear from Sapphire despite her usual determination. Yet, Isolde had a different reaction. “Harder!” </p><p>“Damn,” I whispered. She was clearly in need of proper service. Luckily, I was the one that had the responsibility of taking her virginity. Anyone else, and she might have broken the poor boy in half. </p><p>I put even more weight on her body. She was trapped under me, but she gave no sign of dissatisfaction with the sudden pace. That didn’t mean that she was unaffected, of course, not even close. </p><p>Instead, her legs started to tremble with the telltale sign of infinite pleasure… </p><p>Her legs lost their power to stay closed, parting open obediently. Her eyes widened as she realized the mistake of using such a strong aphrodisiac, but it was too late. The combined assault of my hands and my hips turned it into an amazing assault. </p><p>Such a pity I needed to hurriedly finish such a delicious feast. </p><p>Soon, I let my fingers drift down, and instead of spanking her, slipped a couple fingers inside her wetness, the other still pressing down her waist to pin her in place. The addition of the frenzied assault of my fingers hardly helped her to contain her pleasure, and soon she tightened, exploding into something delicious. </p><p>It barely took a minute for her to start trembling with the signs of climax, achieving the impossible and getting even tighter, her excellent body showing its perks.</p><p>“Damn, girl. Your tightness is simply incredible…” I whispered even as I let my fingers continue ramming inside her even faster. She might have had an answer, but if she did, it was dragged away among her delicious moans. </p><p>Her face was buried in her pillow in an attempt to contain her moans, which blocked my desire to see her expression. Not that it was a problem with no solution, I decided even as I grabbed her hair and pulled it back, forcing her to twist her neck and look at me. </p><p>“Not bad,” I whispered as my hips picked even more speed, the sound of flesh hitting flesh simply deafening. “You might even handle a proper fucking once we’re not restricted in time.” </p><p>I expected her to answer, and when her lips opened, it seemed like she was confirming that particular direction, but instead, her moans rose unbidden, mixing with our rhythmic clapping, creating a great melody. </p><p>The position was fun, but I decided to reward her with another position. I pulled out and earned a disappointed moan, but that disappointment didn’t last long, not when I sat on the bed and pulled her to my lap. </p><p>As I skewered her tight hole once more, her hands found my shoulders, her nails sinking deep enough to draw blood. “Naughty girl,” I whispered before I leaned forward to focus on her neck, kissing and sucking. </p><p>Though I did interrupt that routine with more than one bite, much to her approval if her explosive moans were any indicator. </p><p>Despite her inexperience, she was handling the situation significantly better than I would have given her credit for. </p><p>Her fingers dug deeper into my shoulders, enough to draw blood, and I responded by biting her shoulder with a similar intensity, which left a deep mark on her. </p><p>“Mine,” I growled in a possessive tone, unable to resist the desire rising inside me as her actions triggered me. I stood up, my hands under her hips, and pressed her against the wall, using the leverage to make my assault even more merciless. </p><p>“Yours,” she gasped in response, her voice beautifully soft between her explosive moans, underlining her loyalty even more. </p><p>That didn’t prevent me from pushing deeper inside her — not that she seemed to be complaining. I continued slamming deep inside her repeatedly, underlining my ownership, accompanied by her delicious moans. </p><p>My reckless assault was not without a cost. Soon, she hit another climax, enhancing her already phenomenal tightness even more, which finally managed to break my resistance, and I filled her backdoor with my mark. </p><p>“Not a bad appetizer,” I murmured even as I pulled out, watching in amusement as she collapsed against the wall helplessly, more exhausted than I had ever seen her. </p><p>The unfamiliar invasion of pleasure achieving what her endless exhausting adventures failed to achieve… </p><p>“Appetizer…” she whispered, looking shocked at first before her gaze rose up, and met my gaze. “T-that’s a big promise, do you think you can handle it,” she added, challenge back in her tone, with just a touch of humor added, fleeting, almost impossible to notice. </p><p>Almost, but not quite.  </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle, feeling charmed at her sudden sharp attitude. She had been an annoying enemy, but it seemed that she would be a much more fun subordinate. </p><p>Who knew she had hidden depths… </p><p>“Let’s start working on your freedom,” I said, before stopping for a second.“By the way,” I added, remembering the little disguising trick I pulled against the Phoenix. “Don’t forget that, against the owner of the prison, you’re going to call me your king.” </p><p>“Understood, Your Majesty,” her murmur arrived immediately, her voice filled with a fervor that surprised me. </p><p>How amusing. Clearly, she wasn’t just fulfilling a role, but declaring her loyalty once more. </p><p>Luckily for her, it was already close enough for the truth to save her from the charges of treason. </p><p>All I needed was to decide was to exact way of getting her freedom. </p>
