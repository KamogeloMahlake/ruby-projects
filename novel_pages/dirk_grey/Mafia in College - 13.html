        <p>With her pride on display, stoked further by her anger, I had been expecting Megan to start with an aggressive blowjob. Unfortunately, her spark turned out to be weaker than I had hoped, her lips clamping around my girth, moving up and down in a semi-mechanical fashion, not giving an impressive display of ambition or skill. </p><p>Nevertheless, she raised her eyes confidently, expecting to find an expression of ecstasy, but unluckily for her, I wasn’t an academician that spent my life hoping to get a moment’s attention from one of the more popular girls to fill my social hunger, nor I was a tasteless jock with a brain addled from too much training; I looked back with the same clinical expression, showing that I wasn’t impressed with her display. </p><p>Funnily enough, the flare of anger on her face was more pleasurable than the limp grasp of her lips around my shaft, despite her sexiness, making her look like a petulant teenager that failed to get what she had wanted. But once again, anger proved its worth as an aphrodisiac, and her beats quickened, boosting my pleasure nicely, not that I had any intention of informing her about that. “That’s all,” I murmured dismissively. “Maybe I was being generous with C.” </p><p>“You bastard-” she spat as she pulled out, about to launch an angry tirade, but I had more interesting things in mind. </p><p>“A spoiled monologue would hardly help my enjoyment,” I added, my expression sharp enough to convince her that I would cut things early if she launched that. It was an excuse she should have taken, but her aim was long forgotten in her focus on her wounded pride. </p><p>“I’ll show you skill,” she murmured before she leaned forward, inadvertently silenced due to her need to widen her mouth enough to swallow my girth. She managed to push halfway without an issue, but the rest of the distance required a significant effort, the crown pushing against the entrance of her throat. </p><p>It didn’t take long for her to retreat from that particular objective, not feeling brave enough to take my thickness to her throat. I was tempted to push her head down, making her cover the rest of the distance by force, but the way her hands started to dance on my balls enough for me to put that idea to the corner. </p><p>For now, at least. </p><p>She pulled back, but only to put her tongue out for a moment, giving a sensual caress along my length, which managed to earn an honest moan from me. “Not bad, isn’t it,” she asked with a smirk before swallowing the head once again, engaging her tongue to give an impressive show of dance. </p><p>“It’s definitely impressive,” I said, which made her smile despite her full mouth. “For an appetizer, of course,” I added, sealing that smile back once again. </p><p>I was expecting another petulant argument, so I was surprised when she pulled back once more with a stiff expression, trying to force a smile into existence; but with very limited success. She pushed herself onto her feet, her naked tits dangling attractively. “Of course,” she said as she grabbed the zipper of her skirt, disengaging it with one sharp move. It slid down, leaving her in just her panties, a small red thong that might as well be invisible for all it managed to achieve in terms of concealment. “Of course,” she murmured with a tone a femme-fatale might choose before delivering a lethal strike from a difficult-to-see angle. </p><p>But she chose to turn her back and sat on my lap once more rather than to reach for a weapon, hoping to defeat me in the arena she believed herself to be more advantageous. Her hips started to grind my lap once more, but this time, her thong as the only barrier, thin enough for me to feel her wetness, evidence for the fact that she was forced to be here did little to reduce her enjoyment. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said even as I put my hands on her body, enjoying the softness of her skin. “You’re on the right track,” I added as my other hand slipped through the red strands of her hair, looking for a good grip. But unlike my usual demeanor, I gently guided her head to the side rather than a sharp pull, revealing her neck to my attention. My lips found her skin, her heart thumping in excitement, leaving a lingering kiss on her neck. </p><p>The way her eyes darted in a delicious kind of panic was rather cute, suggesting that I managed to discover a sensitive spot. She continued to move, her attempt to obscure my success obvious, but failing to achieve a noticeable success. She tried to continue the task in hand,  her attempts to look impervious foiled by the panicky desire dancing in her gaze. </p><p>That cute expression of helplessness was enough to make me change my plans. Initially, I was planning to turn the tables on her by subjecting her to rough treatment, but her vulnerability to a softer treatment was enough to make me change my mind. Teasing her until her already dubious self-control shattered completely was the more satisfying route. </p><p>With that in mind, I kept my lips on her neck, abusing the sensitive spot I had just discovered for all that was worth, making her moan a string of cries, cute enough to contrast with the wordy image she tried to project in her life. And my hand, slowly exploring her body to discover other sensitive spots -with a decent success rate- didn’t make it any easier for her to resist, her cute moans getting louder and louder. </p><p>“How is now,” she asked in a tone that would have been mistaken for confident if it wasn’t for its trembling while she quickened the dance of her hips, the last-ditch attempt to maintain the illusion that she had the control while trying to distract me from my job. </p><p>I played along. “Much better,” I answered while pulling back, freeing her neck from my insistent attention. “Your acting is much better now, enough to make me believe that you’re actually enjoying it if I didn’t know any better.” </p><p>“Yeah, right,” she chuckled, her eyes sliding away to hide her lie, which further underlined the extent of her loss of control, reminding me that I was dealing with an unexperienced heiress. “I really need that grade,” she murmured. </p><p>“Is the grade that important to you,” I said even as I dragged my finger along her spine, making her shiver erotically, one that tempted me to push the deficient cover of her panties to the side and take her rapidly, but still, I was more interested in testing the limits of her patience. </p><p>“Isn’t that obvious? Do you think I would have humiliated myself like this if it wasn’t important?” she asked, but once again, her tone disagreed with her words, suggesting that she was happy with my gaze. Meanwhile, my hands were even hungrier while dancing on her body, teasing in a way that she never tasted before, making her react like a virgin bride. “Now I feel bad, forcing you to struggle for a measly grade. You can leave, you have earned your grade.” </p><p>The shock on her face was pretty enough to almost trigger a premature accident, but luckily, my experience prevailed over my desires. “What- why?” she stammered, extremely unhappy about the loss of her excuse. She took a deep breath, desperately trying to think. “I can’t accept,” she spouted rapidly a moment later, an expression of realization appearing on her face. “I can’t accept something I didn’t deserve. I’m going to earn that A.” </p><p>It took all of my willpower to keep myself from laughing out loud. Not only she clearly hadn’t worked a day in her life for her privilege but not bothered by her status, but also she was in a professor’s room, trying to use her sexuality to take a shortcut for a grade that she didn’t deserve. Using that as an excuse was just funny, tempting me to underline it to see how she would try to get away from it, but my patience had some limits as well. And my sexy but spoiled redheaded student, desperately dancing over my naked shaft, trying to come up excuses for why I should take her in my office until she fell unconscious between cries and moans… </p><p>“I can only respect such a selfless dedication,” I said, and even if she heard the mocking edge my tone carried, she acted like she failed to notice in favor of raising herself off my lap temporarily, using the space to let her panties to slide down over her deliciously toned legs until they met with the floor. I leaned back while she returned to her earlier position, sans the absence of her panties. </p><p>I couldn’t help but gasp as she grabbed my shaft, aligning it correctly before sinking down, and a heavenly warmth started to envelop my girth bit by bit, starting from the crown. Ignoring the temptation to push myself up in a manner that would test her capacity, I moved upward until my hand was around her body, teasing previously-discovered sensitive spots with a reckless abandon. </p><p>Meanwhile, she continued to slowly sink deeper, her arousal helping her to do smoothly. But the physical ease of the job was deeply contrasted by the utter confusion adoring her face, shocked by the reaction of her own body, trying to process the moment. Imagining what she was thinking was not too hard. A spoiled princess like her, especially with her extraordinary beauty, probably was used to much more different type of sexual adventure; where the male spent all of his time and effort trying to woo her, only to fail in the actual act due to their excitement. The exact opposite of what was happening right now, pushing her into unfamiliar territory. </p><p>It was the unfamiliarity of the pleasure that made her gush wetter and wetter, her body moving smoothly as her reflexes took control, swallowing more and more of my shaft. I decided to help, my hands climbing up until they were on her shoulders, timing my push just as she started to go down, impaling my shaft even deeper. Her mouth opened, and a gasp escaped her mouth, making me worry about a potential eavesdropper. Even at this late hour, it wasn’t certain that this wing of the building would be completely empty.  </p><p>When my hands moved down to her breasts, testing their delicious elasticity, it only increased the expression of ecstasy on her face, reacting extremely well to my soft touch. I increased the pressure a bit, enough to turn my caress into a squeeze, and her lips parted open once again. This time, when she opened her mouth for another moan, I was ready, and smashed my lips to cut off her moan. </p><p>The unexpected intimacy made her stiffen for a moment, but that mattered little when my tongue slipped inside her mouth, exploring gently until hers twirled around, starting a heated battle. All the while, she continued to jump on my lap, each repeat pushing me closer to a climax. And her as well, if her ever-increasing tightness was any indicator. </p><p>Her climax arrived earlier than mine, accompanied by yet another cry which I had to suppress, though that wasn’t exactly a chore. She tried to continue her treatment, but the sudden loss of power in her trembling legs prevented the continuation of it. I wrapped my arm around her waist to pin her in place before suddenly standing up, bringing her along as I walked across the room, each step pushing my shaft even deeper into her folds. </p><p>I kept my lips affixed to hers even as I pressed her against the wall, because her cries had turned into an unbroken string, making them the only thing between us and a double-expulsion. </p><p>But that didn’t mean that I was going to have any mercy on her. Pinned against the wall, it was the perfect opportunity to explore her hidden depths. My hands on her hips to keep her stable, I started pumping her in long, hard strokes, each bringing her even closer to a climax. She tried to wrap her legs around my waist at first, showing her enjoyment of the moment, uncaring of the submissive position she had found herself in. </p><p>Not one to miss such an opportunity, I just sped up until she was crying with pleasure. Even my resistance had limits, edging an explosion. I chose not to warn her until the last second, until it was too late to actually do something, but her legs wrapping around my waist was an unexpected, yet welcome, surprise. </p><p>She shuddered under the effects of yet another climax while I was busy filling her up. When I pulled out, she stumbled forward, my arm only thing preventing her from falling. But it wasn’t the end. “On all fours,” I commanded while I picked her discarded panties from the floor, and before she could answer, stuffed them in her mouth. She obeyed without a complain, and I made sure that the position she took was just in front of the camera, her face, filled with ecstasy, was completely visible on the camera. </p><p>Then I pushed inside her once again, this time, her makeshift gag barely enough to suppress her voice. Happy with that, I started to rain spanks on her bottom, my other hand sliding through her fiery hair, keeping her upright painfully, something she enjoyed immensely, evidenced by her ever-increasing wetness. </p><p>Several minutes passed like that, and I didn’t bother to change position, enjoying the sexy monotony of the situation until it was time to fill her once again. Filling up a sexy girl who previously thought as my superior was a unique taste, that was for sure. </p><p>The last one proved too much for her, and she collapsed. I didn’t bother to lift her from the floor, just fixed my pants and sat on my desk, working on my paperwork, another small dose of power-play. </p><p>It took her a couple of minutes to gather enough energy to lift herself from the floor, pulling her panties out with a sheepish expression. Though, the lack of anger was a surprising detail. I had expected her to explode in anger, not silently pull some wet wipes to erase the worst of the mess from her legs before pulling her panties on, leaving her bloated with my seed. </p><p>With everything done, I watched her dress silently. It wasn’t the silence of anger, or disappointment. It was yet another mark of the pleasure she had just experienced, leaving her muscles tired and her mind jumbled. But her actions were quickened as the realization invaded her face, making her realize just how out of control the day’s event had developed. </p><p>“See you around, professor,” she murmured as she put her phone on her bag without bothering to check the video, and left the room. I pulled my burner phone to delete the said video from her phone after sending a copy to myself, therefore destroying the whole point of her presence, then dashed out, following her from a distance, aware that she wouldn’t notice my presence in her exhausted state. </p><p>I wanted to see her face when she noticed the absence of the video, just in case she decided to check it before she arrived back in her room, where I could use the webcam to observe her. </p><p>But as they say, the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry. She actually decided to take a less-used, and slightly longer, the route to her sorority house, likely to avoid people before she could gather herself to a degree. However, in her exhaustion, she never noticed a black car slowly following her, in a manner that made alarm bells rang in my head. I had a bad feeling about that. </p><p>The smart thing would have been to act like I hadn’t noticed it, and silently disappear, maybe while sending an anonymous tip to the police. I didn’t even actually liked her as a person. But from my lawless days, I knew just how ineffective it would be, and while she might be an annoying entitled girl, but it didn’t mean that I could actually leave her to such a fate. I dashed forward, as silent as I could manage. The later they noticed me, the better.  </p><p>And it was just in time, because I was just behind her when the car stopped next to her, and the door opened, and a bulky man stepped out of the car. Someone I recognized, much to my chagrin. Someone that I had worked together a few times before, back in my days as an enforcer, before I managed to move onto better things. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised to see Archie still working as an enforcer, as the guy lacked the imagination to do anything better, though unfortunately, he was very good at his job. Which was why when he wrapped his arm around Megan, I directly punched his kidney rather than trying to pull her away. And while he was distracted, I pulled his gun from its holster. </p><p>I wished that killing him was an option, but I knew enough that doing so would bring too much heat, both from the side of the law, and the lawless. Instead, I raised my newly-acquired weapon to his face, but stalled enough to allow him to slip into the car, and the driver to press off. It made sense, as they clearly aimed a surgical strike, and even if the driver came out, they wouldn’t have taken me down before I could take a shot, alerting the campus of their presence. </p><p>The car sped off while I felt Megan’s arm around my torso, tight with shock. But all I could think of was why my old mafia buddies were here, and how hard it was going to screw my new life… </p>
