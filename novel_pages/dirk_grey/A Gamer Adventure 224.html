        <p>“You have — you have awakened,” Mariel found herself muttering with a palpable shock, but even then had been interrupted by a moan halfway as I slid inside her. </p><p>“What do you think?” I said with a chuckle as my hips started to pick up speed. Since she had kindly completed the necessary foreplay — and more — I had no problems rushing forward at full speed. </p><p>“I … Right now?” she asked, her hopeful tone rather obvious, which meant she had realized I had been playing with her a bit. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, I’m a light sleeper,” I said, which earned a gasp of shame from her. Which was misguided at best, but I let that slide, as I had enjoyed her juvenile reaction. Not as much as I enjoyed the way she was tightening around me downstairs, of course, but to be fair, there were very few things in life that could match the way an actual angel wrapped around my shaft. </p><p>“I need to go and start working,” she managed to stammer, which would have been more convincing if two things weren’t true. First, she was the boss, one that scared everyone enough that no one would dare to even visit her office without being summoned, let alone ask her why she was late. </p><p>The second piece of evidence was more direct. Her hips started to move even as she delivered her excuse, displaying the abilities she had learned during her earlier adventure in a different way, showing that she was not as committed to stopping me as her words implied. </p><p>If someone else was using that excuse despite clear desire, I might have actually followed it to teach her a lesson. But my poor angel had been dealing with an enforced puritan lifestyle for centuries, and it would have been too cruel to do so. </p><p>Instead, I teased her with a spank. “You can always take a sick leave, sweetie,” I said as I let my hand linger on her ass, caressing softly, making her tremble in anticipation, temporarily stopping the rhythm of her hips. </p><p>“M-maybe —” she whispered, which turned into a wordless growl as I used the opportunity to push forward, triggering an explosive moan as I touched her depths once again. </p><p>“It’s clearly justified,” I said even as I tightened my grip and pulled out just enough to flip her, making her balance herself on the bed on all fours.</p><p>Allowing me to grab her wings once more as I slid inside her, flaring my mana to caress her feathers, leveraging its softness in the process. And that was not the only way I was using my mana. I gathered a thicker flood and filled her insides with each push, once again assisting her to assimilate her Light Divine Spark. </p><p>[-3183 Mana]</p><p>She certainly deserved a reward after her naughty morning adventure. </p><p>Her moans got even more intense as my mana invaded her body, once again efficiently working on her bonding process with the Light Spark. </p><p>The process wasn’t complete, far from it, but even the development was enough to progress it significantly. </p><p>“Good,” I said cheerfully as her hips started moving once again, responding to the mana flood rather intensely, my teasing tone making her move even faster. I had several words to tease her about the situation, but she was still reasonably sensitive, and I didn’t want to push her too much in any case. </p><p>No matter how self-possessed she looked in her role as a headmistress, she was a fragile beauty, and it made teasing her a dangerous proposition. Especially since she was already overwhelmed by getting caught during her morning trickery. </p><p>Instead, I pulled her wings back as I started impaling her even more aggressively, enjoying her repeated cries. </p><p>Under the pure invasion of pleasure, it didn’t take long for the last vestiges of her little adventure to disappear completely, leaving her to moan and gasp repeatedly, her words long forgotten. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I had seen her like this, as she hadn’t been different the last night, especially during the later half, where the unfamiliar pleasure blanketed her mind. Her delirious moans suggested that just a night of experience was not enough for her to generate familiarity as well. </p><p>I managed to hold back my desire to explode inside her for a while as I quickened my invasion, doing my best to give her an even more explosive experience — at least, as much as I could manage without doing anything creative, which would, at this point, shut her down completely. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean I had nothing else I had in mind, I thought even as I flipped her once more, but this time I stayed straight, which left her torso free from my view. </p><p>She noticed my gaze, her wings folding immediately to hide her face and her torso, which, at this point, was simply amazing. “No need for that sweetie,” I whispered as I grabbed her wings and slowly parted them, which required no strength as she didn’t resist. </p><p>But she whimpered beautifully in shame as she covered her face with her hands, her expression simply an incarnation of cuteness. </p><p>“Honey, let’s put those hands to better use,” I said as I grabbed her wrists, slowly pulling her wrist forward until her hands landed over her breasts. “Now, squeeze,” I said even as I directed her fingers, teaching her how to explore her own body. </p><p>Her expression cycled between shyness and arousal as her fingers clamped around her nipples, while I still played with her wrists, making her twist them slowly. </p><p>Soon, I pulled back — well, let my hand slide lower to caress her stomach — and let her hands handle their task independently. Her hands stayed in place, dancing over her beautiful breasts, the effects of it clear as she started moving her hips thirstily, proving that the pleasure was stronger than the vestiges of shame she was dealing with. </p><p>I managed to keep my lips shut despite my desire to tease her, not wanting to interrupt the growing show. </p><p>An amazing decision, it turned out, as soon, she pulled one of her hands away, only to follow the direction of my hands and reached lower. </p><p>I grabbed her wrist,  leading it toward her clit, our fingers tangled together as we teased her most sensitive spot together, rubbing against her softness, the pleasure growing for her. </p><p>Then, I noticed a flare on the wards, and her eyes widened. “E-emergency,” she whispered in shock. “There’s an attack!” </p><p>“Where?” I asked even as I started cursing at the inappropriate timing of the attacker. </p><p>“One of the outposts at the south,” she said, which was clearly communicated by the wards. “A big one, they need reinforcements immediately.” </p><p>“How immediately?” I asked, quickly recalculating the distance. </p><p>“The monster tide is about to reach the destination, maybe twenty minutes,” she said. </p><p>“Good,” I said with a sudden wild smirk. “It’s enough for me to finish my job and reach there,” I said.</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock. “W-wait—“ she gasped, which was all she was able to say before I leaned forward once more, trapping her under my height. Our lips latched together as I let my hips go free, invading her drenched core with an absolute lack of mercy, the clapping of flesh filling the room, loud enough to overwhelm her suppressed moans. </p><p>Facing a sudden time crunch, I abandoned every sense of restraint as I wanted to teach her about the true meaning of education. </p><p>When I pulled back from the kiss to impale her even more aggressively, her only response was to moan, even more, an impressive delirium coloring her tone, suggesting she was slowly losing all connection with reality. </p><p>An expected outcome under my reckless invasion, which was good, as it was a much better way to use her amazing lips than trying to deliver useless arguments. </p><p>“Now, let’s open those beautiful legs more,” I whispered as I pressed my hands to her thighs, parting them for the next stage. Which came as I changed my alignment slightly, drilling her down. </p><p>“Too … much,” she managed to gasp, but even that took half a minute for her as her moans interrupted her several times, her body rebelling against her. But even as she said so, she couldn’t help but keep her eyes open, watching me disappear into her core again and again without a hint of mercy. </p><p>Yet, she found herself opening her legs, even more, allowing me even better access. </p><p>Her flexibility was simply phenomenal. </p><p>I would have asked her to stand up to explore another position for a fleeting moment, but the way her legs started to tremble suggested that it would take a miracle for her to stand upright. And while I had several means to achieve that miracle, with the sudden invasion forcing my hand, I didn’t have the luxury of dealing with those. </p><p>So, I continued my simple yet effective assault until my body decided it was time to stop, exploding inside her, filling her with both my biological marker and my magical touch. </p><p>[-975 Mana]</p><p>I would have rewarded her with even more mana, but with the upcoming fight, I decided to play it more conservatively. Though, it was still sufficient to break the last vestige of her consciousness as she collapsed against the bed, muttering softly…</p><p>“Rest well,” I whispered as I leaned down and left a lingering kiss on her temple. “I’ll be back for the second round soon enough.” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 7821 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>
