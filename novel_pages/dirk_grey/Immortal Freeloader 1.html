        <p>It was a dark day, a thunderstorm was wreaking havoc outside my windows — well, technically, not my home, but the home of the beautiful lady that was currently being intimate with — but the warmth off the hug I had been enjoying had been interrupted by a beeping sound. </p><p>“Oh, no! My husband is here! Quick, leave,” the beautiful woman I had been sharing the bed with said as she pushed me away. I reacted quickly, gathering my clothes before moving to a balcony that connected to a water pipe, one that was thick enough to allow me to climb down.</p><p>I knew the escape route, because it wasn’t the first time I had to escape the house of a rich, married woman. My life as a professional freeloader taught me long ago to always have an alternate extraction point, as there was nothing more dangerous than a rich man whose ego I bruised in such a direct manner. </p><p>Of course, someone else might say that I had been wasting my life by acting as a plaything for the rich and bored housewives, but I disagreed. I was an injured college athlete, kicked out of the college after unable to afford to pay for it without a scholarship. </p><p>An-ex professional sprinter had no career prospect. </p><p>Maintaining my physique and act as a young boy toy for the rich, bored, and young housewives was far more preferable than trying to live as a college dropout. Especially when those young and bored wives learned from the habits of their husbands in terms of gift giving; expensive clothes, pocket money by thousands, watches, even a car or two. </p><p>A beautiful, simple life. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was not without its challenges. I put on my pants without skipping a step even as I run toward the balcony — another skill I had developed through repeated practice. I kept my jacket and shirt around my neck, threw down my shoes, and started climbing down. </p><p>The storm raged on; the rain making the grip difficult. It was a dangerous process, but I moved down without slipping. After my injury, my trips to the gym might be about maintaining my looks, but my grip was still strong enough to ignore the wetness. </p><p>“I would not die in such a ridiculous manner,” I chuckled. </p><p>Maybe that was a mistake, as suddenly, there was a blinding flash that covered me. </p><p>“Huh, I didn’t know lightning could be red and purple,” I murmured, unable to believe what happened. Was I dead? If I was, why could I speak? </p><p>A POTENTIAL. YET, YOU WANT TO LIVE AS A FREELOADER. LET’S SEE JUST HOW LONG YOU WILL LAST! </p><p>Then, darkness.</p><p>***</p><p>I was surprised as I stirred back. I didn’t expect to wake up after being struck by lightning. It was dangerous enough, but I was also climbing down a water pipe. Lightning and a painful fall were a deadly combination.  </p><p>I struggled to open my eyes, but everything in front of me was shifting and dancing as a blur. Was that a forest? I didn’t remember the garden being this lush. Yet, as the blur disappeared, I realized I had no idea where I was at. </p><p>It didn’t help my surprise when I tried to reach down, only to find myself wearing nothing. Maybe the husband caught me and punished me, I thought, but that didn’t make too much sense. Why risk being charged with manslaughter? </p><p>Even more surprising was that there was no sign of damage on my body, like it was completely ordinary.  </p><p>[Freeloader System Activated]</p><p>[The exalted ones thank the hero for accepting the task of fighting against the great evil!]</p><p>“Hey, I don’t remember accepting anything,” I said, but there was no answer. Was I going mad?</p><p>Or was that voice I heard after the lightning was not a delusion, and I somehow angered a divine being, who punished me … sending me to another world? </p><p>It wasn’t a realization that I should accept easily, but for some reason, I did. Someone deep down, I knew it was true. As much as I had known that my career as an athlete was over the moment I had blown my knee ligaments with a sharp turn, ruining my dreams with it. </p><p>Still, I wanted to cuss. What was wrong with her — I somehow knew that the being that sent me here was a woman — that she punished me by sending a new world, one that I knew nothing about. As for the System, it reminded me of the novels my old college roommate had been reading constantly; except those systems in the novels always had charismatic names like invincible lord, boundless dragon, and other cool shit. </p><p>“What the hell is a freeloader system?” I asked, hoping for an answer, or at least a tutorial. </p><p>There was none. </p><p>“Well, not a big surprise,” I said. The one that gave me the System was angry, so it was too much to hope for a convenience. I took a deep breath, letting the surrounding haze dissipate as I enjoyed the warmth. </p><p>At least she did not send me to an ice planet or something. </p><p>I forced myself to stand up and tried to decide what to do. In the middle of a wild forest, naked, without a weapon. Worse, I was a city kid, one that was too busy with my sports activities to join the scouts, and I knew absolutely little about what could be done. </p><p>Before I could say something, a figure in front of me blinked into existence. And, using the word blinked was certainly not an exaggeration. One moment, there was nothing. Then, there was one. A woman, wearing some kind of thick robe, and with a veil covering her face. For a moment, I thought I was in some kind of repressive society, but the glowing sword in her hand suggested otherwise. </p><p>She reached for her bag while she avoided looking at me. The bag was barely bigger than my hand, so I expected nothing. I was surprised when she pulled a large cloak, one that was too thick to fit there. </p><p>Magic. </p><p>However, as I grabbed the cloak, several lines of writing appeared in front of me. </p><p>[Gift received. Freeloader System activated]</p><p>[Cultivation difference bonus - 120; Pity Bonus - 10]</p><p>[130x Return - Initiate, Profound High-Grade Cloak]</p><p>I covered my body even as I ignored those messages. I could feel that there was some kind of storage space, and I could pull the extra cloak I received — whatever profound high-grade meant, I had no idea — but I didn’t want to alert the witch in front of me. </p><p>Once I wrapped the cloak around, I was ready to answer her questions. </p><p>She said something. </p><p>“Sorry, I don’t understand you,” I answered, hoping that she could understand me. </p><p>She answered me in another language I didn’t understand. I replied with the smattering of French and German I knew. She tried a few more languages. I failed to understand all of it. </p><p>She pulled some kind of green rock from her pouch with some kind of internal glow. I didn’t want to touch any weird glowing rocks, but I didn’t think I could fight against her if things turned violent. I did not know about her capabilities, but she was clearly strong. </p><p>She threw it at me, I grabbed it. </p><p>[Cultivation difference bonus - 120; Pity Bonus - 30]</p><p>[150x Return - Language Jade, Black Peak-Grade]</p><p>I did not know what black grade was, and I didn’t have an opportunity to consider it either. The moment I brought it against my temple like she asked, it felt like they had put my brain through a blender, unknown words infusing themselves into my brain. </p><p>I collapsed on the ground once more even as the yellow rock turned into dust, feeling the worst hangover of my life. </p><p>She spoke again, slowly. This time, I understood several words. She was asking me whether I saw a lightning. I was about to answer no, but she covered the distance, pulled a needle and put it to my wrist. Her expression didn’t look like she was trying to help me. </p><p>It was best to assume she could test whether I was lying. </p><p>“Yes … red … purple,” I answered, trying to find the words in her language. </p><p>“On you?” she asked, but before I could answer, some kind of energy spread into my body. “No … not on you,” she said. She was wrong, of course, but I had no intention of correcting her. Not lying was one thing, omission was something else.  </p><p>“Are you a martial artist?” she asked, this time slower, making it easier to understand.</p><p>I opened my mouth, trying to find the exact words, but failed to find the exact words to describe the difference between a fighter and a professional athlete. “Used to … injury,” I answered choppily. It was the best I could come up with. </p><p>“Very well,” she said, and reached into her bag, and threw me a small bottle. </p><p>[Cultivation difference bonus - 120; Pity Bonus - 130 (Capped)]</p><p>[250x Return - Martial Aptitude Enhancement Pill, Earth High-Grade]</p><p>With that, she disappeared, leaving me alone. </p><p>“Well, what the hell was that?” I spoke, dazed. </p><p>It was not how I expected my day to go. </p>
