        <title>Accidental Villainy 7 - Tara</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Even as she fell onto her knees to follow the orders of her new boss, Tara was having trouble believing just how far things had devolved. </p><p>She felt like she was in a fog, her body still trembling and aching as she reached forward. </p><p>Did she want it … certainly. It was because she had been dreaming of it, she wasn’t able to sleep the whole night, excited about what he would do once she arrived. </p><p>Yet, when she finally did, only for him to order her to stay downstairs and finish cleaning. A strong woman would have either turned and left … or grabbed him and told him what she wanted in very clear terms. </p><p>Yet, she was not a strong woman. She was weak. </p><p>Being a super didn’t change it. It just made her situation more ironic. </p><p>It was why she had been elated when he ordered her to undress once she had arrived at his room. It felt like a promise … a promise that he started fulfilling when she finally was hugged behind, teased, and molested without even asking. </p><p>And, followed by the order to clean him up. Not that she blamed him. After all, he was right. She had made a mess. A big one. </p><p>Following his orders was easy, she decided as she reached forward to grab his boxers, to use them to clean just like he asked. “You’re not allowed to use anything else,” he ordered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she answered, the response leaving her lips without she could even considering the nature of his order. Not that there was any problem with it, even though it was a very inefficient way of cleaning. </p><p>She wrapped her fingers around. She was the one who created the mess. She should be the one to clean it directly. </p><p>It was the first time she had touched a man in such an intimate manner, but any possible significance of it was easy to ignore as she followed his orders like a good little maid. It was all she needed. </p><p>Nothing else. </p><p>As her fingers moved along his length, she could feel the adrenaline dancing in her veins, begging for her to do more. But, without an order, she just stayed focused on the task at hand, feeling the way he throbbed. </p><p>“It’s not working,” he said despite his growing smile. She shivered, feeling like she had never felt before. She should stop and leave, but the way he throbbed under her touch made it impossible. “You need to use more skin. Use your breasts,” he ordered. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she answered, immediately getting closer as she wrapped her breasts around his girth, feeling his throbbing far more intimately as she moved up and down. </p><p>“Spit on it,” he ordered. </p><p>She did, no matter how absurd was the request considering the reason why she had been working on it in the first place. Yet, she didn’t make unnecessary comments or ask unnecessary questions. It was not her place. </p><p>She just focused on following the orders. It felt right.</p><p>“That’s not enough either. Use your pretty lips,” he ordered. Helpless, she ignored her own blush as she leaned … and captured his throbbing head, the taste filling her mouth. “Don’t forget the tongue,” he ordered. </p><p>She let her tongue dance wildly as he slipped his hand through her hair, caressing gently … then not so gently as he pushed her down, and her mouth was filled with his presence. </p><p>It was just right, she admitted in her mind, but lacked both the courage and the opportunity to say that. Luckily, she didn’t need to say didn’t say those words out loud. She just needed to accept his push. </p><p>And, just like that, her head turned into a toy while she did her best to keep the base wrapped with her breasts. She just kept going, doing her best to stay silent, but soon, a moan escaped despite her best attempt to maintain control. </p><p>It was an incredible feeling. </p><p>Her mental musing was broken as his hand suddenly tightened around her hair, pulling her out. “I don’t like my employees daydreaming while working,” he threatened even as his fingers dipped down, twisting her nipple. Tara felt her heart beat faster, doing her best to convince herself that what she was feeling was not lust. </p><p>Yet, as it raged inside her, she couldn’t help it. “I’m sorry sir, it’s just … my first time,” she admitted, feeling shame. </p><p>“Sorry sweetie, I didn’t know that. But you should have said to me. You’re lucky that I’m a good boss. I’m going to help you turn into an expert,” he said. </p><p>She just followed his order like she didn’t have a mind of her own, guided only by his hands. She shuffled on her knees as his thing got closer and closer.</p><p>Soon, it ended up in her mouth, but this time, she wasn’t trying to maintain her tits around his girth. She wasn’t even trying to control herself. </p><p>She just sank low, following his direction as she took his presence first into her mouth … then into her throat, her lips sliding across his skin.</p><p>He leaned forward even more as he pushed her, slamming down even harder as she felt her throat being filled. The way his hips moved to meet her face didn’t help either. </p><p>Or, helped excellently, depending on the perspective, but she didn’t bother focusing on that definition, instead, she focused on her task. She couldn’t fail. </p><p>Not when her boss was working hard to help her. </p><p>Her lips grabbed the base of his shaft, squeezing even as he pushed her up and down. His groan was like music to her ears, her lust growing in response. </p><p>She was a bad girl. A very bad girl. Otherwise, why would she feel herself getting even more drenched, ruining the floor, her mind filled with dreams of pushing him down before sitting on his lap, riding him like … like a whore. Nothing less, nothing more. </p><p>She wished that he ordered her to touch herself, and play while putting on a show, so she could suppress the growing fire inside her. </p><p>Since she lacked the courage to do that, she focused on what she could control. She followed his direction and started moving up and down faster and faster, sucking him for all she could, feeling the way he got even harder between her lips. </p><p>Soon, his hips started to move more erratically, indicating he was going to cum soon. She let him move her faster up and down, his free hand on her breasts to prevent their bouncing. </p><p>Almost there. </p><p>Then, there was a crash. For a moment, she thought that it was her climax … or hers. “Wait here,” he ordered as he pulled out, and only then she realized that it came from downstairs. </p><p>It was an order. She was supposed to wait. But as she watched him put on his pants hurriedly and dash down … but not before grabbing a discarded baseball bat she had assumed to be garbage. </p><p>“No, I need to support him,” she thought as she dashed and quickly dressed … then, stopped. She couldn’t just go and confront them in her face, not when that would mean revealing herself. </p><p>Helpless, she looked at his luggage, and found a ski mask. Not exactly the best disguise, but it was better than nothing. She hurriedly put that on before she dashed downstairs, cursing that she only had enhanced strength, resistance, and durability, and not speed. </p><p>The moment she arrived downstairs, she found herself looking at a messy situation. A broken bottle next to a bleeding man, while her boss … her dear boss, swinging the baseball bat to keep a man with a knife away from him while trying to reach the other … who had been currently in the process of pulling a gun. </p><p>She wouldn’t allow that. </p><p>She couldn’t allow that.</p><p>She rushed forward, ignoring the man with a knife even as she reached the man with the gun, and swung her fist, only at the last second remembering to hold back her punches to prevent a bloody end. </p><p>He still went down. “Fuck, a super—“ the other started, but before she could deal with him, a baseball bat caught him in the head, sending him down. </p><p>“Didn’t I tell you to stay upstairs?” he said, but he wasn’t shouting. </p><p>She pulled her mask off, and met with his gaze. “I’m sorry, sir,” she said as she looked at him, challenging him for the first time. “But I won’t let any harm come to you…” </p><p>And, just like that, the silence stretched.</p>
