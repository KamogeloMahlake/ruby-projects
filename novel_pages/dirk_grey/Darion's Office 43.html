        <p>Erin froze as the curtain was pulled, realizing that she had pushed her luck too much with the boyfriend of her potential investor. </p><p>Well, ex-potential investor, as she was sure that the deal was dead. </p><p>She tensed, preparing herself for the upcoming explosion, wishing that she was in a more convenient position to fix herself. Hanging upside down from the boyfriend in question was a bad location to listen to an explosion. </p><p>“I guess you were right,” Fatima said … which was not the explosion Erin had been expecting. It surprised her, though not as much as her smile. </p><p>“I beg you pardon,” Erin found herself asking. </p><p>“I didn’t say anything to you, honey. I was talking to Darion,” Fatima said, her voice surprisingly light for catching her boyfriend in the shower with another woman. “Though, I would have loved it if you resisted even a bit…” </p><p>“What?” she said. Well, stammered, as Darion was yet to stop licking her, and it was hard to resist the pleasure. </p><p>“Well, we made a bet, and Darion said it would only take five minutes for you to put out. You managed to cost me quite a bit.” </p><p>“Wait, what…” she stammered, as she pulled herself up, ready to get down … but Darion’s tongue quickened, forcing a loud moan off her. It took a moment for her to jump down, which was a pity as it was fun to stay up. “Now, tell me what’s going on.” </p><p>“Well, we made a bet, and since I lost, I have to join you two for a threesome,” Fatima declared like it was a certainty. </p><p>Erin froze, shocked at the presumption. “And, you’re confident that I would accept,” Erin said. Fatima didn’t answer, but her naughty smile was answered enough. Worse, Erin failed to refute, and avoided her gaze. </p><p>“Just as I thought,” Fatima said. Erin opened her mouth to answer, only to end up locked in a passionate kiss. A nice one, Erin had to admit, enough for her to abandon herself to her embrace, even when she forced her to the other side. </p><p>She bit her lips as she realized just how badly things devolved from what was supposed to be an investor meeting. Worse, she had no intention of actually resisting as Fatima mauled her body aggressively if a bit ineptly, showing it was the first time she was with a woman. </p><p>Erin had a feeling Fatima’s new boyfriend was making her change her habits rapidly. </p><p>“Well, work hard, and you’ll have a repeat customer,” Fatima whispered, and Erin felt a touch annoyed, mostly because Fatima was barely able to string a teasing sentence together. </p><p>“Hey, don’t neglect me. This is supposed to be a threesome,” Darion said. </p><p>“Sorry about it,” Fatima said as she pushed Erin down. Erin allowed, even when Fatima sat on her face. She started licking while Fatima’s gagging reached to her ear. She abandoned herself to pleasure …</p><p>Which was why she didn’t understand how she ended up flipping, looking the other side while Darion invaded her, while she continued to lick Fatima. “Lick harder,” Fatima moaned. Erin would have answered … but she was busy moaning. </p><p>“You’re the best personal trainer I have ever seen,” Darion mocked her. Erin would have loved to respond in a clever way to show her she wasn’t to be mocked and played … but locked between two bodies, she couldn’t disagree.</p><p>Even once they changed positions, and were about to answer, Fatima put her fingers into her mouth. “No need to talk, sweetie. Just put on a show…” </p>
