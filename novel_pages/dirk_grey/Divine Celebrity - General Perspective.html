        <p>Hi everyone, </p><p>As I mentioned before, I had started Divine Celebrity as a challenge, trying to expand my limits without getting too away from my core story structure. I wondered just how much you guys are enjoying it? </p><p>I'm not promising to implement the results of the poll directly, but it'll still give me a direction about the limits and the possible applications. </p>
