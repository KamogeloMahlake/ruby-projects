        <p>Barbara was sitting in her room, bored out of her mind. She made the mistake of promising someone from her class that she would go to a party … but she was not in the mood. After the day she had at work, she wasn’t in the mood. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was also the reason why she was sitting alone in her room with the lights turned off. After all, her excuse was that she had to go back home for an emergency. It wouldn’t do well if someone actually noticed the light. </p><p>She couldn’t even say that it was her roommate, not with Lily’s habit of rarely staying in the room. Though, Barbara had to admit, she was jealous. Lily had a sister rich enough that they could afford to pay for the overpriced dorms, just so that she had a place to crash occasionally. </p><p>Meanwhile, Barbara had to work part-time just to keep her student loans manageable. She wanted to complain, but at least it allowed her to live alone without paying any extra. Also, altogether, while she could be bitchy sometimes, Lily was not a bad roommate. </p><p>Which was why, when the door opened without a warning and Lily entered, Barbara was surprised and annoyed at the same time. “Hey, B. What are you doing here with the lights closed? Also, aren’t you supposed to be at a party?” </p><p>Barbara sighed. “I was, but I had a bad day, so I decided to rest.” </p><p>“Oh, really. That’s inconvenient,” Lily said, though as she walked closer, Barbara knew exactly what she was talking about. She had a date. No need to wear that ridiculous top that covered almost none of her breasts otherwise. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you need the room,” Barbara said with a sigh, but even as she asked that, she knew the answer she would receive. There was no reason for her to pull her shirt folded up to display more if the partner in question wasn’t somewhere close. </p><p>“Unfortunately, I do. Sorry,” Lily said. She didn’t sound particularly sorry. “But, you told me that you would be at the party, and I made the same arrangements.” </p><p>“And, I’m guessing it’s out of the question that I can stay in the room.” </p><p>“Not unless you’re willing to join,” Lily answered with a chuckle. </p><p>“Oh, a tempting suggestion, but I rather visit the party,” Barbara answered. The last thing she needed was to deal with the usual two-pump frat boy who thought himself an incredible lover. But when the door opened … and who entered was certainly not a boy. </p><p>“This is Darion,” Lily introduced. </p><p>“I’m guessing, football player,” Barbara guessed.</p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” Darion answered. “Actually, not a student altogether.” </p><p>“He works in my sister’s company,” Lily said, her smile naughty. </p><p>“Yes, I do … stuff,” Darion added, his smirk making her insides tingle. Barbara thought about changing her mind about the invitation, as it was certainly tempting. “This is your bed, right?” Darion said as he jumped up. </p><p>“Yes, help me up,” she said. </p><p>“I think that’s my cue to leave,” Barbara said with a smile and left the room, shocked by just how forward Lily was acting. </p><p>Not that she blamed her. </p><p>“Actually, why don’t I tease them a bit,” she spoke to herself as she turned and opened the door, ready to interrupt them before they got a bit hot and heavy. A good little revenge for forcing her to go back to the party. </p><p>Only to realize she was already too late. “Wow, they are fast…” she murmured, waiting for them to notice her … but then, they did not. Barbara felt herself tempted, and sneaked in, moving behind the dresser. </p><p>“Damn, they are fast,” Barbara whispered even as she watched them cycled between positions, each more erotic than the last. “Well, Lily already invited me,” she murmured, ignoring her guilt as she started playing with herself.</p><p>Then, she was tempted to do even more. She sneaked the couch under the bed, got rid of her shirt, and started playing with herself. The fear of getting caught sent her heart out of control. They looked too distracted to catch her. </p><p>And, if they did, she would just accept her punishment.</p>
