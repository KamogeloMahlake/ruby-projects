        <p>I smirked as Kevin stumbled toward us, trying to force his way through the crowd. </p><p>“Megan, I can explain-” he stuttered, only for his words to die halfway when he realized the positioning of her arm. A terrible lack of awareness, especially for a quarterback whose job was to process everything at his field of vision at once. “What are you doing here!” he said as he took a step forward in a way that he no doubt thought intimidating. </p><p>Unfortunately, he had three things working against him. First, as a principle, I was never afraid of the physical danger posed by a rich, spoiled kid. Second, even though he was a football player, a quarterback hardly created a physically imposing figure, especially since he was an inch shorter and considerably thinner than me. </p><p>Third, dressed in a bathrobe, his attempt was simply comical, enough to earn a wave of laughter from the crowd. </p><p>“What am I doing here?” I said, looking shocked. “I thought I was invited to the party. Aren’t I, Thad?” I said, making a comical show of surprise even as I waved to the hulking figure of Thad, who, as a defensive lineman, put an intimidating figure even with a big smile on his face. </p><p>“Of course you’re not invited,” he said, which made the crowd gasp in excitement, expecting a scandal as I kicked off, missing his widening smirk as Thad processed the sight. “Since when a member of the team needs an invite to step into the Den!” he shouted, which earned a huge cheer from the players around. </p><p>Well, half of the players, exclusively the defense, while the offense chose to look at me angrily. </p><p>Interestingly, the defense was predominantly spread around the left side of the courtyard and the pool, while the offense was ere on the right side. The bad blood between them had to b even worse than what I had assumed if even in a party, they were divided like that. </p><p>And I doubted my actions would help soften the relationship in any manner. Not when my first party appearance was accompanied by stealing the girlfriend of one of their players — one of the quarterbacks, the face of the offense, making the insult even more intense. </p><p>“You heard it, Kev. I need no invite. Is there anything else you want to say?” I said mockingly. It wasn’t the best zinger I had come up with, but it was amazing how the snickers of the crowd could turn into a stand-up quality heckle, especially when the audience was already buzzed. </p><p>“Megan, please, let’s talk,” he said as he took a step forward. </p><p>I was tempted to just punch him, but when Megan took a subtle step back, measured, just enough to maintain the distance while positioning me in between, I decided to follow her direction once more. I took half a step forward, and I was safely lodged between them, preventing Kevin from reaching Megan, like a heroic man defending his girl. </p><p>“Why should we talk?” Megan said. “We talked, and you said you are busy for the evening.” She let out a mocking laugh as she turned the girls around him. “And you clearly are, so I decided to break the pace and find a date to accompany me instead.” </p><p>“Shut up, you frigid bitch,” said a surprised voice as a girl burst into the field. She was a sexy redhead with an amazing body, said amazingness on a great display as she was wearing only a lacy bra as the top, turned transparent with wetness. Unfortunately, she still had her skirt on, preventing it from turning into a real show. “That’s what happens when you never put up for your man. He finds a real woman to satisfy him.” </p><p>From Kevin’s face, and the way her arms tightened around my arm, that was not the best thing to say. Revealing to the whole party that he wasn’t able to seduce his girlfriend to been hardly helped Kevin’s reputation. </p><p>From Megan, however, I only felt fury. A tight, compact fury, the kind I wouldn’t expect from a little rich girl. Up until that moment, it was just a game, Megan’s way of punishing her boyfriend to remind him to act more carefully. </p><p>That moment transformed it completely. Being accused to be the lesser woman in such a public fashion, using details pertaining to their bedroom life, was clearly not something Megan was willing to swallow. </p><p>Megan moved, and I prepared myself to take a step back, ready to give her space if she wanted to attack the redheaded girl. It was not a thing I really understood about the girls, attacking the other woman when the boyfriend was the one that cheated. A silly way to go about it, but I had more important things to worry about than understanding the mysteries of female fury. </p><p>Unfortunately, I realized too late that Megan shared my opinion on that subject. She grabbed my arm rather than lashing forward at the other girl. A moment later, her lips were on mine…</p><p>I always thought it was a cliche describing the first kisses accompanied by music. </p><p>Admittedly, it was less about any kind of emotional surge, revealing an unlikely romantic connection, and more about the DJ choosing the perfect moment to drop the beat before switching to a romantic song. </p><p>I was starting to feel like Kevin was not a well-liked person. What a surprise. </p><p>However, as I felt Megan’s tongue slipping inside my mouth, her ex-boyfriend’s relative likability and DJ’s common sense lost their importance. Her lips were soft, contrasting beautifully with the aggressiveness of her tongue. </p><p>My shock passed in short order, replaced by amusement. </p><p>Well, if Megan wanted to give her ex-boyfriend a show, I was more than happy to help. I let one of my hands slip down to her waist, slipping under her blouse to caress her naked skin even as I dipped her down, the other slipping into her soft hair to support her head. </p><p>She tensed for a moment, clearly not expecting me to take the situation and push even further, but under the circumstances, she couldn’t just push me back to maintain the kiss at her exact preference of intensity. </p><p>And, at the risk of sounding smug, I was not a bad kisser. On the contrary, as my tongue battled against hers, her tenseness melted. One of her hands joined the fray by replicating my move, sliding into my hair, but the similarity ended there. My hold was soft and gentle. She pulled my hair, enough to make me let out a gasp of pain. </p><p>That only made me kiss her harder. A little rough play was always fun. </p><p>I continued to kiss her, even as her other hand joined the fray, landing on my chest. Though, the moment she touched, she froze, giving the signs of being pleasantly surprised by my build, before trailing down with an even bigger passion. </p><p>“Stop it, you slut,” Kevin shouted, his voice boiling in impotent jealousy. I couldn’t help but pity him at that moment. I knew Megan for less than an hour, but even then, I was very much aware that it was literally the worst thing he could say. </p><p>And Megan didn’t waste a second before making him know that. Not by pulling back from the kiss and insulting him back, but by letting her fingers dip down even lower, landing on my bulge. </p><p>Her finger froze at the touch. </p><p>Let’s just say there was a reason for my preference for loose pants. </p><p>However, her freeze lasted only for a second before her fingers started to dance with a renewed vigor, enough to convince me that it was only partially about annoying her ex as much as possible. </p><p>“That’s enough, lovebirds,” another voice interrupted. If it was anyone else, I might have ignored it, as Megan was a delicious angry kisser, but since it was Thad, I decided to follow his direction, especially since I trusted him — well more to his distaste he felt against Kevin — to pick the perfect time to do so. </p><p>As I pulled, another mystery revealed itself. I was surprised that Kevin hadn’t charged to punch me, which would have been an excellent way to twist the narrative. But Thad proved a true defensive lineman and stood between us, his smirk telling that he was more than happy tackling Kevin outside of practice as well. </p><p>I pulled back, my arm still tight around Megan, pulling her tight against my chest. She didn’t seem to mind,  considering her hand was still lingering over my erection, pressing tight enough to make my baggy pants not an effective solution to the size of my bulge. </p><p>And after everything I had seen from her, I wasn’t surprised by her next words. </p><p>“You can have your little boy, I’m happy with a real man,” Megan said dismissively to the redheaded girl, who looked just as disappointed at the developments as Kevin. And to add insult to injury, her gaze stayed down Kevin’s waist region long enough to convey what exactly she was talking about. </p><p>Damn, I thought, unable to hide my wince. Even if I despised the guy, that was a deadly blow, especially since it didn’t have to be actually true. Unless he whipped out a total monster immediately, it would simply be a part of the gossip for the next few days. </p><p>Poor guy. </p><p>Kevin tried to stammer an answer, but Megan had already turned at me with a lovesick expression. Her expression was fake, naturally, but with all the hype going around, I was the only one that was close enough to notice so. For everyone else, she was ‘tamed’ by my monster. </p><p>His teammates — other offensive players, naturally — dragged Kevin back before he could make an even bigger fool of himself, sending deadly glares to me and Thad as they retreated. </p><p>The redheaded girl retreated along as well, with a great distaste. She had achieved her aim of taking the toy she desired, but that didn’t make her little ploy a complete failure. </p><p>After all, where was the fun, playing with a toy discarded by the other children. </p><p>As the offense retreated, Megan finally pulled her hand away from my crotch — though not without a hint of reluctance if I read the light dancing behind her eyes correctly — but still stayed at my side. </p><p>With the show she had provided, she had no choice but to do so. </p>
