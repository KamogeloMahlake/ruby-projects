        <title>Darion's Office 15</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Darion had a smile as he drove back to the office despite the silence of his charge, and he didn’t bother hiding it. After all, his bodyguard assignment went much better than he had been expecting with her friend working hard to make things very fun. </p><p>He even caught the sight of a dirty voyeur toward the end, thinking she was invisible on the balcony, watching their aggressive threesome. </p><p>Darion was tempted to see if he could convert that threesome into a foursome … a pity that Mia chose that moment to call him, asking him to return to the office due to an extreme emergency, with several threats of being fired if he got delayed. And, while he normally cursed and closed the call, his new job was proving to be rather more impressive than he would have otherwise expected, so he played along. </p><p>So, with a sigh, he had to cut the fun short and return, leaving the task of dealing with the voyeur for a later date. </p><p>Lily didn’t appreciate the sudden stop any more than he did, and did her to best to delay him by teasing him ceaselessly during the drive. It started innocently at first. He didn’t respond to her advances, and that was not just about handling the journey as fast as possible. </p><p>No, Lily wasn’t the first uppity woman he was dealing with, and he knew that, if he let things slide even a bit, she would do her best to take control. So, even as she teased him exaggeratedly, he didn’t give her the attention she was looking for.</p><p>Even when she got rid of all her clothes as they pulled through the driveway. </p><p>He looked at her, seeing her smile widen. “It’s the end of our journey. Unless you have something to tell me,” she whispered, confident that she had the upper hand. </p><p>“There’s one thing,” he answered, and her smirk widened further, thinking victory was within her reach. “Your other clothes are in the trunk, don’t forget to put them on. You don’t want Mia to catch you and ground you,” he said and left the car. </p><p>The gasp she let out was beautiful, almost enough to make him ignore the value of what he was missing. Patience, he repeated in his mind. By not giving her what she wanted, she was just going to be more desperate to prove herself. </p><p>“H-how dare you?” she gasped as she threw herself out of the car. </p><p>“You need to be straightforward, red? I don’t speak snotty teenager.” </p><p>Her frown got bigger. “How dare you act like you’re not affected!” she gasped. “I know you’re just trying to hold on to hold the upper hand, trying to play me. I’m not a weak girl that’s fallen to that.” </p><p>“Good, because I have a meeting to go to,” Darion said and turned back, walking toward the door. Admittedly, he was feeling bad leaving a naked, horny redhead behind, but that was something he had to suffer. </p><p>Or not, he corrected himself as he heard her aggressive footsteps closing in, realizing he had underestimated her impatience. He acted unaware, and let her grab his arm … only to turn and grab her hard, easily cutting her off her feet. “I don’t like people attacking me from behind,” he whispered, watching her panic melt into arousal as his tone hit her. A rumbling, throaty tone.</p><p>She might be a spoiled brat, but she was smart enough to understand what he was driving toward. </p><p>“I … I’m sorry,” she gasped, her tone equally throaty. With her naked body pressing against his, he decided to revisit some of his priorities. Maybe the meeting wasn’t that urgent. </p><p>“Unfortunately, we need to make sure you learned your lesson, red,” he whispered as he shifted his hold, grabbing her ass aggressively even as he positioned her for a searing kiss, one that she would be completely helpless against. The anticipatory tremble she displayed in his arms was simply beautiful. </p><p>“I …” she whispered as he leaned forward, her lips open, but before she could steal a kiss, he shifted position, grabbing her legs and bringing her toward the closest surface, a lone chair, the perfect surface to teach her a lesson. As he licked her breast, she let out a beautiful moan, confirming his decision to delay the meeting was a smart one. </p><p>“Let’s make sure you’re ready for a punishment,” he said as he lay her down, pressing his fingers against her entrance, dancing to soften her for the upcoming invasion. He still had a meeting, and he didn’t want to be too late. So, a merciless invasion was the best solution. </p><p>“Oh, faster,” she moaned. </p><p>She was lucky, Darion decided. Any other time, he would have slowed down just to remind her he was not for her to order around, but with the time crunch, he wanted to finish as soon as possible. Even more, stopping halfway was not an option, because it would mean he ended up in a boring meeting while dealing with blue balls. More of a punishment for him than for her. </p><p>Unfortunately, before he could even start, he heard a click on the door. Someone was opening. He immediately stood up and stood at the door, ready to kick out the unwelcome visitor while Lily dashed toward the wall, the only place she could hide from the cracked door. Darion was ready to slam the door and finish his job. But, a glimpse of a familiar white jacket stopped him. </p><p>He didn’t expect it was Mia to arrive. </p><p>“So, how can I help you, boss,” he said, warning Lily about the identity of their intruder just in case she wanted to play around. </p><p>“Why are you delaying. I heard the car pull in five minutes ago, yet you’re not in the meeting. Do I need to buy you a dictionary to teach you the meaning of hurry?” </p><p>Darion smirked even as he positioned himself at the entrance, a seductive pose that would make sure she wouldn’t try to burst in. Yet, even as he positioned himself, he couldn’t help but glance at Lily’s naked body, begging for his attention. A true pity. “I was just making sure the car has no problems, boss. I’m a contentious worker.” </p><p>“Enough, stop playing around. We still have a meeting to attend,” she said, her voice panicked. </p><p>“We?” Darion asked, recognizing the opportunity and pouncing forward, more to mess with Mia to pay her back for her intentional cockblock than any real need for some extra money. “From your tone, I’m guessing it’s very important. Any bonus for me?”</p><p>*** *** ***</p><p>Lily was slowly losing control of her breath as she listened to her bodyguard standing at the door, bargaining with her sister about bonus pay while she stood just two feet away, completely naked. It was an incredibly stupid risk to take. If Mia tried to enter, she would be grounded for months, and he would be fired… </p><p>Yet, she never felt this aroused in her life. Just a mistake, and she would be caught. The temptation was too much. She let her hands go free, which dipped down, right into her wet folds, invading her core. </p><p>“A bonus! When you’re late. You’re pushing your luck!” she heard Mia gasping in anger. Normally, her anger would have just made Lily flinch, but with Darion standing right at the door, protecting her, she felt safe enough to delve deeper into her core, enjoying the moment fully. </p><p>The result was beautiful, with pleasure invading her core. Yet, her shock grew more along, surprised Mia was just trying to convince Darion rather than firing him. A surprised gasp escaped her mouth. “What was that?” Mia asked. </p><p>“The car is having a bit of engine trouble, it’s getting too wet,” Darion answered. </p><p>“Is that something cars too?” Mia asked, surprised. Lily found herself blushing, knowing that it was directed at her. Not that she could blame him. She was sopping wet. </p><p>“Of course,” Darion said. “I can show you how it works if you want.” </p><p>Lily felt her legs losing strength, fearing Mia might actually accept the offer. Yet, even as she collapsed, she didn’t stop playing with herself. </p><p>“Enough, we don’t have time to waste,” Mia cut, her tone sharp. “The meeting is too important for us to waste time like this. Follow me!” </p><p>Lily stayed on the ground, playing with herself, wondering what made Mia act like this. She had never seen her act like this, and even Darion’s maddening charisma didn’t explain it. </p><p>Whatever the meeting was, it was something really important…</p><p>“I wonder if Darion could use the opportunity…” Lily found herself muttering. </p>
