        <p>When Penny came back to the living room a few minutes later, I was disappointed to see her choice of clothing. I was hoping for a provocative set of underwear, preferably lace or string, in an attention-grabbing color like bright red, or at least baby blue or soft pink to create an impression of innocence, temping a viewer with the promise that one day, said innocence might disappear. </p><p>Instead, she came down with an ivory-colored teddy, loose enough to even hide her impressive curves. Well, almost managed to hide her curves, if I was being honest, as her breasts still managed to shout their presence through the non-existent cleavage of the top, her ass trying to strain the baggy looseness of her bottom with each step she took. Even her horrible choice wasn’t enough to completely hide her buxom charm. </p><p>Still, I didn’t let those small details affect the expression of sharp disapproval from my face as I looked at her. Under my silence, her shy excitement melted, leaving the only horror behind. “You didn’t like it,” she gasped. </p><p>“What gave it away,” I replied, with a sarcasm thick enough to drown an Olympic swimmer. I turned halfway towards the door. “Maybe I should leave, you are clearly not taking this seriously.” </p><p>“No! No!” she exclaimed in desperation. “I’ll fix whatever you didn’t like. Please give me another chance!” </p><p> I didn’t answer immediately, posing like I had been considering which way to decide, her desperation getting thicker by every second. I even glanced towards the door, which made her eyes widen in panic. “Well, I had to drive all the way here, a few more minutes wouldn’t hurt,” I murmured. </p><p>“Thank you,” she exclaimed as she dashed forward, which cut short when she managed to stumble on my bag, kicking it in the process. </p><p>I sighed while she stammered in panic. Thankfully, the bag was empty, meaning it didn’t ruin anything valuable. I waved off another deluge of stammering apology. “Please go and change while I still have some unbroken equipment,” I murmured. </p><p>She started climbing the stairs rapidly, the sudden movement stretching her teddy enough to give an appealing view of her bottom, which I had a prime view. But halfway in the stairs, she stopped and looked down. “Where are you going?” she said in shock, realizing that I had stepped on the stairs as well.  </p><p>“Coming with you, obviously. After this abomination, I’m not willing to trust your selection.” </p><p>Her lack of willingness towards that idea was obvious, but the several mishaps she had created were equally obvious; some natural, some carefully engineered. She was on thin ice, and she knew that. And when balanced against her longstanding desire to be an actress, it didn’t take long for her to nod obediently before resuming her climb, but this time, considerably slower. I followed, watching the way her hips danced. </p><p>Her blush had turned into a full-fledged furnace when I stepped inside her bedroom. “Where do you keep your underwear?” I asked, ignoring her awkwardness as she pointed a part of the large wardrobe in the room. I walked there, not commenting on her discomfort intentionally, and opened the wardrobe. </p><p>I would have liked to say that I wasn’t disappointed with the view, but that would have been a lie. Unlike what I had been expecting, the teddy she was wearing wasn’t an exception, rather it was towards the revealing end of the spectrum. “Unbelievable,” I murmured. She had curves to die for, and still chose to dress in a burlap sack. And even the ones that were technically-more revealing had uninspired styles, more hindering than helping. Such a waste, cladding that body in these boring pieces. </p><p>“Is that all you have,” I said with a disappointment I hadn’t had to fake. </p><p>“They are all I have,” she answered, but while doing so, her eyes slid down to one of the drawers for a fleeting moment, then jumped away just as quick, marking her as a poor poker player. </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked, letting my gaze drift towards the same drawer for a moment before meeting with her eyes once more. “Are you absolutely sure that you don’t have anything else that might be a bit more interesting.” </p><p>“I’m - sure,” she stammered, this time, her gaze studiously avoiding the drawer, which made the situation even more obvious. </p><p>I started walking towards the drawer while I spoke. “So, you’re saying that, if I search around, there’s absolutely no chance that I might find something more interesting that might be useful for the shoot.” Then, I stood in front of the drawer, but rather than pulling it open, I turned to her. “Well, we need to cancel the shoot then, what a pity,” I answered with mock disappointment, and started walking towards the door. </p><p>It took a couple of seconds for her to get used to sudden change. “Wait!” she exclaimed. “Can’t we use any of my nightwear?” she asked in desperation. </p><p>“No way, honey, they’re all garbage,” I said, not even slowing down my speed. “It’s a pity though, I had rather high hopes for you.” </p><p>I was about to pass through the door when she called me to wait with an urgent tone once more, and dashed to the same drawer I was standing in front of it moments ago. She opened it with great urgency, and pulled a dark blue, velvet-covered box before dashing towards me. At this point, I wasn’t surprised when she stumbled just a couple of feet away, forcing me to grab her to save her from painful collusion. </p><p>Not the one to miss such a beautiful opportunity, I intentionally grabbed her in an awkward way, and her momentum ended up ripping quite a bit on the top, revealing a glimpse of her breasts, with a hint of her rosy areolas, earning a sexy yelp in the process. “Careful, sweetie,” I said while she stood up once more with a crimson face, doing her best to fix the tear. “So, what’s in the box?” I asked. </p><p>“It’s a gag gift from my friends when I left the town,” she answered rapidly, its quickness enhancing the very attention she was trying to avoid. </p><p>“And you haven’t brought it out until now, because…” I said. </p><p>“I forgot,” she answered, her lie so obvious that even a child wouldn’t have believed in. </p><p>“How … convenient…” I slowly drawled, making sure that she understood her poor attempts to deceive me were noted with great dissatisfaction, pushing her even deeper into the lands of panic. “Why don’t you open it and show me what’s inside.” </p><p>From her trembling fingers, I could guess that the box contained something impressive, but still, it managed to pleasantly surprise me. It was a long nightie, made from an alluring mixture of red and black, designed to entice and enhance rather than cover, a direction supported further by liberal usage of transparent fabrics and a rather aggressive style of cleavage. It had a set of underwear to accompany, but they looked too flimsy to cover Penny’s amazing assets. “Yes, it’s the perfect gag gift,” I quipped. “Very hilarious.” With that, I turned my back and started to walk away. “I’ll be waiting for you downstairs.” </p><p>“You don’t want me to wear that, do you?” she asked in a trembling tone, her blue eyes begging for validation. A hope that I had no problems squashing with a dismissive glare, not even bothering to say anything else as I left her alone in the room and went back downstairs. I would have liked to stay upstairs and watch her change, but it would be a step too far in her current state. </p><p>I had to wait several minutes for her arrival, enough to make me consider another visit upstairs to spell out the situation she had been facing. But before I could, I heard the distinctive clack of a heeled shoe. I looked at the stairs, and watched Penny walking down, dressed in the black and crimson set that I had ordered her to wear. And moreover, she had replaced her makeup with ruby lipstick and dark shades, and completing the femme-fetale feeling with the pair of black stilettos she had chosen. </p><p>“Much better,” I said, which was enough to conjure her shyness back to surface, breaking through her composure, therefore destroying femme-fetale impression she had worked hard to conjure. I failed to prevent a small chuckle from escaping my mouth, one she had missed in her distracted state. “Are you ready for the shoot?” </p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured as she wrapped her arms around her chest. It took both of her arms to hide the sections that weren’t covered by her bra, which had ended just above her nipples, not even covering the entirety of her areolas. And the nightie wasn’t helping at all due to thinness of its transparent fabric. Under the strong spotlights, it almost melted into invisibility. </p><p>Still, that was nothing compared to the tiny size of her panties, leaving her bottom almost completely bare, something she was more than aware of, making her turn her body slightly to avoid my gaze. Even on the front, all it would take was a slightly wider step to reveal her core for my eyes. </p><p>“What do you mean, maybe?” I said with a much sharper tone, making her flinch. “You need to decide before wasting more of my time, honey. I’m a professional, I can’t spend all day coddling you while you’re trying to decide whether you’re serious about being a model or actress. Do you know how many girls there are in this city would do unspeakable things for the chance you have?” </p><p>“Sorry,” she exclaimed, her face blushing further at the mention of unspeakable things, her mind no doubt conjuring a couple of them immediately. “Please don’t go, I want to be an actress. It’s just that…” she murmured, failing to continue. </p><p>“That they are too revealing,” I said in a softer tone, completing the sentence for her. “Don’t worry, these pictures are not going to be seen by anyone else. If you want, I can even delete them the moment we finish the test session,” I said, giving her a promise that I had no intention of keeping. As usual, these photos would take their place in my private collection. </p><p>My lie had worked sufficiently to loosen her nerves, evidenced by her arms, moving back to their natural position, leaving her chest bereft of their protection, which bounced with every step she took, straining the ability of the bra to keep them contained. Apparently, its ability to give support wasn’t prioritized in its design. Unexpectedly, it was not. </p><p>“Do you want to start immediately, or would you like to walk around a few minutes to get used to it first,” I offered her. “It’s important for you to feel comfortable in your clothes to do your best.” She nodded gratefully, missing the implications of such a move. </p><p>“So, when you first decided to become an actress,” I asked her, more to make her feel comfortable rather than any genuine interest, as even before she uttered a word, I could guess her story with great accuracy. That how she admired the glamorous life of the people on television, how she was a special person that couldn’t be contained in the borders of the small town in the middle of nowhere, and how she showed a great skill for acting or singing, evidenced by the great success she had in the workshops taught by a washed-up actress. All she needed was to find an opportunity, and she could launch into the stardom without a hitch. </p><p>I kept an appropriately-awed expression on my face as she told the story on mainly on the lines I had guessed, sprinkled with many useless anecdotes and highlights she assumed as important. She was lucky that it was me that had discovered her, as on the spectrum of predators that feasted on the dreams of hopefuls, I belonged to the most harmless category. In the hands of a typical agent, she would have ended up addicted to drugs and partying, hopelessly turning tricks just to get enough cash to maintain her new glamorous lifestyle before she collapsed in a year or two, with only a couple of minor roles to show for. I actually intended to help her; with a bunch of side benefits for myself, of course…  </p><p>Luckily, listening to her story hadn’t been a complete waste of time. Her story might have been boring and predictable, but her shyness started to melt as she continued to talk while her mind focused on the glamour of the future. As time passed, her movements started to get more heated, which created a rather delicious view to accompany her story, her chest tumbling attractively as she waved her arms enthusiastically, even causing occasional slips that she absentmindedly fixed. </p><p>“Such an inspiring adventure,” I said sarcastically, safe in the knowledge that she would fail to catch it in the excitement of finding a willing ear that ‘understood’ her ‘amazing and difficult’ adventure. I patted her thigh softly, slowly familiarizing her with my touch. “Are you feeling ready for the next step?” I asked, raising my camera once again. </p><p>“Yes,” she said, her nod accompanied by only the slightest blush. Her arms twitched with a desire to cover her chest once more, but this time, she aborted it rather easily. </p><p>“Excellent. Why don’t you stand up in the middle of the room and give me a little twirl.” She followed those orders, and several other simple ones without much trouble. Her acting training might be subpar, but luckily, it seemed that it taught her to follow directions. I crossed my legs subtly to hide my arousals, awakened in the anticipation of what was about to follow. “Now, lean forward just a bit,” I added, making her display more of her rather impressive chest. </p><p>“Am I doing well?” she said after going back to a natural pose, this time, the redness of her face more about excitement than shyness. It seemed that a regular bath of flashes worked wonders in quelling her doubts. </p><p>“Not bad for the starter poses. Now warm-up is over,” I said, making sure to give her a smile to weaken at the discursiveness of my words. “Now, let’s try something a bit more advanced, to see whether you can handle the real thing."</p>
