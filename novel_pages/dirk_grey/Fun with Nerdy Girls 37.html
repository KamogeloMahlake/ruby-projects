        <p>“So, you think you can handle anything I can handle,” Sarah said smugly even as she settled on my lap, her back pressing against my chest as she pulled herself close, my shaft trapped between her cheeks. </p><p>And, captured in a beautiful prison, it was growing back rapidly after its latest exertion. </p><p>Naomi just looked at her in shock, still panting after her spectacular climax. Then, her gaze dipped down, to the area our bodies were dangerously close, a hesitant expression on her face. Her determination flickered, only to renew when she noticed Sarah’s smug gaze. </p><p>“I can handle it,” she delivered confidently. Too confidently, I realized. It wasn’t hard to guess what was going on in Naomi’s mind. She was clearly thinking Sarah was bluffing. Though whether she doubted Sarah taking that final step, or having the courage to repeat it in front of her, it was a different question.</p><p>Either way, she overplayed her hand. Before Carrie’s exaggerated show the night before, I doubted Sarah would have dared to do so, but like before, it was the benefit of dealing with my beautiful nerds. They have no preconceived notions about sex, and since Sarah had suffered under Carrie’s courage the night before, she would have no problems with it. </p><p>“Oh, really,” Sarah said, suddenly sounding hesitant. “So, you’re saying that you’re willing to repeat everything I do. Promise?” It was an artificial expression, and not a particularly convincing one either, but for Naomi, already half-convinced with her assumption, it was all she needed to double down. </p><p>“Promise,” Naomi delivered confidently, her expression smug. </p><p>That smug expression flickered a bit when Sarah rose up enough to free my shaft from its prison, once again completely erect. Naomi’s expression recovered as she turned to Sarah, no doubt to tell her not to bother bluffing, when she noticed Sarah had already grabbed my shaft, aligning it with her entrance. </p><p>Naomi looked panicked for a moment, her mouth open to deliver a surrender, when Sarah changed the position, and when she lowered herself, my shaft was once again trapped in her crack. “I knew it, you’re a little coward,” Naomi said with a gasp of relief. </p><p>“Oh, we’ll see who’s the coward,” Sarah said even as she raised herself once more, enjoying Naomi’s panic as she lowered herself once more, once again rubbing against her crack, which made my erection even more unbearable. </p><p>This time, Naomi said nothing, even with the unfamiliar situation, smart enough to realize Sarah was acting far too confident after her bluff was called. </p><p>I decided to help her a bit, my palms making contact with Sarah’s nude back, massaging her for a while before traveling on her sides, caressing them before shifting to my ultimate tactic. </p><p>Sarah moaned in appreciation as I palmed her breasts, my hands big enough to completely cover their beautiful expanse, my cock still buried in her cheeks. “Not a bad start,” I whispered into her ear even as I squeezed her breasts, my fingers finding her nipples. </p><p>Sarah moaned loudly, her hips rocking as her cheeks massaged my arousal. Even then, she looked straight at her friend, their eyes meeting, one colored with confidence, the other… </p><p>Shock. </p><p>“Let’s see who’s the coward,” Sarah said as she raised herself once more. Not one to miss such an opportunity, I leaned forward, getting a beautiful whiff of her hair before nibbling at her neck, earning a delicious moan in the process as she paused. </p><p>The moans and gasps she was emitting were simply hypnotizing. </p><p>“Maybe—“ Naomi started, but that was all she was able to say before she was interrupted by Sarah’s moan. An excessively loud, deliberate moan as she started to sit on my erection, her gleaming core wrapping around my shaft, still wet from her lips earlier. </p><p>“Someone’s excited to give a show,” I whispered to her ear, soft enough to avoid Naomi’s ears — not that she was in a position to eavesdrop on us in the first place, her gaze locked where our bodies were meeting. </p><p>And Sarah, like the good friend she was, kept her legs wide, the direct view leaving no doubt about what was going on. </p><p>“So, who’s the … coward,” Sarah said smugly, though her pause was less about trying to emphasize, and more about the moan that was forcing itself out as she started moving down.</p><p>Naomi said nothing as Sarah started lowering herself even more, devouring my length with beautiful aggression. “You’re so wet, you’re flowing,” she commented a second later. </p><p>“Yes, she is,” I said even as I shifted my hands a bit, leaving her breasts free as I grabbed her waist, pushing her down. Sarah didn’t answer, too busy moaning explosively. She closed her eyes as she tried to process the sensation of invasion, still a novel presence. </p><p>I turned my gaze on Naomi, who was watching the procession with a delicious mixture of shock, arousal, and not an inconsiderable amount of anger. </p><p>Her mood was understandable, as she had come for a night of some intimate flirting, only to find herself in a tense competition with one of her best friends, and the fact that she was watching that friend taking the ultimate step. </p><p>In such a spectacular manner. </p><p>Realizing her victory, Sarah tried to lift herself up, no doubt to call it an end before chasing Naomi away, but I had other ideas, and absolutely no intention to stop. </p><p>My hands snapped onto her hips, holding her in place, making her jump up and down, each repeat pushing my shaft even deeper. Her moans got louder and louder, losing their earlier controlled attitude. </p><p>Naomi’s eyes dipped down once more, focusing on the junction our bodies met, widening as she watched a certain part of her friend widen further to accommodate my aggressive invasion. </p><p>“So, still in the mood to repeat whatever I do,” Sarah managed to squeeze in between moans, her eyes closing immediately afterward as she focused on the pleasure that was radiating in her body. </p><p>It turned out to be a critical hit to Naomi’s confidence, as she made a motion to stand up, panic invading her tone. Luckily, I was watching her prevent exactly that, and my hand landed on her thigh. </p><p>Hardly the most intensive way to keep someone in their seat, barely enough to give her a pause, but with her body burning in arousal, her nipples hard, it was all I needed. As my fingers danced on her inner thigh, her hesitation and fear were injected with just enough arousal to keep her in place. </p><p>She gritted her teeth before murmuring. “Oh, I believe I can do much more,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>The way Sarah’s eyes popped wide as she turned to Naomi was beautiful, shocked by her decision, before her expression slowly turned to indignation, no doubt shocked by her friend daring to say she would take a turn after that. </p><p>Admittedly, indignation was not a state she could justifiably claim under the circumstances. Not only she had been gleefully mocking and challenging Naomi only because she was confident Naomi wouldn’t take that step…</p><p>But also she had no problems taking a ride after another of their friends, even after seeing us sharing the same level of nudity. </p><p>On this exact couch, even. </p><p>Sarah opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, I put my hand on her leg, and squeezed hard, which was enough to remind her about her poetic hypocrisy. She gritted her teeth and held back whatever argument she was about to deliver. </p><p>And just like that, tables were turned. Naomi looked smug and confident — for a given value of confidence — while Sarah was squirming in discomfort, under the combined attack of the uncomfortable realization, and my iron grip as I continued to ram into her beautiful entrance repeatedly. </p><p>“It wouldn’t be fair to ask Naomi to take the plunge without showing her the full extent of the requirements,” I whispered even as I shifted my hands, clutching to her shoulders before pushing her down, impaling her even harder, her moans even more spectacular, her wetness reaching an unbelievable level. </p><p>Sarah moaned, not that she could do anything else under my iron grip, taking it to the limit under the circumstances. As her moans rose, Naomi’s momentary confidence shattered once more, though this time replaced by a different kind of fear. </p><p>The kind I had seen on her face when we exercised together, when I asked her to do a complicated move that she wasn’t sure of completing with her physical abilities. </p><p>Sarah, unaware of the changing nature of her friend’s concerns, focused on crying and moaning as she lost herself in pleasure, each second bringing a bigger flare of joy. </p><p>I said nothing, enjoying the sight of two contrasting beauties, nary a trace fiber between both of their bodies, every secret of their body on display, yet none of them bothering to cover themselves up. </p><p>The situation was far too gone for that. </p><p>Yet, I was willing to push the case even further. “Why don’t you stand up…” I said as I turned to Naomi, only for her to look at me in abject shock, thinking that I was asking to leave. </p><p>Like I would ever do such a thing after everything that happened. </p><p>“… take a seat that would give a better view to your dear friend. We don’t want her to miss anything, do we, Sarah?” I asked, slapping her ass. </p><p>“No! Don’t!” Sarah gasped, suddenly feeling self-conscious, which, under the circumstances, was more about me taking back control than the body she was displaying — after all, she had already displayed everything, leaving no secret between friends.</p><p>She recognized my tone, the same tone I used last night after taking control, and in the morning when we ‘played’ in the kitchen, pushing her even more than she had been expecting when she decided to fuck behind her friend. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, after all the goading she had thrown at Naomi since the beginning of our adventure, a panicked request was the worst thing she could do to stop Naomi, who was currently sporting a beautiful smile, noticing the opportunity to twist the situation. </p><p>It was a trap for her as well, of course, but it would be a while until she noticed it.</p>
