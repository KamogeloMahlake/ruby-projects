        <p>I didn’t resist as Astrid pushed me toward the middle of the pool, not when she immediately took a position behind me, her hands on my shoulders, rubbing gently. Though, that wasn’t half as interesting as her hefty breasts pushing against my back, creating a heavenly sensation. “Mmm,” I murmured. “Not a bad start.” </p><p>Then, Lillian dived a bit deeper, and I felt a pair of hands around my crotch, one wrapped around my shaft, going up and down, the other gently massaging my balls. “How about this,” Lillian murmured. </p><p>“Nothing to complain,” I answered as I enjoyed the exquisite treatment of her hands, combined with the gentle caress of the warm water. “I have everything I want right here.” </p><p>“Really,” Astrid whispered to my ear before kissing my neck gently. “Everything?” she added even as her hands traveled lower, her body pushing even tighter against mine, until a second hand wrapped around my shaft, doubling the pleasure, her other arm staying wrapped around my waist to pull herself tight. Her body moved up and down just like her hand did, providing an unusual —but very enjoyable— massage to my back. </p><p>Things got even more heated when Lillian leaned for a kiss, but not for my lips. Instead, she met with Astrid, whose head was peeking above my shoulder. So, I watched a delicious make out session of a pair of divine examples of sexiness, one redhead and one blonde, from a very closed range, all the while their hands continued to caress my most sensitive location. </p><p>I knew it was their show, and I wasn’t supposed to touch them, but combined with the previous show, I was getting impatient. Combined with my limited ability to deny my baser instincts —anger and lust in particular— denying such a beautiful siren call, even for the promises of an even more spectacular explosion later on, was not possible. Not after I had already stretched myself to the limit just as I watched their amazing show. I leaned, pressing my lips on Lillian’s neck, while my right hand sneaked to her tits, once again enjoying their firmness. Meanwhile, my left hand trailed down her sides, enjoying her smooth curves. </p><p>“Impatient,” Lillian murmured as she broke the kiss with Astrid, only to replace her lips with mine, Astrid’s taste still present on her lips. Her hands quickened, enhancing the pleasure I was feeling. </p><p>“Very impatient,” Astrid whispered, agreeing with Lillian’s statement. She started kissing my neck and shoulders while her impressive tits still pressed against my back, making me enjoy her presence even more. Then, Lillian pulled back, while Astrid grabbed my hair and forced me to turn a bit, and took the position against my lips. I was expecting Lillian to take Astrid’s role, but she surprised me by diving underwater, and I felt her lips around my shaft, selflessly giving me an underwater blowjob. </p><p>The next several minutes passed in a delicious cacophony, as the girls alternated positions whenever I was getting used to their approach, keeping it fresh. I was impressed. They were definitely showing the benefits of all the risks I took saving them, kissing, licking, snuggling, and biting, all awakening great pleasure. </p><p>When it was Astrid’s turn once more for the kiss, she clamped around my lips, her arms draped around my neck while Lillian once again busied herself underwater with great results. I decided to reward the girls for their effort, not to be selfish, and brought my hands between their legs, one for each girl. A pair of shocked moans rose the moment I twisted my fingers, proving I wasn’t the only one feeling stretched trying to suppress the pleasure. </p><p>At first, Astrid was able to maintain the kiss, interrupted by the occasional moans, but soon, the pleasure became too much, forcing her to separate. I chose to focus on Lillian’s exquisite nipples, teasing their sensitiveness through uneven brushes of my tongue. </p><p>"Yes!" they shouted simultaneously as they enjoyed the treatment. </p><p>Still, Lillian didn’t stay over water for too long, and soon dropped below the surface, an evil smile twisting her lips. She knelt down underwater as she ran her tongue up and down my shaft. Honestly, at that point, it was hard not to cum. I only held because my instincts warning me that cumming first under the circumstances would signify defeat, which was not acceptable. And Astrid’s delicious moans, echoing in the bath, didn’t help any. </p><p>It was Astrid that surrendered first, exploding without a warning, her warmth distinct even among the warm bathwater. She staggered back, leaning against the edge as she sucked gulps of air, trying to stay conscious after the explosion. I put my hands under Lillian’s armpits and pulled her on the surface. “You’re alone, now,” I said with a smirk, nodding toward Astrid with a negligent gesture. </p><p>“Such a pity,” Lillian answered. “But I’m sure that even alone-” she tried to posture, but I easily threw her toward Astrid, following after her immediately. I spent a second enjoying the view. Astrid was leaning against the marble wall of the bath, facing toward us, when Lillian collided with her chest first. Lillian’s back was toward me, while her tits pressing against Astrid’s, creating the most delicious sandwich ever. </p><p>Teasing time was over. It was time for the main course. </p><p>Lillian gasped in anticipation as she felt my body pressing against hers, her moans rising even before I slid into her tight tunnel. The swollen head of my erection, throbbing with desire, disappeared first in her needy hole, slowly followed by the rest of my shaft. </p><p>“Aaagh!” she moaned as her willing and waiting tightness stretched around my throbbing, enthusiastic presence. Her cry of enthusiasm was short-lived as Astrid’s lips silenced her immediately with another vigorous kiss, her anticipation clear. </p><p>“Damn, girl. You’re even tighter,” I murmured as my shaft slowly disappeared inside her despite my size. It was the second time I was enjoying her depths, so it felt different, but definitely not in a bad way. The way she grabbed around me was exquisite, making my heart beat faster in anticipation. As more of my shaft disappeared inside her, her moans rose, stretching Astrid’s capabilities to contain her voice. Luckily, we were in the middle of the wilderness, protected by layers of wards, so there was no problem Lillian moaning until her vocal cords were bruised. </p><p>However, as I ravaged her, I could once again feel a connection forming, like the first time we spend together. My magic flowed in a weird pattern that I barely recognized, following my instincts, wrapping around her magic, melting into hers. Unlike the last time, where it flowed like an uncontrollable flood, this time it was a controllable river, though like trying to hold back a river, trying to hold it back would have caused some discomfort. </p><p>Once again, my magic wrapped around hers, giving me an intimate sense of her own magic. Unlike the last time, I could feel traces of my own power in her flow, the courtesy of the previous time. I examined them carefully, afraid that it might hurt her, but a careful investigation showed that unless I wanted to activate them maliciously, they would not harm her. On the contrary, they would help her development significantly. </p><p>What an interesting development. </p><p>Lillian was unaware of the target of my focus. “Yes, impale me harder!” she shouted, uncaring of the disgrace, making me wonder how her noble father would have reacted if he knew that his precious daughter had been lovingly suffering under a bastard’s cock, ignoring the decorum of her position, bringing shame to her role as an heiress. Pity I wouldn’t know that. Still, it wasn’t exactly a deal-breaker as I pushed my shaft deeper and deeper inside her, forcing her to stretch to the limit. Lillian’s moans took a pained edge, huffing and puffing as she tried to resist the invasion, but her ass pushed back enthusiastically still. </p><p>She cried with pleasure as I grabbed her hair, pulling hard. “I’m about to move,” I warned her as I pulled back, only to slam back immediately, forcing the air of her lungs. Her eyes widened, her mouth hung open, and her cries echoed on the pristine marble walls of the bath. I pushed forward mercilessly, gyrating my dick inside her, teasing her from a different angle with every repeat. Soon, she lost herself in a string of repetitive cries.</p><p>Astrid watched us, her mouth parted open. “Be careful, you’re going to ruin her,” she warned with a giggle, unable to hide her fascination as her hands danced over Lillian’s body, occasionally roaming on mine. “But I’m surprised that she can take your monster as easily in her second time. I’m impressed.” </p><p>“Well, you weren’t any worse,” I reminded her. After all, just several days ago I had helped her graduate to the ranks of womanhood, and she had shown an exemplar performance. </p><p>“True, but I grew up in the wilds, and hardship was something we’re used to. Not so much for this little blonde thing,” Astrid said mockingly, though, from her tone, I could sense that she was saying those words with no ulterior aim. It was just old fashioned ribbing. The girls had really become good friends during this period. Of course, Lillian didn’t even react to her words, too busy gasping and moaning as she steadily climbed toward an orgasm. </p><p>I decided to mess with her a bit in Lillian’s stead. “Well, if it’s such a hardship, maybe I should skip you,” I offered with a smirk. </p><p>“No!” she shouted immediately, though mollified a bit when I laughed. “Asshole,” she murmured. I was tempted to say anything else, but Lillian chose that exact moment to explode into deafening cries, signaling her climax. “My turn!” Astrid exclaimed enthusiastically. </p><p>“As you wish, sweetie,” I said, but instead of pulling immediately, I made sure to analyze Lillian’s magic to make sure there were no side effects, and while doing so, added some more magic to her. Only then I helped Astrid to push Lillian on the edge of the bath, and she lay down, gasping hard, trying to catch her breath. Before Astrid could move, I already moved in front of her, my arms on her both sides, locking her in place. Her eyes widened, but before she could act, I pushed forward, pushing inside. After the extended foreplay, and the amazing show she had just watched, my shaft slipped in easily, though it was still a very snug fit. </p><p>“Damn,” Astrid moaned. “I missed this.” </p><p>“Then let’s load you up so that you don’t miss me too much in my journey,” I whispered into her ear even as I pushed forward, ravaging her insides. </p><p>“You’re going away?” Astrid cried, though I wasn’t sure whether my words or the invasion of my shaft made her cry loudly. </p><p>“For a few days, at least,” I explained even as I brought my hands to her hips, pulling her closer, giving a true taste of my invasion. Under my assault, Astrid staggered for a moment, her words disappearing under the assault of a fresh wave of joy. </p><p>However, Astrid impressed me by shaking it off. “You can’t. This mountain is far too dangerous to explore.” </p><p>“Sorry, sweetie,” I said, even kissing her for a fleeting moment. “We’re facing against an enemy of unknown size. We can’t just sit and ignore such an important possible advantage. I know it’s risky, but apparently, they somehow managed to build a city here. Every secret I grasp, however small, will give us a significant advantage later on.” </p><p>Astrid looked at me rebelliously for a moment, no doubt trying to come up with ways to prevent me from doing so. If it was for something else, I would have punished her severely for her disrespect, but knowing she was worried for my safety, I decided to cut her some slack. Instead, I quickened my pace, turning my already-impressive shaft into a weapon of destruction, each push extracting a louder cry. Soon, her worries melted away in a rush of pleasure, and her thoughts evaporated, leaving only passion behind. </p><p>I wondered whether I could replicate the same trick with Astrid. I called my magic in the same pattern, wrapping around Astrid’s core. The sensation was different. Unlike Lillian’s magic, Astrid’s didn’t lash out immediately, trying to coax more of my magic to flow. However, it didn’t surprise me. I was expecting that, since neither Astrid’s first time with me, nor the time after my Ascension, had created such a result. </p><p>I suspected it was about Lillian’s bloodline. Maybe it was resonating with the source of my power, the Dragon’s Heart. After all, there needed to be a reason why they kidnapped her, and why their kidnappers had such a rare treasure with them. Lillian’s power being somehow interacting with it explained quite a bit, especially with that mysterious captain’s insistence about leaving Lillian untouched. It was by no means a definitive conclusion, but it was far better than anything else I had. </p><p>Astrid moaned repeatedly, enjoying the sensation of being filled to the brim while I leaned down, biting her bountiful tits. Leaving my red mark on her pale tits was definitely enjoyable. </p><p>Even as I played her body like an instrument, I focused on my magic, trying to recreate the effect with Lillian’s magic. It wasn’t simple, but after several repeats, I managed to attain elementary success. Our magic mixed together, leaving small scraps of it in her magic flow. However, since Astrid’s magic was far less developed compared to Lillian’s, the relative effect of it was even bigger. Even without any additional support, I didn’t doubt that after a week of careful meditation, Astrid could double her strength. </p><p>What a convenient ability. </p><p>Soon, Astrid exploded in cries as well, which was no less loud than Lillian’s earlier tone. As she hugged me and shuddered, trying to keep herself upright, I made eye contact with Lillian, who had recovered in the meanwhile, and was watching us with steamy eyes, her fingers disappearing repeatedly between her legs. “You’re attending yourself. Be careful, or I might feel inadequate.” </p><p>“Then come and attend my needs,” Lillian moaned as she lay on her back, her legs parted invitingly. </p><p>“How can I turn down your noble invitation,” I said even as I pushed Astrid out of the water, and pushed her directly on top of her. Before Lillian could react, I was already in front of them, and slid inside her with a smooth stab. </p><p>Lillian might be surprised by the sudden weight on her, but it didn’t prevent her from crying in pleasure. Meanwhile, not wanting to neglect her, I brought my fingers down to tease Astrid’s poor, neglected pussy, which was still shuddering after her latest orgasm. This time, the moans that filled the room was even louder, making me smile widely. No matter the danger, no matter the risk, having two top-grade beauties in front of me, wet and naked, begging for my attention, was an amazing sensation, especially after spending years faking incompetence with little attention from ladies. </p><p>Normally, I would have just stopped at this point, but the potential implications of my latest discovery were too tempting to deny. So, I spent the rest of the afternoon playing with their magic and their bodies in equal measures, leaving two exhausted, but thoroughly satisfied, ladies in my wake. </p><p>After finishing, I dragged them to a makeshift camping bed, and covered them with a blanket, not even bothering to dress them, leaving them in a naked hug. Since they were already getting along great, it wouldn’t be a problem. </p><p>Before leaving, I wrote a detailed note, ordering them to stay inside the Villa no matter what, and meditate. Also, I explained several exercises to Lillian, and asked them to teach those to Astrid, who, unlike Lillian, lacked a proper magical education. If I was going to carry her along with me, I wanted her to be as competent as possible. </p><p>After that, I quickly dressed and made myself a bag, leaving the Villa just as the sun finally sank below the horizon. </p><p>I wanted to explore the mountain in the dark, curious of the secrets it might reveal… </p>
