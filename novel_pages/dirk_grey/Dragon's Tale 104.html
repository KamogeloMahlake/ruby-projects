        <p>"Y-you’re so rude,” she muttered, though her blush was more of a shy tone than anger — a difference that I had long learned to identify — as she brought her clothes under the fabric she was using as a dress at the moment, doing her best to minimize the flashes of skin. </p><p>Not particularly successfully, giving me a delicious glimpse of her glistening perfect skin, tempting me to drag my tongue over it. </p><p>As I focused on her accidental reveals, another great explosion happened near the ship, showing that the retreat wasn’t going as well as they had been hoping — not that it was surprising. The crime of sinking a ship was significant, but amusingly, it was the suspicion that they had been transporting me — and the dragon hearts I had stolen — that intensified their chase. </p><p>They didn’t know I was a stowaway, but luckily, their armaments were enough to prevent them from stopping for a search. </p><p>Truly a great stroke of luck. </p><p>I ignored another, even louder explosion, even if it made the ship shake horribly, showing that, if it wasn’t for the great protective wards the ship relied on, it might have delivered catastrophic damage. </p><p>Even with the wards, the ship had slowed down slightly. I didn’t let it worry me, as they were yet to return to the hidden deck to use their magical ballista and other weapons, which was enough to show their confidence to escape. </p><p>I didn’t know where their confidence came from, but I chose to trust their expertise, and focus on the task at hand. </p><p>Watching Xia shuffle panicked as she tried to cover herself. </p><p>Unlike me, she lacked the strategic experience to ignore the nearest explosion as insignificant, jumping in panic. And, the fabric was barely hanging on her body in the first place, and utterly failed to stay on when she jerked in panic. </p><p>It slid down, leaving her in a beautiful panic. Her first reflex was to lean down and pick it up, which gave me a glimpse of her beautiful breasts, their perfect shape more than enough to compensate for their modest size.</p><p>I whistled in appreciation, which was enough for her to stop and her breasts with her arms, her legs crossed. It reduced the glimpse I was receiving, but it also stopped her from putting it on.</p><p>“L-look away,” she muttered shyly, making me chuckle as I watched her forget that she was a mighty sorceress, and had dozens of magical ways to solve her problems, instead doing her best to cover her body with her arms.</p><p>“You’re lucky that I’m a helpful man,” I said with a chuckle as I crouched, and she took a panicked step behind me. I grabbed the fabric and raised it, gesturing for her to pick it up. </p><p>She reached, the temporary absence of an arm around her chest giving me another glimpse of her nipple, which was getting harder. Before her hand could touch, I made a show of stumbling backward. </p><p>“Sorry, it’s the ship,” I murmured. “It’s so hard to stand up straight.” </p><p>“Yes, you have such a poor balance,” she replied. “I have seen it during the fight, you’re very clumsy,” she added, biting back in annoyance — though it enhanced her shyness even further.</p><p>It was wrong to do, but watching her stumble due to her shyness, enough to forget her own magical abilities, was simply too entertaining to stop. So, when she reached toward it, I pulled it again, though this time, I didn’t even bother faking a stumble. “Oops,” I said in a deadpan voice. </p><p>“J-jerk,” she stammered, but she neither tried to cast a spell nor used one of the many barriers in the deck to change back to her clothes. Instead, she tried to grab the fabric once again, this time quickly and without a warning, hoping to catch me by surprise. </p><p>She had no chance of matching my reflexes. I pulled back my arm at the last moment, making her fingers brush against the fabric helplessly. I wanted to show her the futility of her action, but she chose to take that as a near victory, and her arm moved again, this time followed by a step forward, in her hurry, her other arm sliding just enough to reveal her treasures. </p><p>If we were in a different location, I would have retreated back, turning it into an amusing chase, to see just how long it would take for her to realize the absurdity of the situation. However, with the constant risk of the sailors coming down, it was hardly the safest choice.</p><p>The other option was to let her grab the fabric and win our little game, but it was almost as unappetizing as an option. </p><p>But that was not the only way of stopping our little game. I had another way, one that would distract her from the battle for a long time. I stepped forward at the same time, passing her even as wrapped the fabric around her tight, trapping her arms. </p><p>Yet keeping the fabric low enough to create beautiful cleavage, one that looked even better as I hugged her from behind. </p><p>“Here, let me help,” I said cheekily. She froze as she felt my arms around her, preventing him from moving. </p><p>“M-Marcus, let me go,” she whispered throatily, her voice colored with reluctance. </p><p>“Oh, really, is this what you truly want?” I whispered into her ear, which was enough to freeze in my arms.  A whimper escaped her mouth, but that was the extent of her complaints, even as I let the silence stretch. </p><p>Her silence turned rather thick as I tugged the fabric down a bit, enhancing her cleavage enough to give a glimpse of her areolas while still keeping her nipples hidden. I could have pulled it more, but it could never rival the excitement of slowly divesting her of her clothing. </p><p>Well, what passed for clothing in her current mode of dress. </p><p>I stayed still for a moment, letting her process the moment, giving her the time to change her mind, but her response was to press her hips against my erection. She did so subtly, trying to hide it as a shuffle, but it was hard to conceal when it was like that when the movement of her hips turned rhythmic in quick succession. </p><p>I wasn’t exactly surprised by that. After all, it was not a mystery that women found power attractive, and Xia had just watched me win several impossible battles in quick succession. And, like it wasn’t enough, she had experienced those deadly situations directly, reminding her of her mortality. </p><p>It was only natural that she wanted to affirm her life.</p><p>I had no doubt that, if it was not for her intense shyness that showed a distinct lack of experience with sexual adventures, she would have turned in my arms and started kissing me — before transitioning into even more entertaining activities.  </p><p>Not that I had any problem with her shyness. Her initiative would have been entertaining, but it would have been intense. In comparison, her clumsy attempts to slip a couple rubbing were still sexy, and extended for a much longer time. </p><p>And, considering we had nothing to do until the battle outside concluded one way or another, there was no need to move fast. It was a rather excellent way to kill some time.</p><p>I kept my arms around her waist, though not as tight as a moment before. She could have easily pulled her arms and fixed the fabric, but she ignored that in favor of continuing her fake struggle, her body rubbing against mine, her blush getting thicker. </p><p>With my loose grip and her constant rubbing, the fabric continued to slip down, revealing her nipples. However, with her eyes closed to fully enjoy the moment, she missed that fact. </p><p>That, or she closed her eyes just to have an excuse to miss that fact, I corrected myself as the fabric continued to slide, leaving most of her torso naked as it gathered around my arms — which were wrapped at her waist. </p><p>I noticed the quirk on her lips, realizing her ploy. She was too shy to take a concrete step forward, but she wasn’t too shy to let herself slowly get naked, hoping to tempt me to rip the cover away aggressively. </p><p>Too bad for her that it only increased my determination to play with her slowly… </p><p>I did nothing but enjoy Xia’s constant rubbing, her apparent excuse of trying to extract herself from my arms getting more and more unbelievable each second. </p><p>However, before I could take the next step, the hatch opened once more, followed by rapid footsteps. </p><p>Horrible timing. </p>
