        <p>Hi, everyone. I wasn't very happy with this weeks' Wild Dragon of Rome, so it'll skip this week. I know it's a cliffhanger a bit, but the upcoming battle is very critical for the future of the story, so I want to perfect it. </p><p>Instead, I'll be uploading 8 whole chapters for Blacksmith vs. The System, while also making the first 10 chapters available for 5$ tier, which is more than my regular updates. Hopefully, it's good enough as an apology. </p><p>Also, I'm getting quite a bit excited about the Blacksmith, story, so I'll probably turn that into a Royal Road story with guaranteed public updates somewhere in late August- early September if all goes well. </p><p>Fingers crossed. </p><p>Have fun, everyone!</p>
