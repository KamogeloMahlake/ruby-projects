        <p>Watching Aria on my lap after a ferocious ride was a rush that was hard to match. Watching the innocent princess riding me in her control even as her beautiful breasts dangled as she rose and fall was a feast, and her struggle to catch her breath after the furious ride just added a delicious portion of dessert to the amazing meal. </p><p>Delicious enough to make me hungry enough for another bite, despite my assurances about the lesson’s end, especially as my erection came back to life with record speed, still inside her snug entrance. </p><p>“That was amazing,” I said to her even as I put my hand on her shoulder, caressing gently to make her open her eyes. “Now, are you ready for the second part of the lesson,” I said. </p><p>“T-the second part?” she stammered, her beautiful blue eyes widened in a way that might have melted the heart of a more merciful man, but just tempted me further. “But you said…” she tried to continue, only for her shyness to block her own voice under my gaze. She somehow felt shy talking about it even after displaying such a spectacular show. </p><p>“It’s because you’re such a good student, Aria,” I whispered throatily even as I grabbed her waist and pushed her up, helping her to stand up with her trembling feet. I also stood up, standing behind her. “Since you have managed to learn the previous lesson flawlessly, there’s no harm in giving the preview of the new topic. I expect a desire to excel from my students.” </p><p>As usual, my nonsensical arguments worked excellently when framed from a perspective of a tutor, triggering her submissiveness toward the authority, though, admittedly, the pleasure that was still held her body under control, making her tremble with every step as I led toward the middle of the cell. I was kind enough to cast a cleaning spell on the floor, even though it hadn’t been long enough for the floor to get dirty. Then, I summoned her dress directly in front of her. </p><p>“On your hands and knees,” I whispered to her even as I hugged her from behind, enjoying the smoothness of her skin. “It’s time we teach you some new positions. </p><p>“O-on my hands and knees,” she repeated, once again stammering as she tried to look at me, but failed to do so while wrapped in my arms. </p><p>The reason for her hesitancy was clear. There was something that was inherently dirtier in taking her while she was on all four in terms of power balance. Not a relatively balanced one like a student-teacher one either, but a wide gulf like between a servant and a lord. And due to her exalted position, even Aria, despite all her naivety, was aware of the implications. “Yes,” I said simply even as underlined it with a spank on her plump ass, making her flinch. “Is there a problem?” </p><p>Aria’s brief flare of rebellion died under my stiff spank. She didn’t dare to say anything, even when I let her go, and instead, obediently took the requested position on the floor, her dress gathered under her knees to prevent chafing. Interestingly, she positioned herself so that she not facing the door but the wall on the opposite side, leaving her blind to any possible visitor. I was curious whether it was intentional, or instinctual after the latest shameful display when Emma had barged inside. </p><p>My seed was already dripping down her entrance as I crouched down behind her, and for a moment, I was struck with the fancy of probing her remaining virgin hole, but decided otherwise. It was too early to do so, especially since we were ripe for interruptions here. It would have been a pity to go through all the necessary preparations to loosen her up, only to be interrupted before I could taste the fruit of my efforts. </p><p>So, rather than pushing the envelope more than necessary, I crouched behind her, my hands resting on her plump ass. “Are you ready?” I asked even as I slapped her ass, and she moaned, which carried shame and arousal in equal amounts. “Do we need to go over this again? When I ask a question, I expect a proper reply,” I said, spanking her again, this time hard enough to leave a red welt behind. </p><p>“S-sorry,” she stammered in shock, trying to adapt to the sudden change in attitude. But while she might be shocked by it, from the way she clenched, she was enjoying it despite her shock. </p><p>I let my gaze dance over her naked figure, her plump ass trembling in preparation, her firm tits dangling freely thanks to the position, while her blonde hair spilling down to hide her face. The last part wouldn’t do, I decided, and gathered her hair in my fist even as I pushed my shaft against her wet entrance, plunging the tip into her warm embrace. </p><p>“You’re enjoying this even more, don’t you?” I casually commented as I plunged deeper into her, enjoying her grasp, which was even tighter than the previous time. “You’re such a slutty princess.” </p><p>“W-what!” she cried loudly even as she tried to get used to my presence inside her. “N-no, t-that’s not it,” she added after a moan, but stammering so much that her lie wouldn’t have convinced an innocent kitten. </p><p>I spanked her ass again while pulling her hair simultaneously, extracting another pained cry that wasn’t bereft of pleasure. “Good girls don’t lie, Aria,” I said with a soft, lazy tone that contrasted greatly with my merciless pumping, the sound of our flesh melding threatening to break the walls of the cell. “Tell me, are you a good girl?” </p><p>Another spank later, her reply lashed out quickly. “I’m a good girl!” she cried, cracking as loud as the spank that just landed on her ass. </p><p>“Then, why are you being untruthful to my questions, sweetheart?” I whispered even as I pulled her hair hard, her back taking a deliciously curved shape to compensate. I cast another spell, this time creating a reflective surface on the wall that worked like a perfect mirror, forcing her to look at her own lewd expression. “Look at yourself, is this the face of a girl that doesn’t enjoy what’s happening to her.” </p><p>Her shock was apparent as she was finally forced to look at her expression in the mirror, contorted with pleasure. “N-no, sir,” she managed to murmur.</p><p>“Excellent,” I said, caressing her ass as a reward, which enhanced her pleasure further. “Now, tell me again, are you a slutty princess?” </p><p>It took a few seconds for her to answer, but she managed to utter her response without my pushing, even though she had to close her eyes, avoiding her own reflection. “Yes, sir. I’m a slutty princess,” she admitted, even though her own words made her tighten even more like she was trying to milk me. </p><p>“Keep your eyes open,” I ordered, and she did so, once again scandalized by the expression on her own reflection. “You’re such a good girl, getting tight and wet just for me,” I complimented her, once again shifting back to gentle caresses that contrasted with my furious pounding. She might be still too shy to admit it unprompted, but her body and her secretions were much more honest, shouting the feast of ecstasy she was experiencing. </p><p>Under all the factors that drove her arousal further, I wasn’t shocked when she climaxed barely a couple of minutes into our new position. Her arms trembled, threatening to topple her body, but I tightened my grip on her hair, both helping her to maintain her position, and keeping her alert with a jolt of pain. </p><p>“Please,” she gasped, asking for a moment’s rest, but I wasn’t willing to give that. </p><p>“You forgot something,” I reminded her. </p><p>“Please, sir,” she repeated, this time adding the required form of respect. I wasn’t intending to be a stickler on that, but if she was going to add that, I had no intention to let her get away with it. “I need to rest, just for a minute, please,” she begged. </p><p>“No,” I answered. “I don’t care how many times you cum, we’re not going to stop until I cum,” I added. </p><p>Her eyes widened, but that didn’t stop her moans of pleasure. However, a simple confident statement of mine was enough to destroy any past and future argument from her part, and she just took my impaling obediently, keeping her mouth shut. Or more accurately, trying to keep her mouth shut, as her body readily betrayed her, letting out an unending bevy of cries and moans, the occasional spank landing on her ass or hard pull of her hair only making them louder.</p><p>Seeing her obedience, I was tempted to push her even further, living up to my reputation as a Dark Lord. “You’re such a good princess, Aria,” I whispered mockingly. “Going all this trouble to better serve your amazing husband, Lancelot, even when he’s traversing out there with that slut, Isolde,” I mocked her, like what she had been doing wasn’t leagues worse than the suspicions about a possible dalliance. </p><p>“No, sir” she gasped, but despite her argument, being reminded of her own impending marriage only made her tighter. “I’m not a good princess,” she repeated. </p><p>“Of course not,” I said as I spanked her ass again. “Because you’re a slut princess. My slut princess until you marry.” Of course, I had no intention of letting her go even if I somehow fail to sabotage the wedding. Still, step by step. Despite our relationship, she was not at a point to admit it completely. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she gasped, drunk with pleasure, and conquered by her endless climaxes. As I landed spank after spank to her ass, marring the perfection that was good enough to win a prize, before finally letting my hand trail down to her thighs, squeezing them in contrast. </p><p>“Say it fully, I want to hear you admit it,” I ordered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she repeated even as she steadily climbed toward another climax. “I’m your obedient slut princess, and I’ll do everything you want until my wedding day,” she gasped. </p><p>“Again,” I asked, punctuating my order with another hard spank, and she repeated the statement again… Then, again and again, claiming the role of my slut princess… I wished I had the proper tools to record that, as one day, I would have loved to show that to Queen, driving that just how weak her heir was. </p><p>She was climaxing for the third time, her moans of pleasure mixed with sobs of desperation as she was overwhelmed with pleasure, her eyes closed, when I felt a trigger on the wards, but the effort I put on them paid off. A brief surge of concentration told me that the visitor was Emma, which meant there was no problem with the visitor. </p><p>When the cell door opened, it was immediately accompanied by a gasp of shock, but it came from Emma. Aria didn’t even notice our intruder, too far gone in pleasure. “Welcome,” I said without even bothering to turn, just making eye contact with the red-haired mage through the mirror. </p><p>“W-what!” Emma stammered in shock, which was a justified reaction. After all, while the scene she had walked on the day before wasn’t exactly an innocent one, it definitely was compared to this. Seeing the heir to the throne moaning like a back-alley whore was no doubt shocking to her. </p><p>“Sit down,” I said to Emma, pointing at the only chair in the room. “We will talk after I’m finished with our innocent princess,” I said to Emma while Aria continued her moans, her eyes firmly shut as she tried to stay conscious through another climax. Her legs trembled, and her arms finally declared their surrender, but I shifted my hands to her waist to pull her upright, her back pressing against my chest, and her lips covered with mine. </p><p>“Say hi to our guest,” I whispered, making her open her mouth. </p><p>After my prompting, Aria finally noticed that the number of guests had increased. </p><p>“No,” she exclaimed and used her hands to cover her face, which did little to lessen the impact of the moment. However, the more important part was the way she tightened, clamped enough to finally make me cum. She moaned in shame as I filled her insides again, under the gaze of Emma, who was far too shocked to say anything, watching helplessly from her chair… </p>
