        <p>Deciding on the next step was significantly more difficult than I had been expecting, especially with the constant tendrils of subtle mind control trying to invade my mind as I stood in front of the throne, triggering my anger significantly. And since I was strongly suspecting that Sapphire was not responsible for the existence of the ward, examining it was a critical thing, if only to know who deserved the dangerous explosion of the fury I was barely holding back. </p><p>Luckily, that didn’t mean I needed to neglect Sapphire in the process. </p><p>Thanks to my newest toy, the Tether of the Underworld. </p><p>For the rest of the night, I chose to neglect the Blade of Shadows —a thin, elegant, pure black blade adorned with black diamonds— letting it hang on my waist after sending a stream of magic through it to make sure it was the genuine article, and not a well-made copy. It took a moment for me to be satisfied with the results, and then I turned my attention to the Tether of the Underworld. </p><p>Even a glance was enough to tell the reason for its relative lack of fame among the great items that had been made famous by the Dark Lords that carried them. Unlike many such items, it was completely unassuming, barely to be distinguished by a thick piece of silk ribbon —though luckily, it was also pure black, giving a bit more gravitas. It was so simple that, for the first part of its reign, the opponents assumed it to be a simple part of its robes, according to the historical records. </p><p>Funnily enough, the name came from the second half, when people started to realize the lich was able to raise an army of zombies alone, far above what was assumed to be handled by a single necromancer, even one that abandoned its own mortality. Therefore, the name of Underworld was linked with the Tether forevermore. Unfortunately, when his rivals finally took him down, they were disappointed to realize that it was just a tool to increase the ease of setting up wards, and lich was using genius-level wards to handle armies of zombies centrally. </p><p>That technique was lost with the death of the lich, and Tether had become a relatively unimportant trophy in the hands of the next Dark Lord —who was a swordsman, therefore failing to understand the true implications of the tether— and after a few battles, it fell in the hands of the Empire, moving from one trophy room to another. </p><p>Shortsighted fools, I murmured even as wrapped the Tether around my left forearm before channeling my magic through its length, enjoying the enhanced clarity of perception. I didn’t aim at the mind control ward immediately, of course. No, I first targeted the defensive wards of the room, much bulkier by their nature, to get used to handling the item. </p><p>I didn’t want to destroy the subtle mind control ward by accident. It was my only clue to the target of my fury… </p><p>Luckily, multitasking wasn’t something outside my skill level. Even as I used my magic repeatedly on the defensive wards of the room to inspect their structure, I turned my real attention to the beautiful specimen of a woman in front of me. With her blonde flowing hair, blue eyes, and soft face, she was just as beautiful. </p><p>But the same couldn’t be said for the impassive dress she was wearing, hiding her beautiful curves in an attempt to enhance her authority. It was not something to be allowed, I thought even as closed the distance between us, standing in front of her as she sat on her throne. </p><p>“Our deal is complete, but how about a little fun before I leave,” I said as she shivered. My hands were already on the neck of her dress before she could get a word edgewise, and pulled hard, ripping it off with all the aggression of a barbarian invader who managed to fight its way to the throne room. </p><p>As her dress turned into scraps, her underwear was revealed. “Someone was prepared,” I said mockingly even as examined her corset and panties, both pure white, but that was the extent of their purity. The corset only had a modest cleavage, but that hardly mattered when it was completely made from lace, with big gaps across its surface to reveal most of her skin to my eyes. Her panties were a little better, barely more than a small piece of cloth connected by a thin string, struggling to contain her plump ass. </p><p>“You’re rather predictable in that aspect,” Sapphire said with a surprising nobility as she raised her head smugly, her tiara still shining on her head. After saying that, she raised her hand, about to remove the tiara from her head. </p><p>Only to be stopped by my fingers wrapping around her wrist. “No, keep it. Tonight, I want to fuck the Queen.”</p><p>Her expression of disagreement suggested that she didn’t agree with that, indicating that she was more comfortable with whoring herself in her dancer identity. Too bad for her that I had no intention of actually allowing that. </p><p>I grabbed her other wrist as well before pinning her arms against the throne, the silver and gold supplementing her own white and golden visage quite a bit. Her expression trembled under my dark arousal, like it was going to be our first time. </p><p>“W-wouldn’t you want me to serve you properly?” she whispered, the stammer in her tone too natural to be an act.  </p><p>“Oh, dear. You’re the Queen. It would be extremely rude to serve me. Let me serve you instead.” However, my tone, dark and domineering, didn’t agree with the meaning of my words. Nor my following action, pushing forward to capture her lips in an invading kiss, silencing her arguments with the strength of my tongue.</p><p>It was a special moment, I thought, taking the Queen of the Empire in the center of the power, on her own throne, still wearing her crown. </p><p>As I annexed her lips, however, she was surprisingly hesitant. Almost shy, to a degree that she never had when we were in the club. As if the crown in her head was forcing her to act much more reservedly. </p><p>It was a wonder what a change of environment could achieve. </p><p>When I finally pulled back, she was gasping for breath desperately, her pretty lips tantalizingly bruised with my aggressive kiss. “Such a lovely sight,” I murmured even as I leaned forward once more, my hands still around her wrists to pin her against her throne, but this time, my target was not her lips. </p><p>No, that honor went to her beautiful neck. I pressed my lips against her soft skin, kissing hard enough to leave a bright mark that would no doubt turn into a spectacular hickey without some healing magic. Her helpless moans, however, suggested that she wasn’t particularly broken up about the roughness of the treatment. </p><p>As I moved lower, her moans intensified further. </p><p>I could have easily destroyed her corset, its lacy texture was far too soft to actually create a barrier, but pulling it down roughly with my teeth, just ripping it enough to reveal one of her delicious nipples was a much better option. Ripped clothing fitted the theme much better nakedness, after all. </p><p>Her moans rose unbidden as my lips clasped around her nipple for a while, but I didn’t stay around there for long, Not when her legs widened reflexively, showing her out-of-control wetness. It was such a pity to neglect that, I decided. </p><p>Serving a woman between her legs as she sat on a throne was supposed to be an extremely subservient act, at least at first glance. That was, unless, you were a Dark Lord with great experience in reversing such situations. </p><p>I started by putting her wrists together in front of her, the Tether flying with a flick of my hand, its flight controlled magically. It wrapped around her forearms, the other part still connected with my wrist, rendering her hands useless while leaving my hands free, and used that freedom to grab her thighs, parting her legs even further. </p><p>However, as much as I enjoyed tying her up, the convenient availability of the Tether wasn’t the only reason I used that to tie her hands. No, I used that, because it gave me a convenient excuse to use my magic to check her connection with the wards undetected. Even if she did, I could use the excuse of trying to get used to a new item. </p><p>Not that she was in the mood of noticing that, not when her full attention was grabbed by the way I ripped off her panties before leaning forward and brushing her entrance with my tongue, giving myself an extended taste of her wetness. She just moaned as my tongue danced around her knob, making her suffer under a rush of pleasure. </p><p>That wasn’t all I did, of course. My tongue moved almost automatically as I teased her, while my mind was focused on channeling my magic stealthily, a task that was made much easier as she got distracted by her enhanced pleasure. She was far too occupied with her own body to notice my magical interference.</p><p>With that, I traced her magic, to understand which wards were under her direct control, even as I put a finger at her entrance, slipping inside even as my tongue danced around her knob mercilessly, invading her body with waves of pleasure. Her moans intensified as I slipped my finger into her wetness, followed quickly by a second one soon after, adding a shocked yelp to her song consisted entirely of moans. </p><p>Her back arched, pushing her beautiful tits up as she buried herself into her throne, her symbol of power irrevocably stained with her submission as she started shaking with pleasure. </p><p>As much as I enjoyed the way she tightened around my fingers, I didn’t want to miss the opportunity. As her control over her own magic loosened further, I increased my observation range… </p><p>Only to freeze when I noticed the connection between her and the mind control ward. I almost lashed out in a painful manner, ready to teach her the cost of daring to manipulate me, but surprised by the connection. </p><p>I would have probably reacted directly if it wasn’t for the Tether of the Underworld, allowing me to analyze the connection between her and the ward, quickly, before my anger reached the point of eruption.</p><p>How interesting, I thought even as I stood up once more, looking at the trembling figure of the Queen on her own throne, her crown deliciously askew. </p><p>The mind control ward was affecting her as well… Something was truly afoot… </p>
