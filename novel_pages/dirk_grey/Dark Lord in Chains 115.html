        <p>Trying to tease an elf directly was a terrible and unnecessary risk, I thought even as I whispered something into Aria’s ear. After all, not only they represented a great threat — Cinder giving me a good idea about their potential strength range as their cosmic rival — but I also had no idea the kind of unique tricks they could pull. </p><p>Cinder’s abilities relating to the living flame had certainly been eye-opening, and the less that was said about her miraculous transformation, the better. There was a high likelihood that, not only elves had similar abilities, but there was a chance that those abilities weren’t conveniently inaccessible due to a mental block. </p><p>After all, not all my enemies would be like Cinder, taking a risk just to prove herself… </p><p>Therefore, it was an unnecessary risk to push that mysterious elf. </p><p>Aria followed my request. “What a clumsy maid?” she gasped in scorn — well, as close as scorn as she could manage, which wasn’t particularly close, and her excitement made it even more unconvincing. “You deserve a punishment.” </p><p>A terrible and unnecessary risk, which didn’t mean I wouldn’t take it. The shock of the inexperience I had seen on her beautiful face was all that I needed to push my mysterious spy far harder than it was reasonable. </p><p>“A … punishment, my lady,” our spy gasped, which was also enough to reveal that there was a problem. Maids didn’t react to such words not with confusion but with pure panic. </p><p>“Do you want me to handle the punishment while you handle your important paperwork, my princess,” I whispered loudly even as I used my access to grope her. It was always fun to tease her, but the real reason was to give the elf a moment to process the upcoming situation. I didn’t want her to react in panic, but considered it slowly. </p><p>Luckily, my earlier threat about targeting whoever arranging her access seemed to work, as, despite her blush, she stayed in place. </p><p>“Good idea,” Aria answered after some delay, and I slid out of my seat, and started walking toward our spy, her eyes widening. Too much, meaning I needed to relax her. </p><p>“A spanking is enough, right, my princess? After all, no need to push the poor maid too much,” I said, and saw our spy relax once Aria nodded, watching the situation enthusiastically. </p><p>Not surprising after the passion she displayed while she punished Emma. </p><p>I turned my attention back to our spy, her amateurish nature when it came to the subject couldn’t be more apparent. Her gaze darting was enough to make her thoughts visible, and the loosening of her expression admitted that she was willing to accept the punishment unless things escalated too much. </p><p>Her choice of illusion spell to show her expression while hiding her unique features made it even easier to hide it. </p><p>As I closed in, she reacted predictably tense, giving me the impression that if I dared to grab her arm, I would end up in a spell on the face. I needed to give her a bit of control even as I punished her, I decided as I sat down. </p><p>And patted my lap, inviting her to walk on her own. She froze, standing silently. I might have already gotten bored if I didn’t feel the thumping of her magic softly, showing that her power was considerable. </p><p>It worked excellently when mixed with her incredible beauty, and the maid uniform wasn’t exactly boring either. The contrast was particularly impressive. Her face contorted in confusion, but didn’t act. </p><p>Aria looked at me, ready to push, but I gestured for her to stay silent. She just accepted, with no problem. </p><p>For a minute, she stood in front of me, with her hands wringing the hem of her skirt — though I hardly needed that to read the intensity of her nervousness. Only when I was sure she wouldn’t react, I spoke. “Come on, sweetie, you don’t want to ignore the order of your princess, do you?” </p><p>That move finally extorted a step, which turned into two, and soon, she started walking. Slowly and hesitantly, but walking nonetheless. </p><p>The only thing that was not on her face was fear, confident in her magical power that there was no risk. After all, she was in the same room with a princess famous for her healing only, and her boy toy. </p><p>What harm could such a useless man bear, right?</p><p>I decided to tease her a bit more. Just as she was about to bend over, I gestured to the door. “Actually, why don’t you go and pour me a drink before we start,” I offered. </p><p>And, just like that, I saw what I was hoping for. A spark of anger, an emotion that was easy to convert into a passion. “Of course, sir,” she said between her clenched teeth. </p><p>She turned and walked toward the door, but before she could leave the room, I called her again. “Actually, scratch that, I don’t want to spill it. You can bring one after your punishment.” </p><p>The frustration on her face was beautiful. She started walking once more without saying anything, leaving me with the pleasure of pointlessly ordering someone that could probably dismantle the palace as long as I was not committed to defending it. </p><p>I didn’t call it playing with fire, but only because it would be unfair to Cinder. </p><p>While she walked toward me, I cast a spell to drag a thick ruler from Aria’s desk, which made our spy’s lips curl in disdain. Considering the ruler was flapping in the air helplessly, not an absurd reaction. </p><p>She would feel safer with such an incompetent display of magic. A completely inaccurate sense, of course, which was the reason I displayed it, but it worked well with my earlier ‘mistake’. </p><p>As she stood in front of me, trying to hide her disdain toward an incompetent human noble, I patted my lap. “Come here, sweetie,” I ordered. </p><p>She was hesitant, but didn’t dally much before she finally lay on my lap, facing toward Aria. “Good maid,” I called as I landed the ruler on her ass. </p><p>One that she took to her naked skin, leaving a lingering sensation of sting behind. One that was just a touch excessive for a blow, and might or might not include some very subtle tantric manipulation. </p><p>Her mouth opened in shock, but she didn’t cry. “Good girl,” I said as I used the ruler on her ass again, the skirt and the underwear working hard to blunt the impact. </p><p>“Two,” she admitted. </p><p>“Start from one, honey. Don’t tell me you can’t count,” I said with excessive dismissiveness. </p><p>The way she trembled in anger on my lap was beautiful, though the pure venom in her tone suggested I was pushing my luck too much. “One.” </p><p>“Good maid,” I said, with no need to fake the amusement I was feeling, aware that she misunderstood the source significantly. </p><p>She counted the blows to her bottom with increasing frustration, missing the fact that it was just a little distraction. My other hand was on her back, lingering lazily like I was trying to keep her in place. I didn’t press hard, just lingering. </p><p>Testing if my little elf was aware enough to notice as I carefully explored her sensitive spots, tantric allowing me to observe her mood accurately. None of those lingering touches left any impact that was worthy of memorizing, but it allowed me to create a pleasure map of her beautiful body… </p><p>A map that I started to put to use as we reached the double-digit numbers, accidentally letting my finger on the more sensitive areas, her neck, her left shoulder, and other innocent areas, building the basis for the future. </p><p>I didn’t usually work that hard to break spies, but I was willing to make an exception for the sexy elf on my lap. </p><p>Even better was her reaction. She started shuffling on my lap, too amateurish to actually hide her frustration with her own reaction — along with a shocking dose of shame that confirmed her lack of experience when it came to matters of the flesh. </p><p>She wasn’t as innocent as Aria — well, not as much as she had been in the beginning, as the way she watched us hungrily, not even bothering to fix her dress certainly didn’t shout innocence — but then, very rare was as innocent. </p><p>Still, she was handling herself nicely, until I shifted and my erection pressed against her stomach. Her eyes widened in shock, barely holding back a shocked gasp, and for the first time, I had to use my other hand to keep her in place. </p><p>“Calm down, sweetie, it’s not you, it’s the beautiful princess over there,” I whispered into her ear. Just another comment to further flame her anger, which would hopefully make her ignore the absurdity of the situation as I pushed forward. </p><p>Of course, assuming I pushed for more… </p>
