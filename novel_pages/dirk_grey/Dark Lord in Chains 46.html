        <p>Coming to a decision about the mind-control was actually challenging. After coming to a conclusion that Sapphire wasn’t responsible for it, I was ready to leave it for a later date and focus on having fun with Sapphire, but the fact that it was targeting Sapphire as well for an unknown purpose, however, changed things. </p><p>I needed to discuss that with her, even at the expense of revealing a few cards, one being the proper usage of the Tether of the Underworld, the item that I had just haggled successfully. </p><p>Fortunately, I knew exactly how to keep her focused on the proper part, I thought even as I pulled back, leaving her trembling helplessly on her throne after the latest orgasm given by my aggressive tongue. </p><p>Before she could gather herself, I hovered above her once more, this time replacing my tongue with my shaft. “Are you ready to get properly fucked on your throne, Your Imperial Highness?” I said, even as I grabbed her breasts, squeezing hard. </p><p>“I need a minute-” she started, only for my lips to close around hers, silencing her with another kiss. Her hips rose automatically, giving me an excellent angle to slip inside. I used the opportunity, impaling aggressively, enough that her singular moan echoed in the room despite my lips desperately trying to silence her. </p><p>Then, the sound of flesh colliding joined the music as I impaled her mercilessly, my body weight pinning her underneath. It wasn’t a particularly inspired position, I might say, boring even, but sometimes, the moment was perfect enough spicing it further. </p><p>And a busty blonde Queen, being rammed repeatedly on her throne with my body pressed over hers, while her wrists still tied helplessly, certainly qualified. </p><p>As she built up toward another orgasm, my fingers squeezing her tits, it was the worst time to discuss something serious. Especially when she was too distracted even to use her Tantric abilities trying to convert me. Naturally, I chose that moment to actually mention the serious problem we were facing. </p><p>“Thank you for the Tether, by the way,” I said even as I rose a bit, lifting the pressure from her body, though I continued to slam into her, building up the pleasure to a new level. “It’s a very helpful item in my line of business, allowing me to decipher all kinds of wards. A true treasure.” </p><p>“I -” she started, only to fade into a moan as I sank even deeper into her, her tits dancing erotically with each push. “I’m glad,” she managed to complete. “Maybe you’re willing to discuss the Eternal Core.” </p><p>“Maybe,” I said. “But not before I make a demonstration of the tether,” I said even as I flared my magic, connecting to hers through the convenient connection of the tether. “It’s perfect for finding hidden wards, for example. Watch carefully,” I said as I carefully empowered the mind-controlling ward. </p><p>At first glance, it seemed like a horrible idea to reinforce a hostile ward, but dealing with the mind was a delicate thing. Tripling its power only made it weaker, making it much easier to detect its mental touch. Not to mention, it also contrasted its structure against the rest of the ward scheme, showing just how intricately it was woven into the rest of the wards, impossible to construct in just a day or two. </p><p>Or in a few minutes, making it impossible for her to suspect me. </p><p>“How can it be!” Sapphire gasped as she turned what remained from her attention to the wards, realizing the mental manipulation she had been suffering, her anger no less than mine. </p><p>Such beautiful anger was not to be wasted, I decided even as I pulled out while simultaneously casting a cleaning and lubrication spell on her puckered hole before pressing my shaft against her tightness, invading aggressively enough to add a dash of pain to her furious gasp. </p><p>“Well, Your Imperial Highness,” I said even as I pulled the tether just to remind her of the current situation even as I invaded her beautiful booty aggressively, enjoying the tightness as I slid even deeper. “It’s your throne room, you should be the one to understand what’s going on,” I said. </p><p>“Interesting ward, though,” I said even as I examined it, unable to prevent a frown from appearing on my face despite the spectacular pleasure I was experiencing. As I enhanced its power, the structure of the ward became much easier to analyze, but that only brought in more questions. </p><p>“How so?” she managed to ask even as I continued to invade her ass, stretching her for my pleasure. </p><p>“First of all, the construction of the ward was almost nothing I had seen before, and not just in terms of application,” I explained. “Even the most common basics of the ward are almost completely unfamiliar. The style of it reminds me of some of the ancient wards, but it’s just that, a limited familiarity. Let alone finding the caster, I have no idea which region they came from.” </p><p>“That whore Fernhand! She has to be the one responsible!” Sapphire stated, anger flaring on her face to mix into her pleasure, making her even sexier in the process. </p><p>“Impossible,” I said. “If she had ward masters in that capability, she would have taken your throne and sold you to a third-rate brothel already,” I answered, a reminder she clearly didn’t appreciate. But a slap on her plump bottom was enough to cut any argument she might have about that statement. “You’ll understand when I talk about its effects.” </p><p>“What are those,” she asked, but despite all her attempts to be serious, her body started to rebel under the rush of pleasure. Her back arched, displaying her beautiful tits to my hungry glare.   </p><p>“It’s pretty interesting. The first part is relatively straightforward, subtly reinforcing loyalty toward the throne for anyone that stands in front of the throne,” I said. She looked confused at first. I continued. “Toward the throne, whomever that might occupy the throne at that moment…”</p><p>Her eyes widened as she understood the implications of what I was talking about, though it might be about my shaft, going even deeper into her ass. I continued explaining. “There’s also the part that trying to make you lose your fascination for being the Queen, but it’s clearly not affecting you like it was supposed to. Your defenses must be amazing.” </p><p>“T-thanks,” she said, which would have been touching if it wasn’t for everything else that was going on. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t her defenses that were keeping the effects away. No, it was her tantric magic, or more accurately, the side effects of her magic, accidentally purging the effects by enflaming her desires, which included the desire for power. </p><p>It was amazing news. Not because I particularly cared just how much Sapphire was willing to defend her throne — it was her problem — but it was evidence that whomever responsible for casting didn’t know about Sapphire’s tantric abilities. </p><p>And that meant their information was limited. Always a convenient thing in a potential enemy. </p><p>“Who could have cast a ward if not the rebels?” Sapphire managed to ask, with rather an impressive difficulty with my shaft invading her ass repeatedly. </p><p>“Well, good question, but unfortunately, that information is not a part of the wide range of products I’m offering,” I answered even as I spanked her ass, enjoying the ripples. I didn’t bother to restrain myself too much as well, adding another layer to her pain. </p><p>“How much would it cost for you to get that information,” she offered. </p><p>“I’m not sure you know what you’re asking for, Your Imperial Majesty,” I said even as I pushed. “We’re talking about an active force that was strong enough to actually sneak into your throne room, set up a ward that went unnoticed for a long time, likely for years, and currently still active. It’s a bit different than selling the assets of a defeated dark lord, as you can imagine. Would you be willing to pay the cost?”</p><p>“What would it cost?” she answered between her moans. </p><p>“I can’t give you a price yet, not before I could identify who is responsible. The stronger they are, the more it would cost. But to a start, I would have a magical item, just as a retainer fee. the Shield of the Ether, for example.” </p><p>“That’s nonsense-” she started, only be interrupted by a moan as I twisted her nipple, forcing another moan. Then, before she could gather her breath, my lips landed over hers, silencing her with another heated kiss as I continued to drill mercilessly. </p><p>Her reaction to my offer was understandable. After all, unlike the previous items I had mentioned, the Shield of Ether was not one of the items that belonged to previous dark lords. Instead, it belonged to one of the most famous heroes in history, used to defend the Empire against dangerous threats. “That’s the deal, sweetheart,” I said as I rammed inside her repeatedly, waiting for her answer. </p><p>If it wasn’t she had already sacrificed too much to earn my cooperation, she would have definitely rejected that. “I accept, but only after you discover their identity,” she countered. </p><p>I pulled out suddenly, leaving her gasping, only to thrust inside her even more aggressively. “No deal, Your Imperial Majesty,” I said, once again using her title mockingly, not that under the circumstances, it could be called extreme. She whimpered. “That’s not how retainer works.” </p><p>“Can’t I offer something else?” she said. “It’ll be a disaster if it disappears. Money, other items. I’m willing to give three items from the vault instead of the Shield.” </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I said with a sudden shift in tone. “I want the shield not just because I want to make a lot of money,” I said. “The construction of the ward makes it clear that our mysterious enemy is really capable of using magic. Having a shield famous for resisting magical attacks even with overwhelming strength is the bare minimum I need to take the risk of spying on them. Or, you can trust your court mages, who failed to detect this for years…” </p><p>She fell silent — discounting the endless moans I continued to ram inside her. “You win,” she uttered a couple of minutes later, her voice tinged with pleasure. </p><p>The endless pleasures of sex were an excellent source of bargaining leverage. Now, all I needed to do was to decide what to do next… </p>
