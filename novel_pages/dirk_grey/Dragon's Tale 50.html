        <p>I was planning to finish the dinner without making a major move, when I noticed Olivia’s excited gaze was sliding down to my hand, which was still around the thigh of the brunette girl from an Equites family —one I was yet to learn her name despite our closeness. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t the only one that noticed it. Marcus, the boy who had thought himself to be my competitor, noticed that detail due to extra attention he was paying on the hostess of the evening, preparing to lash out. </p><p>Olivia’s attraction gave me a rather indecent idea to prove myself to her. Or more accurately, it gave me an opportunity, because with all the training I was going through, I was feeling horny, and squeezing the tight body of a noble lady who was doing her best to rub her body against mine wasn’t exactly helping me to keep my calm. The only problem was the crowd of annoying males, who would no doubt try to push me away if I dared to make an open move. </p><p>Luckily, their fragile egos gave me the option I needed. “So, boys,” I said after finishing another story. “How about a drinking game, so that you can show me the famous strength of the Roman nobles,” I said, both my words and my tone filled with an exaggerated superiority. Just what I needed to trigger a bunch of hotheaded youths. </p><p>“You-” Marcus started angrily, only to be interrupted by Olivia. </p><p>“What an excellent idea,” she said. “Don’t you think so, Marcus?”</p><p>“I don’t think competing with a barbarian means anything,” Marcus answered tersely. </p><p>“Don’t worry boy, I can compete against all of you together, unless you’re scared of even that, of course,” I said with a hearty laugh. Making an enemy of so many little nobles might cut some of the probabilities, but it would also give me a reputation among the female part of the noble population. And rather than entertaining a bunch of noble teenagers with fragile egos, I would prefer sampling the flowers of upper society. </p><p>“Arrogant barbarian,” Marcus growled as he quickly filled his glass with wine and drained it up immediately. </p><p>I just smirked as I gestured to the noble girl I was currently caressing, and she filled my glass with a shocked yet aroused giggle. Just because she was trying to impress Olivia didn’t mean she was unaffected by my skilled touches. </p><p>Making a noble girl serve me wine worked perfectly to incense the other boys in the room, and they joined the game with great fervor, only to fall rather quickly as I used a simple spell to strengthen their alcohol, before they even realized just how far they had gone. </p><p>It barely took ten minutes. </p><p>“I can’t say I’m impressed,” I said even as I grabbed the ass of the noble girl that was serving me during the competition and pulled her on my lap, lodging my raging arousal between her asscheeks, showing my intention fully. “So, my noble ladies, is there any chance I could show you how my tribe rewards a victorious hero?” I said even as I slipped my hand under her skirt, brushing her wetness. </p><p>Not all noblewomen were interested in that. Some were clearly shocked by the initiative I was showing, while some were interested, they watched the situation with someone who was watching a forest fire —a spectacular view, but not to get closer.</p><p>There were two exceptions —well, three counting the enthusiastic social climber that was rubbing herself against my lap. Olivia, that delicious redhead who was currently hosting the party, and another blonde girl that was standing next to her all night. Adding to the sexy brunette on my lap, it represented a delicious spread. </p><p>And just when one of the others was about to interject, Olivia spoke with a sharp tone that belied no argument. “Sounds interesting, show me,” she said, unable to hide the shine of interest in her eyes. </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I said, not bothering to hide my mocking gaze even as I grabbed the dress of the brunette and ripped it off with a sharp pull, worthy of a barbarian. It earned a couple of shocked cries, and some of the women had already left the place, but with Olivia taking a step closer to get a better view, no one tried to stop me as I freed my shaft from my pants.</p><p>However, the shocked gasps they let out earlier were nothing as I suddenly pushed her off my lap to the floor, grabbed her head, and pulled her closer to me. Her eyes widened in shock, but her desire to struggle was abandoned quickly as Olivia gasped in appreciation, which contrasted greatly with the scandalized gasps the rest let out. </p><p>Clearly, in their mind, playing with a barbarian was one thing, and being treated as a slave was something much different. </p><p>The brunette opened her mouth obediently and I grabbed her head, skewering her with my length mercilessly. “So rough, so strong,” Olivia murmured in appreciation as she took a step closer despite her blonde friend’s attempts to grab her arm and keep her in place. “Make it a good show, Cera,” she then added, finally giving me the name of the sexy brunette I had I had been molesting for a while. </p><p>I kept one hand on Cera’s head while letting the other drop-down around her tits, mauling them hard enough to leave a soft pink mark. It wasn’t the best way to tease a girl under normal circumstances, but it fit my barbarian warrior persona perfectly. Though from the stuffed moans Cera was letting out, she didn’t seem like she was particularly minding. </p><p>“Why not come closer for a better view, mistress,” I said as I looked at Olivia, once again pronouncing the last word with a mocking edge. But my disrespect was clearly making Olivia feel even more aroused, her nipples visibly pushing against her silky dress. </p><p>Olivia just smiled confidently before shrugging the grasp of her blonde friend before she slowly walked closer, her breaths getting noticeably shallower despite her best efforts to keep it even to create an impassive demeanor. Her friend just followed her helplessly. Meanwhile, Cera’s lips were desperately wrapped around my shaft as used her mouth as a hole to relieve my barbarian desires. </p><p>I didn’t bother to suppress my moans and gasps, which only worked to enhance my domineering barbarian aura. Despite Cera’s obvious lack of skills —giving blowjobs were certainly something that was supposed to be below those nobles women— the hotness of her mouth was delicious. My iron grip around her head, determining the pace perfectly, only enhanced those sensations. </p><p>However, the fact that I could sense her arousal climbing up with a noticeable speed made it even better. Just a minute later, her tongue joined our little game as an active participant, moving around instinctively. I started fucking her throat even deeper, seeking true satisfaction… </p><p>Then, I noticed something even more interesting. Despite their initial reluctance, the outer edge of observers had walked closer, their legs rubbing against each other in a suspicious manner. Apparently, it wasn’t just Cera or Olivia who had fantasies about rough treatment from barbarian gladiators. </p><p>As a noble scion myself, I decided that it was my task to properly fulfill the wishes of those repressed noble ladies who had worked hard every day to consume the riches of the Republic! I let Cera pull out for a moment, and while she used that to catch her breath, I grabbed her waist and pulled her to my lap, and without a warning, skewered her with my girth. </p><p>The moan she let out as she swallowed my full length without prior preparation was simply spectacular. Luckily, she was wet enough after extended foreplay during the drinking game. Her tunnel trapped my girth, doing its best to extract its reward, while I grabbed her waist with both hands, and forced her to move at a spectacular speed. </p><p>Around, I could see that the women that surrounded me were already on the edge, so I cheated a bit by letting my aura slip out, adding another layer to my domineering presence. After that, I wasn’t surprised to see the surrounding crowd taking the seat at the nearest available surface, their hands immediately disappearing under their dress. </p><p>The effect on Olivia and her blonde friend was even more spectacular. They both watched the moving body of Cera. Olivia was already lost in anticipation, trembling excitedly. Her friend was slightly better, her eyes still carrying a dose of panic that struggled to survive under the rush of pleasure. </p><p>Still, her alertness wasn’t enough to prevent me from grabbing her arm and pulling her to the seat next to me, much to her panic, and much to Olivia’s perverted amusement. She tried to stand up, only to find out that my hold on her arm was not just a suggestion. “Olivia-” she tried to gasp, only to be silenced by my lips, aggressively stealing a kiss. </p><p>When I pulled back, she had a dazed expression on her face. Olivia just exploded in laughter. “Such an interesting way to lose your first kiss,” she commented even as she took a seat on the other side of her blonde friend, helping me to keep her in place. </p><p>A brunette social-climber that bitten more than she could chew, a surprisingly inexperienced blonde considering her social class, and a redhead who was still significantly overestimating her ability to control the situation, not to mention several other ladies of high status who was currently busy fingering themselves at the sight of me violating their equally-noble peers. </p><p>The house visit was shaping to be even more interesting than I had expected… </p>
