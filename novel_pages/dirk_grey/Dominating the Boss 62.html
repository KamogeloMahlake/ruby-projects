        <p>Charlie tried to catch Umi’s gaze as she stood up to take her seat once more. He succeeded for a moment. “T-try to p-play along,” he said. “The game is almost over.” </p><p>Umi gave him a dismissive nod, not even bothering to look at him, her gaze firmly on Tiffany, whose success had annoyed her immensely. It didn’t surprise me. Charlie wasn’t doing particularly well in the respect department earlier, but his actions during the game had ruined any hope she might have for the aim. </p><p>Instead, she sat on my lap, and started rocking wildly, but this time, she didn’t pull her skirt up. </p><p>I didn’t ask her to. It didn’t matter, when Tiffany readily ruined our fun whenever things started to escalate. Of course, I could have asked Tiffany to stop doing that, but watching their petty argument was entertaining enough. </p><p>Also, as amusing as it had been taking their wives while they had been distracted with their effort to earn my favor, the poker game was getting stale. At this point, they were too drunk for it to be entertaining. </p><p>So, I started playing the game more seriously. Even if they weren’t drunk and the dealer wasn’t cheating in my favor, I would have won easily, but with those factors in, I managed to conceal my victory in a couple of wild hands, earning back what I put in, and even won ten thousand from them, leaving them looking at the table with gaping expression. </p><p>“I think that’s all for me,” I said as I stood up, though I made a show of stumbling. “Everything is getting blurry,” I added, then looked at their chips. “But don’t interrupt your fun for me,” I said. </p><p>“Actually, we—” Mark started, but I continued talking. A benefit of acting drunk. </p><p>“Since you two entertained me this much, let me add something to sweeten the pot. I’ll give the winner the right to take a sales region from the loser.” With that, I started walking toward the bathroom. </p><p>“Actually, I will go visit the kitchen, we need more drinks,” Umi said, which was objectively not true. My bottle was almost finished, but with most of it poured into the fake potted plant, I didn’t need to replenish it. Mark and Charlie still had some in their bottles, but they were in no condition to continue it. </p><p>However, Charlie just nodded absentmindedly, too focused on recovering their losses. </p><p>Tiffany, who had put some of her clothing back on in the process, looked at Umi. “Maybe you should deal the cards while I find them. It might be hard to find them,” she said. </p><p>“No need. I can handle it,” Umi said, a naughty smile blooming on her face as she walked faster, thinking that she won in their game of ‘Musical chairs - Naughty edition’, not realizing Tiffany was just goading her. </p><p>Umi accompanied me to the end of the corridor, trying to look calm, but the moment we reached the end of the corridor, she pressed her finger against my lips and grabbed my wrist. “Follow me,” she said, trying to sound authoritative, which was only as successful as a beautiful fluffy kitten trying to look threatening after watching a documentary about lions.  </p><p>And, just as adorable. </p><p>Amused by her attempt, I followed her, even when she dragged me toward the back entrance to the garden, gesturing to me to be silent. </p><p>I followed her as she opened the door, and we found ourselves in a well-maintained garden. “So,” I whispered. “Are you in the mood for some open-air fun?” </p><p>“No, we’re going to my apartment,” she said. “Tiffany had all the fun she needed. For the rest of the night, she can deal with two drunks.” </p><p>Who was I to refuse such a beautiful offer, at least in terms of leaving the place? I wasn’t as sure about visiting her apartment, but that part, we could negotiate later. </p><p>It took a while for us to circle around the house, mostly because I chose to steal a few kisses while we sneaked around. However, once we arrived at the car, I noticed a surprise. A large blanket in the back seat. One that wasn’t here before. </p><p>Excited by her ‘successful’ escape, Umi missed that. I was curious just how long it would take for her to notice it. “Why don’t you drive while I closed my eyes for a while,” I asked her even as I went to sit in the backseat. “Also, drive to my house,” I said, not wanting to stuff myself into her tiny bed, which might be enough for two people, but I suspected we would need more.   </p><p>“Yes, sir,” Umi said as I settled in the backseat, and turned off the internal lights. The backseat wasn’t pitch black, but it was dark enough. So, Umi didn’t notice that, once I sat down, the blanket moved slightly, but I was able to see the red strands of hair slipping out. </p><p>I wondered just how long it would take for Umi to realize her sneaky escape attempt wasn’t as successful. </p><p>Once her head was safely blocked by the seat, Tiffany let the blanket slip just enough to reveal her face. She looked up, biting her lip before glancing down at my growing bulge, her expression naughty. I chuckled even as I freed my shaft, happy to play along once again. </p><p>Tiffany’s intention was clear. Umi tried to sneak around, and Tiffany was teaching her how it was done. I didn’t know what she said to disappear from the house, nor did I care other than a momentary curiosity. </p><p>“Do you mind turning on the music, sweetie,” I asked Umi. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she accepted readily, her smile beautiful as she rode the high of her success, unaware that Tiffany had countered her ploy beautifully. Her lips were already around my cock, bobbing her head enthusiastically, trusting the combined effect of the music and engine sound to keep her rumbling moans hidden. </p><p>Umi didn’t notice it. The relative darkness and the seat blocking her view were two smaller reasons, but the real reason was her driving. She wasn’t a bad driver. On the contrary, she was a very good driver, and a very careful one. </p><p>It worked against her right now. As she focused on the road, she missed the occasional movement of the blanket, just as she failed to register its presence. After a few minutes, Tiffany looked at me, a naughty smile on her face as she prepared to escalate. </p><p>Luckily, the beautiful imported sedan I used had a lot of legroom for comfort by design. Coupled with the fact that Umi wasn’t the tallest driver, so pulled the seat forward quite a bit, there was enough space for Tiffany to shift there. </p><p>She did so while the car was moving. Umi didn’t notice. I certainly did, particularly since, as the blanket slid off, Tiffany revealed that her presence wasn’t the only surprise. </p><p>She wasn’t even wearing a stitch. </p><p>Naughty, I thought even as I watched Tiffany’s naked body get between me and the seat, her naked beauty particularly alluring as we hid from Umi. It added to our fun. </p><p>It was already entertaining enough, then Tiffany reached under the blanket, and pulled out her phone. She typed a quick message, but her head continued bobbing. I didn’t try to read who she texted, but a second later, Umi’s phone, which she was using as a GPS device, had a little message notification, solving that particular mystery. </p><p>Umi smirked when she saw the notification, but she only sent a message when we stopped for a red light — which she didn’t pass despite the road being empty at this hour. They texted quite a bit. I didn’t have any problems with it, considering that, unlike Umi, Tiffany had no trouble multitasking.  </p><p>Though, comparing them wasn’t fair. Unlike texting and driving, there never had been a campaign against texting and sucking. </p><p>Or, deep-throating.  </p><p>“Who were you texting?” I asked. </p><p>“Tiffany,” Umi answered smugly. “She is wondering where we are.” </p><p>“And, what did you say?” </p><p>“I told her that she might have been lucky during the game, but mere luck couldn’t win against strategic thinking and preparation.” </p><p>“That’s certainly true. Strategic thinking and guile deserve a reward,” I said even as I grabbed Tiffany’s hair and pushed her down even more, invading her throat. Umi smiled, thinking that it was a compliment she earned. </p><p>With no traffic, the drive didn’t last particularly long. Soon, we were at my garage. Umi stepped out to open my door, even after everything, willing to prove that she was an excellent secretary.  </p><p>I admired her commitment to perfection. Most secretaries, after everything we had done, would have assumed that their real job description was optional. Umi seemed to be a perfectionist enough to pick another direction. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>Too bad her diligence wasn’t rewarded. When she opened the door,  she was met with a surprise. Tiffany, wearing nothing, doing her best to suffocate herself with my girth. </p><p>Umi gasped as I let Tiffany pull back. “W-why are you here?” Umi gasped in shock. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie. You are right in saying that mere luck couldn’t win against strategic thinking and preparation,” Tiffany said as she stepped out of the car, standing in front of Umi in her full glory.  “Too bad I’m better than you at that as well…” </p>
