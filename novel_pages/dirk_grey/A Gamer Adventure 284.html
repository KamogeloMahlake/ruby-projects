        <p>Seldanna said nothing as I wrapped my arms around her divine being, not that words were necessary to convey her feelings. The way she trembled under my arms was enough. </p><p>I said nothing as well, just leaned down to snuggle to the nape of her neck, taking a deep breath, enjoying the novel nature of her new smell, which was a mind-bending mixture of the most beautiful flowers imaginable, intoxicating in its nature, enough to reveal her divine nature.</p><p>I delivered a soft, lingering kiss on her neck, and she shivered helplessly. I enjoyed her warmth against my chest even as I felt the beautiful texture of her skin, her beauty was truly unmatched. Admittedly, even the dress of leaves she had conjured for herself had an unmatched softness, adding a nice texture, yet not blowing her body from my touch.  </p><p>It seemed that godhood had other perks that were near unlimited power and dominion, one that was even more interesting for me. </p><p>“So, my goddess,” I whispered after I kissed her neck again, enjoying the way she reacted to my barest touch, showing that I wasn’t the only one enjoying the more carnal benefits of her transformation. “We have played enough. Do you think it’s finally the time to celebrate your successful elevation?” </p><p>She shivered, catching my gaze, her desire burning even more than I expected. “Yes, worship me,” she whispered, though her needy tone contrasted with the haughty nature her words tried to reflect. </p><p>“As you wish, my goddess,” I answered. I was tempted to teach her the mistake of trying to order me around —  the fun way, of course — but after some thought, I decided to follow her direction. After all, not only she had become an actual goddess, but also she defeated the Avatar of an enemy god. </p><p>More than enough to earn some rare preferential treatment. </p><p>“Wait, really?” she whispered, showing that even with all the power,  she was unused to her authority. It was good, as I had no intention of letting her get arrogant. </p><p>Playful obedience, however, was a different matter.  </p><p>“You’re a goddess, Seldanna,” I whispered as I tightened my grip around her waist, pulling her closer. “Who am I to reject your holy decree?” </p><p>She let out a dismissive chuckle at the misleading nature of my words. Understandable, as my full erection was leaning between her cheeks. Hardly a move that conveyed respect.</p><p>However, while Seldanna mocked my words with a giggle, she made no move to extract herself from that position; unless the way she was moving her body slowly up and down was a way to slowly free herself from my domineering grasp. </p><p>While I played with her, I cast a spell, slowly lowering us to the ground, where a huge bed made of leaves appeared. I let her go from my hold, and she lay on her back immediately, her rapid movement revealing her desperate desire, enough to destroy the dignified aura she wanted to cultivate. </p><p>And, if her blush was any evidence, she realized that after she ended up on her back. “Undress me,” she ordered, trying to sound haughty to compensate for her earlier slip, but it made her look even cuter instead.</p><p>“As you wish, my goddess,” I said as I leaned above her, and put my hands on her dress that was made of thousands of leaves, and removed one piece. Then another, and another… each enhancing her impatience further. </p><p>So, before I could even reach two-digit numbers, her dress suddenly parted open, timed to look like my touch had removed a critical piece, revealing her breasts, which looked even more incredible after her transformation. </p><p>Alluring enough to change my mind about slowly teasing her. I leaned forward, enjoying her gaze filled with excitement getting more intense as I got closer. Unfortunately, that eye contact didn’t last long. </p><p>Fortunately, the alternative was even better. I buried my head into the glorious valley between her breasts, licking them slowly, their taste more spectacular than the most amazing nectar imaginable. </p><p>Seldanna let out a moan of pleasure … which had some interesting effects. Some of the effects, like the ones that had on my body, were perfectly understandable. As her needy moan hit my ear, I felt my body burn with an intense desire. It almost felt like a magical compulsion, and if I didn’t know my own body intimately when it came to that subject, I might have actually believed it. </p><p>But it was my own body, treating her moan as a delicious sustenance. At first, I thought that it was just an illusion, but as I closed my eyes to feel the energies of my body — without stopping the dance of my lips over her amazing breasts, naturally — I realized that it was actually the case. The Divine Spark in my body building a connection with hers. </p><p>It was a soft connection, with the potential to grow further. But I didn’t panic, as I recognized the unique nature of the Companion bond.  The details were different without the System to modify it … but I could feel deep inside me that it was the true form of Companion Connection, and the System-Assisted version was a watered-down variant. </p><p>A nice finding, I thought as I continued licking her breasts, my fingers caressing her stomach to make her tremble sexily. She moaned again, and the effect triggered once more.</p><p>This time, I turned my attention to the external effects, which were not about me, at least not directly. I had already detected that, as a Goddess, she had some kind of connection with the land itself. It was the same kind of connection that the memories of the old god showed. </p><p>I just didn’t know if it was something unique to Nature Spark, or something that was integral to every god, my information was extremely limited. The avatar of the necromancer god didn’t have such a connection,  but that didn’t mean much. </p><p>In the end, one thing was certain. Seldanna’s connection with the land getting stronger was a good thing. It would allow her to use her power remotely with much greater efficiency, which was the greatest advantage of the gods and goddesses. Even I couldn’t do that. </p><p>I had my own tricks, like the one that I used with the God Forest, but I realized that it only worked because there was no god in the fragmented plain at that moment. If I tried to replicate the same trick while using Nature Spark, Seldanna could block it easily, and even if I used another Spark, it would end up with a bitter struggle where she held a great, incredible advantage. </p><p>Since I could still be confident in escaping if Seldanna ever changed her mind, rather than doing the silly thing and interfering, I helped her further by creating a hidden ward in the Aether dimension, one that would convert Aether particles into pure mana and feed it to her — while also conveniently getting rid of remaining necrotic mana in the Aether Dimension. </p><p>Well, I didn’t feed it to her but to the God Forest, not willing to distract her from her amazing state, but practically, it was the same thing. It quickened her bonding with the land several times without interrupting her fun. </p><p>And, speaking of her fun, she let out a spectacular moan as I took her nipple between my lips, my tongue teasing it. The resulting moans were spectacular enough to convince me to focus on our pleasure,  ignoring everything else. </p><p>My fingers danced more aggressively on her stomach, making her tremble under my fingers. She opened her mouth to say something, but only a moan escaped her pretty lips. “So, my goddess, are you enjoying my worship?” I whispered as I started moving up, kissing her collarbone. </p><p>“Stop speaking and start working, you insolent mortal,” she said, her attempt to sound angry dying a quick death as she immediately followed it with an explosive moan. </p><p>“How about if I start like this,” I said as I started moving lower down, kissing her stomach as I moved lower. “Do you think you can handle it?” </p><p>“O-of course I can handle it. I’m a goddess,” she moaned, which would have been more convincing if she had been able to keep herself from stammering as the pleasure invaded her divine senses. </p><p>And, I was yet to reach her wetness. </p><p>When I finally reached there, she let out an even more explosive moan, and with her pleasure, the forests around us got even stronger. Her taste was beautiful, tinged with overwhelming arousal as my fingers danced around her knob, my tongue dipping to her wetness, bringing her divine qualities to the surface. </p><p>“It’s good that your pleasure is useful for growing even more forests,” I said as I chuckled, taking a small break. </p><p>Her blush thickened further as she examined the surrounding area. “T-then, you better start working faster,” she whispered shyly. “The forests need all the help they could get.” </p><p>“For the environment,” I chuckled as I lowered my head…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 30    Charisma: 30</p><p>Precision: 30    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 30     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 30       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 30}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 237555}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 1103  Mana: 2410}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Elven Goddess - ???}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>
