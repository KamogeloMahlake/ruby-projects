        <p>“So, that was one of the more interesting first interviews I had,” I said with a chuckle even as I sat next to Amy, enjoying her confused her expression. She clearly didn’t appreciate me sitting next to her, but even as she spat her makeshift gag — her roommate’s underwear — she didn’t complain about it. </p><p>It was a bit difficult considering we had just a threesome. There had been no direct contact between use, but Carol had been a bridge. </p><p>As far as icebreakers went, calling it effective was underselling it. </p><p>“Not the craziest?” she asked, choosing to take the out I granted her rather than talking about the elephant in the room. </p><p>“I’m a fashion photographer. So, believe me when I say it was not,” I said with a chuckle, enjoying her silence as she checked my body. I was happy see that, now that she was not distracted by the presence of her roommate — and secret love — she was looking my body with appreciation. </p><p>“Good, now untie me,” she said as she turned slightly, presenting me her tied arms. I touched the belt, but rather than untying her immediately, I let my finger drag along, enjoying her slight shiver. “What are you waiting for?” she growled, clearly frustrated by her own physical response. </p><p>“Well, I can … or I can leave it for Carol to unwrap. Which one you prefer?” </p><p>“Why would I prefer the second one?” she declared, her tone abrasive, like her body didn’t shiver far more intensely at the idea. </p><p>I thought about challenging her about her intense crush, but after a momentary consideration, I changed my mind. “Well, I thought you might be interested in pranking your roomie. Imagine how she would react when she leaves the shower, only to see you being fucked in her own bed, your hands still bound,” I said. </p><p>As far as pranks went, it wasn’t a particularly creative one … and that was assuming it could be classified as prank in the first place. </p><p>Her thoughtful expression showed that she cared about the prank factor even less. Instead, she was clearly more interested in another threesome opportunity, this time with something more than just licking.  </p><p>“It would be fun to see her face,” she said. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I grabbed her arm and forced her up, not enough to be truly painful, but enough to be intensely annoying. “Feel free to tell if you can’t handle a little pain,” I challenged her. </p><p>And received a scathing angry gaze that might have actually scared me if it wasn’t for her bound arms. Yet, she was just in the mood, and clearly took that as a challenge, not complaining the slightest as I yanked her arm as I pushed her toward Carol’s bedroom. </p><p>Her challenging silence continued as I pushed her on Carol’s bed face first, her naked ass pointing upward. She was tense as I dragged my finger against her entrance, but also expectant. </p><p>Clearly, her love of Carol didn’t exclude her from having a little bit of fun. </p><p>She finally let a gasp once I grabbed her hair, pulling just enough to hurt rather than slipping inside. Instead, I lay next to her, and my fingers started dancing at her entrance. </p><p>“Why the delay,” she challenged. “Don’t tell me you’re not hard yet. We might need to think about this threesome idea if that’s the case,” she declared, her tone abrasive as she challenged my male pride. </p><p>If I was any less confident about it, I might have tried to prove just how wrong she was. Instead, I chuckled as I continued teasing her. “Don’t tell me you think I can be manipulated that easily,” I commented with a chuckle. “You can always beg for it.” </p><p>“Only in your dreams —” she started, only to let out a gasp once my fingers twisted, triggering a jolt of pleasure. She looked surprised, not expecting me to play with her body with such an ease. </p><p>“It sounds like a challenge,” I said. “Do you want to bet?” </p><p>“What’s the bet?” she asked. </p><p>“That I can either make you beg for it, or make you cum, before Carol gets out of the shower,” I challenged. “And if I win, I want this…” I said, dragging my finger along her puckered hole. She tensed in a way that suggested she had never done it before, but despite her panic, she didn’t say anything about it. </p><p>Instead, she followed with her challenge. “And, if I win, I will tie you and we’ll tease you for the rest of the night,” she countered. </p><p>I had to admit. She played it well. If she won, she would have what she truly wanted, but with an excuse that prevented her from admitting any kind of emotional vulnerability, which she clearly cared more than her anal virginity. </p><p>“Good. Don’t worry. When I win, I will make sure to let you prepare it properly,” I said even as I continued to tease her entrance. I could see that affected by it, but she still accepted it with determination. When I sneaked nearer to kiss her neck, she reacted better, no doubt not expecting a gentle approach, but it was her mistake. </p><p>Bondage and edge play didn’t mean sadism. Unfortunately, I didn’t have hours to properly drive her mad, not with Carol still in the shower. I expected her to stay there for a long time, using it an excuse not to confront her roommate, but even then, it would be measured in minutes, not hours. </p><p>So, I cheated. “I just need to decide one thing about our appointment,” I whispered into her ear. </p><p>“And, what’s that important question?” she asked. </p><p>“Whether to ask Carol to join in,” I whispered. “It might be interesting to double the fun,” I whispered. “I couldn’t help but imagine how beautiful her expression would be as I pushed my cock through her puckered hole. Do you think she’ll cry or moan?” </p><p>“T-talking about another girl when you’re busy with me. T-that’s rude,” she said, which might have been effective if it wasn’t for the way her voice trembling. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re jealous of your precious roommate,” I whispered. “You didn’t seem to care while she had been licking you in the living room, every brush of her tongue making you shiver more and more…” </p><p>Amy whimpered as I continued to talk about Carol while I fingered her, her wetness getting thicker and thicker. She clearly didn’t expect that from me, and she wasn’t handling it very well. </p><p>Even that was an understatement, I realized barely a minute later, when her body started rocking, and she desperately bit her pillow to keep her voice down. She must have spent a lot of sleepless night dreaming of Carol if that was her reaction after a minute of teasing. </p><p>“Well, that was easier than I expected,” I said with a chuckle as I moved back. </p><p>“I … I didn’t cum,” she said, which I didn’t even deign with an answer, not with her body rocking desperately with the aftershocks. </p><p>Instead, I moved behind her. Not for my rightfully gained reward … no, that was for later. For now, I wanted to properly enjoy everything she was giving for me. I pressed my shaft against her entrance. Her only reaction was to raise her hips up slightly, showing just how desperate she was for someone to douse her arousal. </p><p>She moaned as I impaled her aggressively, once again biting the pillow to keep her voice down, but failed. I tightened my grip on her hands — still bound behind her — as I picked up speed, finally fucking her properly after all the teasing. Soon, even the pillow stopped containing her desperate cries, howling and gasping in equal measures. </p><p>At the background, I heard the sound of the shower stop, and rapid footsteps approaching. A second later, Carol appeared at the doorway, her expression panicked as she took a note of what was going on … which turned into exasperation. </p><p>“Try not to moan that much, baby. It’s not a competition,” Carol complained, announcing her presence, unaware of the impact it had on Amy. Amy tensed around my girth as she realized she was being watched, trying to bite the pillow even more desperately.</p><p>I didn’t let her. I grabbed her bright pink hair, using the handle to raise her head up, her cries filling the room, Carol’s presence not helping her to contain herself.  </p><p>Carol chuckled, though I could see that it was more about suppressing her confusion. “I’ll go and dry. Try to finish quickly,” she commented. </p><p>“Nonsense, come sit,” I said, disagreeing with her, but I didn’t stop my main work even for a moment. </p><p>“I don’t want to ruin the bed,” she answered, but I interrupted her with a chuckle. </p><p>“I think it’s a bit late for it,” I said as I pointed at the sheets, already ruined with Amy’s earlier explosion. “Just come here and enjoy the show.” </p><p>“Well…” Carol said, conflicted, but she was unable to resist under my gaze. She was not the only girl in the room that couldn’t let a challenge go unanswered…</p>
