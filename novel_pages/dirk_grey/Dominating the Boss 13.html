        <p>The sun was just starting to shine when I left Mike’s house, leaving the redheaded bombshell naked in her bed, collapsed in exhaustion. Honestly, I wasn’t too far away from collapsing himself. Mike’s wife turned out to be even more of a nympho than my wildest hopes, based on the way she dressed, requiring hours of dedicated attention from me to satisfy her arousal, a desire that was enhanced greatly by her marital anger. </p><p>I wish that making Mike watch the video while slowly explaining why angering his young wife with such disregard was a mistake, but it would mean foregoing any chance of a repeat, and I wasn’t that willing to miss the opportunity to repeat the night with such a beautiful example of young passion. Maybe a year later, after their inevitable divorce. I wouldn’t give more than another six months to their marriage unless Mike had the foresight of signing an iron-clad prenup. </p><p>I was driving lazily, my mind on a particularly impressive moment of remembrance where I took Tiffany in her marriage bed while she was trying to milk yet another dose of pregnancy-helper from me, and to add insult to injury, wearing the same lingerie she had been wearing on her wedding night.</p><p>A blare from my phone distracted me from my musings. Curious who was calling me in this god-forsaken hour, I raised my phone. It was Brenda, which meant I needed to answer. There was a lot of reason why she might call me in this hour, but few of them were good. I prepared to speed up in case it was a dangerous emergency. “Yes, toy,” I said. Just because I needed to answer it didn’t mean that I needed to be kind about it. </p><p>“Boss,” she said with a chirping voice. “I have excellent news.” </p><p>Admittedly, I would have been very angry if she had woken me up to inform me about her supposed good news, but I was already awake, not to mention quite relaxed after several enjoyable hours, so I just chuckled. “Shoot it away, toy.” </p><p>“As you know, I was with Natalie tonight,” she explained, and I nodded. She had done the prudent thing and informed me about Natalie’s request for a late-night ‘work’ event beforehand. I hummed, signaling her to continue. “During that, she started to complain about your presence, and I gave her an idea to get rid of you.” </p><p>It couldn’t be a good plan -from Natalie’s perspective, of course- if she was feeling enthusiastic about telling me. “You don’t say?” I murmured. </p><p>“She was complaining about you gaining too much power in the company in such a short duration, so I suggested that maybe she should try to get you in a relaxed environment where you would spill a few personal secrets.” </p><p>I sighed. “Good idea, but it wouldn’t work. From our last time, she must have realized that I don’t relinquish control during it, no matter how lighthearted the situation is. And if that failed, our encounter in the office or on the plane did. Nevertheless, I don’t think it will work.” </p><p>An excited snicker suggested that I might not be on a completely accurate path. “That wasn’t the kind of relaxed night I had in mind, boss,” she said. “I convinced her that a small barbecue in a family setting, with a couple of beers and some relaxed conversation, would work wonders in relaxing you.” </p><p>“You can’t mean that she is going to invite me to her house,” I said, couldn’t help but think what had happened to the last workmate who had the amazing idea to invite me to his home, just hours ago. “I would have thought that she was smart enough to do her best to keep me away from that sexy girlfriend of hers, not bring me in the same location on purpose.” </p><p>“Come on, boss. You must have realized that how badly her decision-making suffers when things start to move to the bedroom,” Brenda explained, her amusement suggesting that it wasn’t the first time that she had used that particular personality flaw.  </p><p>“I assumed that it was because of her inexperience with submissiveness. Is it the same while trying to be dominant?” </p><p>“Probably worse,” she answered. “After a while, the feeling of invincibility sets in, and if she gets an idea at that moment, it’s almost impossible to dislodge it. All it took was a few veiled comments from me before she came up with that genius idea. I didn’t even have to spell it out.” </p><p>“You definitely earned a reward for it, sweetie,” I answered. “Do you know when she is going to launch this amazing plan of hers.” </p><p>“Most likely this Saturday. She was feeling the pressure of the situation. I think she’ll act to change it before you could entrench yourself further.” </p><p>“Do you have anything important you can tell me about her girlfriend,” I asked. The answer turned out to be a resounding yes, as Brenda started spilling out a dossier of secrets, arranged by topic, in escalating importance that would manage to keep the attention of even the most disinterested listener primed. She had a real talent for gossiping. Though, one of the details managed to catch my attention rather sharply. “They are having fights about having a threesome?” </p><p>“Yes,” Brenda answered, her smirk audible in her voice. “Jenny enjoys penetration more than Natalie does,” she said before a giggle interrupted her. “Or if your account of the business trip was even half-accurate, she enjoys it more than Natalie’s claimed lack of enjoyment. Natalie is quite against the type of threesome Jenna wants, but Jenna is insistent, because I had joined their bed for a night during Natalie’s birthday, for a threesome of Natalie’s presence.” </p><p>“I’m assuming that Natalie claimed that it was a one-off event.” </p><p>“She was rather clever about it as well. After convincing Jenna to have a threesome, she had suggested the name of one of her past girlfriends, and then allowed Jenna to convince her to have me in their bed instead, only after making me promise that it will be just for a night.” </p><p>“Clever,” I said, impressed by the way Natalie managed to have her girlfriend and her side-chick at the same time, all the while managing to act like it was a great sacrifice on her part. “But I’m assuming that it was a one-time event. She doesn’t seem to be enthusiastic about sharing Jenna.” </p><p>“You have no idea how many spanks I had suffered that night just because I dared to drift towards Jenna even a bit. She was not happy about even the slightest caress,” Brenda answered. “She is really jealous when it comes to defending her from the others.”  </p><p>“You have given me a lot to think about,” I said. “Why don’t you get a bit of sleep while I arrange a date for the night.” After Brenda closed the phone, I sent a quick message to Elena, asking whether she had any prior engagement for tomorrow evening, and how she would feel helping me to teach a lesson to that arrogant brunette she met at the airport lounge…</p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>‘The dinner will be ready in about ninety minutes, are you sure you’ll be here on time,’ read the message from Natalie. This morning, just like Brenda had predicted yesterday, Natalie had called me to invite a private gathering to her house, giving the excuse of improving work relationships. I found it curious that she had intentionally tried to cut short my preparation time. It seemed that she was finally recognizing the risk I represented. A pity that it was already too late. </p><p>‘Don’t worry, I’m just picking up my date,’ I answered, even as I leaned back on the comfortable chair I was occupying at the airport, which was in a special lounge dedicated for first-class passengers, sipping a rare selection of single malt, its smokiness balanced against its sharpness perfectly. Drinking early wasn’t the most prudent choice, I knew, but the selection in the lounge was hard to deny. </p><p>Her response didn’t even take a second. ‘A date?’ she asked. </p><p>‘Yes, a date. I have a friend staying with me that I need to drop at the airport in a few hours. It’s not a problem, right?’ I answered. Her sudden panic was easy to understand. She was obviously hoping that I was going to arrive alone, which would allow her to manipulate me without much of a challenge. A part of me wished that I actually accoladed to her wishes, as pulling the rug under her feet in a position where she had the absolute confidence would doubtless be more enjoyable, but putting her face to face with Elena in her own fortress was too tempting to pass. ‘I need to go, see you at the dinner,’ I wrote before she could write an answer, because I saw the sexy blonde I was waiting for appearing around the corner. </p><p>“Elena,” I said with a cheerful tone as I waved as I slid my phone back to my pocket. I knew how sensitive she could be when not getting the full attention of anyone in direct interaction. It was half of the reason she was willing to join me in our little scheme, as she had been rather insulted by Natalie’s presumption of trying to steal attention from her. Now, with the opportunity to take revenge there, she was more than happy to bring that to completion. The first-class ticket that I paid for and the promise of a pleasure-filled night was the other half of the reason. </p><p>She walked towards me in her signature walk, a slow, sensual saunter that managed to make every single man, and not an insignificant portion of the women, to watch her with rapt attention, more than one jealous wife or girlfriend slapping the arm of their partner in a jealous inadequacy. I didn’t blame them. Even wearing a pair of jeans and a crop top, focusing on comfort rather than style, Elena was sexy enough to be the center of the attention. </p><p>Comfortable in her standards, of course. Her jeans were still tight enough to enhance the sexiness of her long legs, and the crop top rode high enough to give a beautiful glance of her smooth stomach. She wasn’t the kind of woman that would wear sweatpants to the public no matter the discomfort. </p><p>I stood up to greet her, but I made sure to not to hurry too much, just to remind her that I wasn’t one of the simpering fools that would give everything she wanted just to turn her frown into a smile. Which was why we were close, I think, a sense of alignment and that she rarely found in other men. A twisted kind of friendship with a significant portion of our time dedicated to manipulate others for our enjoyment, or hidden behind the closed doors, naked, again for our pleasure. </p><p>I said nothing as I brought her fingers to my lips before gently brushing. “Always a gentleman,” she said with a charming chuckle that broke a great number of hearts every year. It was completely artificial, of course, practiced many times in front of the mirror until it was just another weapon in her arsenal, supporting her in her mission to liberate rich and lonely men, and occasionally women, from a significant portion of their wealth. </p><p> “Nothing less than you deserve, my dear,” I answered in a tone that suggested a rugged charm and confidence, mixed with a hint of devotion. Again, completely artificial, though nowhere near polished at hers. After all, she was a master, and I was just an amateur, albeit a successful one. </p><p>“Seven out of ten,” she whispered. “Good posture, the tone is nice, but you maintained the eye contact for too long. It needs to slip away, leaving the lady questioning about the devotion they held rather than giving her confidence. That way, she would work hard to earn that devotion. We have a way of devaluing men if we’re sure of their devotion.” </p><p>“As you say, mistress,” I said as I gave her an exaggerated bow that wouldn’t go askew in an 18th-century royal palace, which made her giggle. A genuine one, even. “Shall we go,” I said as I presented my arm for her, and hers hooked to mine, much to the disappointment of our audience, destroying their dreams of asking her out. The fact that most wouldn’t have dared to do even if I wasn’t there didn’t matter much, dreams running eternal. </p><p>We walked in relative silence, broken by occasional idle chatter, until we arrived at the car. I opened her door, and she slipped inside. “Do we have time to stop in a shop. I would like to get rid of these horrible clothes and wear something more decent.” </p><p>“Unfortunately we don’t,” I answered, remembering some of the shopping expeditions she had, pushing the limits of human endurance. Not boring in any way of course, as watching her dress in a plethora of clothes could never stop being fun, but we were in a tight clock. </p><p>“But you promised to bring me to shopping,” she said with a playful pout, too exaggerated to be a real attempt. </p><p>“For tomorrow,” I corrected her even as I sent her a glare equally playful. I liked Elena, but she wasn’t a woman to relax around, even for a moment. Her pout intensified, which earned a chuckle from me. “And believe me, you don’t need anything else for tonight.” I smiled, then let my gaze dance over her body with obvious hunger. “Admittedly, you never do. You could wear a burlap, and still be the sexiest woman in the room.” </p><p>She chuckled as well. “Shut it, you flatterer. Since you’re determined to be a boring date, why don’t you explain to me why you’re locked in this small town,” Elena asked as I started to drive. “You told me bits and pieces during our previous encounter, but I need to have a better picture of what’s going on if I need to take initiative.” </p><p>“I don’t know, it’s already a boring story,” I said with an exaggerated mannerism. “I don’t want to disappoint you further.” </p><p>Elena tried to sigh exasperatedly, but she failed to fight off the smile that appeared on her lips. “I might have a way to make it more fun, but you need to promise me to be a good boy for the night,” she said. </p><p>“Not too good, I hope,” I countered, and she let out a crystal laugh. I started to give a more detailed explanation of the background of my unexpected transfer and demotion. </p><p>Meanwhile, she reached for my zipper, and dragged it down by a torturous slowness, my erection getting harder with every click of the slider. “Someone is eager,” she murmured halfway in. </p><p>“It missed your touch,” I answered before moving back to my explanation, and her fingers continued their task. Soon, my shaft was standing free, ready for her attention. Her delicate fingers wrapped gently around it, and started a soft dance that implied everything, but promising nothing. </p><p>“It’s good to be missed,” she answered. “Why don’t you tell me the details of your plan,” she said, her expression alone pushing me dangerously close to the climax, a fake innocence, but it just added to the sexiness of the moment. </p><p>“I don’t have a plan, exactly,” I explained, which earned a quirked eyebrow from her. “Sorry, but it was a last-minute reveal. But still, we have some interesting nuggets of information, such as a threesome conducted, and a promise for a different threesome that is being delayed for jealousy reasons…” I said, starting to explain the key points of the relationship dynamic between Natalie and her long-term girlfriend while receiving her skillful handjob. </p><p>The treatment didn’t stay restricted to her hand. Soon, she leaned forward, capturing my girth in the hot grasp of her mouth. </p><p>“It seems promising,” she said, pulling back for a moment, once again letting her hand take over the task. “But, how can be sure that Natalie would make a move on me? It seems like the weak part of the plan.” </p><p>“Well, on that I don’t think that would be too hard. She is too prideful-” I said, which earned a laugh from Elena even as her grip tightened around my shaft, increasing the pleasure I was feeling even further. </p><p>“It sounds like someone else I know.” </p><p>“Can’t argue with that. But at least, I make sure to take the measure of the people before trying to mess with them.” Her eyebrows quirked in amusement. “Most of the times,” I admitted with a sigh, not wanting to remember some of my more memorable mistakes “Anyway, Natalie is too prideful to miss a challenge, especially if she thinks she is going to win. I’ll distract her girlfriend for a while while you act like you can’t handle your liqueur.” </p><p>“And the bet comes after that, I presume,” she said. </p><p>“Yes, and the fun starts after that. You have the silk ties with you, right?” </p><p>“How rude, Nathan. A gentleman never asks a lady about the contents of her bag,” she said even as she leaned forward. </p><p>“My apologies, milady. Could you find enough mercy in your forgiving heart to forgive this horrible transgression.” She didn’t say a word, choosing to use her lips in a different way to convey her forgiveness. Her blonde hair covered my lap even as I felt a familiar warmth on my shaft, the whole distance of it as my passenger showed off with the capability of her throat. </p><p>It would be smarter to pull to the side until the pleasured haze that covered my mind abated. But there was one problem with that. I knew Elena well-enough that doing so would make that beautiful treatment disappear. Instead, I pressed the gas pedal harder, eating the remaining distance faster, luckily, the roads were mostly empty. </p><p>It was surprisingly easy to come close to climax when one had been driving into the darkness with a dangerous speed while a blonde bombshell tried her best to receive an internal throat massage. At that point, I felt Elena pulling back. I pulled one of my hands from the wheel in a great hurry and grabbed her head instead, pushing her back into her place rapidly. </p><p>A slight gasp escaped her mouth and she tried to pull back, but my grip was firm. The pressure didn’t abate even as she started to pat my leg in a display of helplessness while I pulled and pushed roughly. I had no intention of letting her go unless she used our safe word, or considering her mouth was occupied, our safe pattern, something she rarely used, and under much more extreme conditions. </p><p>Which was why I was surprised to receive it the moment before I was about to release. I let her go, more in surprise than panic, an emotion that was intensified on seeing her lips, curled amusedly despite her messed up lipstick. “I didn’t want to spoil your appetite before the main event,” she said with a smirk even as her hands, which previously had given me an amazing treatment, stuffed my erection back into my pants, into a very uncomfortable position. </p><p>I could have begged her to continue, but I didn’t want to give her another funny anecdote. She already had enough of them. And, moreover, she was right. I shouldn’t spoil my appetite before the main event. </p>
