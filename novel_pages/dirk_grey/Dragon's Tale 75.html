        <p>A servant walked to me, while the ladies looked at me hungrily. “It’s time to send you back, slave,” the servant said loudly. My gaze turned to Olivia, curious about the sudden change, but only to find a smirk on her face, suggesting the party was just about to begin. </p><p>Though, this time, they were clearly angling for something different than an open-air orgy.  </p><p>I said nothing, choosing to obediently follow the servant until she brought me to a bedroom, decorated with bright silk surrounding a huge, four-poster bed that radiated magic to make it even more comfortable. </p><p>Of course, no matter how well-decorated the room was, it couldn’t rival the sight of two naked figures, laying on the bed. One of them was a familiar figure. Cera, the enthusiastic brunette girl from an Equites family distinguished herself by working hard, earning herself a position with the higher classes. </p><p>Not a particularly comfortable position, as she was currently lying down, her head between the legs of a woman I didn’t recognize. The only personal thing I knew about her was that she was married — and I knew that only because her husband was also in the party, a deep discussion with Tiberius, trying to decide a political direction for their campaign. </p><p>I wonder if that was the reason Olivia sent me to this room first, keeping her happy so that she could nudge her husband toward a deeper alliance. It wouldn’t be the only bride that would allow such a thing. </p><p>Though, as my gaze danced on her naked body, I was rather enthusiastic about it. She was not as young as the others. I would guess she was in her mid-thirties. But she was one of those lucky women the time treated them very kindly — that or the immense amount of expensive treatments to prevent even the smallest defect from appearing on her skin. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, it didn’t change the fact that she was a delicious thick brunette whose curves reminded me of an hourglass, her flawless skin shining beautifully under the candlelight. </p><p>If pleasuring her was what I needed to do to make sure Olivia’s political activities went flawlessly, it was a sacrifice I was willing to make. </p><p>“You better not disappoint, boy,” the woman spoke haughtily, dismissal in her tone clear even as she gazed at my body hungrily. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about it, esteemed noble,” I said with a smirk even as I removed clothes, each step leaving me more naked. “I’m sure you’ll be very happy with my services.” </p><p>She nodded, her gaze already dancing on my body. Which was a mistake, as if she had kept her gaze up, she would have noticed the peculiarity of my expression, and prepared herself for what was about to come. </p><p>I had no intention of rejecting her order, of course. I was just a poor slave, beholden to my betters, helpless to their dominance. </p><p>Right? </p><p>Even thinking about that, I couldn’t help but chuckle. Even after all the exposure, I was still unable to believe just how arrogant the nobles that were ruling one of the strongest countries, if not the strongest, of the world, were able to send the legendary legions to foreign lands with just a whisper. The arrogance of nobles in the province of Britannia was nothing in comparison. </p><p>Ironically, it was the arrogance and dismissal they were showing that made it so easy to infiltrate their homes and other sensitive locations. Maybe they didn’t expect a Sorcerer to infiltrate their exalted society that way, which would have been not too inaccurate. Every Sorcerer was a strategic weapon, even for a country as strong as the Republic, not exactly something that could be deployed as a spy. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but feel that it was not the strategic thinking but arrogance that prevented it from being used. </p><p>Luckily, I was there to help, helping those exalted Romans to realize pride was a dangerous emotion that needed to be abandoned. </p><p>One sexy noble at a time. </p><p>“Hurry up, you barbarian, don’t keep me waiting,” she ordered. “Start fucking this bitch from behind.” Cera’s hips rose, indicating that she had no problems accepting such a conclusion. </p><p>I just smirked as I climbed on the bed, but rather than slipping inside Cera, I climbed next to her, and reached for her breasts, their amazing size more than enough to fill my palms. “What are you doing, you barbarian,” she grumbled angrily. “I gave you an order.” </p><p>“I know,” I said even as I squeezed her breasts hard enough to make her gasp in pain, but not hard enough that it stopped being enjoyable for her. Though, with Cera working steadily downstairs, providing pleasure, the cutoff point was reasonably high. “And I ignored it.” </p><p>And I had no problem reaching that to the limits of it, squeezing her nipples hard. A moan escaped her mouth, but her brown eyes turned to me, angry despite the joy she received from the action. “You’re just a gladiator, you’re supposed to listen to me,” she growled in genuine anger. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said even as I slapped her tits. “Didn’t you ask your friends how the things the previous time had worked? I’m Peirous, and I’m not your servant. No one can command me in the bedroom.” Then, I paused for a moment, looking at her with a smirk. “Of course, I’m more than happy to turn and leave. I’m sure your friends love to hear that how you couldn’t handle a real man,” I added, thumping my chest just to highlight the impression even more.   </p><p>She looked at me, shocked at my daring while I smirked at her. Interestingly, my rough treatment of her was only possible because of my reputation as a barbarian. Roman women were prideful, and more importantly, they had the laws behind them, and if a husband started acting too arrogant at home, they might find themselves divorced. </p><p>Ironically, the attraction they had toward me came from that paradox as well, promising something that their husbands failed to give, but ultimately, in a setting that was safe for them. </p><p>Too bad for them that I was much more than they expected. </p><p>“Don’t be too arrogant—“ she started, but I leaned forward, capturing her lips in a searing kiss, my tongue invading her mouth. She tasted a delicious mixture of fruits and wine, helping my enthusiasm even more than the beautiful sight of her generous curves. </p><p>When I pulled back, I didn’t bother to hide my sense of superiority. “Tell me which one you want to pick,” I said even as I grabbed Cera’s head, pushing her down to make her continue to service the busty older beauty, while my smirk just widened, enjoying the conflict of her face. </p><p>Especially since her gaze dipped down several times, checking the treasure between my legs, no doubt considering whether abandoning her pride for a night was a worthy price for what I was offering, though her eyes, clouded in arousal, left no doubt about where her ultimate choice would lie. </p><p>The nod of approval came not too long after, putting a smirk on my face. I grabbed Cera’s hair and pulled her back harshly, knowing from experience that she enjoyed the rough treatment. So, her moan didn’t surprise me. </p><p>Unfortunately, I needed to attend our noble guest — well, the nobler one, technically. I took Cera’s place, but rather than lying down to service her, I positioned my shaft against her glistening entrance, already wet enough after Cera’s service. </p><p>Yet, rather than sliding inside, I waited, still pinning her under my smirk. It took a while for her to realize I had no intention of starting to move. She pushed her hips forward, only for me to pull back, maintaining the distance. </p><p>The expression of frustration on her face was simply too beautiful. “What are you waiting for, you arrogant slave?” she growled, which, I had to admit, enhanced her mature beauty even further, making me even more tempted to wipe it off, replacing it with a worshipful expression. </p><p>“I’m waiting for you to ask nicely, of course.” </p><p>“You dare!” she gasped as she tried to push herself up, but pressing my hand on her stomach easily stopped her. She might wield a lot of authority in her noble house, giving her considerable power, but that hardly transferred into physical strength. Despite her best effort, she stayed pinned under my hand, unable to stand. </p><p>“Of course, I dare,” I said with a smirk. “I took down a crazy Nemean Lion alone, do you think a naked noble scares me, no matter how sexy she is.” I stopped for a moment, enjoying the shocked expression on her face, though not missing the opportunity to slip a compliment. </p><p>Her sexy curves deserved it. </p><p>Then, I put a serious expression as I pulled my hand back. “But if you don’t want to enjoy my presence, I’m sure your exalted friends will have no problem starting earlier,” I said as I turned my back, looking determined to walk away. </p><p>I heard the distinct sound of a fist connecting to a pillow, followed by the sound of the same pillow, cutting through the hair. </p><p>Amusingly, despite our closeness, she managed to miss me, the pillow hitting the wall. I continued walking away, not even bothering to react to her. She only spoke once my hand touched the handle of the door. </p><p>“You win, you bastard,” she growled. “Come here and fuck me, dominate me. But I swear to Venus, if you leave me unsatisfied, I’ll have your head!” </p><p>Almost perfect, I thought. I could have done without the threat at the end, but I didn’t care much about that. After all, I had a couple of hours to teach her the lesson she deserved… </p>
