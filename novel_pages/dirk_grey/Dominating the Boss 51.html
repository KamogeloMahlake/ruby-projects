        <p>The rest of the morning passed without a notable event, and I was prepared to leave for lunch when there was a hesitant knock on the door. I invited them in. </p><p>It was Umi, with a tray with my lunch order. </p><p>“Welcome,” I said as I watched her take a step forward, taking in the show. She was still dressed mostly the same, but there were a couple differences. The skirt was rolled even higher, and the blouse had five buttons open — though the tray covered the spectacle. She likely made all those changes in front of my door, putting its remoteness from foot traffic into good use.</p><p>Also, her daring looks suggested that she had a follow-up discussion with Charlie, and that didn’t leave her particularly happy. Well, I was ready to cheer her up. </p><p>“Lock the door and come in,” I said even as I pushed the clutter to the side. </p><p>“You want me to l-lock the door,” Umi muttered, her beautiful eyes widening, showing that she expected me to have limits when I was in the office. </p><p>Well, technically, I had some limits, but they were not remotely close to what she had in mind. </p><p>Her surprise didn’t prevent her from following my order. She locked the door before she walked forward slowly, realizing what would follow, but her growing arousal was obvious regardless. </p><p>She continued to walk. “What’s wrong?” I asked, though I knew exactly what was wrong. </p><p>“N-nothing, sir,” she said when she arrived in front of my desk. Though, just as she put down the tray, I caught a glimpse of a naughty smile. The reason, I understood once the tray was on my desk, and I received a full view of her cleavage. </p><p>She didn’t wear a bra, turning her cleavage into a true show, especially when she was leaning in front of me. “Excellent. This is exactly the initiative I expect from my secretary,” I said, enjoying her cleavage while she blushed, her hands twitching with a desire to cover her face — or the cleavage. She might be acting more daring after the fight, but that didn’t fix her innate shyness. </p><p>“Now, why don’t you tell me about my lunch,” I said as I glanced down, and found some unfamiliar dishes. “Is this a new place?” </p><p>“N-no, sir,” she answered, her blush getting even thicker. “I … I cooked them myself.” </p><p>“Oh, how fascinating,” I said, though enjoying the implied intimacy more than the food itself even though they looked delicious. “Thank you for your effort.”   </p><p>“It’s not a bother,” she said, embarrassed, but I was more interested in the way her breasts danced as she shrugged, the lack of bra turning it into an erotic show. </p><p>“Now, I don’t know how to eat them,” I said, which surprised her. Understandable, as it was an absurd lie considering it was some steamed vegetables and chicken stir-fry, and nothing really exotic. “Why don’t you come here and feed me.” </p><p>She paused a moment, realizing what would happen, but what followed her pause was a big, sultry smile. One that was bigger than I expected. “Of course,” she said, suddenly vindictive. “After all, I’m here to make sure my fiancee’s career goes without a hitch. And he told me, very strictly, that I should never make you unhappy.” </p><p>“Really?” I said, actually surprised by it.  </p><p>“Yes. Several times,” she said as she walked around my desk and stood next to me. </p><p>It took all I had to not palm my face when what Charlie was doing hit me. He clearly hadn’t wanted to talk about why the interview had gone like that, instead deflected the topic. But, his indirect words worked the exact opposite of how he wanted. </p><p>What a terrible salesman. </p><p>Once she arrived next to me, Umi sat on my knee before I even asked, reached for a fork, and brought a bite while I wrapped a hand around her waist, my hand landing on her naked thigh, staying in place for a moment before starting to climb up slowly.  </p><p>She fed me a second bite. “Delicious,” I whispered after chewing and swallowing it, then gently bit her earlobe, enjoying the way she shivered on my lap. A moan followed when my fingers followed her thigh, and reached high enough to show me her bra wasn’t the only piece of underwear she was missing. “Delicious,” I repeated, but I pulled back slightly, gently teasing her inner thigh rather than slipping inside.  </p><p>I didn’t trust her to drop the fork and ruin my suit if I did so. </p><p>More importantly, she deserved a lesson for daring to tease me with her lack of panties. A little teasing was an excellent punishment considering her clear desire for more. </p><p>I said nothing, and she continued to feed me silently, which lasted until I used my other hand to unbutton her blouse even more. “S-sir,” she whispered.</p><p>“What?” I countered even as her blouse parted open completely, revealing her large tits for my gaze. I was tempted to just grab them, but it wouldn’t fit my desire to tease her slowly. Instead, I let my finger dance on her stomach, doing my best to drive her mad slowly, occasionally drifting near her naked breasts, but not touching. </p><p>“P-please touch me, sir,” she whispered. I might have felt a little inadequate if I still heard an echo of vindictiveness in her tone. Luckily, her voice was pure desire, her body aching for pleasure after she received the taste of it. </p><p>“Oh that would be wrong,” I said mockingly. “I’m your boss, after all. You can’t expect me to do something like that,” I said, enjoying the absurdity of my words under the circumstances. </p><p>“Really,” she growled, reacting to my teasing surprisingly well. She settled more comfortably on my lap, but her move still managed to surprise me with its daring. “As you wish, sir. Then, that’s enough for lunch. It’s time for the dessert. </p><p>I opened my mouth, about to ask exactly what she had in mind for a dessert, but she was quicker. She grabbed my hair with both hands as she leaned forward, capturing my lips. Her tongue was so greedy, invading my mouth with an aggression that I didn’t expect. </p><p>She was learning. </p><p>She changed her position without stopping the kiss, and turned toward me. Her legs were on both sides of me. It rode her skirt up, meaning it was her naked core that was riding my bulge. “Oh, sir, you brought a dessert for me too,” she whispered as she rubbed against me. “You’re such an excellent boss.” </p><p>“Why don’t you go and enjoy it,” I said even as I finally brought my hands against her breasts, palming their beautiful wide expanse and twisting her nipples. </p><p>“N-not right now,” she whispered as she continued to hump me. “I want to savor it first,” she said as her back arched with pleasure. I decided to give her that. The beautiful sight of her breasts, with occasional pink spots to show where my fondling had turned too rough made them look even sexier. </p><p>I made a show of swallowing hard, giving her the feedback she desired, and showing that seductive was an excellent color for her. </p><p>After all, as a boss, it was my responsibility to encourage the development of proper skills in my beautiful secretary. </p><p>“I think my new job is going to be more exhausting than I had first assumed,” she whispered throatily, encouraged by my exaggerated vulnerability as she grabbed my neck to pull herself up, but this time, she lifted herself a bit, shoo rather than kissing me, her naked breasts dangled in front of me. </p><p>“Maybe, but I can promise that hard work is always rewarded,” I whispered before I leaned forward, capturing her nipple between my lips, squeezing gently enough to earn another moan.  </p><p>“Tempting,” she whispered. “What kind of reward we are talking about?” </p><p>“Hmm,” I whispered as I buried myself between her breasts, the tremors enough to make her moan. “Have you had any place that you always wanted to visit, but never had the opportunity.” </p><p>“Paris,” the answer came instantly, before she even considered the question. </p><p>I pulled back, caught her gaze, and smirked. “Oh, what a coincidence. I need to go there very soon for a business trip, and it’s only right that I bring my secretary with me, right?” </p><p>“Oh,” she whispered as she realized the implication. “I … I don’t —” she started, coming close to refusing. I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for the earlier show with Charlie, she might have refused the offer. Instead, she paused for a moment before she delivered her answer. “When is this trip?” she asked. </p><p>“That depends on how hard you work,” I answered even as my eyes roved up and down her curves. </p><p>“Well, I better start then,” she said as she vacated my lap and fell on her knees. “Comfortable,” she said as she felt the thick carpet under her, then unzipped my pants. </p><p>Showing that she was ready to work hard starting from her first day. </p>
