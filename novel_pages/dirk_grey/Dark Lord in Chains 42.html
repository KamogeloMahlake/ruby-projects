        <p>It was uniquely thrilling to spank the haughty councilwoman who thought herself superior to everyone else, responsible for spinning a dangerous web of ploys and tricks from her hidden spot like a spider, trying to take control of the Empire. I was impressed with her ambition, of course, but not with her methods despite the initial success she generated, forcing Sapphire to act. </p><p>I was not impressed, not because their complicated ploys had resulted in my defeat, making me lose the fiefdom I had created after great struggle. It was the part and parcel of the struggle for power. It wasn’t the first setback I had faced, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last. I didn’t even take that personally. </p><p>No, I was not impressed, because she wasn’t the first schemer I had faced. And if there was something I had learned from my own rise of power, that schemers never won in the end. That didn’t mean that they didn’t win skirmishes. They did, especially against the target they put on their sight, in this case, the Queen. But somehow, they always forgot that such complicated conflicts forced them into a weird, static stalemate that created opportunities for others, the kind that cared little for their carefully crafted web of favors, tricks, and consequences. </p><p>Someone like a deposed dark lord, for example. </p><p>I was never impressed with the schemers was their reliance on their own plots. Too used to the comfort of their competitors reacting in the same manner, the speed they folded once their carefully crafted web was pierced by an unexpected slash of a sword by an unknown player was patently boring. </p><p>Luckily, at least, in our current delicious situation, with her laying on her desk with ripped robes that revealed her revealing thong, and my spanks exploding against her skin to turn the already pink coloring of her ass cheeks into a bright, stinging red, it was far from boring. </p><p>“Don’t stop your explanation, sweetheart,” I said softly even as another spank exploded on her bottom. “And don’t forget, due to my previous work experience, I’m really sensitive against people trying to manipulate me. I don’t react well to such little tricks.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured. </p><p>“No, you don’t, not really. Because I have a tendency to take that personally, and you don’t want to be on the other side when I take something personally.” She shivered. “Of course, you don’t have to suffer through my whims. You just need to ask, and I’ll pull back, and as long as you promise to go back to being a little councilwoman dealing with paperwork, I will even stop Sapphire pursuing you.” </p><p>“W-what?” she stammered, caught flatfooted by the sudden offer, the sudden absence of my touch surprising her even further. </p><p>She was about to stand up, when I ordered. “Did I told you to stand up?” </p><p>“S-sorry, sir,” she stammered as she continued to lay on her desk. </p><p>“To answer your rudely phrased question,” I continued with a calm tone, like she was the one acting absurd. “I don’t like to force people to work with me, so I’m offering you an option, a good option even. I’ll not only never bother you again, but I’ll even protect you from the charges of treason. I won’t even tell so many high-ranking nobles that their minds had subtly manipulated with your forbidden mind-control magic. All you need to do is to abandon your ambition and go back and play being a little politician.” </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when her answer came immediately. “No, sir, I prefer our current deal.” After all, if she were to be dissuaded from her path that easily, she wouldn’t have bothered in the first place. But my aim was still achieved. After all, I had given her an option, a very attractive option, even, meaning what was about to follow would have to be reframed in her mind. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said with a cheeky tone even as I put my hand on her thong, ripping it off her body with one aggressive pull. “Just keep in mind that you can call this off anytime if our deal is not in your taste, and I’ll let you go,” I offered, well aware that under those circumstances, such an option would be the weight that to pull her deeper rather than relief to let her float. </p><p>One didn’t become Dark Lord without learning to offer choices more effective than the strongest chain. It wasn’t my preferred way of working, I preferred to manipulate the situation until the request came from them, but against Fernhand, it was poetically fitting. </p><p>“Continue with your delicious tale of political intrigue,” I whispered even as I put my hand on her naked bottom, caressing her red cheeks, making her flinch despite the gentleness of the touch, conditioned by the earlier spanks. More surprising, however, was the utter lack of reaction as I removed my own pants, as if she was already prepared. Curious, I caressed her wet lips, only for her not to react. Well, she did tremble deliciously under the touch, but there was a distinct absence of tenseness that she felt whenever I spanked her bottom. </p><p>A moment of consideration later, I decided that was to be expected. After all, having sex to get a hint of control of the situation was her opening gambit once I revealed my identity. Why would she be bothered by when I decided to resort to that, especially if it meant that it would stop the spanking that she clearly hated, painful and demeaning in a patronizing matter simultaneously. </p><p>Luckily, the regular way wasn’t the only way to have some fun, I decided. I brought my fingers just an inch further, touching at the forbidden spot between her cheeks. Her body flinched even as my index finger brushed her puckered hole, enough to stall her explanation for a heartbeat, which might as well be shouting considering her ability to keep down her bodily reaction. I flared my mana, and a quick spell later, her entrance was properly cleaned. It was lubricated as well, but not enough to actually classify as proper, barely enough to prevent an injury, but not enough to make a comfortable experience for her. </p><p>Before she could react to my spell, I had already slipped a finger into her, earning a gasp. It wasn’t just pain that I was hearing though, there was also a sheer surprise. “Don’t tell me that no one had ever touched here,” I asked, unable to resist the temptation </p><p>“N-no,” she stammered, her tone filled with shock, but also fury. “Of course not! That’s horrible.” </p><p>“Oh, honey,” I said with a chuckle, even as I added a second finger, earning another strained cry. “You know that you can make me stop anytime, as long as you’re willing to live a life in obscurity.” </p><p>“Bastard,” she groaned angrily, which made me smile even wider. After all, it was the first honest expression I had gained from her, and it was quite a fun reaction. </p><p>“Do you want me to stop?” I asked even as I pulled out my fingers. </p><p>“No,” she answered immediately, her voice filled with panic. Clearly, while she didn’t enjoy the feeling of being penetrated aggressively in her virgin hole, she clearly appreciated the opportunity to give up her illegal gains even less. </p><p>“What do you want me, then?” I asked, not touching her. </p><p>“Whatever you want,” her answer came quickly even as she raised her bottom, far too willing to sacrifice her distaste for her benefit. I was tempted to tease her a bit more, but then, decided otherwise. I had already played with her enough. </p><p>I pressed the crown of my shaft against her puckered hole, enjoying the way she tensed before starting to push forward. Slowly, of course, to give her more than enough time to actually getaway. But she never did, just gasping as my shaft moved in inch by inch, stretching her virgin hole. </p><p>“Did I tell you to stop talking, sweetie?” I said even as another spank landed on her ass, adding another layer of pleasure to her struggle. “And don’t think that I didn’t notice the little lies you’re trying to slip, I’m keeping a tally for future punishments,” I added. It was a mostly empty threat, relying on the ambiguous nature of the statement. It was a juvenile tactic as well, one that I wouldn’t normally try against an excellent manipulator like Fernhand, but I was betting on her distracted state thanks to losing her anal virginity. </p><p>It was amusing to notice the change of pace in her tone, just enough to make me believe that she was panicking, but it was too quick, giving me a calculated feeling, suggesting that it was a fake. Still, I gave no indication that I had caught her little ruse, allowing her to think that she succeeded. After all, from the start, my aim never was the knowledge she would bother speaking. I just needed the mundane knowledge about the palace politics and the relationship between the nobles in the Light Faction, the kind I never bothered to collect before, as well as the latest developments since my capture… </p><p>Enjoying the tightness of her ass as I did so was simply a bonus. A delicious bonus. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said as patted her ass gently like I was consoling a misbehaving servant, smug and understanding at the same time. My shaft continued to invade her puckered hole deeper in the process, of course, enjoying the way she stretched around me for the first time in her life, with all the humiliation it implied. </p><p>She gritted her teeth and continued to explain with a single-minded focus that frankly scared me a little. It seemed that her advantageous position against Sapphire was not a coincidence. </p><p>I started to wonder whether her reach was long enough to create the crisis in the North in the first place. </p><p>Sapphire clearly hadn’t thought so, considering the way she bet everything on the fact that Fernhand was yet to be aware of that problem—if her explanation to Aria was true, of course. Pity that even if Fernhand knew anything about it, she wouldn’t have mentioned it unless I asked explicitly, and doing so would reveal the problem to her if she didn’t already know about it. </p><p>Fernhand was dangerous enough without having me as an unintentional informant, no need to strengthen her hand even further. </p><p>Still, trying to piece the things together from a number of unreliable sources where I couldn’t even ask questions without revealing much more than I was willing to give was getting frustrating. Luckily, I had the perfect way to resolve those frustrations. I grabbed her soft, flowing hair, harshly enough to add another layer to her little punishment even before I used it as leverage to push even deeper. </p><p>Her resulting moans were simply delicious, interrupting her explanation repeatedly. This time, however, I let her get away with it those interruptions. She earned that much leniency, at least…  </p>
