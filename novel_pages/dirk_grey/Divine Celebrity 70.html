        <p>“That was not bad,” I murmured as I left the emergency meeting at the dean’s office, one that lasted almost six hours as the Dean and Coach Spencer raged at us for daring to act irresponsibly. </p><p>Naturally, I had been the target of their distaste, but unfortunately for them, they weren’t as intimidating as they assumed themselves to be, and I easily disregarded their pointless rage to focus on something more productive. </p><p>Their attitude might have scared me a bit if it wasn’t for the live stream. An orphan with no money was the excellent scapegoat for such a big scandal, even if I had been the hero of the last football game. </p><p>Especially since Dean cared more about other things than winning, if the assignment of Head Coach was any indicator. </p><p>Yet, as the meeting continued, the intent I received started to get more and more intense rather than slowing down, showing that it was getting even more viral. </p><p>It kept them from making a decision, afraid of the public backlash. </p><p>It was already night when finally came to a decision. Or, more accurately, a nondecision, as they decided to suspend me and Kevin for a while for instigating the fight, while they came to a decision. </p><p>Of course, according to the school rules, they needed to actually suspend the whole team for joining the fight, but that would mean no player for the next week’s game. </p><p>And just like that, walked out, uncaring of the pointed glare of most of the players. At the entrance, I found Megan waiting for me in her car. </p><p>Interesting. </p><p>“Do you need a ride,” she said as she pulled the car.</p><p>“Not as much as you,” I said with a smirk, enjoying her cute blush as I took my seat. </p><p>Then, I turned to catch Kevin’s gaze and waved at him, then the rest of the offensive players, which didn’t exactly help to balm the less-than-positive feelings they had toward me, ruining their triumphant moment. </p><p>Of course, Kevin also received similar gazes, and unlike me, he looked much less prepared to actually handle the such weight, wilting under the collective anger. </p><p>But that was all the attention I gave to his plight as Megan pressed the gas and I drove away. She stayed silent for a moment, giving me a chance to rest, which I appreciated. Not that I was tired, but I used the opportunity to close my eyes and focus on the System once more, triggering it once more to refresh my gains. </p><p>[Unarmed III, Acquired]</p><p>The gains were good enough to put a smile on my face, enjoying the subtle warmth that spread into my body, one that was getting rather familiar. </p><p>“You look chipper,” Megan commented as she continued to drive. “I’m guessing they let you out without punishment.” </p><p>“Even better,” I answered as I opened my eyes once more. “I’m not allowed to play the next game.” Megan quirked an eyebrow, questioning me about that subtly. “It’s good, because it’s the first week without Coach Bill, and apparently, Thad and Carter. It’ll be such a disaster.” </p><p>“And then, they have to reinstate you,” Megan answered. </p><p>“Well, especially if we put a couple videos, that my lovely girlfriend helping me to train, using her precious time to keep me fit so we can serve our school better,” I suggested. </p><p>“And leaking some photos about your difficult training, I’m guessing,” Megan added, trying to sound disinterested, no doubt to frame it like a favor. </p><p>“Well, I’m sure Kim would love to help if you’re busy,” I said, my smile leaving no doubt in her mind to show just how much it would benefit the celebrity personality she was doing her best to create. </p><p>“Asshole,” she murmured, which might have been more intimidating if it wasn’t for the blush that covered her face, no doubt the memories of the night before rushing to her head. She drove in silence for a while. “By the way, they towed your car while you were away,” she said. </p><p>“Parking violation, or the moving company Thad used,” I said. </p><p>“The second,” she answered. </p><p>“Not a problem, it was a borrow in the first place. I have at least a week to find an alternative now that I don’t have to go to the stadium every single day.” Though, as I did so, a frown appeared on my face. </p><p>Not because losing the car, as that was going to happen sooner or later, was how loaners worked. It was the reason I didn’t keep anything important inside in the first place. </p><p>I was more distracted by the great speed of operation. They just had a meeting in the morning, and Coach Bill’s decision had just been declared. Yet, they were moving away quickly enough not to take a car. </p><p>Of course, there was a chance that it was something that they had arranged a while ago, and Carter and Thad had been keeping that under wraps, but that didn’t make much sense either. </p><p>If that had been the case, not only Thad would have mentioned it, but also Carter wouldn’t have given all that trouble to develop me to the new mike — as my achievement of actually playing during that weekend game was completely out of his calculations, making that pointless. </p><p>It was weird.</p><p>Weird enough that I might have started exploring the reason, if I didn’t have more important issues. </p><p>Like the best way to gather more Intent while the team was on a break, preferably doing something that would actually give me some additional abilities. </p><p>“You’re a car enthusiast,” I said as I looked at her. </p><p>That earned a bland glare from her. In lieu of an answer, she pressed the gas a bit, before taking the next turn with a sharpness that would have crashed a less skilled driver impressively. “Really, what did you make thinks so.” </p><p>“Cool it, sweetie,” I said, but I was unable to hold back a chuckle. “I was thinking of finding a classic, maybe something from the fifties, and repairing it,” I said. “You know, for some style.” </p><p>That earned another glare, this time reproachful. “And the budget you have for it is,” she muttered. </p><p>“Practically nonexistent,” I said with a big smile, not feeling even a hint of shame admitting that. “So, it better be real junk.” </p><p>“And, where are you going to repair that junk,” she asked. </p><p>“I’m sure you know a garage that wouldn’t mind letting me borrow the corner they operated, of course,” I said with a smirk. “You know, cashing that favor I earned by playing along.” </p><p>“You already cashed that in last night,” she said. </p><p>“No, sweetie, that was about our little photoshoot, don’t mix things,” I answered. </p><p>“You drive a hard bargain,” she said. </p><p>I chuckled. “Oh, don’t tell me that you don’t benefit from it as well. Think of it, the new power couple of the school, shuffling between a beautiful classic and a modern sports car.” </p><p>“Finding a car on the cheap, arranging a garage… It sounds like a lot of work, more than a simple favor like that deserves,” she finally answered. “Especially since I have to actually arrange the garage.” </p><p>Of course, her statement was not a final comment, but the opening salvo in a long bargain. Too bad for her that I had no intention of playing around. “If you say so,” I murmured. “I’m sure Kim wouldn’t mind helping me to find an old bike.” </p><p>The angry glare that she threw to my side was balm to my wounded little heart. “Fine,” she spat out. “But don’t come to me crying when you ruin the car that I find you with your unskilled hands. My favor is complete regardless of how spectacular your failure is.” </p><p>“Oh, what did I deserve to lose your beautiful trust.” </p><p>“I have seen the state of the garbage you called a car,” she answered. “That’s enough for me not to have the slightest expectation. </p><p> I just smiled at her. She was not wrong, entirely, as while I was decent when it came to repairs, I was mostly self-thought, struggling to keep my bucket of rust running without a problem. </p><p>But, with the System, I was confident to tackle the challenge. </p><p>I glanced at Megan, who was busy driving silently, unable to hide her arousal despite her best efforts. I was tempted to make a move and enjoy that aspect. </p><p>Just not as much as I enjoyed teasing her. </p><p>“You can pull to the side,” I said after a while. “I can walk the rest of the distance.” </p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I need to make some plans for the week, and a walk in the cold would help me think,” I answered. Then, I let my smirk widen. “Unless you have another exercise in mind that could help me put you in the right mood.” </p><p>Her anger was simply beautiful as she pulled to the side with a sharp brake that would have sent me out of the car if it wasn’t for the seatbelt. Dangerous, but not as dangerous as her next move, pressing the gas with her full strength before I could step out. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my Agility gain, I would have ended up on the pavement. For now, however, I waved my hand instead, enjoying her disappearance. </p><p>Hopefully, she wouldn’t try to make me pay back too badly about the car.  </p>
