        <p>“I’ll kill you,” Mia gasped the moment the door was closed, jumping to her feet. “Actually, no, I’m not going to kill you. I’m going to torture you first, until you beg for death.” As she declared her anger, she wished that she wasn’t trying to keep her tits hidden with  one arm. It damaged her authority significantly. </p><p>Maybe it was why he looked amused rather than scared. </p><p>“Take my words seriously, you stupid janitor,” Mia gasped, and when his smirk was erased, replaced by an angry expression, she thought herself scored a win. </p><p>“Is that the way to speak to your fiancee, when you were enjoying my cock just a second ago,” he countered, and just like that, any satisfaction she had was erased. </p><p>“Get the fuck out of my office,” she gasped. “Or I’ll make you wish you are dead.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” he answered, his voice grating her for some reason. She didn’t like just how confident he was as he leaned forward … she felt her power disappear just a bit as she fixed her pose, trying to keep her tits covered. “So,  you would be happy if I turn and leave.” </p><p>“Of course,” she answered, trying to sound more confident than she was feeling. A part of that lack of confidence was the monster in his pants, almost pressing against her leg — and worse, she wished to move just a bit closer to feel that. </p><p>She watched as he bend over a bit more. “So, you don’t care about that big client and all the money she’ll bring.” </p><p>That caught Mia flatfooted. “What do you mean.” </p><p>“What I mean, if I leave that door without you apologizing to me for your hurtful words, I won’t play along with your little scheme. Have fun explaining to her why your loving fiancee suddenly dumped you.” </p><p>Mia froze. It had been a while since anyone … let alone a lowly janitor, dared to threaten her. “You can never do that!” she declared, feeling confident. She was the boss. Who did he think he was… </p><p>“Really, watch closely then,” he said. And just like that, he pulled back, so fast that her mind didn't even have time to register the consequences of his declaration when he was already halfway. </p><p>“Stop!” she ordered, shocked at his reaction. </p><p>He did not, continuing to walk toward the door. </p><p>“Stop, I order you!” she gasped. He ignored. “Please, stop,” she gasped, raising her arm. She might have even rushed forward to stop him, but her legs were trembling at the realization. She was about to lose her biggest account, one that she had been working for more than a year, for a moment of arrogance. </p><p>Big mistake. </p><p>She remembered his words. “I’m sorry for insulting you, Darion. Please, stop!” she shouted once more. That arrested his movement, and instead, he leaned against the door. </p><p>A reminder of just how close she got to ruin everything. </p><p>“A good start. But I can do with hearing what exactly you are sorry for,” he said. </p><p>“D-don’t push it—“ she started, only for his expression to turn stormy. “N-no, I’m sorry for being an arrogant bitch,” she gasped hurriedly. </p><p>“Good, all that remains is to earn your forgiveness,” he answered. </p><p>“H-how about another three months of bonus,” she offered with a small voice, one that she was sure that it would be rejected. </p><p>“No, honey,” he answered, his voice making her heart beat faster. “How about apologizing me like a fiancee would. After all, we need to practice for your great heist, right?” </p><p>Mia froze, realizing what he was asking for. She was about to reject that, as no money was worthy of debasing her … but a memory stopped her from verbalizing that. A recent memory, where she had been on his lap right in front of his lap… Which was as pleasurable as it had been humiliating… </p><p>Was that wrong to take him on his offer, Mia suddenly found herself thinking. After all, she was the boss, and he was the employee. There was no insult there. She was the one taking advantage of him… </p><p>“I’m leaving if we’re going to stand here all day,” he warned. </p><p>Mia never felt this insulted in her life … which was why she found it mysterious when her decided to rebel and drop her jacket down. She turned her back to hide herself, but she doubted it was particularly effective with the angle she chose — and if she worked hard, she might even convince herself that it was not intentional. </p><p>“Good, now show me,” he said, and she turned to face him, but the feeling of shame managed to win this time, and she covered her chest with her arms…</p><p>“Better,” he said throatily, his frown turning into a smile that somehow stole all her strength. She had never felt such sensations, though, if she  was being honest, the memory of the monster underneath her did most of the job. </p><p>More than one of her college friends blamed her for being a size Queen, after all. </p><p> She dropped her arms before she could realize what she was doing, even giving him  a shy look, like he was actually her fiancee. </p><p>“A good start, now, show me your other  assets. Lean against the desk. I need to see if my fiancee has the booty to make it worth it,” he declared. Mia felt her face blush. She had never been insulted this much. “Drop the pants,” he added. </p><p>No, she corrected. She hadn’t been insulted this much … and she had a feeling it wasn’t the only record she would broke today… She got rid of them quickly before taking the same pose — but not neglecting to put on her pumps back on —  glad that she had picked something interesting to wear today. </p><p>Not the most impressive color, but fancy enough, and transparency certainly helped to put her ass to best of light… And, her ass certainly needed all the help. </p><p>“Not bad,” he murmured, his footsteps getting closer. </p><p>“I’m glad to bring you satisfaction,” she bit back, though her voice was less sarcastic than she hoped to sound… The way her core was burning in anticipation made it hard to sound sarcastic. </p><p>“Good, now, let’s enjoy the goods,” he said, once again crass. Intentionally so, she realized, but that realization was less shocking than the daring way he grabbed her tits in the middle of the office. He was certainly impatient. </p><p>Still, she wasn’t prepared for the feelings that overwhelmed her when he grabbed her tits and mauling them like a barbarian. But at least, that position allowed  her to look away, which allowed her to maintain a semblance of control.  </p><p>She was certainly not prepared for him to suddenly force her to turn, and end up sharing a gaze. She wanted to avoid it, but somehow, his gaze managed to enchant hers, forcing her to get locked at their dark depths… </p><p>He was a dangerous man … a dangerous man that was busy mauling her ass like he owned her, treating her like a cheap whore. </p><p>Worse, she was unable to say anything. For a moment she thought that she would be able to gather the necessary drive to push him away … but right at then, he chose to got rid of his shirt. And, his muscles, his dark, knotted, impressive muscles that she had never seen anywhere but magazines, made that drive evaporate. </p><p>At that moment, she realized she had never been with a true man … and the prospect of finally being with one didn’t feel too terrible.</p>
