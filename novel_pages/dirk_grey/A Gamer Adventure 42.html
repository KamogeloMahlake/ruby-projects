        <p>Her reaction to my proclamation was a thing of wonder. A beautiful expression of confusion spread on her face, enhanced further by the blush that turned her alabaster skin to red. She wiggled uncomfortably, but made no attempt to pull away from her comfortable position of leaning against my chest. </p><p>Her innocent yet accepting reaction made her impossible to resist even without considering the fact she was the impeccable head librarian, one of the deadliest mages in the country, her name enough to make her foes tremble. And now, she was trying to ignore her own reaction as I pulled her on my lap. She shivered, her shyness obvious, but that didn’t prevent her from wiggling on top of my shaft, trying to get comfortable. </p><p>A little bribe for her tantalizing obedience was in order, I decided even as I put my finger to her mouth once more, but this time, rather than sliding it directly, I lingered on her lips, tracing the edges even as her mouth opened helplessly, a gasp escaping her mouth. She moved her lips, trying to catch it, but I moved my finger before she could, earning a frustrated growl, enough to make me chuckle. I let my finger slide into her mouth and let my mana flow once more. </p><p>[-55 Mana]</p><p>[+2 Tantric]</p><p>I was happy with the rapid development of my new skill, even though I had doubts about its usefulness. But I wasn’t asshole enough to focus on long term goals when I had a fragile brunette on my lap whose work life and ambitions blinded her to the true pleasures of life. </p><p>So, while she was distracted, I discarded the washcloth, and let my other hand free on her body. I wanted to delve deep into her breasts, but for her first time, she deserved a more considerate treatment. Instead, I let my fingers drift on her stomach, caressing it with gentle, fleeting touches. Already charged with our earlier play, that was enough to trigger a moan from her, muffled due to my finger in her mouth. I wasn’t letting any more mana out —I wanted to regenerate more in case we had another ambush— but she continued to suck it with the same enthusiasm, making my imagination work overtime about other things she might enjoy sucking. </p><p>“It feels … different,” she murmured as I let my hand climb upward, dancing on the bottom of her naked breasts, ideas such as modesty and personal space long forgotten. I reached for her breasts, which, while smaller than what I had been enjoying thanks to Marianne, Helga, and Aviada, were still beautiful in their perkiness and perfect shape. And the way her nipples stiffened at my touch was more than enough to address the deficiency in size. </p><p>She was beautiful. And the fact that she was several times stronger than me just made the moment even more exciting. </p><p>I wanted to speak, to tease her about her new experience, but when I saw her eyes closed in an effort to contain the new sensations, I decided to take it a different way. I gently traced her nipple, earning another moan in the process, before letting my fingers dance over her body. </p><p>[+400 Experience]</p><p>My finger wasn’t in her mouth anymore, which allowed me to continue caressing her nipples even as my other hand moved down in a determined journey until it ended around her panties. I thought about sliding in her panties, then I decided to pull them off completely, leaving her naked for my view. She gasped cutely as I dragged them down her toned legs, but gave no resistance. I couldn’t help but feel excited at the sight of her most sensitive location, cleanly shaved despite her lack of experience. </p><p>“So, let me teach you how to masturbate,” I whispered into her ear even as my fingers gave a cursory caress to her lower lips before focusing on her inner thighs, massaging her slowly but sensuously. </p><p>“Okay,” she murmured dreamily, but from her tone, I could easily see that she was not in a mood to listen, so rather than speaking, I decided to teach her by example. As my fingers started their determined dance on her thighs, however, she moaned once more. “Faster,” she begged. </p><p>Normally, I would have stretched the moment, torturing my partner deliciously with a bit of delayed pleasure, but I decided to make an exception for Titania. Not experiencing arousal for decades was a true tragedy, something I knew intimately from my own fate. If I could enlighten someone else on the subject while enjoying the moment, I would never say no to it. So, I let my fingers move to the hot zone, enjoying the way her wetness coated my fingers. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>“It feels amazing!” she moaned loudly. </p><p>“Of course it does, but you haven’t seen anything yet,” I said to her even as my fingers started moving, her enjoyment displayed by a string of moans that left her mouth. She was truly delicious. I decided to push the boundaries even more. “By the way, I would like to try an alternative mana conducting method, if you’re okay with it,” I asked her. Her response was an absentminded nod, followed by another moan. She wasn’t in a state to really comment on it, barely understanding the significance of my question. </p><p>So, she froze when I pressed my lips against hers, cutting off another moan halfway. I kissed her softly, even as I let my mana flow from my body to hers, in a soft, lingering kiss. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>[-128 Mana]</p><p>[+4 Tantric]</p><p>Mana transfer was a silly excuse to kiss her, so I was surprised when I actually felt it flowing much smoother. I didn’t need to ask her about the efficiency, as by now, I was familiar enough with the mana flow to realize mouth-to-mouth transfer was highly superior to delivering it through my finger. Of course, that brought up another question, whether a full-blown sexual delivery would have been even more efficient. I didn’t know, but it was definitely a worthy —and potentially very enjoyable— test. </p><p>That was for later, however, as there were more immediate concerns that deserved my attention, such as the way Titania was wiggling on my lap even as she neared the first orgasm of her life, the distance between her muffled moans dwindling even further. So, when I finally slipped a finger into her entrance, it wasn’t shocking for her to start trembling helplessly as she was struck by her orgasm. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>I slid my hands to her stomach, gently caressing her as she tried to process the pleasure, while I maintained a lingering kiss. “How was it?” I asked after a minute. </p><p>“It was amazing!” she said excitedly. “I have never thought that it would’ve been that enjoyable. I missed a lot of time.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s not too late, you’re definitely beautiful enough to compensate for the lost time and if you want I’m always ready to help.”</p><p>“Really?” she asked, looking between excited and shocked. </p><p>“Of course, that was my pleasure,” I answered. Then, I decided to push her a bit. “May I ask you a personal question?” I said, and she nodded shyly. “You said you’ve never even masturbated? Is there a reason for it? Weren’t you at least tempted to it?” </p><p>“I don’t know. Learning to use Light Magic took a lot of effort from me when I was young. I guess I never had the time or the inclination,” she murmured, which admittedly, confused me a little. She seemed honest in her response, making it a bit of a mystery. Not doing it because of external pressure or some other reason might have been understandable, but not feeling the inclination for it was weird. It would have made sense if she was asexual, but from what I had seen in the last half an hour, she most definitely was a sexual being, though quite deprived. “Is it always that enjoyable?” she asked in a small tone. </p><p>“No,” I answered, and her shy smile turned into a frown, but before she could say anything else, I continued. “What we have done was just a preview. The real thing is much better than that.” </p><p>“Really, how’s that possible?” she asked, shocked. </p><p>“That’s just how it goes,” I answered, even as I let my hands on her stomach start moving once more, climbing toward her breasts, caressing the edge sensually, something that made her moan. “This was just a prelude. The real thing is something special, even earth-shattering,” I said then suddenly caught her eyes with a wide, smug smirk. “If delivered by a person that knows what he’s doing, of course,” I added. </p><p>She smirked back, though it still had a shy edge to it. “And the next thing you’re going to say is that you know what you’re doing.” </p><p>“Well, I’m not one to brag but you can say that I have some minor accomplishments in the subject,“ I said even as I let my other hand slip down to her entrance, circling around her clit to force a moan out of her. “As you can attest…” </p><p>“Bastard,” she murmured, yet feeling much more comfortable in my arms than before. I said nothing, but let my fingers dance at her entrance slowly, enough to arouse her, but not enough to build her toward another climax. The silence stretched for a while. Well, not exactly silence as her moans rang in the cave in an exciting frequency. </p><p>Then, she spoke once more. “Maybe we should explore the alternative ways of mana delivery,” she whispered. </p><p>Since my blood was mostly in the lower half of my body, it took a moment for me to understand what she was saying. “Of course,” I stammered, excited, not expecting her to actually take the recommendation that easily. “It’s our responsibility as magical researchers,” I said, though as I said that, I made sure to lean towards her ear, delivering it through a husky whisper. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she raised her bottom a bit, enough to pull my pants down. She might not be as strong as me, but she was strong enough to almost rip my pants as she pulled them down, quite excited. She was about to lay on her back, but I gestured for her to stop before laying on my back. “Why don’t you take the seat of honor, Miss Head Librarian,” I said as I smiled in amusement, even though my heartbeat rose significantly. Inviting one of the most dangerous women known to mankind to ride you in a cowgirl position was a rather dangerous thing, after all. </p><p>Luckily, she lacked the mana to take offense, and more importantly, her blush and her excited smile weren’t exactly signs of uncontrollable anger. Her legs were trembling as she hovered above me, feeling excited at the prospect. She closed in before turning her back, lowering herself toward my shaft, but I stopped her just as her entrance kissed the crown of my shaft. “What’s wrong?” she whispered, her fear palpable. </p><p>“I want you to turn around. I want to get lost in your beautiful gray eyes as we do it,” I said. She turned at me, hesitant and shy. “For the safety of the experiment, of course,” I continued mockingly. “I need to watch your expression in case something goes wrong.” </p><p>“I see,” she whispered even as she turned to face me, once again giving me a full-frontal view of her beautiful, tight body, making my shaft throb in anticipation. “It’s good to see you’re careful about the experiment,” she added, trying to replicate my mocking edge, but unable to suppress her innocent excitement.   </p><p>Then, she lowered herself, slowly engulfing me within her hot grasp. She staggered a moment when I felt the pressure of her barrier, but she didn’t let it delay her for more than a moment, getting rid of it with a stiff push, not even bothering to stop to adapt. Not surprising, considering her prowess, a little bit of pain wasn’t going to stop her from what she desired. However, as she sank lower, her speed slowed down, while her expression twisted in joy and desire. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 1%]</p><p>I was happy to see the companion tracker ticking once again, though I was not exactly surprised. After all, not only had I saved her from a deadly ambush, but also come up with a totally new way of mana transfer just to cure her deficiency easier. It would have been surprising if she wasn’t feeling a connection with me. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she murmured as she stilled, giving a pause to her task of devouring my full length. I let her move up and down at her own pace, letting her enjoy the experience before I took control. She rose up until only the crown was enveloped in her warmth, before she moved down with a torturous slowness, only to stop when she reached the previous point. </p><p>“You’re beautiful,” I whispered even as I maintained eye contact, doing my best to display my sincerity. It was not a hard task, not when her beautiful body lay in front of me in its spectacular full-frontal nudity while she did her best to make my shaft disappear from view despite her discomfort, her beautiful face contorted with pleasure. </p><p>Her sudden tightening was a nice surprise. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 3%]</p><p>“Really?” she gasped, surprised, like she had heard it for the first time. </p><p>I was about to dismiss that as a ridiculous notion before I remembered that the raven-haired beauty in front of me was also the most intimidating person around back in the school. Even without adding in her unflattering clothes and steely expression there, I doubted that many had the courage to openly flirt with her. </p><p>It was a travesty that needed to be corrected, I decided. “Yes, you are,” I said. “The way your raven hair sticks to your glowing face, the way your beautiful lips shine under the flickering lights, the way your eyes sparkle in joy, every part of you is beautiful,” I whispered throatily even as I reached up and put my hands on her body, caressing her sides in a gentleness that wouldn’t go amiss in a marital bed. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 7%]</p><p>“Tell me more,” she gasped, her tone indicating that she was already halfway to orgasm. </p><p>“The way you walk is spectacular,” I whispered. “Scary and intimidating, but it still makes me want to pull you into an abandoned part of the library before I rip your clothes off to see what’s underneath…” </p><p>Her pacing picked up speed, every repeat forcing my shaft deeper into her core. She didn’t look entirely comfortable with the amount she took, but if she wanted to push her limits, who was I to argue. “And, do you like what’s underneath my clothes?” she gasped even as she looked into my eyes, though despite her willpower, she was barely able to maintain eye contact. </p><p>“Oh, did I?” I whispered. “I found a treasure trove above and beyond even my admittedly ambitious dreams. Your shoulders are beautiful enough to breathe life to a dead man, your stomach smooth enough to make me lay on it forever, enjoying its surface,” I said with a throaty whisper, making her shiver at each word. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 10%]</p><p>“Tell me more,” she gasped even as she picked up speed, rocking her hips recklessly, unaware of the danger that was building up inside me. </p><p>“Of course,” I said. “Your breasts are more perfect than a seven node array balanced to trigger,” I whispered, letting some magical theory into our flirting, curious of the effect. It was a nice surprise when she tightened even further, proving that her librarian role was not just for show. “Your hips are beautiful, sculpted to perfection, and your pussy…” I said, lingering a bit before letting out a moan. “Oh, your pussy is the greatest sensation I have ever felt in my life…” I added. </p><p>[Achievement: Seductive Sonnet. Woo a beautiful but attention-starved lady through the power of words. +2 Manipulation, +500 Experience]</p><p>That seemed to be the last trigger she needed, as her eyes suddenly closed and her body stiffened, giving me the signal of an impending orgasm. Since I was already on the edge and keeping myself from exploding through sheer willpower, I decided to add to the moment through my new skill. I packed as much as mana I could pack into my seed before letting it free. </p><p>[-400 Mana]</p><p>[+6 Tantric] </p><p>Assisted by my new skill, I started spurting inside her like a broken dam, beat after beat filling her completely. It proved to be the last thing she needed to push her over the edge, as she exploded in cries even as she collapsed on my chest, my shaft still inside her, filling her to the brim. </p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 12%]</p><p>It took a lot for me to take control of my breathing as well, enjoying the sensation of conquering the most dangerous woman I knew while also achieving a spectacular achievement, Even as she tried to get control of her breathing, I continued pumping into her, wanting to enjoy the moment as much as possible. </p><p>But my beautiful plan was blocked by an interesting, and very unwelcome, notification. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 12%] Progress Blocked! </p><p><br></p><p> [Level: 18    Experience: 159950 / 171000 </p><p>Strength: 18    Charisma: 30</p><p>Precision: 13    Perception: 17</p><p>Agility: 17     Manipulation: 22</p><p>Speed: 15       Intelligence: 20</p><p>Endurance: 14      Wisdom: 24</p><p>HP: 1386 / 1386    Mana: 624 / 2034        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p>Basic Tantric [22/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p>
