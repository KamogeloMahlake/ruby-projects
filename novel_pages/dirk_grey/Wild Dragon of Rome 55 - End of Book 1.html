        <p>As I retreated from the burning remains of the sorcerer, I couldn’t help but lament the easy death he had experienced. Cursed and burned at the same time was not exactly pleasant, but it was quicker than he deserved. </p><p>“It’s a problem,” I muttered even as I started running, feeling my body struggle with the effort. Whatever the sorcerer had done with the mana I pulled, it was refusing to be expelled easily. I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for the dragon heart constantly pumping mana, my fate wouldn’t be too different than him. </p><p>I wished that I had the time to sit down and examine it, as it didn’t feel exactly like mana, but something more. I had no doubt that, examining it even for an hour would have expanded my horizon when it came to the nature of vitae and mana. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have time for that. I didn’t even have time to slowly hunt the remaining legionaries that were split between the two wings, their attempts to close on me delayed by the spreading fires. </p><p>For one simple reason. </p><p>Whatever that was living in the depths of the valley, it woke up. </p><p>And, it was angry. </p><p>The only thing I did was to remove the poorly fitting armor on my torso, and wrap a cloak around my right arm. Somehow, I managed to keep that a secret. Anything else they might deduce had to be abandoned. </p><p>As I ran toward Lillian and Astrid — who thankfully had enough presence of mind to stay together — I absentmindedly caressed the Spear, still unable to believe that it bonded with me. It was supposed to be impossible. Without the proper inheritance ritual…</p><p>“You weren’t just training me in tactics because you were bored, were you, old coot,” I grumbled as the realization hit. I had always thought that he trained me to be some kind of an enforcer mage for the family, and the tactics and history lessons were just a way to pass the time while I was resting between training — torture — sessions. </p><p>But, the fact that the Spear of Scipio reacted to me, just like it always did to his presence, changed everything. </p><p>Suddenly, I couldn’t help but feel despair as I imagined his letter, being destroyed by the mages that had been raiding his home. At that time, I had assumed that it wasn’t as important as the presence of a sorcerer in the compound. </p><p>But, maybe I was wrong… </p><p>“Marcus, you’re alive,” Lillian gasped as I burst into their hiding spot. Astrid said nothing, but it was because she was already moving toward me for a hug, but I could see that she was exhausted. </p><p>“Both of you, stay where you are. I’m still trying to deal with a spell on me. Stay away just in case.” </p><p>“What kind of spell?” Lillian asked. “Maybe I can heal?” </p><p>“The kind that’s cast by a dying sorcerer, so let’s not waste time. It’s already in control,” I said. </p><p>“Maybe we can carry you—” Lillian started. </p><p>“No. You two are not in any better condition. And, I can’t really risk you touching the spear,” I said. It shouldn’t harm anyone while in my hands, but it wasn’t worth the risk. </p><p>“You look dead on your feet. Is a new weapon really that important? Just throw it —” Astrid started, interrupted by Lillian’s gasp. </p><p>“Wait, is this…” </p><p>“The famous Spear of Scipio. Yes. Our sorcerer friend was kind enough to bring it to me,” I said. “But, let’s move. I can feel the presence of their horses. They are just two miles away. We need to get some before they panic and escape.” </p><p>I started jogging, which was the fastest pace I could maintain with the weakness of my body as I battled with the energy. Luckily, they were able to match my speed, but they weren’t any less exhausted. </p><p>“Why did they leave their horses behind? It doesn’t make sense.” </p><p>Before I could answer, a roar exploded from the center of the valley, one that I felt in my bones. “That’s why,” I said. “The beasts could sense its presence, whatever it is. Now, move. We need the horses if we are to ever get away.” </p><p>“D-do you think that beast will follow us?” Lillian said. </p><p>“I don’t know, but —” I started, only to stop when I felt the presence of two shifters running toward us. “Can you make me two ice spears,” I asked. She immediately did so even as it exhausted her. ”Excellent,” I said as I threw them into the trees. </p><p>I was too exhausted to hit them, but it was enough to scare them enough. </p><p>With that, we managed to barely stumble toward our target. They looked far too crazed, but Astrid moved toward them. A touch of hers was enough to calm the horses down. It was far faster than taming a wild beast. </p><p>While she was finishing that, I freed the rest of the horses, and they escaped in panic. It was a very expensive, but effective way of creating false trails. </p><p>“Excellent teamwork,” I said as we each climbed on a horse, and started riding. </p><p>“Are we trying to escape whatever that beast is?” Lillian shouted. </p><p>“Yes and no,” I replied. “We also want to escape before the other legion forces inevitably respond,” I said. Luckily, while the fire mana in my arm weakened my body, it didn’t weaken my senses, which allowed me to pick a direction that avoided the first responders from the legions. </p><p>“Where are we going?” Lillian asked even as we managed to leave the valley. </p><p>“Where they won’t be looking for us,” I responded. </p><p>“You mean?” Lillian asked, her tone hopeful. </p><p>“Exactly. We’re going back to Britannia,” I declared confidently. Things would be much easier without a sorcerer right in our tail. </p><p>“What if they send another sorcerer?” Lillian asked. </p><p>I chuckled. “I doubt it. Even assuming they can discover that we went back to Britannia, I doubt that they would be readily committing another sorcerer. And, even if they did,” I said and dragged my finger over the hilt of my new weapon. </p><p>With the Spear of Scipio in hand, I was far more confident against a sorcerer. And, even if they did the unthinkable and sent multiple, we could always escape again. </p><p>Sorcerers weren’t exactly subtle presences to my senses. </p><p>They didn’t argue. I didn’t know if it was the exhaustion, or if they agreed with my judgment, but I wasn’t in a position to care either. I was too busy trying to chart a safe direction toward the sea. </p><p>A while later, a commotion caught my attention. Even from a great distance, I could feel the presence of at least six sorcerers, casting spells. Yet, it wasn’t it. At the distance, I could feel the march of thousands of people. </p><p>Multiple legions were mobilizing. </p><p>However, for once, I wasn’t afraid that I was the target. Not when I could see a pair of huge wings poking through the tree canopy at the center of the valley.”  </p><p>“Well, that answers a question,” I commented in a tone of awe and shock. I would have assumed that I was too spent to feel any strong flare of emotion, but it clearly wasn’t the case. </p><p>But then, how many times would one see a living, breathing dragon that confirmed their existence. </p><p>It looked like the name of the crystal was not just a coincidence… </p>
