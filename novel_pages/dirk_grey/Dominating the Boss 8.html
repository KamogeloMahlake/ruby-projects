        <title>Dominating the Boss 8</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>It was Monday, and I was back at work, sitting on my desk at my newly assigned office. I couldn’t say I was perfectly comfortable. The furniture I had ordered was yet to arrive, making the room feel like a loaner, but it still beat the hellhole I had been living since my reassignment. In front of me, several files were open. Financial reports for the department. </p><p>An extreme sense of pleasure filled my body as I went through the paperwork, searching for another trail of evidence to ‘accidentally’ stumble into another irregularity, which then would be presented to Natalie as a random finding which needed instant correction, as it was clearly a mistake that needed to be fixed. </p><p>But admittedly, the anticipation of another revenge session wasn’t the reason for the rush of pleasure that kept me in the edge of orgasm. That honor went to Brenda, who was currently under my table, her blond hair covering my lap, her lips around my girth as she bobbed her head repeatedly in an effort to push me over the edge. Quite enthusiastically as well, I must add. I was impressed with the speed she adapted to her new station. I hadn’t even needed to touch her head as she did her best to devour the entirety of my shaft. </p><p>“Perfect,” I murmured as I came across a mistake. Brenda tried to pull back, but I pushed my fingers through her hair, preventing her movement. “I’m not talking to you, sweetheart, go on with your work,” I said even as I examined the details of the bill, to see whether it would lead to me to the direction I wanted. It was much easier to audit someone when you already knew where the bodies were buried. You just needed to find a path that looked plausible from a glance, and voila, you were there. </p><p>With the evidence I was searching in front of my fingers, the next step was to call Natalie for another talk. I decided to send Brenda to call her, because I knew that such a visible sign of encroachment into her territories would annoy her even further. Too bad for her that she could do nothing to get back, not when her career was balanced against my checkbook. </p><p>Of course, I had no intention of sending Brenda away before she finished her current task. But I was a kind boss, so I decided to assist her. My right hand joined the left over her head, then I pushed her down without warning, hard enough to lodge my shaft deep into her throat. She took it like a champion, just softly gagging a few times even as my crown clogged her breathing. I kept her down several more seconds, then allowed her to pull out for a breath. A few more repeats, and I was filling her mouth with my seed. </p><p>When she pulled back, her cheeks were puffed with an attempt to contain my seed, but impressively, none of it stained her lips. “I’m impressed, Brenda. You’re a quick learner, just as I like,” I said, patting her head gently as she swallowed my seed, the flare of anger barely surviving a second in her sea of submissiveness. “Go and fix your makeup,” I ordered. “Then, I want you to send Natalie to my room. Say her that I need to talk with her about something important.” </p><p>“No,” she stammered. I understood the reason for her hesitance. She might be inefficient when it came to academics, but she was quite smart when it came to understanding office politics. And calling Natalie to my room in short notice was insulting enough. Using her own secretary for delivery just enhanced it. And Brenda was savvy enough know that her temporary role as my emissary would do nothing to blunt Natalie’s anger towards her, especially since she couldn’t lash out to me, making Brenda end up as the victim. All told, her panic was justified. Too bad for her, that I had no intention of catering to her disobedience. </p><p>“Did you just talked back to me,” I said. A flash of panic passed through her face as she realized the gravity of her mistake, but it was too late. “Stand up,” I ordered. She stood up, her legs trembling. “Turn back, and put your hands on the desk,” I added. She was quick to follow it, uncaring of the fact that her skirt, short enough to barely cover her bottom while she was standing straight, slid up, revealing her choice of panties for the day. I put my fingers on the small of her back, where the low-cut of her panties ended. “You know what is next, right, slut,” I murmured. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, her trembling, vulnerable voice enough to stiffen my shaft once more. </p><p>“Good, because you seem to trouble learning I don’t like the back-talk.” My touch slid down, caressing her naked flesh. Then, without a warning, my touch turned into a spank, echoing in the room. “Let’s see, maybe a physical reminder would work better.” She whimpered. “I want you to count them,” I said as I spanked her once more. </p><p>“Two,” she moaned helplessly. </p><p>“Do I need to educate you in maths as well,” I said, even as another spank landed on her bottom, this time on the opposite cheek, making her redness symmetric. “You need to start from one.” </p><p>“One,” she mumbled between her bitten lips, trying to keep her voice contained. </p><p>I let out a defeated sigh, overdone on purpose. “Speak clearly,” I added, even as I slapped her bottom once more. </p><p>“One,” she said, loud and clear discounting the soft tremble in her tone. I shrugged. I had expected her to move up, which would give me an excuse to roll-back the count. But even I couldn’t get everything I wanted, I thought as I continued spanking Brenda, who followed up by counting. “Ten,” she moaned after a while, her voice mixing up with a gasp as I dragged my fingers over her panties, her wetness evident even through the fabric. </p><p>I leaned forward, my breath falling on her neck, her body trapped between the desk and my body. “The last one seemed to be a bit off. Maybe we should take it from the beginning.” Her body froze in a manner I would have categorized as fear without my familiarity with her reaction. She was excited enough to beg me for a repeat, but smart enough to realize doing so would just backfire. “Or maybe not,” I added, amused by the sudden flash of disappointment going on her face. </p><p>I let it slide uncommented, pulling open the bottom drawer of my desk instead. Hearing the noise, she tried to turn to check the source. I grabbed her hair. A sharp tug was enough to make her stand still, though it also had another nice effect, smashing her bottom against my erection. She wiggled her bottom softly. It was a tempting idea, but not tempting enough to make me abandon my plan. </p><p>I leaned down and pulled down two items. A small bottle of lubricant, and an anal plug that shouted its presence thanks to its bright pink color. Brenda strained her neck to see what I just pulled, but I kept them in an angle that she couldn’t see. “You’re being a naughty girl,” I said, my palm meeting with her flesh once more, darkening its redness. “Stop trying to get a peek.” </p><p>That turned out to be enough to remind her about her place. First, I freed my shaft from the confines of my pants, as it was getting quite stuffy in there. Then, I grabbed the edge of her panties, dragging them down in a torturous slowness, ignoring the way she trembled in anticipation. I let them go when they were around her knees, and focused my attention on her entrance, sopping wet with anticipation. I caressed them for a second, but hadn’t dallied for long. Her trembles were beautiful, but I had another hole in mind. </p><p>My gaze fell into her puckered hole as I opened the bottle of lubricant, spreading it over the plug that was going to slide into that hole moments later. I rested my shaft against her slit, teasing slightly. Her bottom rose in response, giving me a better angle to slide inside. It was lucky that my door had a lock, leaving me free to use it -and her- however I wished. </p><p>“You want it, don’t you, you dirty slut,” I murmured even as I slid the top of my shaft inside her. She just moaned in response. Normally, I would be quick to inform her about my displeasure when she failed to answer a direct question, but for once, I decided to cut her slack. In a moment, she would have enough to keep her occupied and more. </p><p>A surprised shout escaped her mouth as I pressed the well-lubricated dildo against her puckered hole. “Silence,” I ordered even as slid my shaft deeper into her without warning. Her mouth opened in preparation of an even bigger shout, but I was ready for it. I pressed my empty hand against her mouth, muffling her voice. </p><p>I kept my hand over her mouth even after her cries subsided, replaced by moans as I continue to push inside her repeatedly. After all, fun as it was, it was just the appetizer, with the main event still awaiting. “Are you ready for it,” I asked. I felt her stiffen at my question, but didn’t wait for an answer before sliding the thin end of the plug inside her. She achieved the impossible, tightening even further as I struggled to push it into her back door. </p><p>“Holy shit, you are tight. Don’t tell me it’s the first time it’s being used.” She gave no answer, not that it was necessary. The sudden blush on her face, thicker than anything I had the pleasure of seeing on her face, was more than enough as an answer. “That’s amazing. Who would have guessed that I would be lucky enough to get your only remaining cherry,” I continued cheerfully as I pushed the dildo deeper, my shaft sliding in and out of her tunnel repeatedly. </p><p>Minutes later, I pushed the plug deeper in one last push, lodging it completely into her bowels, earning one last earth-shattering cry from her which made me glad that my hand was still over her mouth, the only thing that prevented the office drones from rushing in. “Try to keep your voice low, slut,” I ordered. “Or do you want everyone to rush here, to see you bent over on the desk, panting like a bitch in heat.” </p><p>She gave no answer, but even I wasn’t merciless enough to blame her for it when a blank expression covered her face, signifying the overload of pleasure she was experiencing. She seemed to enjoy the invasion of her alternate hole more than I would have first thought. Soon, she collapsed over my desk, her arms trembling too badly to support her weight. I let go of her mouth in favor of sinking my fingers into her bottom, and started slamming into her mercilessly. </p><p>Her grip around my girth tightened even further as her juices gushed out, pulling me dangerously close to a climax of my own. I barely managed to pull back, spraying her bottom with my pearly liquid, contrasting brightly with her ass, which burned bright red after my merciless spanking. “I hope that was enough to make the lesson stick,” I murmured as I fixed my clothing. “Otherwise, I might need to bring out a few toys to make the lesson permanent.” </p><p>She nodded absentmindedly, still under the effects of the monumental climax she had suffered through. Then, my words managed to infuse through her haze, panic blossoming on her face once more, but it was edged with anticipation, suggesting that my threat resonated with more than her fear. “Understood,” she said, her gasping tone tempting me to push her down to continue our adventure. </p><p>“Good, then go and ask Natalie to visit me. We have things to discuss.” At my words, an alarmed expression went through her face, but it was mellower than the first time, showing the session worked as intended. Another moment passed with indecision, then she nodded. “Good, but don’t forget to visit the bathroom before her office. You’re a mess.” </p><p>Once again, she nodded, then stood up despite her trembling legs. Her hand reached towards her bottom, trying to reach the head of the pink plug on her bottom, but my fingers, wrapping around her wrist, preventing her from doing so. “That stays,” I ordered. </p><p>“But-” she managed to say before I grabbed her hair, tugging hard. </p><p>“I said, it’s going to stay for the day.” I kept my gaze on hers until she nodded helplessly. “Good, and don’t even think about removing it during the day. You never know when I might decide to check.” </p><p>With that resolved, she quickly fixed her clothing, then walked out. It was a pleasure walking her to get away, each step was taken gingerly, trying to accommodate the presence stretching her tight hole. </p><p>It was a fun sight. </p><p>  <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong> <strong>     *****</strong>  </p><p>I knew who was on the other side of the door as soon as I heard the knock, as currently, there was only one person in the company that had the need to visit my room while displaying obvious signs anger. “Come in,” I called. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when the door opened, only to reveal Natalie. She was dressed in a power suit, sharp black jacket over her spotless, impeccably ironed shirt, complete with a tight pencil skirt and black stilettos. The business equivalent of plate armor. It was different than her usual ensemble, a mixture of stylish and relaxed. She clearly wore it in an attempt to compensate for what had happened during the weekend. Too bad for her, for me, it only highlighted her weakness, and I had more than one way to break through her openings. “You ‘called’ me,” she spat out. </p><p>“Why don’t you come in,” I said, gesturing to a chair.</p><p> She walked there, but her face was sharp enough to cut steel, her steps echoing on the room. She stopped in front of my table, but instead of sitting down, she chose to watch me from a standing position, trying to seem intimidating. A waste of energy, as it made her look even more vulnerable, as it was quite difficult for her to intimidate me after our latest encounter. “Is this about the weekend! We agreed to never talk about it!” </p><p>“Calm your panties, sweetie,” I said as I rested comfortably, ignoring the storm on her face, my words stretching lazily. “It’s not about anything that happened in the casino, or in the hotel.” I smirked. “Or anything that had happened in the plane, or plane’s bathroom, with or without the flight attendant.” It was amusing to watch her face get redder and redder as I went deeper on the list. I was tempted to go more into detail about the things we shouldn’t mention, but the redness of her face dissuaded me from that path. Not because I was afraid of her, but I needed her to be reasonably coherent for the next stage of the plan, not yelling in a poor attempt to cover her anxiety. </p><p>“What’s it about then,” she asked, her voice just a shade lower than an unrestricted shout. A voice that would have caused anyone else in this little office to dash away in panic, but not me. I calmly twisted the printouts of the file so that she could read. “What’s this,” she asked, the anger replaced with dismissiveness as she looked at the pile of papers, each covered in numbers. </p><p>“Financial reports of the department,” I said in a soft voice. After all, there was no need for me to bother impressing her with my tone, when the content did it effectively already. She tried to look unaffected, but with her face losing all of its color, it wasn’t what I would call a successful attempt. “I was going over them, and I found a couple of things you might want to go over.” </p><p>“Really?” she said, her voice cracking with panic. She pulled up a chair close where the paper lay, keeping her gaze firmly on them. “Why did you bother going through them,” she asked. </p><p>Her poor display of information gathering was enough to put a smile on my face, but thankfully, she was too distracted by the papers to notice it. “It pertains my new role as the sales manager. You weren’t expecting me to sign into the role and take over the responsibility for them without going through them, did you?” </p><p>“If you wish to do so,” she said, trying to sound casual, but it was hard with her voice trembling. “But there is no reason to bother with them. Your time is too worthwhile to waste going through the financials. We need you outside, bringing in new clients.” </p><p>“Really, looking at the numbers, things don’t seem so bad if we include the order that we had managed to get from Harrison.” </p><p>“Yes, that helped,” she said, clearly unsatisfied with the necessity of admitting it, but she was smart enough to realize angering me wasn’t a winning proposition in our current situation. “Still, a few more clients wouldn’t hurt.” </p><p>“I understand. Then, why don’t we quickly go over the numbers so we can make sure everything is in order, and I can sign to take them over, and move on the important stuff. I only have a few hours to finish them.” I had no time pressure, but I added that to give her an angle she could work to prevent me from working on them. Even now, pushing her too hard was not an option I wanted to take. </p><p>She nodded, and we started going over the documents I had prepared. It was amusing to watch her struggle to explain the discrepancies in numbers. It wasn’t that she was a bad liar. She was good enough to convince a lot of people with her well-thought excuses. Misrepresentations, typos, system errors, small tweaks to stay compliant to company policies of the client… Corporate speak at its best. Her lies might even be enough to convince me if I didn’t know the extent of her tricks. </p><p>But unfortunately for her, it wasn’t the case, so her excuses met with my good-humored but factual rebuttals, destroying them with ease. I was careful never to blame her, but continued doing my best to find different reasons for not signing my name before logging a request for correction. She tried to dissuade me from going through it, trying to look like she was trying to spare me from the extra work that would result from it, but I neatly ignored them, curious what else she was going to do. </p><p>“Would it be a bother if I come to your side of the table,” she asked, fifteen minutes after her arrival. “It’s a bit hard to work like this, my neck is starting to hurt.” </p><p>“Sure, go ahead,” I added, curious where she was going with that. She stood up with an exaggerated sigh and stretched. It was a very peculiar way of stretching, one that had put the curves of her body to my viewing pleasure, while informing me the fact that a few buttons of her blouse had been undone during our discussions. I was impressed. I hadn’t even noticed her fiddling with them. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured as she pulled a chair next to me. I hadn’t missed the fact that another button had come undone as she sat down, enough to reveal that she was wearing a lacy bra that looked far too fragile to contain her spectacular breasts. </p><p>I ignored the blatant invitation it in favor of moving to the next item on the list. It would have been a lie if I claimed I wasn’t tempted to push her over the table and take her on the exact spot I took her secretary barely an hour ago, but I kept my desire in check, curious how much she was going to push. “What about this one,” I asked instead, pointing at a line of expense with no further explanation. “It’s above the limit of discretionary expense, but doesn’t have any note or approval to justify it.” </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I caught a flash of panic that she suppressed a moment later, replaced with her face docility. “It’s Brenda,” Natalie explained dismissively. “She can be a bit careless filling the reports, since they are mostly for record purposes. But we can go and check the actual records instead if you think it’s worth the effort.” She followed with a sigh that communicated a good-natured frustration. </p><p>“You don’t seem to be that enthusiastic,” I asked cheerfully. </p><p>“Not really,” she sighed as she pulled back, though she still leaned forward to enhance her cleavage. “It’s such a waste of time, spending an hour in that dusty room, hunting for a useless invoice.” </p><p>“It’s not like I have anything better to do,” I said, once again ignoring the blatant invitation. This time, I wanted her to be the initiator. Another flag to surrender in our little game. </p><p>Her confident expression slipped for a second, revealing the panic underneath, but she was quick to repair it. “I might have an idea,” she gasped even as she put her hand on my leg, slowly trailing upwards. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said even as I leaned back, indicating that I was planning to stay passive. “Why don’t you show me what you have in mind, boss.” </p><p>Her expression slipped again, this time with anger, but I acted like I had missed it while looking into her cleavage. She said nothing else as she reached to her blouse, unlocking the remaining buttons. It parted open, treating me with the sight of her slightly transparent bra, the pinkness of her areolas slightly visible. But that wasn’t as interesting as the sight of her nipples, pushing against the fabric in search of their freedom, suggesting that I wasn’t the only person in the room that was feeling aroused. I smirked, amused by the betrayal of her own body. I could easily imagine her thoughts, cursing herself.</p><p>To her credit, she managed to keep her feelings bottled, her hand, freed once more, landed on my thigh. Then, it started to climb while gently massaging my leg. But, her gentleness disappeared the moment she reached to my belt, freeing my waist from its hold in a quick, almost desperate, maneuver. The button and the zipper shared the same fate a moment later, leaving her free to delve deep into my boxer. “Wow, it looks like somebody missed junior a lot,” I said mockingly. “You should have dropped by after the breakfast, boss. You don’t need an excuse for it. My door is always open for you.” </p><p>“I’ll keep it in mind,” she said as her hands tightened around my erection tighter than necessary. My only answer was a smile as I watched her struggle containing her anger. But even as she struggled for control, her hand started moving up and down over my shaft. Her grip was hard, but her movements were rhythmic and enjoyable. For a minute, I let her continue massaging my shaft while still confined in my underwear. Then, I pushed my boxers down, revealing the full glory of my shaft for her eyes once more. </p><p>Her eyes widened, but she had to struggle to pull her sight away from it. When she did so, she found herself looking at my eyes, filled with an amused glee. She blushed, her lips parting like she was about to say something. I was tempted to order her to start sucking, but kept my silence, leaving the initiative with her, curious when she was going to push forward. </p><p>Not soon, I learned. Minutes passed as she continued caressing my shaft, with no indication of pushing forward, happy to kill time. I looked at her, trying to look bored to remind her that inadequate service might result in unintended consequences. It wasn’t a happy message for her, but she was smart enough to understand the risks. Her hand sneaked behind her, and a brief struggle later, her bra came undone, sliding down to reveal her spectacular breasts to my sight, still leaving few marks from our last encounter. I wondered how she explained them to her girlfriend.  </p><p>Then, she left her chair, and fell on her knees in front of me, her hand sliding lower on my length. Good, I thought. She was finally doing something fun. “You better go a bit deeper under the table,” I ordered. “Just in case someone walks in.” </p><p>“Shit, we forget to lock the door,” she exclaimed. She tried to stand up, but I pressed my hand on her shoulder, keeping her in place. “Stay,” I said. “No one would see anything with you under the table, but they might be suspicious if the door is locked.” She still looked like she was about to reject, so my free hand went through her hair and pushed her head down. She couldn’t argue with my girth in her mouth, could she? </p><p>As I predicted, her struggles disappeared soon after, her head started bobbing. It was fun, no doubt, but I was already planning the ways I could push her further. I reached for my phone, and sent a quick message to Brenda, telling her to come to my room as soon as possible, but act completely normal when she arrived. </p><p>A minute later, the door opened, and Brenda stepped inside. “Hi Brenda, how can I help you?” I said before she could ask me where Natalie was. Underneath the table, Natalie tried to pull back in shock, but I kept my hand over her head, preventing her from pulling back. While doing that, I had made no attempt to obscuring what was going on. Brenda’s eyes grew in shock, realizing the exact location of her dear boss. Not that it was a hard puzzle for her, she was in the exact same spot minutes ago. I gestured her to play along. </p><p>She nodded, but still in shock. “I’m here for the bring the documents you asked for,” she said, only the slightest stammer in her tone, still shocked with the realization. </p><p>“Ah, I forgot,” I said with an overdone gesture. “Why don’t you place them on the shelf, then,” I added even as I gestured her to lock the door. I didn’t want any surprise visitor for the next stage of my plan. </p>
