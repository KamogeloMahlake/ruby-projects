        <p>“H-how is this,” Penny murmured as I turned my attention to her, whose beautiful face once again glowing with a shy blush as she stood at the entrance, visible even in the dimness of the room. </p><p>This time, she wore a robe to cover her beautiful body, though it was only true for a rather loose definition of the concept of coverage. The robe was of a half-kimono type dress than a proper bathrobe, designed to be sexy and alluring rather than to protect the maximum amount of skin. </p><p>And, most importantly, it was designed to fit sexily a petite woman, one that had neither Penny’s height nor her beautiful curves. </p><p>On her voluptuous body, the robe barely went low enough to cover her ass, and that was under the condition that she stood completely still, a careless step enough to reveal everything that the robe tried to keep hidden. Nor it was large enough to be successfully tied around her body despite her best effort, the red ribbon still peeking underneath. </p><p>Normally, such an ill-fitting item of clothing would have created an unappealing view. The material of the robe prevented that from being the case. It was made of some kind of soft satin, melding around her body completely, looking like it was painted on, leaving no room for the imagination. </p><p>Not that I needed that to imagine the body underneath, but the view certainly helped. </p><p>Ironically, the robes for men were much looser, comfortably wrapping around me. </p><p>“Give me a twirl, beautiful,” I said as I took a sip from the scotch, enjoying the sight as she shuffled her weight uncomfortably. If it wasn’t for her earlier, even more daring, costume, I would have assumed she was feeling self-conscious about revealing her body, but with that, I was more inclined to assume it was about her fledgling confidence in her clothing, especially after her previous attempt fell short. </p><p> She followed my request and gave a little twirl, confirming my guess about her robe's limited capability to keep her bottom covered. “Delicious enough to feast,” I whispered, which made a smile bloom to replace her hesitancy. </p><p>“Now, give me a show that’s worthy of your clothing,” I said even as I grabbed my camera, taking a quick shot of her beauty. </p><p>“R-right now,” she murmured as she grabbed the sash to tighten it further, her hesitancy returning with a vengeance. The soft flash exploded, eroding some of that hesitancy, and a sharp glare was enough to destroy the rest of the attitude, awakening her beautiful obedience once more. </p><p>She took a step forward, the thin material shuffling around her body to give an even more beautiful glimpse of her body, her long legs completely exposed, displaying their stunning beauty as her muscles contracted. The muscle movement wasn’t as obvious as she lacked a dancer’s physique — not that it was a problem. Losing her curves for that would certainly be a poor trade-off. </p><p>I was busy taking another immortal record of her beautiful curves, each shy step bringing her closer. As an added bonus, the sash of her robe was clearly too soft to hold against the pressure of her curves as she moved, each step making the gaping opening in front of her wider, showing off her body further. </p><p>She tried to fix it a couple of times to hide some more of her legs, but ultimately, it was useless. </p><p>When she stood in front of me, I delivered another surprise, turning on soft yet rhythmic music. “Why don’t you show me just how well you can dance?” I suggested. </p><p>“I — I’m not a good dancer,” she muttered, but under my sharp gaze, she started swaying to the music without further complaint. It turned out that her words were not a modest brag, but the truth. She was truly a deficient dancer, failing to follow the simplistic rhythm of the music. </p><p>Yet, ironically, her clumsy dance somehow worked perfectly with her cute face, reminding me of a raunchy yet cute scene from a 60s movie. Of course, that was only possible due to her spectacular beauty combined with her unique brand of innocence. </p><p>“You’re doing more than alright, sweetie,” I murmured. “Just close your eyes, and let the music take you.” </p><p>She said nothing, just trusting my words to close her eyes, continuing to sway with the music. After a few more photos, I put the camera on the side, and gave my full attention to her dance. The number of interesting poses I could find without standing up or aggressively micromanaging her pose was limited. </p><p>And at the moment, I wanted to enjoy her show without interruption. </p><p>For a while, I just sat as she did her approximation of dance, her robe slowly slipping more and more, revealing the gift wrap underneath properly while I busied myself throwing appreciative looks at her. I had a feeling that, if I put my hand on her pulse, I would find it thumping with all the wildness of a hummingbird. </p><p>I managed to suppress that desire, letting her sway ineptly under the constant thumping of the music, the robe getting more and more useless — at least in terms of the coverage it provided. </p><p>As a tool to enhance her allure, it was working spectacularly. </p><p>I doubted that her thoughts were too far away from the same track, not with her nipples hardening to the limit, pushing against the ribbon pretty effectively. Then, she leaned forward, the robe slipping even further in response to my erotic thoughts. </p><p> Her gaze found mine when she finally opened her eyes, still swaying with the music. I noticed it, yet didn’t raise mine to meet hers, instead of staying stuck to her amazing chest, which was enough to make her nipples harden even more.  </p><p>“It’s time for the next step,” I whispered even as I patted my lap. It was all that was needed to make her react. She turned her back, giving me a glimpse of her plump ass before she started lowering herself, And since I was already sporting an erection, she didn’t have any trouble finding her landing spot, trapping between her beautiful cheeks as her back pressed against my chest, our skin separated just by our robes. </p><p>Even after everything we had done together today, I could not help but be aroused. Not that it was too shocking. Penny was beautiful, alluring, dressed specifically as a gift for me, waiting for me to unwrap her. My raging erection, captured between her cheeks, even the slightest movement of her hips sending shocks through my system hardly hurt. </p><p>Her beauty was not just a spark but out of controlled forest fire, and I was just an abandoned tanker of gasoline, under the mercy of her beauty. </p><p>I grabbed her waist, enjoying the three layers of softness, the satin robe, the silky ribbon, and most importantly, her beautiful skin. She trembled slightly under her touch, but the quick movements of her hips were more than enough to convey her passion. </p><p>Especially since the choppiness of her movement that defined her movements while she danced had disappeared completely, leaving its place for a smooth, sensual movement. </p><p>Once again, a great example of eroticism. </p><p>My fingers wiggled, finding her naked waist as she continued to rock her hips steadily, like she was trying to prove that her beautiful ass was superior to Nancy’s toned one even without going the full distance. </p><p>If that was her intention, however, she needed to work much harder. That was not a slight to her, as she had an amazing ass, but so did Nancy…</p><p>Unsurprisingly, she lacked the courage to say anything even as her hips started moving faster, my fingers continuing to explore her skin, smooth yet fiery at the same time. I felt her quiver as my shaft got buried between her beautiful valley. </p><p>The sensation was good, but not as amazing as it could have been, I decided as I slowly slid my hands up until I felt the edge of her breasts, getting freer from the already-deficient hold of the ribbon as she rocked her hips heatedly. </p><p>Direct groping was definitely against the lapdance etiquette, but I had a wild feeling that Penny might let that egregious move slide, so I let my fingers continue to move up, caressing more and more of their glorious expanse, followed by reckless cupping that sank my fingers deep into her flesh. </p><p>The moan she let out in response was simply spectacular. </p><p>I enjoyed the soft weight of her globes against my palms as I squeezed them, enjoying the sudden speed her hips had picked up, my mind already on the next step, trying to decide on the optimal moment to free her from the oppression of her robe… </p><p>Yet, in a surprising display of initiative, Penny stole that opportunity from me. She slid away before I could break the rules of the private dance, turning her back to me. Though, watching the robe slide down her body slowly, revealing her smooth shoulders, interrupted only by a lone red ribbon, barely enough to hide inches of her curvy body, the color contrast was especially beautiful under the low light… </p><p>So beautiful that, even when she started turning toward me, I didn’t reach for my camera, enjoying the moment for myself… </p>
