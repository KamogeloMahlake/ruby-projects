        <p>Three hours after my talk with Natalie, I left the room, leaving a satisfied but exhausted Jenny behind, sleeping softly. I hadn’t sent the recording to Natalie, of course. Instead, I saved it to a secure server and deleted it from my phone. We could always watch it together, but I had no intention of giving Natalie something she could leverage against me, and an explicit recording of me having sex was definitely something in that vein. </p><p>I wasn’t afraid of Natalie anymore, but that didn’t mean I would ignore the basic logic. Yes, she didn’t lack the opportunities to get a hidden recording of her own, but it was very different than one recorded by myself and shared with me. That actually turned it into admissible evidence in all kinds of internal company procedures. </p><p>I could have stayed in my room and asked for room service, but watching TV while Jenny slept until the morning didn’t sound like an attractive option —and she would after our exhausting lovemaking session. We had spent enough time together for me to learn her habits. </p><p>With that in mind, I decided to try one of the restaurants in the resort, famous for its excellent steaks and extensive selection of bourbon. I was passing through the lobby when I heard a familiar, yet unwelcome voice. “Hey, boss, good evening,” called Mike, his smarmy voice grating my nerves. </p><p>Even then, when I turned, a large smile was on my lips, mostly aimed for the partner that I expected to see next to him. “Hi, Mike, ready for an amazing retreat?” I said even as my eyes met with his wife Tiffany’s, her lips curled in a knowing smile. </p><p>The smile on her face was beautiful, though not beautiful as her body, peeking through the loose summer dress that was short enough to reveal most of her curvy legs. The dress was more conservative on the topside, but it was only assuming a normal-sized chest. Tiffany’s beautiful curves had ruined the plans of the fashion designer, giving me an excellent glimpse of her amazing breasts. </p><p>“Of course, I have excellent plans for our latest product,” Mike said enthusiastically, and I couldn’t help but respond with a smile. Personally, I didn’t like Mike, not because of his lack of ethics and his willingness to use underhanded means, as I wasn’t too far from that path. I didn’t build my own company from nothing by being nice. However, his fake cheer and his unashamed brown-nosing managed to kill any respect his willingness to succeed might generate. A man needed gravitas. </p><p>Of course, it didn’t mean that I was unhappy promoting him. When I expanded his responsibilities —after his wife’s very convincing arguments while he was drunk and sleeping across us in his own dining room, followed by another long session in their wedding bed— I had made sure to put several dead territories to his expanded area, but somehow, he managed to revitalize them. </p><p>That hadn’t been a simple job, of course. It was only possible through endless overtimes and extended business trips —not to mention some unexplained spending on the discretionary budget which I subtly ignored but recorded just in case. Gifts and other bribery were a way of doing business, but also it created a true disaster if caught, so I made sure both I and Natalie were isolated from its impact if caught. </p><p>“And how is your beautiful wife,” I asked after two minutes of listening to him droning about a new incentive system. </p><p>“She is a bit unhappy about overtimes, but doing well enough,” he answered, feeling no problem answering for her even as he subtly pushed her forward. I grabbed her hand and kissed her knuckles gently while Mike smiled in a smug manner. </p><p>The smile I shared with Tiffany was more concealed, but even more amused. Mike was convinced that I had a crush on his wife —which wasn’t entirely incorrect— and secretly encouraged his wife about feeding that crush so that he could use that attraction to get more benefit from me. I knew that discussion, because Tiffany shared it with me during one of our idle chats while laying in their bed, trying to catch our breath for another session. </p><p>Mike might have some ideas about Tiffany flirting with me, something his wife agreed without reservation. Of course, he didn’t know that like a dutiful boss, I was helping to minimize the impact of the lonely nights Tiffany was suffering as Mike went to his frequent business trips, usually while she models another fancy lingerie she purchased from her husband’s newly expanded salary. </p><p>“How are you this evening, milady?” I asked, and she giggled exaggeratedly, dipping just enough to enhance the view of her cleavage. I made sure to stretch my gaze. Mike noticed it, rolling his eyes in a manner he thought to be secret. </p><p>“Charlie, come and meet the boss,” Mike said after I let go of Tiffany’s hand, but stayed close enough to get a few glimpses into her cleavage —not that I was desperate, but I wanted to ma. A young man in his early twenties who had been watching us came closer, and a vaguely-Asian looking beautiful woman followed him. “This is our new star in the southern district, and a true genius of material sciences that could answer any question our clients can come up with,” Mike explained.</p><p>Since Mike was obviously proud of him, I carefully examined Charlie even as we talked for a minute. He was wearing a well-fitting suit that hid a thin frame underneath, but it was unable to hide his slouched posture. Combined with his fearful expression as he struggled to meet my eyes, it wasn’t hard to guess he was one of those technical experts with little self-confidence. A perfect choice to support Mike’s expansion strategy, smart enough to support him, but too weak on the aspect of selling to be a real threat. His manner of speaking just confirmed it. </p><p>“So, enough about work,” I said. “Who is the beauty next to you?”</p><p>“U-Umi,” he stammered, shocked by my sudden shift. I could see a tendril of anger appearing in his eyes, but it disappeared just as quickly as it appeared. He disliked my attention, but lacked the courage to stand against the boss. “She’s my fiance.” </p><p>“Nice to meet you, Umi,” I said even as I grabbed the hand she presented, but once again, rather than shaking it, I elected to leave a lingering kiss on her knuckles. Moreover, I used the opportunity to carefully examine her looks. Her half-Asian roots were rather obvious with her black hair, dainty face, and the shape of her dark eyes, and her name just confirmed her Japanese roots. </p><p>“A p-pleasure,” she answered, but stammered badly as she said so, signaling that she was even shyer than her husband. She lacked an accent, suggesting she grew up in America rather than Japan. </p><p>“It’s definitely a pleasure,” I said even as I let my gaze down, examining her rather impressive chest. Apparently, no one had told her breasts about being Asian, because they were amazingly large, threatening to spill through her conservative blouse, making her look sexy despite her boring top, and even more boring knee-high skirt. </p><p>I let my gaze linger on her breasts, more as a test to the newly established couple —though it would be a lie if I said I didn’t enjoy the sight. They failed the test rather badly, because Charlie only managed to stammer weakly. “Sir, we need to go visit the reception,” he murmured in the end as he grabbed his fiancee’s hand, dragging her along. </p><p>“Nice kid,” I said to Mike, who was smirking at Charlie’s reaction, though his mocking gaze slipped at me, no doubt feeling superior about how a pair of tits was enough to confuse his poor old boss. I doubted his smile would be as patronizing if he had any idea about the extent to which my flirting with his wife had progressed. “A bit serious, though.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, he’s learning,” he said before turning to his wife. “Honey, I will go get our rooms, but you don’t need to tire yourself. Why don’t you accompany Nathan for a drink,” he said, sharing an amused wink with his wife, one that Tiffany shared with a smile, amused by the unknowing approval she had received from her husband. </p><p>“Sure, honey,” she said, then took a step back to avoid his attempt to kiss, while managing to look it completely accidental. From Mike’s lack of anger, I guessed that it was rehearsed. Tiffany put her hand on my arm, and we started walking. </p><p>Tiffany said nothing until Mike went to rejoin Charlie and his fiancee. “So, drinks in the bar, or in private where we could continue working on my little pregnancy problem,” Tiffany whispered as we started walking. </p><p>“Who said we can’t work on your little issue while we are still at the bar,” I whispered, making her eyes widen in shock and appreciation. However, before she could answer, I made a stop and leaned against the wall, close enough to the reception to hear what Mike and Charlie were speaking while still staying away from their gaze. </p><p>“Should I be jealous,” Tiffany whispered even as she pressed her body against mine suggestively, but her tone lacked the heat, instead sounded curious. </p><p>“Well, I was thinking about spicing our little dinner with some Asian delicacies, but if you want to stay kosher…” I murmured. </p><p>“You can’t be serious,” she whispered back, careful not to be heard. “Little miss I won’t even let my fiancee see me naked before marriage. Impossible. She won’t even sit together with you.” </p><p>“Oh, you should have more trust in your husband,” I said. </p><p>She looked at me questioningly. “Did you already talked with him about it before we arrived here?” she asked, curious. </p><p>“Oh, no. But you’re underestimating your husband’s lack of spine and brownnosing instincts if you think I actually need to say something to convince her to act. Listen.” </p><p>She took my clue, and we started to listen. For a couple of minutes, we listened to a boring conversation about lead assignments and conversion rates, before Charlie finally breached the topic. “So…” he murmured, trailing for a while. “The big boss was… interesting… Is your wife a friend of him?” </p><p>“He’s one of the old guard that actually believes that he’s suave and charming, but he’s completely harmless,” Mike answered, and I actually had to kiss Tiffany to suppress her laughter. Mike really had an overinflated sense of his own superiority, if he wasn’t even suspecting after all those months. </p><p>“Is he?” Charlie answered, his tone doubtful. “He seemed…” he continued, suggesting that his common sense was considerably better than Mike’s. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, it’s all for show. He’s old enough to have trouble getting up without drugs. He’s just posturing to save his ego.” I shook my head in amusement. Insults about age and impotence lost its effectiveness when one was railing at the attacker’s wife at least once a week… </p><p>“Still-” Umi said, trying to interject into the conversation. </p><p>“Look,” Mike cut in. “It’s your call, but he’s the one that’s going to sign on the final commission and territory assignments. If my wife sharing a drink and giggling suggestively once every three months doubles my income, I’m not going to say no. You should start thinking about it as well?” </p><p>“What are you saying!” Charlie asked, his tone even louder. </p><p>“I’m saying that I still remember you talking half an hour about your dream house, and how you two can’t afford the down-payment. I’m also saying that if your fiancee happened to visit the bar wearing a beautiful dress while we are out having a boy’s night, your year-end bonus might be thick enough for you to actually afford that.” </p><p>Charlie’s wife interjected. “But that’s horrible!” </p><p>“It’s your call, Umi,” Mike said with a little laugh. “If you find the idea of sharing a drink in a bar that reprehensible, you guys could live in an apartment rather than a beautiful house.” </p><p>I looked at Tiffany, who was struggling to keep her laughter, her red hair shaking with her every trembling breath. Mike was a good salesperson, I had to admit. A bit unobservant when it came to his own home, but nobody was perfect. </p><p>“I don’t know…” Charlie murmured. “Can you ask your wife to take care of Umi if she goes there?” </p><p>Umi gasped. “You can’t be serious!” </p><p>“Well…” Charlie murmured. I couldn’t see him, but I could see him shaking with indecision and fear, but unable to reject Mike’s sensible words. “It’s not exactly bad, if you think about it. Tiffany would be there to help you navigate the situation, and run screening if he ever tries to be pushy.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, that’s not a problem,” Mike cut in. “Tiffany guarantees that he’s a gentleman.” </p><p>Of course, I was. I always made sure that Tiffany had multiple orgasms during our meetings, even the ones we were rather stuck in time. I chuckled silently and gestured Tiffany to move before they sent Umi ahead to prepare. “You were right,” Tiffany murmured, fascinated. “I was really underestimating my dear husband’s brown-nosing abilities.” </p><p>“Right,” I said with a chuckle. “Let’s go and find ourselves a booth. It seems that we have a guest to entertain.” </p>
