        <p>In the morning, I carefully extracted myself from Anna’s arms as I went to repeat my morning exercise routine, knowing that she was far too exhausted to wake up anytime soon, an assumption that turned out to be correct, as even after I finished my exercise and returned to the RV, she was still sleeping. </p><p>It was a beautiful, inspiring sight, her voluptuous body wrapped around the white sheets, the soft lights of the morning sun spilling over her to add an interesting depth, while the pink marks of our passionate embrace still marking her skin, focused especially around her breasts, owing to my fascination with those perfect globes. </p><p>The temptation was hard to resist, so I pulled my sketchbook and started to draft a colored sketch, trying to catch the inspiration brought by the amazing scene in front of me. </p><p>However, as my pen danced on the surface of the paper, the resulting picture didn’t just contain the beautiful innocence in front of my eyes, but also the spirit of mischievousness she had displayed when she dared to sneak behind the curtain when she thought that I was sleeping, fulfilling her needs, as well as the contrast she had shown with her usual shyness, hiding her true self like a blanket. </p><p>It was why painting was superior to photography and videos. It was not just limited to capture the moment, but allowed the painter to reflect everything he could observe about the truth of his target. </p><p>And, Anna had a very interesting truth, one that I just started exploring… My pencil continued to dance on the paper as I captured more and more, amused by the realization that the little girl I had picked up to get some extra income gave me the inspiration I was searching for during my month-long journey through the wilderness. Still, it was a pity that I couldn’t just put a canvas and create a proper painting of her. </p><p>Waking up to a full-sized canvas recording her naked figure after first time would be too disconcerting, and I didn’t trust myself to stop halfway when she started stirring when I was painting. Sketching was a less mentally involved activity. </p><p>When she finally started stirring, I moved to the shower, a perfect middle ground between staying next to her and leaving the RV, signaling my presence, yet not imposing my presence to her while she processed the last night’s adventure. </p><p>It turned out to be the case as I heard her moving around the RV. Though it would be a lie if I said I didn’t hope for a sudden visit to make the shower livelier. Unfortunately, under the bright lights of the morning, her shy personality was the victorious side. </p><p>I quickly finished my shower and left the bathroom with only a towel in mind, my muscles still glistening with a thin layer of moisture. While I didn’t want to push her to anything, that didn’t exclude giving her a proper show to damage any resistance she might build up in her mind due to her doubts. After all, the uncaring, disappearing men after a one-night stand was a common cliche. </p><p>“Good morning,” I said as I stepped out, only to find her wrapped tightly with the blanket, hiding her body from the view. </p><p>“G-good morning,” she stammered as her eyes stuck to my chest. Normally, I would account that to her fascination with my muscles —not undeserved if I may say so without sounding a bit narcissistic— but this time, it was clearly an excuse for me to avoid my gaze. Just as I suspected, her shyness was triggered perfectly after a night of debauchery, slamming against her mentality in repeated waves while she struggled to acknowledge what had happened. </p><p>Of course, it was trivial to take a step forward while letting my towel slide down, free her body from the sheet that was wrapped around with another tug, and have a joyful repeat of the last night’s activities, but doing so would strain her mind even more. </p><p>I didn’t want to overwhelm her in such a manner. “The shower is yours,” I said to her instead. “I’m going for a quick swim, feel free to join me if you want,” I offered, giving her an option that was just subtle enough to allow her to chase a repeat —as her swimsuit was deliciously ruined after the last accident, meaning if she came to the lake wearing that, there would be no question about the direction she wanted to follow. </p><p>Of course, just because I wanted to give her space didn’t mean that I would let her deal without any intervention. I leaned forward to steal a lingering kiss from her cheek, a simple move that nonetheless turned suggestive. An inevitable result after last night’s activities, not to mention our current mode of dress.</p><p>With that, I took my swimsuit and left the RV, leaving her alone and blushing. </p><p>The chilly waters of the lake turned out to be a relief, because as much as I didn’t want to admit, the gentle kiss that turned her into a blushing mess didn’t leave me completely unaffected either. After last night, my body was begging for a repeat, and turning back to the allure of her body wasn’t as simple as I would have thought. The chilly embrace was exactly what I needed to keep my mind straight and preventing myself from pressuring Anna. </p><p>“A good decision,” I murmured when I noticed Anna walking toward the lake, wearing her bulky bathrobe to utterly hide her swimsuit. She clearly needed some time to process what had happened earlier. </p><p>“How’s the water?” she asked in a steady tone that sounded suspiciously practiced as she stood at the shore, her arms tight around her bathrobe. </p><p>“A bit chilly, but exactly what I needed to make an explosive start for the rest of the day,” I said, suppressing my desire to make a teasing comment about the previous evening. I was afraid that she would take such words much more seriously than I uttered. </p><p>Her next words seemed to confirm my opinion. “D-do you mind turning your back for a moment while I get in the water?” she asked, stammering and whispering even with her mental preparation. </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I turned my back, while simultaneously removing some fun ideas from the plan I had been making for the next few days, unless she decided to save herself for the nighttime. </p><p>“You can turn back now,” she said after a beautiful splash reached my ears. I did so, ready to tease her a bit about her shyness now that she was safely underwater, only for my mouth to fall open helplessly. “Is something matter?” she asked, a giggle escaping her mouth even as she blushed furiously. </p><p>I wanted to answer immediately, but I found that the words in my mind decided to take a surprise holiday. </p><p>The waters of the lake were surprisingly clear, which wouldn’t have been too much of a problem even with her ripped red one piece, if it wasn’t for one very important detail. The distorted view of her body didn’t carry even the slightest hint of red, or any other color than her own beautiful skin, not even the slightest hint. </p><p>She was skinny-dipping!</p><p>“I hope it’s not a problem, the red one is quite tight, and I don’t have any other swimsuit, ” she muttered —trying to sound confident and playful, but unable to overcome a shy undertone— as she started swimming deeper into the lake gently, her beautiful ass rising out of the water, giving me a beautiful glimpse. </p><p>At that moment, I was suddenly empathized by the sailors of the old stories, tempted by a glimpse of their own imagination, jumping into the water to chase a mirage, innocent and tempting at the same time. An explosive combination. If their imagination was half as good as what I was seeing in reality, their deadly attempts were understandable… Because before even making a conscious thought, I found myself chasing Anna, slowly yet steadily. </p><p>“M-Michael,” she stammered as she noticed me swimming toward her with a determined pace, her blush intensified even further. “Is there something matter?” </p><p>“I thought it was a good time to play water chase,” I said confidently, her question jerking me out of my daze. I still swam toward her, of course, but this time, it was much slower, like a shark cutting the path of its prey. “After all, you’re nice enough to bring such a beautiful bait?” </p><p>“Bait?” she uttered as she swam away, trying to sound playful but coming across as shy and panicked. “I didn’t bring anything with me, what are you talking about?” </p><p>“Exactly, you didn’t bring a thing… Not a single thing, not even a string…” I said even as I positioned myself perfectly to cut her path toward the nearest shore. “And it leaves just one thing I can get if I catch you,” I said, unable to hide the hunger in my tone. “Unless you can’t handle the game, of course?” I asked, still giving her an exit. </p><p>She stopped swimming and turned toward me, which gave me an interesting view of her beautiful breasts, though a bit distorted thanks to the soft waves caressing her skin. A beautiful expression of concentration appeared on her face, understanding what I was still leaving the choice to her. “I-” she uttered before she took a deep breath, which did amazing things to her bosom, straining my capability to keep myself back. Luckily, I was strong enough to resist the temptation until she opened her mouth suddenly. “Catch me if you can!” she shouted with a playful laugh as she turned back, swimming as quick as she could manage. </p><p>“As you wish, my naughty mermaid,” I said as I followed her… </p>
