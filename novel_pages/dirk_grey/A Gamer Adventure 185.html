        <p>I acted like I missed the sudden sharpness not-Delia’s gaze as I leaned forward, pressing my lips against her wetness. A guttural moan escaped her throat despite her best effort, throaty and rich, the kind that would have awakened my arousal if that task hadn’t been already completed by her unlimited beauty. </p><p>When she looked me back again, after half a minute where she did her best to watch the ceiling, her face was marked with frustration. </p><p>Not the frustration of disappointment. Even if I was keeping my abilities restricted to avoid any pesky suspicion that might ruin my plan,  her disappointment would have hurt my little fragile male pride. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t that particular flavor, but a more familiar kind of frustration, the kind that a beautiful lady carried while she tried to keep her moans of pleasure suppressed despite her body begging for a release of the pressure. </p><p>An expression that I was intensely familiar with. </p><p>I had been thinking about pulling back to ask my questions again about the mission she was trying to push for me, but seeing just how decisive she was as she was trying to keep her moans down, I decided to stay once more. Teasing my mysterious adversary was just too tempting to reject. </p><p>And it wasn’t like my current task was an unbearable chore. </p><p>Watching a beautiful busty blonde twist and squirm under my tongue was always a pleasure, so I let my tongue dance aggressively around her knob, each twirl designed to trigger a soft moan off her beautiful lips. Yet, she managed to defy that order for a time long enough to give me a surprise. </p><p>Yet, five minutes of dedicated assault was enough to finally break her determination, and a moan escaped her beautiful lips, signaling the perfect opportunity to ask questions about the mission. </p><p>I continued licking her delicious core. </p><p>Her moans continued, only to be interrupted by question a couple minutes later. “Weren’t you about to ask me questions … about the mission,” she whispered, her voice tense with pleasure. </p><p>I raised my head, just enough to catch her expression, a beautiful mixture of anger and pleasure hidden behind a fake layer of confusion, one that she doubtlessly expected to trick me. </p><p>“Well, I was, but since you seem to be so determined keeping it a secret, I decided to respect your decision,” I said, though considering my hands were still on her thighs as I said that, pushing her legs wide, it was hardly the most convincing argument. Luckily, we were currently not in a position that required a flexible tongue. </p><p>A metaphorical flexible tongue, of course, as the literal flexibility was much more important as I leaned down once again to tease her wetness with maddeningly rhythmic brushes. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t watch her expression simultaneously, though the way her body was trembling had given me enough material to imagine  the way it flickered, her mouth open, her tongue flickering out to moisten her lips repeatedly. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t completely impervious of the effects of my actions as well. My cock was throbbing at this point, imprisoned helplessly in my pants, enough to make me consider freeing them. Yet, I suppressed that desire, as getting naked would make her think that I was pushing for the next stage. </p><p>A stage that she was clearly not ready yet. </p><p>So, I continued, amused by the plight I had forced myself in. I continued teasing her core, doing my best to push her to a climax. Under my skilled assault — even if it was limited enough to maintain my false facade — it didn’t take long for her to start trembling intensely, providing me with the telltale signs of a beautiful climax.</p><p>The kind that rewarded my efforts with a sweet explosion. </p><p>Yet, even as she started breathing hard to get rid of the after-effects of her climax, I didn’t give her any space to recover, my tongue continuing its assault with a renewed passion, almost reaching the point of displeasing. Luckily, I knew exactly where to stop to her torture sweet and beautiful, the discomfort staying the kind that would maintain its unique nature. </p><p>After all, I had the pride of an expert… </p><p>It didn’t take long for her to realize that I had no intention of stopping, so, I watched as she raised her head, barely able to look me into her eye as she tried to limit the signs of frustrated pleasure behind a fake layer of euphoria. </p><p>“M-maybe I could give you a few clues about the mission,” she stammered. </p><p>Trying to watch her as she tried to hide an expression of pleasure behind another expression of pleasure was amusing, even though I didn’t underestimate the nature of her actions. She was doing her best to hide her frustration by a layer of euphoria, because she wanted me to believe that she was speaking because I had managed to extract that from her. </p><p>Meaning, she was already planning to share that information beforehand. </p><p>“Before we left the capital, a precious amulet of Her Highness had been lost to the sticky fingers of a thief, and she needs someone to retrieve it. It’s precious, because it’s one of the few gifts the late Queen had bequeathed to her before her unfortunate demise.” </p><p>“Hmm,” I said even as I pulled my head back, but still, I kept my fingers over her core, dancing at the entrance softly, not letting the assault lessen. “And should I assume the Princess wants me to travel to the Capital to find among the rats that skulk in the shadows.” I pushed my chest out proudly. “I’m a great mage, not someone that could suffer the insult dealing with that kind of rats. And if that lazy—“ I started, before forcibly correcting my words, suggesting that I was drunk enough to almost insult the Princess in front of her loyal servant before correcting myself. </p><p>“And if Her Highness thinks that I would do such a thing, she’s mistaken,” I corrected myself, trying to force a respectful tone, but deliberately adding a sharp undertone to show a wounded pride. </p><p>It was as intentional as her attempt to look lost in pleasure. It wasn’t the first time, but I wanted to remind both her and the Princess that I was too prideful, to the point of being easily manipulated. </p><p>Giving a false weakness was much better than letting them searching for a real weakness. </p><p>Who knew what they might find if they started skulking around? </p><p>“Don’t worry, Her Highness respects you immensely. You’re not only a great mage, but also a great blacksmith that could create miracles with nothing but his mana and his hands. How could she just send you deal with that kind of riffraff. No, her agents managed to track the location of the item.” </p><p>“Better,” I said. “Do you have any idea where? I can’t help her if it’s in a distant location. I have important tasks I have to handle in the school, and I doubt the Princess could convince the headmistress to allow a leave longer than a day.” </p><p>“Unfortunately—“ she started, only for a moan to escape as I flicked her knob, my fingers steadily working on her entrance to push her deeper into the pleasure. “Unfortunately, I don’t know where it is, but I’m sure Her Highness would meet you to explain. May I—“ she continued, only to be interrupted by another moan as my fingers twisted beautifully. </p><p>“May you, what?” I asked mockingly even as I looked at her face, amused by the flicker of annoyance that climbed to the surface before drowning among the waves of pleasure. </p><p>There were certainly perks to the role I was playing, especially with the excuse of being drunk enough to be reckless. </p><p>“May I tell Her Highness that you accept the mission? I’m sure she would reward you immensely.” </p><p>“You may, as long as she can give me enough reward to make it worth my time, of course,” I said, seemingly dismissively as I leaned down once more to press my tongue against her wet core for a bit more, before pulling back. </p><p>“I’m willing to meet with the Princess whenever it’s convenient for her,” I said as I stood up, deliberately leaving her on the edge. A little punishment for her daring. It might have been constituted as out-of-character for my role as the arrogant mage, so I decided to add one last sentence before leaving. </p><p>“And if you want to continue our … discussion…” I said, letting my smirk gain a salacious yet confident reflection. “Feel free to visit my room. I would appreciate the opportunity to take a break.” </p><p>With that, I left the room, leaving a sexy, naked blonde panting as she lay on the table.  </p><p>Though, despite my words, I was yet to truly accept that mission. The reason, the subtle smile of victory that danced on her lips, reminding me of an assassin that successfully sank a dagger in the heart of her target.</p><p>A reaction that was more intense than I had expected from a servant. </p><p>Even more interestingly, even as that expression passed through her face, her eyes lost their focus, suggesting that it wasn’t me that she was stabbing. </p><p>I was just the dagger… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
