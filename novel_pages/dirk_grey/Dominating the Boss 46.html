        <p>“She was really amazing … wasn’t she,” Dorothy commented as another dancer left the room without a stitch on her body while she took another non-alcoholic shot, doing her best to look excited. </p><p>“Yes, she was,” I said even as I turned my attention to the one that replaced it, careful not to meet her gaze. </p><p>It took everything I had not to start laughing at Dorothy’s attitude. As the dancers came and left, her blush turned spectacular, clearly not ready to confront their weaponized nudity … certainly not when others were in the room if the hesitant glares she sent both to me and the others were any indicator. </p><p>But, she was under the impression that she kept that a secret. Admittedly, she was partially right. Once I signaled Natalie and Jenny to enjoy themselves, they turned their attention to the dancer, occasionally enjoying a lap dance or two between them. I had the feeling that if it wasn’t for Dorothy, they would have been pushing the envelope a bit more, but with her present, they kept themselves back. </p><p>Meaning, they didn’t care much about Dorothy’s occasional glances toward them before she bounced back to me. I did my best not to feed her attitude, and without anything to hold on to, she was too hesitant to push. </p><p>I was once again glad for my decision not to allow alcohol in the room. I doubted things would have been simple if Dorothy had some liquid courage in her veins. </p><p>Luckily, when the next dancer arrived, a curvy brunette dressed in hot pants that barely kept her hips contained and a police top, keeping my gaze away from Dorothy wasn’t particularly difficult. Not that Dorothy wasn’t pretty, but it was hard to compete against a sexy dancer while she was sitting in her seat, sending hesitant glares around. </p><p>At that moment, I relaxed, thinking that we would be able to handle everything perfectly. </p><p>Then, Dorothy decided to escalate. “You haven’t had a lap dance yet,” Dorothy said to me. </p><p>“Well, I’m not exactly —” I started, only for Dorothy to cut me off. </p><p>“N-nonsense. It wouldn’t be fair if you’re not entertained,” Dorothy said as she gestured for the dancer to walk toward me. Her tone was the farthest thing away from domineering … but there was something about having a multi-billion net worth that inevitably enhanced her power, especially when I worked for her business. </p><p>“Thanks, boss,” I said, hoping that it would remind her of the power differential between us, and it wasn’t right to abuse it.</p><p>Though I was glad I didn’t have to say that out loud. Even thinking about it, I barely managed to keep back my laughter. I was probably the last one who should be saying something like this. </p><p>The dancer moved toward me enthusiastically — real enthusiasm, though it was probably about the other girls gossiping about the tips they received. We weren’t exactly throwing around money to a young athlete who had just received his professional career, but the amount we threw around was still respectable enough to make the girls very excited. </p><p>Especially since it was still early. Making a lot of money was good. </p><p>Making a lot of money when they were working on a shift that was supposed to be mostly empty was even better. </p><p>Driven by those factors, the brunette simply shook her top as she moved toward me, revealing her shockingly large and shapely breasts  — shockingly perfect considering they were natural — before she plopped down onto my lap. </p><p>“Hello, handsome, I’m Destiny,” she said huskily as she grabbed my head and pulled me into her bosom, surprising me. </p><p>Another miscalculation. I didn’t expect her to start this aggressively, which was my mistake. I expected her to start slower, taking note of my attitude before finding the right balance to make sure I didn’t get too hard to handle. </p><p>Unfortunately, I ignored several facts. I was in the room with three women, which automatically gave me a sense of security. She knew we weren’t drunk — expecting waitresses and dancers not to talk was the height of idiocy — so she didn’t need to fear a drunken overreach. I had been sitting without requesting anything, which gave the impression that I was shy and well-behaved. </p><p>And, I threw around a lot of money to make sure they knew Dorothy was to be kept happy. And, since she was the one who ordered the dance … I received the best one. </p><p>Now, in general, I had no problem being suffocated by a pair of spectacular breasts. I would go as far as to say that it was one of my favorite activities. </p><p>Unfortunately, under the circumstances, it might be the single worst move, as it meant I couldn’t see anything in the room, ruining the control I had. I shuffled a bit, hoping that it would stop the lady, but before that could work, Dorothy reached to whisper something into her ear. </p><p>One that I couldn’t hear properly because of that damnable music, but whatever it was, it meant that Miss Destiny had just shuffled to perch on top of my erection rather than pulling away as I expected, rocking her hips aggressively. </p><p>I could have extracted myself forcefully, but I ignored that option. It would look absurd for the boss lady. And, more importantly…</p><p>I didn’t want to. </p><p>As much as maintaining my vigilance was important considering the identity of Dorothy, I had been just watching the best dancers in this upscale club giving their best to seduce us … and the shows they had put on Natalie’s lap while Jenny nibbled their exposed breasts was particularly arousing, tempting me to join. </p><p>Only Dorothy’s presence kept me back. Even my resistance had its limits, particularly when there was an enthusiastic brunette doing her best to dry-hump me into oblivion. </p><p>Though, I soon found myself questioning whether it was the correct choice, as Destiny raised her hips for a moment, and when they landed back, her hotpants were not in place. Somehow, they were removed. The speed wasn’t a problem as those hot pants, along with everything else, were designed to be removed easily. </p><p>The problem: they still needed at least one hand to untie laces. And, with Destiny’s arms around my neck, there had to be another contributor responsible for it. </p><p>And I doubted Natalie or Jenny decided to join me under the circumstances. </p><p>Then, another pair of hands landed on the legs, caressing hesitantly as they moved higher, confirming that guess. The pants were thick enough that I couldn’t immediately recognize the touch, but I knew neither Natalie nor Jenny would touch me this hesitantly. </p><p>It was a surprise, a big one. I didn’t expect Dorothy to suddenly get daring when I was occupied with a dancer. Now, I understood her hesitancy much better. </p><p>I could have stopped it, but not without being forceful. Instead, I stayed focused on Destiny’s breasts, hoping that Dorothy would get hesitant soon. For all her excitement — and the crush she seemed to be developing toward me — I didn’t expect her to really push anything while Natalie and Jenny were still in the room. </p><p>I kept my attention on Destiny, wondering what I could do to hasten her retreat. First, I moved my head slightly, capturing Destiny’s nipple between my teeth, gently playing with it. It was a trick that was supposed to be enough to make Destiny pull back. </p><p>But, it seemed that I underestimated her, as she just leaned further, implicitly allowing me to play with her tits as much as I wanted. Curious, I moved slightly up, and delivered a rough kiss that would, without a doubt, leave a hickey. </p><p>She kept her position. </p><p>Whatever Dorothy had promised her, it must be incredible. </p><p>Still, I felt Dorothy’s hands pull back, which counted as a win. Now, I just needed to scare off Destiny … a fun way. I shifted my hands to her hips, mauling them wildly even as my finger rubbed her wetness. Surely, even in the premium room, that must be enough to tell her that she was in dangerous waters and pull back, right. </p><p>It did not. Instead, she moaned loudly as she started rocking her hips even more aggressively. </p><p>Well, I thought as I abandoned myself to the pleasure. At least, with Dorothy properly scared, in a situation that she triggered, meaning that the danger was over. </p><p>Or, at least, that was what I thought until I heard Natalie’s distinctive heels hitting the floor. This time, when I pushed Destiny away a bit, she responded. </p><p>Natalie and Jenny were already up, looking toward me hesitantly while Dorothy pinned Natalie under her gaze. “I think we’ll call it an early night. You know, pregnancy,” Natalie said as she looked at me. I knew her expression enough to read she was following orders. </p><p>“Do you want me to accompany you,” I asked despite knowing the answer. </p><p>“No need. Someone needs to accompany our boss, right,” Natalie said, her tone resigned as she turned to join Jenny, and they left. </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I could see Dorothy watching them depart with a smug expression. One that suggested that she was smart enough to pull an incredible trick. </p><p>Unaware that only with her identity protecting her from me that she even had a chance to play. And, as she pushed her luck, the protection from that detail was getting weaker and weaker… </p><p>She was pushing her luck. </p>
