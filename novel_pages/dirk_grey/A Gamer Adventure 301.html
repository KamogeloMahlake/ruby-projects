        <p>“How’s being a prisoner going,” Helga asked the moment I teleported back to our little hidden spot, once again bringing a dozen prospective candidates with me for Helga’s special classes. </p><p>“Not bad,” I answered with a chuckle. </p><p>It was the third day of my imprisonment, and they were yet to allow me to come into contact with the Spear, still trying to come to a decision about my loyalty. </p><p>Naturally, it took me about fifteen minutes after the guild blacksmith had left to take control of the whole wing teleport back, using another disguise I prepared to pose as my own assistant back in my forge, making sure recruiting efforts were going well despite the production slowing down. </p><p>It wasn’t like I was short of money. </p><p>I teleported back to Silver Spires to bring the best candidates, finally pushing the number of private students Helga had over a hundred. </p><p>Of course, based on my request, she only interacted with them through a very complicated and awe-inspiring illusion, introducing herself as the spirit of knowledge. The sense of wonderment that awakened helped the Divine Spark generation quite a bit. </p><p>“How about the —“ she started, but I silenced her … rather directly, with a searing kiss. </p><p>“No talking. It’s time for my conjugal visit,” I said after I pulled back. </p><p>“Really, before we even give you a show of my newest discovery,” she said. I was about to say yes, but then I stopped, recognizing the naughty way her lips curled. </p><p>For a moment, I said nothing, examining her. Her beauty was as striking as always with her beautiful blonde hair spilling to her shoulders, and her robe hugging her body. Yet, it was her smile that grabbed my attention. Beautiful as always … but with a naughty, playful curl that was normally absent. </p><p>She was getting even sexier. </p><p>And wasn’t that a was a scary thought? </p><p>Good kind of scary. </p><p>“Alright, tell me,” I said as I decided to surrender, not having in my heart to ruin her little ploy. </p><p>She said nothing, but waved her hand. Immediately, a complicated illusion appeared, representing the single most complicated magical artifact I had ever seen, impossible to discern where the magic ended and the material aspects began. </p><p>Even with my intelligence, I was barely able to decipher its function after examining it for a while … and only because its ultimate function was simple. </p><p>“A beacon,” I gasped. “One that can be detected accurately through primordial aether.” </p><p>“It’s just a prototype, and I’m not sure how long it could resist the emptiness of the Primordial Aether … but yes, a beacon,” she said, with no problem of counting the negative aspects. She was proud. </p><p>As she should be. What she designed was no joke, even if it was impossible to build in its current form — the forging requirements were significantly above my capabilities, and flat-out impossible in several locations. </p><p>In comparison, purely magical aspects were masterful, perfect as far as I could see, with several methods showing it in a way that I hadn’t thought to be possible. “What does this ward here do?” I asked. </p><p>“Ah, it’s simple. It’s there to solve the core mismatch between the …” she started, giving me a lengthy explanation, one that I barely understood despite my Intelligence stat. </p><p>Admittedly, she didn’t make my job any easier by the way she positioned herself. She stood next to me, with her hand sneaking down, dragging her palm over my erection, my pants proving to be a poor insulator against her divine fingers. I stopped listening and started enjoying her touch. </p><p>“Focus. Do you want me to explain twice,” she said the moment my attention started to wander, before I could even give an outward sign. Yet, from the way her smile widened, it was clear that she was confident in her assessment. </p><p>“Your power?” I asked.</p><p>“The position of the Goddess of Knowledge has some interesting benefits,” she said. “Including how to catch wayward students,” she added, squeezing my shaft slightly. </p><p>“Inconvenient,” I pouted, and her smile turned even more vicious. “I’ll pay attention,” I immediately corrected, happy to play along by giving an exaggerated display of obedience. </p><p>She certainly deserved me playing along with her fantasies. </p><p>I kept my attention on the glowing magical display that zoomed in and out repeatedly as she explained how every single part worked. Some parts displayed how the fundamentals worked, while the others showed some magical rules and principles that I didn’t even know existed. </p><p>She was using her new strength as a goddess very efficiently. </p><p>I enjoyed the lecture on magic … even if her fingers were making it very difficult to focus. It was difficult enough when she was caressing from outside, but it turned even more difficult once she pushed my pants down. </p><p>“Is this appropriate behavior, professor,” I teased her. </p><p>“Of course. You can’t listen to the class with your pants feeling tight and uncomfortable,” she answered readily. True, but that didn’t make her naked touch any less distracting. </p><p>She was playing for the keeps. </p><p>The explanation lasted almost an hour … and even then, it could only be described as an introduction. “Now, show me how well you understood it by upgrading the design of the physical parts,” she ordered. </p><p>What she asked of me was not a simple task. The pressure from the complicated wards alone was enough to destabilize most of the ordinary metals, which was challenging enough. Then, there was the aspect of building a correct and stable structure. Then, it had to be able to hold the mana for long, resist the erosion of the Primordial Aether at least partially … as well as some other interesting features. </p><p>Even a prototype was difficult to truly design. </p><p>Still, I started working, doing my best to improve. </p><p>Then, Helga chose to complicate matters seven further by falling down on her knees and her lips wrapped around the head of my shaft, making the challenge even more difficult. Her soft fingers stayed wrapped around the base, pumping up and down steadily </p><p>I didn’t bother to keep down my moan. “Focus,” she admonished, pulling back just enough to deliver her warning before she sank down again, this time going deeper. </p><p>I followed her request and suppressed my moans, enjoying her steady effort. Jolts of pleasure spread through my body as she started to apply a very complicated pattern of movement. </p><p>“It looks like your Domain of Knowledge is not limited to magical knowledge,” I mocked her, learning a playful pinch. </p><p>“I told you to focus,” she warned, but she was unable to prevent the blush from spreading on her face. For all her efforts to look like she was an expert on maintaining control, she was still my shy bookworm at heart. </p><p>Anyone else trying to order me around would have earned a playful punishment at best. But Helga was different. </p><p>She earned the privilege of a delayed punishment. </p><p>I worked on my task carefully, maintaining a fragile balance between work and pleasure. It was a challenge to do so with the wetness spreading around my girth, attacking the fragile balance I had built. </p><p>I continued to take many magical notes, but my speed of writing slowed down once she took me into her mouth fully, moving back and forth at an incredible pace. </p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to process the sudden rush of pleasure without moaning. </p><p>I failed, spectacularly. </p><p>“I expect my students to be more attentive,” she said … without even stopping her treatment, using magic to vocalize it while her mouth was busy. She bobbed her head, her pace changing. Sometimes, she moved back and forth aggressively, sometimes, she bobbed slowly as she savored the taste. </p><p>Making my job harder and harder, grunts turning into a long string of moans as she worked on my shaft. </p><p>Time slowed down, and I suffered a delicious torture as I tried to put the finishing touches on the schematic. </p><p>However, as we climbed toward the peak of the pleasure, our bodies weren’t the only thing that was reacting. My mana danced in her automatically as it was my habit, helping her to process the new Divine Spark she had collected. </p><p>That spark started to float once I helped her to completely bond with the environment, solidifying her domain further. </p><p>And, giving me a beautiful reward in the process.  </p><p>[+7 Intelligence]</p><p>It was interesting just how little the size of the Domain mattered as far as my benefits went. Just in a few weeks, Helga was able to catch up with Seldanna, who had thousands of times more Divine Spark to rely on along with the memories of an old god. </p><p>Yet, Helga almost managed to catch up with her initial stage. Well, at least in terms of supporting my power. </p><p>In other aspects, like actually allowing her to resist an invasion, her tiny domain wouldn’t be particularly useful. Not that it mattered. </p><p>I was there to defend her. </p><p>With the significant boost of intelligence I had just received, working on the plans of the beacon got easier. The higher processing speed allowed me to make some interesting calculations that I was unable to complete earlier, and soon, the first set of changes was complete. </p><p>Of course, the beacon was nowhere near complete … but it was progress nonetheless. </p><p>“Good work,” Helga said and grabbed my legs while she took a deep breath. “Now, it’s time for your reward.” With that, she leaned forward, her blonde hair spilling down to hide her face as she mercilessly deep-throated me….</p><p>And, soon, I reached a limit, filling her mouth. She pulled back once she managed to catch every little bit of my seed, swallowing with gusto. </p><p>“It’s a pity you have to return to prison,” she chuckled as she waved her hand, and teleported away, teasing me. </p><p>Cheeky girl, I thought with a smile, and teleported back to my prison rather than following her. </p><p>I could punish her during our next meeting…</p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 61</p><p>Endurance: 72      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 58410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>
