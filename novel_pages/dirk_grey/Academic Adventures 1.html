        <p>Another comic attempt from me. Hopefully, it's a bit better than the previous one. </p><p>I already have my renders queued up for this one, so, if everything goes well, there will be at least two issues each month for this one. </p><p>I'll try for weekly, but no hard commitment on that one. I'm still relatively new, which makes it difficult to predict the time requirements and possible mistakes... </p>
