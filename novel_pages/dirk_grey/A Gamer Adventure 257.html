        <p>I said nothing as a soft blush covered every part of her visible skin while she reconsidered her strategy to distract me, her attention once again slipping away from the magical aspects of the battle. I wondered if her whole body was covered with that blush. </p><p>Then, as if she read my mind, she decided to show me that. Her hands reached to her front, and one by one, she started unbuttoning her shirt, shivering with each step, the revealed skin just as blushed. Soon, however, I was more interested in the peek of her cleavage, showing the expanse of her breasts… </p><p>She tried to keep her expression serious, but it was a challenge that got stronger with every button. Soon, her robe was completely parted, revealing her underwear… Yet, when she grabbed her robe, her hands trembled, like she was wondering whether it was too much. </p><p>That would not do, I decided, and manipulated the vines to move once more, the distraction proving enough to focus her back on our … game. “I’ll show you,” she growled as she get rid of her robe, leaving her effectively naked. </p><p>“A daring play,” I commented. “Now, are you going to continue with your fingers … or something more?” I said. </p><p>“Something more,” she whispered before she realized where I was looking at. “W-with my lips?” she asked, her cute eyes shining with shock, yet desire was not too far behind. </p><p>“Well, that’s one option, but certainly not the only one,” I reminded her, letting my gaze dip down to her spectacular breasts that challenged the ability of her underwear to stay whole. </p><p>“You —“ she gasped, but another magic assault to the vine that was keeping me bound was a good way to distract her from the shameful nature of the event, letting her focus on the present instead.  </p><p>Though, the shameful nature of the event didn’t keep her down for long. She didn’t lose much time before her gaze fell on my shaft, which was already throbbing thanks to her earlier treatment, and the show only made the situation more intense. Soon, she leaned down. Slowly, hesitantly, her gaze jumped everywhere. </p><p>Yet, ultimately, her lips captured the head of my shaft, her mouth even warmer than her fingers — which returned to the base almost immediately. It felt like velvet. Then, she moved, slightly, her shivers enough to kill a weaker man with a heart attack. </p><p>Yet, the true effect only started when her head started bobbing. Slowly, hesitantly, yet with an intense erotic tone. As she did that, she slowly caressed the base, unsure of her movements like it was a puzzle she was trying to resolve. When her head pulled back, I was afraid that was the end, but then, her tongue darted out as she hesitantly started her task, giving a lick. </p><p>I attacked my bound hands once more, which finally earned her gaze, frustration battling with desire. “Well, you need to work harder to distract me,” I suggested. </p><p>She murmured something unintelligible, probably not too nice. Then, her beautiful ruby lips parted, swallowing a third of my length in one smooth move, surprising me with her initiative. </p><p>I let my magical attack fade, abandoning the ground I acquired, giving her some advantage in our little game. The positive reinforcement worked better than I expected. Her eyes glowed — literally, with mana — as she pushed herself deeper on my shaft, managing to swallow more than half, and only letting out one gag in return. </p><p>It was a spectacular view with her lips caressing the base while the crown started to experience the tight grip of her throat. The sensation was equally nice. </p><p>Certainly a unique experience. Spectacular, even, especially when she continued to look at with her pretty eyes colored with victory. I didn’t argue against that, as we were playing one of those rare games that her victory didn’t mean my loss… A mutual victory was certainly on the table. </p><p>I watched passively as her pretty little mouth tightened around my girth, my length disappearing into her depths. Then, things escalated even more. She started alternating her pacing, her lips tightening further as she quickened. </p><p>It took everything I had not to comment on it, letting her continue to explore her self-assigned path to victory. She mumbled occasionally, but with her mouth occupied, it was difficult to decipher her words. </p><p>She surprised me by continuing her magical attack, and I felt her magic invading the vine that kept her legs immobile. I was tempted to act like I hadn’t noticed that trick, curious how she would follow up, but then decided against it. I didn’t want to make her overestimate her abilities to cast concealed spells, that kind of thing was dangerous. </p><p>Luckily, that didn’t mean I had to sacrifice my fun to teach her the lesson properly. As she delivered her covert attack, I copied one through the vine that was around my arm, loosening its grip, enough that I could pull my hand out of its tight hold. She didn’t notice it. </p><p>“You lose—” she whispered once the vine loosened around her legs and wrapped around mine, which was the moment I grabbed her hair and pulled her down using my freed hand, cutting her words. </p><p>I didn’t plunge her down immediately. “Think again,” I said, using my distracting attempt as leverage to wrap the one that was around my arms to hers, forcing her arms behind her. “You need to be more careful about counter-attacks. Now, you can blink twice and I can take it as a surrender—“ I commented, only to receive a growl instead. </p><p>A very clear negative response. </p><p>“As you wish, then it’s my turn to distract,” I said as I plunged her head down, invading her throat mercilessly. It had been a while since I properly tasted the warm touch of a beautiful woman with everything that was going on, and changing that felt incredible. </p><p>For a while, I stayed merciful — relatively — and maintained a pace she enjoyed as her head bobbed outside her control, her lips gliding over my steely shaft. </p><p>Her attempts to attack with her mana stopped for a moment, and I used the chance to move the second vine on her as well. Bound both ways, she lost the ability to react as I ripped her top off, finally leaving her breasts free. </p><p>“Now, that’s a distraction,” I chuckled as I squeezed her nipple, which just brought a suppressed moan, but there was no mistaking the arousal dancing in the depths of her gaze. She shivered, showing she barely had a minute to resist this pace. </p><p>If I hadn’t been going through the biggest dry spell of my recent history, I might have slowed down. </p><p>For this time, I had a different method in mind. </p><p>I tightened my grip without a warning and pushed her down even faster, while simultaneously raising my hips, occupying her throat aggressively. Her beautiful blue eyes widened in shock as I rammed my cock even deeper into her throat, cutting her breathing. Her throat muscles tried to resist my invasion, but I was merciless, not allowing her a chance to succeed. </p><p>Despite wheezing and gagging, she managed to maintain her gaze on mine, with a look that was just asking for more.  </p><p>“What a naughty little priestess,” I said with a chuckle, though I didn’t find that inappropriate. After all, she was worshiping something that effectively I created, making me her … grand-god. A little worship of my trunk was nothing inappropriate. </p><p>While I was fucking her throat mercilessly, she gagged and wheezed, adding another layer of enjoyment to our little game. She did her best to act obediently as she swallowed my behemoth to the best of her ability. Her mouth opened as wide as possible, trying to swallow me down. </p><p>“There’s a good priestess…” I murmured as I let her pull back to catch her breath, just before she climaxed, her nipple still between my fingers. “Now, do you want to stop our training, or do you want to continue.” </p><p>At the edge of a climax, she didn’t say anything for a moment, trying to catch her breath. Which wasn’t easy, with my hand digging into her tits, the rush of pleasure working excellently to distract her from the more immediate aspects of our little game. </p><p>“No,” she managed to whisper after a long while. “Don’t you dare to stop…” </p><p>“As you wish, my dear Seldanna,” I whispered as I pushed her down once more, her mouth fully open under my firm assault. My full length disappeared into her mouth and down her throat again, while she did nothing but gag and choke obediently.</p><p>I closed my eyes to enjoy the sensation as she started trembling, enjoying her first orgasm … of many that we would eventually create. And, as a first-time bonus, I let her pull back as she trembled badly, her bindings working excellently to keep her from collapsing. </p><p>Bit by bit, she recovered, and her gaze found mine. I expected confusion, maybe a soft vulnerability. </p><p>I didn’t expect a vindictive smirk. </p><p>Suddenly vines wrapped around my arms and legs. </p><p>Oops. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 12</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 7352}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2050}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>
