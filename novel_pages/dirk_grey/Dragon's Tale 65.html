        <p>The implied mention of other nobles might have triggered her jealousy, but since that jealousy combined with her hero worship reflected in a very enjoyable manner, I wasn’t particularly beat up about it. “Actually, your merchant identity will help me even more. I need you to arrange a voyage to Egypt for me.” </p><p>“Egypt, why?” she gasped in shock. Understandable, as it was hardly the easiest journey imaginable, nor Egypt was the safest location to visit. </p><p>A lot of that was about the complicated nature of its political standing. Technically, it was a subordinate kingdom, but between centuries, its effective status bounced between being a literal province and a competing kingdom, and the constant power struggle between the Eastern Empire and the Western Republic, with constant switches of the mastery, was hardly something that would make it any easier. </p><p>Currently, the spectrum was closer to independence, with a generous dash of ongoing rebellion, making it a difficult location to travel as a Roman citizen, and even more challenging for a tribal barbarian. </p><p>“I’m starting to suspect that the thing I’m looking for might not be in Rome,” I said, deflecting the question, my fingers massaging her inner thighs making wonders to prevent her desire to follow up. “But there are some clues pointing to Egypt. I might need to commit to an emergency journey there, and having one prepared wouldn’t be too difficult.” </p><p>“It’s not something that could be put together in a day or two, not without raising suspicion. And I’m not sure I can afford it without other investors.” </p><p>“Why, it’s just a ship?” </p><p>“No, with the number of the pirates spawning, anything less than a fleet has no chance of going forward.” </p><p>I smirked. “Don’t worry about that, with me on board, there will be no problem.” </p><p>“Are you sure? Some pirates actually have mages on board, and even if they didn’t, fighting against several ships might be too difficult.“ </p><p>“Don’t worry your pretty head about that. I just need you to arrange a skilled captain with flexible timing and a speedy ship. As long as you can handle that in a few weeks, it would be enough for me.” </p><p>“I can easily arrange a ship in less than a week, but are you sure—“ she tried to continue, only to be silenced by my finger on her beautiful lips. </p><p>“Don’t worry your pretty head about that,” I said even as I pushed my hands under her dress. “But are sure you can afford even one ship. With this meeting, and your residence, you had a lot of expenses. The items I gave to you must be near depletion. Should I arrange something for you?” I asked. </p><p>“No need,” she said, though her blush suggested there was an interesting story behind that. </p><p>“Oh, really. That quick. Don’t tell me the magical ingredients I have given you sold for even more than I had been expecting.” </p><p>“Not that. I might … have made a few bets,” she murmured, her hesitance showing exactly who was the target of said bet. Not that I had problems with it. Using the extra knowledge for betting was just the smart thing to do. </p><p>“Oh, daring to bet on your savior,” I growled into her ear playfully even as my hands moved high, freeing her body from the oppressive wrapping of her beautiful dress. “That deserves a punishment!” </p><p>Theodora was shocked at my sudden move, finding herself without her dress without a warning. And considering she lacked any kind of lingerie underneath, leaving her body completely bare, her shock was understandable. </p><p>However, her shock didn’t mean she tried to pull away from my lap once she processed her nakedness. Her gaze already shining with surrender, it wasn’t shocking. Even when it contrasted with her true identity — while she hadn’t admitted yet, clearly related to some kind of high noble in Constantinople. </p><p>Of course, she wasn’t the only high noble that tasted the benefits of my attention. Both Olivia and Atia were high nobles, belonging to Patrician families with several living ex-Consuls. Even one of the two reigning Consuls was an uncle of Atia, highlighting her position even more. Even if Theodora was back in Constantinople, her position would be lower than Atia, likely significantly so. </p><p>However, there was a big difference. For Olivia and Atia, I was nothing more than a slave, marking me a temporary fun dalliance, a more intimate kind of entertainment than my fights in Colosseum. </p><p>My relationship with Theodora was completely different, something she was very much aware of if the way she trembled in my lap in excitement was any indicator. </p><p>While Theodora didn’t know my true identity and the full extent of my power — a trust that she was yet to earn — she was aware that both my status as a slave was a farce, and I was actually a competent mage, which was something that made me someone worthy of note regardless of my place of birth and power. </p><p>Surrendering to me despite that awareness, especially when she deliberately cut herself from her own source of power, was a tacit surrender. Though, considering she owed me her freedom and her current relative comfort if not her life, maybe it was understandable. </p><p>“So, about your punishment,” I said with a soft whisper, caressing her naked leg even as her gaze widened, anticipation growing wide. Her expression alone told me that she had spent more than one night dreaming about the moment we almost shared back in the slaver’s tent. </p><p>“Yes,” she gasped, surrendering readily under my gaze, shifting her position so that her legs were on both sides of me, her hands landing near my pants, ready to drag it down, waiting for my words. </p><p>Someone was enthusiastic. </p><p>Pity that I had a different idea on how to progress. I said nothing, deliberately delaying the order she was waiting for. I put my hands on her shoulder, caressing her waist and the small of her back almost absentmindedly. “On second thought, maybe I should forgive you. You haven’t earned that. Tell me about the merchant connections you have established.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” she stammered, panting softly. “Maybe…” </p><p>“Of course I am,” I said with a chuckle. “Tell me.” </p><p>She started explaining, while I kept her on my lap, slowly caressing her body, but limiting myself to her thighs, back, and neck. Anywhere that was a lesser priority in terms of sexiness, but still sensitive enough to drive her arousal to the next level. </p><p>And it worked just as I hoped. She started shuffling in her seat — which was my lap — which was enough to show her growing desire and the corresponding discomfort even without her fingers tightening around my shoulders. </p><p>To her credit, despite that, she continued to explain the details of her achievements. And her achievements were quite a bit more than I expected. She already had dozens of people hired, working for her, the organization completed, permits acquired, and the necessary bribes paid. </p><p>She was even able to select several products to focus on, with a detailed explanation for each, including their economic potential, the risk involved, the potential market. She even went to the level they were prioritized by existing stronger trading organizations to make sure it wouldn’t encroach on her business. </p><p>Overall, it was a level of meticulousness I didn’t expect from a high noble about trading, a task that was usually dismissed as a worthless activity worthy only for low-class people. </p><p>So much that she actually deserved a reward. Though not immediately, as the way she was squirming on my lap desperately, too shy to actually ask me to go forward or take initiative to go her own despite her nakedness. </p><p>I continued to listen while she continued to explain, going deeper into the details of her organization, each more interesting than last, almost as much as her beautiful naked body. I followed up with questions about the locations of her businesses and her residence, which she explained enthusiastically. </p><p>That part was not empty talk. With my identity as a gladiator in the middle of a turf war, I was at risk even before adding my aggressive invasions of Patrician houses — and their daughters — making the situation even more dangerous. </p><p>Having a safe house I could use in case of an unforeseen emergency was not a bad idea. </p><p>Meanwhile, her explanation continued. Her legs started to tighten helplessly, to a level of distracting me from her explanation. </p><p>Extending her sweet torture even more was tempting, but I decided against it. First, she had deserved her reward. Also, torturing her silently too long was suspicious considering the function of the room. No one was listening directly — something I made sure by repeatedly checking it magically — but that didn’t mean no one was near enough to hear an explosive moan of pleasure. </p><p>And no moans were bad, not only for my reputation, but also for keeping the suspicions of my so-called owners at bay. </p><p>“I was wrong to think you deserved a punishment,” I whispered into her ear, and she tensed, worse than my extended teasing had achieved, a tenseness that only disappeared when I finished my statement, “you deserve a reward.” </p><p>Just like that, her fears disappeared, though, admittedly, it might be less about the impact of my words, and more about my fingers finally touching her core, caressing gently. </p><p>She licked her lips even as she tried to contain her moan, my fingers dancing over her most sensitive spot, each second driving her pleasure deeper. I wondered just how long she might have resisted the call of the pleasure. </p><p>Too bad I lacked the time to explore that without making my so-called owners suspicious. “We need to make sure you look reasonably pleasured. Otherwise, my boss might be suspicious. Are you willing to make that great sacrifice?” </p><p>“I am,” she gasped immediately. </p><p>I pulled my fingers away, but before she could even show a hint of disappointment, I pushed her down, forcing her on her knees. I admired the sight of her lithe, fit body. The way she parted her hips readily, begging for my invasion with her delicious gasps. </p><p>And I had no problem delivering that invasion. </p>
