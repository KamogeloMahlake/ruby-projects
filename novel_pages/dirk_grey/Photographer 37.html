        <p>After I passed the keys to the valet, I turned, my gaze on the faces of my two beauties, enjoying their matching hesitation. The lakeside adventure left its mark on them, and following that with a day where they had to give an impressive variation of suggestively sexy poses hardly helped to reduce their tenseness. </p><p>Especially since both of them were too hesitant to talk about it in the first place. </p><p>“A good place to spend the evening, right?” I said as I gestured to the building that looked over the city just like the name indicated. Admittedly, it wasn’t the most tasteful architectural structure, but the luxuries hidden inside were enough to compensate for that little blunder. </p><p>Penny said nothing, just looking at the hotel, fascinated. Coming from a small town, she was unfamiliar with the siren call of luxury. </p><p>“Are you sure you can afford it?” Nancy mumbled, though her gaze was no less fascinated. She might not have come from a rural area, but she never had the income that would allow her to enjoy any kind of luxury. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, I have already arranged it,” I said, neglecting to mention that it was the reward points that earned us the momentary glimpse into the luxury. No need to diminish the awe they were feeling. </p><p>Unprepared for a night stay, we didn’t have a lot of luggage, but the bellboys were still quick to swarm over and pick them up. Not too enthusiastic considering the car I was driving, but still. </p><p>“Why don’t you girls go for the elevator, and I’ll be there the moment I pick up the key,” I said. They nodded, and I started walking. </p><p>I had sent them beforehand, because of the receptionist. A cute brunette. Normally, I wouldn’t be bothered, but the longing gaze she had as she looked at the camera that was hanging on my shoulder. </p><p>Recognizing the longing gaze of an aspiring model was an elementary skill, and without the girls, I was sure to swing an upgrade at least. </p><p>Maybe something more… </p><p> “I’m here to check-in,” I said, making sure to sound tired even as I flicked the camera. </p><p>“Tough day?” she asked. </p><p>“Definitely. You can’t imagine how exhausting it is to herd a couple of entitled models all day,” I said, sounding fed up. </p><p>“Oh, you’re a professional?” she said, trying to sound nonchalant, but failing to do so. Meanwhile, I passed her my ID, and after a few clicks, her eyes widened, no doubt realizing just how many countries I had been to for the last year. </p><p>Of course, they were all for the job I had been fired from, but that was hardly the thing to share with her, right?</p><p>“Unfortunately so,” I answered, and she looked at me questioningly, shocked at my vehemence. “It’s a nice job, but after a long day of work, it gets a touch exhausting, especially with the professional models. I really miss working with aspiring models,” I said, throwing a hook at her. </p><p>Her voice was considerably higher as she answered, unable to suppress her enthusiasm. “Oh, really?” </p><p>“Of course. The aspiring models, at least ones that recognize the opportunity and work hard without a complaint rather than doing their best to copy the smugness of a diva, are a delight to work with.” </p><p>“I’m actually trying to be a model as well,” she said, trying to sound serious. </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured, examining her face carefully for half a minute, until her enthusiastic smile started to disappear. “I can definitely see it,” I said even as I pulled a business card from my pocket. “Actually, why don’t we have a test shot, I should have a free slot in two weeks. Unless one of the divas suddenly decided to change the date, we can work it. As long as you’re open to travel, of course.” </p><p>“I might,” she said, her enthusiasm hitting back, only to disappear just as quick as she processed just how non-committal my recommendation was. She typed a few seconds before raising her head once again. “Maybe we can have a test shoot tonight?” she whispered. “If you’re not too tired, of course.” </p><p>“I would have loved it,” I answered, doing my best to look regretful, and her smile fell, realizing her opportunity was slipping. Perfect time to drive the dagger, I realized. “Unfortunately, I have been in those regular rooms before, and they are too small to have a proper shoot. I need a higher ceiling to properly set up the light.” </p><p>She took a deep breath to suppress her brewing excitement, thinking she had just found her big break opportunity. She typed her keyboard a couple of times. “It’s your lucky day,” she suddenly murmured. “We have an upgrade for you.” </p><p>“Oh, what a nice coincidence. Which one?” I asked despite being fully aware of which one was the target. I had been to the hotel, and there was only one floor with higher than the usual ceiling.  </p><p>“Our grand suite, actually,” she whispered as she leaned forward, trying to keep her voice whisper. I understood the reason for it, as no doubt she was pushing for that upgrade. She was important, but not that important. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “You have my number, and send me a message. We’ll arrange a meeting time.” With that, I turned and left, leaving an excited cute brunette behind me. </p><p>I didn’t feel guilty, because the offer wasn’t even a lie. Due to the loose clothing she was wearing, I wasn’t able to make a good judgment on her body, her face was certainly beautiful enough to get some success. </p><p>If she was willing to put the time, of course.</p><p>I walked to meet with the girls, who were waiting for me in front of the elevator. Luckily, the elevator area wasn’t directly visible from the reception. I didn’t want my latest model candidate to realize I had two models accompanying me. </p><p>I wanted to keep that part as a surprise. </p><p>“Which floor?” Nancy asked as we stepped into the elevator. </p><p>“The top floor, of course,” I said, smirking widely. </p><p>“Really,” Penny interjected while Nancy sent a suspicious glare, aware of the price such a location would go. “Three rooms on the top floor? How did you afford it?” </p><p>I chuckled even as I wrapped my arm around her waist. “Who told you that there would be three rooms.” </p><p>“We have only two rooms?” Nancy said, though her tone betrayed that she realized where I was driving at. I chuckled. “Just one,” she said, her panic growing. </p><p>“Is it a problem, after everything?” I asked, which put a huge blush on her face. </p><p>“One room for three people? I’m afraid it won’t be comfortable,” she said, quick to find a different explanation. Before she could comment further, the elevator stopped.</p><p>I quickly moved to our room, unlocking it with a flick, gesturing them to walk forward. “Do you think it’s enough,” I said, enjoying the simultaneous gasps as they took the view of the room. </p><p>“It’s amazing,” Nancy gasped as she walked around, taking the sight of the luxury room. Nancy clearly shared the same approach, but she reacted by freezing in shock. </p><p>Their reaction was understandable, as the grand suite definitely lived to its reputation. It was a touch too gauche for my tastes, going more for a showy classical approach rather than a more understated modern style, but they compensated that by embracing that extravaganza perfectly. And with a large bedroom, a connected living room, a huge bathroom, with a tub large enough to almost classify as a pool. </p><p>I watched them walk around the room, almost in a daze, before chuckling. “So, do you think we’ll be able to fit comfortably? </p><p>“I guess,” Nancy murmured, not happy that her excuse had been destroyed spectacularly.</p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I slapped her ass. “Why don’t you be a dear and start preparing the bath, we definitely need one after everything. </p><p>“W-we?” Nancy suddenly stammered, though Penny’s expression showed she shared her attitude. </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I pointed at the bath. “Look at the size of that thing, it can easily comfort all three of us.” </p><p>“Size isn’t a problem.” </p><p>“And what is the problem,” I said mockingly even as I took a large step forward Penny, closing in the distance as I slipped my hands under her costume to caress her naked stomach for a moment before slipping them down, quickly unbuttoning her pants and pulling them down, revealing her suspiciously-damp panties. “Don’t tell me you’re worried you can’t handle a touch of nudity, after everything today.” </p><p>Nancy’s rebellious streak didn’t disappoint. “Of course not,” she assured before she could even realize what she had said, and her pride, preventing her from taking her words back, preventing her from saying anything else. </p><p>While she moved to her task, I turned to Penny. “Let’s prepare you for the bath,”  I said as I pulled off her top, which, thanks to the absence of a bra, left her spectacular breasts free for my attention… </p>
