        <p>Once again, I was confronted with the difficult choice of deciding whether to play safe or push the opportunity to the limits despite the risk. </p><p>Once again, I came in favor of the latter. </p><p>How could I not, after spending weeks under the condescending attention of the woman in front of me. Now that she was in front of me, wearing such sexy clothes, willing to obey my desires for the next hour as she planned to drug me, how could I not push her to the limit.  </p><p>Then more… </p><p>“You were about to tell me about the location of a lesser item, to establish a working relationship,” Sapphire reminded me even as she twirled, straining the capabilities of her velvet top to contain her perky breasts. </p><p>“No wonder you can keep control of the Empire without royal blood, even after your dear husband died more than a decade ago,” I commented with a smirk. “You keep your mind on what’s truly important, not like those puffed up nobles,” I commented. “I wonder how you were raised to gain such a clear mind.” </p><p>“I’m just another of those —as you say— puffed up nobles,” she answered, quite quickly. “I just had the fortune of getting the attention of my late husband.” </p><p>“I understand,” I said. I could have questioned her pointless statement, but her words gave me an opening to push through. “Let’s see how you kept the attention of our dear king all those years.” I grabbed her velvet corset and pulled it hard without giving a warning, leaving her top naked, leaving only her skimpy panties for coverage. That, and the lacy mask that covered the upper half of her face.  </p><p>“You dare!” she exclaimed even as one of her arms rose to cover her breasts —which spectacularly failed considering the size of her bosom and thinness of her arm— while the other prepared to cast a spell. </p><p>“No need to be harsh,” I said even as I stood up. “I’m just offering a deal, nothing else. I can walk away if the entertainment is subpar.” </p><p>The blues of her eyes flared with anger, reminding me that she was the queen of an Empire, one that could easily mobilize hundreds of thousands of soldiers with one word. However, even more impressively, the flare was gone the next second, proving her abilities as a respectable opponent. </p><p>She let her arms fell, removing the threat of assault and her poor attempt to protect her modesty at the same time. I licked my lips as I examined her nakedness. Her body was delicious and perky, impossible to be positioned as a mature woman. I would have been surprised by it if I hadn’t watched her using Tantric magic to steal magic power from her watchers to reinforce her own magic, but through such an illegal method, it wasn’t too unexpected for her to maintain her looks. </p><p>I sat back and gestured her to continue, not bothering to utter even a word. She clearly didn’t like such a move, but considering her circumstances, her obedience was not surprising. She even managed to suppress most of her enthusiasm when I took a sip from my drink, leading her to believe that her plan to drug me was going to succeed. </p><p>However, I wanted her to pay, even for that illusion. With a bent finger, I gestured her to walk closer, and she did so while letting her body twist sexily following the soft music, a great contrast to her steely face —which was another part of her plan in my opinion. She was deliberately displaying her resistance inefficiently to make me underestimate her, therefore distracting me from her true weapon. Not a bad plan. </p><p>Too bad that she was playing a rigged game. </p><p>When she came near, I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her to my lap, interrupting her dance. She squirmed a bit, but not to a point that she could actually get away. “You prepared me a delicious drink. Too bad that the presentation is lacking,” I murmured before I pressed my mouth to the valley between her breasts, and poured some of the drink just below her neck. </p><p>She flinched as my lips touched her skin, but that didn’t prevent her from leaning back to allow me to drink it without a loss. After taking a gulp —and burning the poison subtly— I brought my lips to her nipples, dragging my tongue along. An involuntary gasp escaped her mouth as I felt her nipple harden between my lips and under the assault of my tongue. </p><p>I smirked. Finally an honest response about what she was feeling. </p><p>“Such a delicious drink,” I said even as I loosened my hold around her waist, confident that she wouldn’t escape, not when she bet herself on me consuming her drink. I decided to put my idle hand to better use and grabbed her ass aggressively, helping myself to her bountiful bottom. Her hips and ass were deliciously large, but her skin was still flawlessly pure. If I closed my eyes, I could have easily convinced myself that Aria was on my lap instead, enjoying my double assault obediently. </p><p>“Thank you,” she managed to utter between her gritted teeth. “I’m proud of my own mixing abilities.” </p><p>“Good girl,” I said even as I slapped her ass, the sound of the smack echoing loudly in the room, earning another angry glare, but it only made me more aroused, to the point that my pants turned into tools of torture. I took another sip from the drink to mollify her anger, once again through her tits, of course. “But you’re not leveraging your advantages to the limit,” I said as I grabbed her hand, and brought it to my lap. </p><p>To her credit, she didn’t lose time arguing before using her thin, delicate hands to free my cock from its imprisonment. Her soft, feminine fingers wrapped around my girth even though they failed to connect, and started moving up and down in a complicated rhythm, with alternating pressure. Delicious, I thought. It was certainly one of the best handjobs I had ever received, sending waves of pleasure through my body. And considering her competition was the professionals I could access as a Dark Lord, it was a rather hefty compliment. </p><p>“No doubt you could keep the old Emperor loyal, without even a concubine, for years,” I commented before biting her tits playfully. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she commented angrily. </p><p>I smiled, but it was a dark, cold smile that was packed with a threat. I straightened a bit, and put my drink to the side. “Oh, really?” I said. “I’m pushing my luck?” I uttered those words softly, indicating that she had managed to touch my nerve. A believable act, but it wasn’t true. She had touched my nerve long ago, I was just seeking the appropriate opportunity to fake an outburst to push her to the desired position without making her suspicious. “Do you really want to see how I push my luck?” </p><p>A fragile display of male ego was just what I needed. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she uttered immediately, her tone and cadence perfectly measured to awake pity and mercy by conveying a sense of feminine weakness. She was truly an amazing actress, enough to make me pity the bad hand I was forcing her to play. Anyone else, she could have easily played like a toy. </p><p>“Too late,” I said sharply. “I was going to treat you nicely, accounting for all the effort you had put to create such a beautiful Empire, but you just needed to push.” </p><p>“Please-” she started, only to be silenced by a spank on her bottom, this time hard enough to make her yelp in pain. She might be an amazing actress and manipulator, but she was not used to pain the slightest. </p><p>“From now on, I don’t want to you say anything else than yes, sir, and no, sir,” I said, doing my best to hide my reaction to the beautiful view of her shaking body. “Understood?” </p><p>If the looks could kill, I would be dead. Her angry glare was hot enough to melt steel, carrying the full weight of a Queen. Unfortunately, she was not in her seat of power, and lacked the ability to handle such a task herself. She was paying for her overspecialized skill set. “Yes, sir,” she finally said after almost a minute of silence, grudgingly. </p><p>“Good. Now, do you want to learn the location of the Eternal Core?” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she answered, this time immediately. </p><p>“Do you want to discover the location of the secret stash of the Dark Lord tonight so that you can assess the quality of my information?” </p><p>“Yes, sir.” </p><p>“Are you ready to show your sincerity in turn?” I asked even as I grabbed her ass, squeezing softly to remove any confusion about how she could show her sincerity. </p><p>“Yes, sir.” </p><p>“Are you going to be rebellious little slut?” </p><p>That made her stop for a moment, and I spanked her ass in a warning. “No, sir,” she answered, but her tone was flat. </p><p>“Nice reply. A bit slow, and your tone could use some work, but overall, passable. I’m an understanding man. After all, not every day a Queen needs to whore herself just to get some scraps of information.” </p><p>Her eyes were burning, but she nodded obediently still. “Thank you, sir.” </p><p>I chuckled as I caressed her ass, then grabbed my drink and took another sip through the beautiful valley between her breasts. “Good, you’re learning.” Then, without waiting for an answer, I started kissing and biting her tits recklessly, but it was just a distraction. Meanwhile, my other hand grabbed her panties and ripped them off with one smooth move, leaving her core naked, bereft of the last piece of protection. “On your knees, slut,” I ordered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said again, this time, her tone was trembling. </p><p>“Good, get down here and convince me just how much you value the information I’m going to provide," I said, enjoying the sense of superiority as she crouched between my legs, her trembling hands pressing against my legs. Just to give her a bit of hope, I drank the rest of the drink in one long sip, giving her hope that as long as she could excite me sufficiently, I would fall unconscious, and she would win. </p><p>What a coincidence that she was in the perfect position to arouse such excitement. </p><p>And what an excitement it was. I had the Queen of the Empire on her knees in front of me, resting her hands on my thighs, ready to give me the highest-class service I had ever received. I had seduced my fair share of strong women, heroines, duchesses, even Queens of various small entities, but the ruling Queen of the biggest empire of the world was something truly special… </p><p>I watched as she got closer and closer to my shaft, her eyes flickering weakly before she ultimately closed them. I waited until her lips pressed against the head to ask a question. “So, when was the last time you have given a blowjob?” </p><p>My question cut through her weakness, unearthing her anger once again. However, she was strong enough to murmur an answer. “It has been about two decades, sir,” she answered. </p><p>She didn’t explain more, but I could easily guess the circumstances. She was likely pregnant with her daughter at that time, and used it to keep the Emperor’s attention on her, preventing him from straying. It was my ‘honor’ to break such a long streak. “Good work, slut,” I commented mercilessly, while caressed her head with a softness that contrasted my words. “Now, start.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she murmured, following my gentle direction, hovering just inches away from my shaft before she parted her lips, her brunette hair —the original blonde still hidden with the spell— creating a screen. I didn’t want to miss the view, so I gathered her hair in my soft grasp. </p><p>Without further delay, she finally gave in, lowering her head and taking the crown of my cock into her mouth, her lips sliding across softly. I couldn’t help but groan in satisfaction, more about the sheer achievement of the moment than the physical dimension of the pleasure. If I hadn’t ‘warmed up’ beautifully thanks to the assistance of Princess Aria, I would have exploded with her first touch. </p><p>She stiffened as I groaned, but that didn’t prevent her from devouring the crown and the following inch before applying a steady suction. She then pushed her head back down, taking half of my shaft in one move, proving that while it had been long since she had delivered such a task, her skills were still sufficiently impressive. </p><p>My hips rose to meet her motion as she bobbed her head, turning her repeated movements into a true delicacy, especially as she slowly lost her ability to hide her fury. After all, no matter how calm she was, what I was doing had long past her bottom line. But a combination of two factors kept her going. First, she wasn’t unfamiliar with using her body to gain benefits, like dancing to steal the life force of other nobles, or using her femininity to seduce the previous Emperor, therefore rising to the throne. Second, and more importantly, she was convinced that I was poisoned, and she just needed to play along before she could exact her revenge. </p><p>Maybe she was even imagining locking me in her secret cell, imagining how to torture me along with the ‘Dark Lord’. Honestly, I was tempted to play along, just to see her face when she realized my identity. Too bad I had too many plans to risk something like that. </p><p>For a while, I stayed passive, letting her set the pace as she continued to bob her head, her lips gliding over my steely shaft. When she gave a slow, wet kiss that made my insides tingle, it surprised me a bit, even though her aim was obvious. Soon, her hands joined to the battle, caressing the bottom of my shaft repeatedly as she tried to bring me to completion, following the rhythm of the music. I had no doubt that if I let her continue like this, it would take just minutes for her to achieve her aim, progressing our little game to the next stage. </p><p>Too bad for her that I had a different method in mind. </p><p>I grabbed her head without a warning and pushed her down while simultaneously raising my hips, occupying her throat in a surprise invasion. Her beautiful blue eyes widened in shock as I rammed my cock deep into her throat, cutting her breathing, ignoring her ineffectual push. Her throat muscles tried to resist my invasion, but I was merciless, not allowing her a chance to succeed. </p><p>Despite wheezing and gagging, she managed to raise her eyes to meet with my gaze, with a look that promised pain and torture. Unfortunately for her, I already knew their limits in terms of torture, which was not even close to faze me even when helpless and under her control. While I was fucking her throat mercilessly, the same threat turned into a spice to color our rough dance further. </p><p>She was smart enough to realize that too under my victorious gaze, and closed her eyes, doing her best to act obediently as she swallowed my behemoth to the best of her ability. Despite her hesitancy, she did her best to open her mouth as wide as possible, trying to swallow me down. </p><p>“There’s a good girl…” I murmured as I let her pull back to catch her breath, caressing her hair kindly as another mocking gesture. Her relief was short-lived, however, as I pushed her down just seconds later, forcing her blue eyes to widen under my forceful and firm assault. Bit by bit, I pushed the entirety of my cock into her mouth and down her throat again, while Sapphire did nothing but gag and choke obediently.</p><p>My grin stretched wider and wider as she struggled in her task, her tits dangling freely as I forced her down. I was getting close… However, for the final, I had something unique in mind. Something simple yet impressive enough to deliver another hit to her already-flickering confidence. </p><p>Just as I was about to explode, I pulled out, pulling her hair at the same to make her raise her head, my cock aiming at her face. Then, just before I exploded on her face, I ripped the lacy mask off her face, revealing her royal face completely, also taking away the last piece of clothing, one that protected her self-esteem even if that was useless to protect her modesty. </p><p>From the sudden widening of her eyes, filled with vulnerability, it was clear that it worked even better than I had planned, which finally pushed me over the edge. I exploded on her face, covering her delicate skin with my seed as she desperately tried to breathe. </p><p>Only after I had expanded my reserves I let her go, letting her collapse on all-fours as she coughed and wheezed, trying to catch her breath. Meanwhile, my mind was on what to do next with the Queen of the Empire lay in front of me, covered with my seed… </p>
