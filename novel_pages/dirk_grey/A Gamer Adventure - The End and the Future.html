        <p>Hi, everyone. </p><p>My longest story, A Gamer Adventure, finally came to an end. </p><p>I hope that you all enjoyed it. </p><p>I have a question about the future of the story and the universe, whether you prefer it to continue ... and if you prefer it, in what form? </p><p><em><strong>Please note that, regardless of the result, I will probably have a small break. </strong></em></p>
