        <p>“What’s there to explain?” I asked mockingly even as I took a step back, a dark smirk on my face as I did my best to look threatening. She looked at me using the mirror, not even bothering to explain, her expression still sharp, but with no hint of panic. </p><p>“You’re no fun,” I chuckled as I closed in the distance once more, and spanked her ass, enjoying the moan that she let out, breaking her serious expression for a moment. Watching her panic at my ambiguous words and threatening attitude would have been amusing. </p><p>Pity that she was smart enough to realize that, at this point, I wouldn’t harm her needlessly. </p><p>“You’re a smart woman to manage the Empire for so long. Why don’t you try and guess my objective.” I smirked playfully. “I even have a reward for you if you can successfully guess.” </p><p>She said nothing for a moment, but the flicker of excitement in her eyes suggested she was very much interested in that reward. An interesting sense of priorities considering we were discussing her losing her throne, showing just how far she came to rely on me during these last few fateful days. </p><p>I looked at her, enjoying the way her eyelids were half-closed as she started thinking, her breasts moving gently as she breathed deep, still exhausted from our last encounter. “Why don’t you entertain me while you catch your breath,” I murmured as I flicked my hand, and her chains fell on the floor with a great crash, while I lay on the floor, enjoying the coldness of the stone against my burning skin. </p><p>“As you wish,” she murmured as she stood up slowly, but her speed had nothing to do with hesitation. The seductive sway of her body as she managed to push herself to her feet despite her trembling legs was all the evidence I needed. </p><p>The distance between us was barely two steps, yet she closed the distance with a lingering slowness, each step as beautiful as a dance move, alluring and sexy at the same time, her naked body enhancing the allure even more. </p><p>She was simply spectacular. </p><p>Yet, even as she stood above me, giving an interesting angle to her nudity, her expression was serious, no doubt thinking about my question. “You want me to work on something else?” she guessed as she slowly lowered herself. </p><p>“Technically correct, but it’s such an ancillary — benefit,” I said, interrupted by a moan as her hips arrived at my waist, pushing down. </p><p>“Really?” she asked, confused. </p><p>“Oh, yeah,” I answered. “I have several missions for you around the capital, but technically, it’s only viable you will have a lot of free time. I have a much more important reason for making you ‘disappear’ from the politics.” </p><p>Sapphire closed her eyes, her expression serious, yet that didn’t prevent her hips from starting to rock. Her hips were too beautiful to be left alone, so my hands rebelled until they came to land on their amazing expanse, enjoying their softness as she rocked her hips, riding me amazingly. </p><p>It was certainly a good idea to free her from the chains after everything that had happened. She danced on me to prove herself. </p><p>I busied myself by staring at the beautiful dance of her hips and the sway of her tits, all the while creating a comprehensive strategy that might have been completed against the other aspects of it. </p><p>Meanwhile, she had offered several possible reasons for my request, though almost all related to exact political fights in the Empire, relating the fights between the different factions. </p><p>Disappointing, I thought. Not because her ideas were stupid. On the other hand, they were clever, and reasonably thought-out — especially considering just how distracted she was by her beautiful multitasking. </p><p>It was disappointing, because they lacked imagination. Everything she had offered was firmly about palace politics, either to reduce the power of the certain factions, or taking control of them to prepare against the upcoming threat. </p><p>Yet, it wasn’t surprising, because it wasn’t the first time I was facing that lack of imagination, though, until the current moment, I always stood on the opposite side of it. The noble dark families exhibited the same lack of imagination even as I fought against them, allowing me to use novel, high-risk strategies with great effect.</p><p>They didn’t always succeed, of course, and some of them brought me too close to death for my comfort, but considering I had managed to take the position of a dark lord, it was clearly a workable strategy. </p><p>“Try to be more imaginative, beautiful,” I said to her even as I slapped her breast, giving her a jolt. One she appreciated greatly, if her moan was to be believed. </p><p>Her hips continued to move as she opened her eyes, pinning me under their beautiful blueness. “I don’t know?” she admitted. “Maybe a clue.” </p><p>“Only if you can earn it,” I commented with a smirk. She raised herself a bit, only to push herself down harder, impaling herself with my spear, her moan spectacular. Her hands landed on my chest, using it for balance as her hips started to rock in a spectacular manner, each passing second giving me a renewed jolt of pleasure. I said nothing as her hips danced and rotated at a masterful pace, each push giving a renewed push of pleasure. </p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured even as she closed her eyes to contain the rush of pleasure she was generating for herself. “Certainly enough to get a clue. Tell me, how do you make two dragons fight?” </p><p>“You want to make those mysterious enemies fight?” she suggested after a while, though her voice lacked confidence.  </p><p>“Exactly.” </p><p>“But how?” she asked. “Why would they care about my sudden disappearance. If they thought who’s occupying the throne was important, they wouldn’t have set all those wards.” </p><p>“You’re not wrong, but you’re missing something important. They might not care about who’s occupying the throne, but that doesn’t mean they won’t react to a sudden, violent assassination that ruins their plans. After all, who else but their biggest enemies could achieve something without their notice.” </p><p>“You want them to panic,” she said, a sudden realization appearing on her face. “But isn’t it dangerous?” </p><p>“Oh, it certainly is,” I said. “But it isn’t as dangerous as allowing you to walk around the palace, especially with their ability to easily penetrate the wards. In the palace, you’re just waiting until they make a decision to remove you, and it’s impossible to prevent it, even if I stay guarding you always.” </p><p>“And how does taking me from the throne help. Wouldn’t they just do the same thing to Aria?” </p><p>“Not if we don’t put her on the throne immediately. You can go tell her that you’re going for a secret mission, and she can delay the coronation.” </p><p>“She can’t handle it,” Sapphire said dismissively. “She lacks the confidence to deal with any noble that would push for a quick decision. She’s just too weak.” </p><p>I smirked at her dismissal, curious how she would react if she knew Aria’s achievements under more positive reinforcement. However, as much as talking about that had entertainment potential, we were dealing with more important issues. “That’s even better. Tell her that you’re going on a mission, and ask her to stay in mourning. With her reputation, they wouldn’t care, and defending her in a secret location would have been much easier.” </p><p>“Will you protect her?” she asked, worried. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t make you sad,” I said as I caressed her cheek. Of course, I had no intention of sacrificing my precious Aria regardless of our relationship, but considering my loving words made her move even quicker, sending shivers of pleasure across my body, I was more than willing to omit that part for a better reward. </p><p>“And how does doing something like that help us catch those mysterious enemies.” </p><p>“It’ll force them to act. Imagine you’re a dragon, eyeing a juicy deer, but before you can hunt it, it disappears suspiciously close to the den of another dragon. What would you do?” </p><p>“Blame the other dragon,” she said, her eyes wide in realization. </p><p>“Exactly. Currently, both parties are confident that they have a better understanding of what’s going on. One of them expanding their power in Dark Lands, while the other exerting their power to control the palace and the Empire without being noticed.” </p><p>“I understand why the elves would react badly to my disappearance, but why should phoenixes care about my disappearance since they knew they are not responsible.” </p><p>“That’s the beautiful part. How can they be confident that one of their team is responsible for that activity? And even if they could ascertain that, they would suspect elves acting because they are moving toward whatever end-game they are playing for, forcing them to react. Either case, they would make a lot of unplanned moves, allowing me to understand more about their plans.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured between her moans, fascinated. “And what I’m going to do?” </p><p>“You’re going to help me, of course,” I said even as I slapped her ass. “With things quickening, we’ll need to act a lot faster, and someone I could trust would help me a lot.” </p><p>All I needed to decide, was who was going to help her that…</p>
