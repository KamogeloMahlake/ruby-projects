    <body>
        <p>Hi Everyone, </p><p>First of all, thanks for your well wishes about my health issues. Much appreciated. </p><p>It took longer than the doctors initially predicted due to a number of unfortunate surprises, but I'm almost recovered. However, I won't be able to update it today. </p><p>So, what I'm planning to do is to change the update schedule a bit. Normally, since there is 5  Fridays in January, I would be posting some bonus chapters the fifth Friday. Instead, I need to update the schedule so that I will be doing four updates, just skipping the 8th. Apologies for unexpected delay. Because I'm yet to recover to my full strength. </p><p>Still, depending on my recovery speed, I'll do my best to put some bonus chapters. </p><p>Thank you for your understanding, and once again, apologies for the delay. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Dirk</p>
