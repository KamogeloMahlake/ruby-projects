        <p>I had gone over Emily’s report a couple times, and my power allowed me to catch some combinations. Most were unrelated to Slasher’s adventures, but I still managed to identify two Villains with whom he collaborated… A low-level ranged attacker called the Buccaneer, who fashioned himself after pirates, and a regular thug, Wall-Breaker, with a minor invulnerability skill. </p><p>I had to admit, three of them made a strong team, disposable enough to be used against a mysterious villain, yet effective enough to deal with us. </p><p>Unfortunately, as I read the report, something in my mind niggled, telling me that I was missing something important. I didn’t know if was something about my power, or just my own paranoia — sometimes, it was hard to distinguish the two — but either way, I didn’t dare to ignore it further. </p><p>I overcharged my power as I started to go through the report, and the connections between discrete events thickened, but so did my headache. </p><p>“Everything alright, sir?” she asked. </p><p>“Just a headache,” I said, then I noticed her questioning glance, even though she didn’t dare to actually ask a question. “I know I can rest, but it’s too important,” I added. </p><p>“I understand, sir,” she said, but with my power in overdrive, I could see her intense worry. She clearly wanted to help but also knew that there was nothing she could do. It was a pity that I didn’t have a way for her to … </p><p>Then, it clicked. “Why don’t you come here, sweetie? I can use your help.” </p><p>“I’m ready, sir,” she said as she moved next to me. “What can I do?” </p><p>“You can start by getting rid of your top. I need a distraction from the headache,” I said. She blushed, not expecting the help to come in that form. Then, I patted the desk. “Get rid of the rest, and sit here. An eye candy would be helpful.” </p><p>She might be surprised by my request, but she was certainly not disappointed, following my request as I asked. She sat on the desk, her legs crossed with a whole body blush, creating a beautiful ornament for my viewing pleasure. </p><p>“Good, now, continue watching them,” I said as I gave her another set of combat footage, this time not just the Slasher, but the thug and the wannabe pirate as well. There was no harm in being prepared. </p><p>I returned to analyzing the reports, but one hand stayed on her body, the sensation of her supple skin just enough to take the blunt off my growing headache. I delved deeper and deeper into the reports, leaving me with a blinding headache … but it was not a waste. </p><p>I managed to identify some interesting connections between Slasher and two other Villains, and one independent hero. </p><p>One of the villains was the Underworld Archer, who, similar to the Buccaneer in terms of effectiveness. He had some kind of projection ability that he could only use to create a bow and various types of arrows, though whether he was skilled in targeting, or if it was a part of his skillset was unknown. </p><p>The other Villain was the Commander, who had some kind of coordination skill, able to use a dozen thugs he followed with impressive capability, limiting himself to bank heists, but his limited range was his major problem. </p><p>And, the sole independent hero I suspected was King Shadow, a mysterious man with the ability to form and control living shadows. He was famous for his excessive aggressiveness and environmental damage. The only thing that prevented him from being treated as a villain was his track record. He got results, taking down a lot of minor villains, so he was left alone. </p><p>On the surface, there was nothing that really linked all four together. They didn’t even face each other too many times, and if it wasn’t for my power, combined with the excessive detail level of Emily’s report, I would have never caught any link. </p><p>There were relatively few encounters between King Shadow and the other three, but a majority of them were followed by another heist a few days later in the same area, often using the environmental damage created by King Shadow to their benefit. </p><p>And, a few times, they used the fight as a distraction to hit a different location. A nasty combo that, even with my power, I wouldn’t have discovered if it wasn’t for my focus on Slasher. No wonder it stayed undiscovered. </p><p>Who would have spent that much energy on a minor villain? </p><p>Of course, that raised another interesting question. Who was the leader? I hadn’t interacted with any of them, but none of their public personas had shown them to be a planner to such a degree — including the  Commander, despite the name. </p><p>Either one of them was disciplined enough to constantly reflect a fake persona, or they had a supporter from the Shadows. Considering the lack of video evidence about the Slasher’s full abilities, I was inclined to believe the second. </p><p>As for who supposed them, I had no idea. Maybe the Syndicate, maybe the New Giant force … maybe someone completely different that let the two borrow them. </p><p>The more I delved, the more I started to realize that the world of heroes and villains wasn’t as simple as it first seemed. There was more going on than bright costumes and collateral damage. </p><p>And, by poor luck, I somehow ended up in the middle, already too late to pull back. </p><p>I needed to deal with the mess … but not right now, not with a blinding headache. I needed to relax, and I needed a nap. </p><p>With that sequence. </p><p>I didn’t say anything. I just unzipped my pants, and Tara slipped under my desk. </p><p>The headache didn’t prevent me from appreciating the view as her thick, brown hair flowed down to her shoulders, particularly when her eyes looked at my shaft, captivated with excitement. Her pouty lips parted invitingly as she leaned forward without hesitation, and soon, her warmth enveloped me.  </p><p>Unlike the previous times, she didn’t show any hesitation as she pushed herself down, her throat tight around my length. She pushed fast while I leaned back, enjoying the service passively. My head hurt too much to have any kind of active role. Even the temptation of her beautiful naked breasts wasn’t enough to distract me. </p><p>Her hands landed on my legs, and whenever she pulled back to catch her breath, they replaced her lips. “Give it a lick, sweetie,” I commented.  </p><p>She gasped as she leaned forward, the small comment enough to break her self-confident streak. Her enthusiasm was still there, of course, but with shyness back into the mix, she looked incredible. </p><p>Especially that shyness didn’t prevent her from treating mine like a delicious ice cream cone, her hands working on the base. “My god,” she whispered as her hands danced up and down, acting like it was the first time she had seen it. </p><p>Though, in a way, it was the first time she had such a free rein, playing on my length steadily. Her hands explored every inch of my length, her tongue working harder than her fingers. </p><p>“You can suck again,” I said, permitting her to start working on it once more. She withdrew her hands, but her lips once again replaced without the slightest delay. Her shy blush’s contrast with the skill she was going down was truly spectacular as she continued to kneel in front of me. </p><p>She looked mesmerized.</p><p>I sank deeper into my chair with a sigh, deliberately ignoring every single aspect of the incoming disaster — as thinking about how to handle various combinations of six super opponents activated my power, which was very painful — and enjoyed the service instead. </p><p>She continued providing said service, each second driving my pleasure further and further as her lips continued to dance, working hard to bring me to completion, moving faster and faster, plunging down deeper and deeper. </p><p>Ultimately, she succeeded, and I exploded. “Don’t waste it,” I ordered … and she was quick to follow that order, not wasting even a drop. </p><p>A fascinating victory… </p><p>“I think I’ll take a nap here, wake me up in two hours,” I said before I closed my eyes, the momentary euphoria silencing the pain and exhaustion enough to allow me to fall asleep. </p>
