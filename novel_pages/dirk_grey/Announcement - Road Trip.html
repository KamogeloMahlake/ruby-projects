        <p>Hi Everyone, </p><p>Just a quick reminder. I'll remove the first 13 chapters of the Road Trip from Patreon in a week or two, to publish that book in Amazon as well. Due to Amazon's terms and conditions, publishing that in multiple platforms simultaneously is not allowed. </p><p>I know it's not very convenient, but I need to have a wider range of books in other platforms as well, allowing me to reach more readers, critical for my dream of becoming a full-time writer (which would mean much more production from my end) </p><p><strong>Slowly, I'll apply the same treatment to the other books, but I can guarantee that books like A Gamer Adventure, </strong> <strong>Dragon's Tale, and Dark Lord in Chains will be exempt from that. Even if I publish them, they will be on Smashwords, which means no exclusivity. </strong></p><p>I'll still continue publishing the follow up chapters here, of course. </p>
