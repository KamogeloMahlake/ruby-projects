        <p>Hi guys. I'm thinking about adding a new fanfiction, kind of like a loose connection of one-shots as one main character went through multiverse complete quests.Â </p><p>Acolyte of Corruption, where he goes to various universes with a mission to seduce and corrupt his target, the universes, and the ladies in question determined by polls similar to Dark Lord in Chains, but with a looser main story.</p><p><strong>Since it's a preliminary idea, not sure about the general schedule and the exact shape of the polls.</strong></p>
