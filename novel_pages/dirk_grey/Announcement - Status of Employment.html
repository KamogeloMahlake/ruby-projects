        <p>Hi everyone. </p><p>I'm sure you all noticed there's an extra chapter this month. </p><p>It's because as of a couple days ago, my job had changed from full time to part time. I had been expecting this due to ongoing crisis, therefore took necessary financial precautions to minimise its short term impact.  </p><p>However, as much as it's a challenge for me, it's good news for you guys, because as long as this situation continues, I have a lot of free time on my hand. <strong>Therefore, I'm going to update at least 2 bonus extra chapter each month as long as this situation continues (which I expect to last 3-6 months). I'll update a chapter of photographer tomorrow as well. </strong></p><p><em>Also, I plan to launch an exclusive story for 5$ tier. I already have the story line drafted, so I should be able to upload it before 15th of May (fingers crossed) </em></p><p><em>Hope everyone enjoyed this months updates. </em></p>
