        <p>Sarah was having trouble hiding her shocked gaze at the way Carrie dressed, even after the last night’s amazing show. Understandable, considering that with an ill-fitting, poorly tied bathrobe, Carrie looked like she was about to start acting in a scene of a high-budget, but very erotic movie. </p><p>The way the robe loosened even further with each step hardly helped to counter that beautiful impression. </p><p>“Good morning,” she said even as she walked toward us, watching us from the half-wall opening of the open kitchen. I watched every step of her with rapt attention. Sarah was no different, fascinated by the intentional twirl she added to her every step, though with a great deal of jealousy replacing my fascination. </p><p>“Good morning-“ I started to answer when she finally entered the kitchen, but that was cut short. Before I could even finish my greeting, she put her hands on my shoulders, rose to her tiptoes, and sealed my lips in a searing kiss. </p><p>Impressed with the sudden initiative, I let her push me back successfully, until my back pressed against the wall. Carrie continued to kiss, even Sarah let out a pointed cough. Her bathrobe failed to stay closed under her sharp movement, making my towel the only thing between our bodies. </p><p>The temptation to bend her over the table and reward her for her failure was intense. Ironically, it was Sarah’s pointed coughs that made me hold myself back. Not because I was shy to do in front of her — something I had proved without a room for doubt the last night — but because I didn’t want to scare off Sarah by being too aggressive. </p><p>Because I could share that idea with Carrie, she pulled back, her bathrobe open, granting us her delicious nakedness. </p><p>“Try to keep it in your room, guys,” Sarah said, somehow managing to do so without a stammer despite her growing blush. Just because she had watched us before didn’t mean she was desynthesized to our show. “If you rub against each other for one more second, you’re going to catch fire.” </p><p>“No need to be jealous just because you don’t have someone to rub against,” Carrie said. </p><p>Under different circumstances, it might have been a hurtful statement, the kind Sarah would just pull back sadly. However, after everything that happened last night, it was much more different. “Oh, really?” Sarah said, her voice tense, like a politician declaring war. </p><p>Carrie smirked as she fixed her bathrobe, trying to act like she didn’t catch Sarah’s reaction before turning to catch my gaze. </p><p>However, there was no mistaking her gaze. It was the same one she had when she was watching us from the window while we frolicked in the pool, the less intense version of the gaze she had when I taught Sarah joys of the flesh in my bed while she peeked from the door. </p><p>Carrie was developing into a precariously naughty girl, goading her friend to a desperate attempt to pay back. The only thing that was keeping Sarah back was guilt, and Carrie’s mocking was an excellent way to destroy that. </p><p>I wondered whether her effectiveness was accidental, or I was facing the origin story of a sexy villain!</p><p>Regardless, Sarah hardly waited for Carrie to leave the kitchen before walking in front of me, and opening one of the cabinets, trying to pick a mug from the highest shelf despite having several others in more convenient locations. </p><p>“Can you help me?” she gasped, doing her best to sound erotic. It was more angry than erotic, but ironically, that made her even sexier. </p><p>“Of course, sweetie,” I said even as I grabbed her waist and lifted her up easily. She reached the mug with deliberate slowness, but she was busy trying to catch Carrie’s eyes. </p><p>She managed to catch Carrie’s eye, but didn’t find the sudden jealousy she was hoping for, greeted by amused dismissal instead. “Your friend seems to be confident about her hold over me,” I whispered as I lowered her slowly, even as the way I dragged her close to my body dislodged my towel once more. “Maybe even too confident…” </p><p>“Maybe,” Sarah gasped, unable to do anything but gasp beautifully as she felt my naked shaft pressing against her skirt. </p><p>I faced the same temptation I felt when Carrie was facing me, to push her against the kitchen counter and take her mercilessly. Pity that it would ruin the fun atmosphere that took all night to establish. </p><p>Instead, I took a step back, and leaned down to pick up my towel. Just as I grabbed it, a foot landed, preventing me from taking it down. “The room is warm enough,” Sarah whispered, with a heat that surprised me. Maybe it was the anger she felt from the dismissal, maybe it was the rush she had from looking down on my bent body, but her voice carried the confidence she had when our little game had started. </p><p>“Oh,” I answered back. I didn’t bother trying to act surprised. Instead, I put my hand on her inner thigh, climbing up slowly yet steadily. I waited until her gaze trembled before asking my question. “And you’re not worried about your friend seeing me naked.” </p><p>Sarah throw a worried glance at Carrie, who was doing a good job of looking like she was focused on the TV — though her sprawled pose once again displayed her assets to a spectacular effect. That worked wonders to renew her decisiveness through burning jealousy. </p><p>Then her gaze fell on the kitchen counter, sizing its height, which, luckily, was tall enough to cover my state of nakedness as long as Carrie was sitting. Her gaze fell on me once more, her courage renewed. “Yeah, it’s alright,” she said, trying to sound nonchalant. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said with a smirk before standing up, but I kept my hand on her leg, letting my fingers rise up, revealing more and more of her toned thighs. She shivered as I was about to caress her panties. </p><p>I picked that exact moment to pull back, leaving her to gasp in shock while I returned back to flip my delicious omelet. Luckily, due to its thickness, I had to cook it slowly, giving me just enough time to tease Sarah in close quarters. </p><p>When I finished flipping it, Sarah’s gaze was already on my midsection, watching my erection with great interest. </p><p>I chuckled even as I pointed at the fridge. “Do you mind getting some juice?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she said, doing her best to watch me as she moved. Meanwhile, Carrie raised her head and looked at us, and after making sure Sarah was looking at the opposite end, opened her robe even more, turning her cleavage into a delicious naked show, followed by a saucy wink, and a gesture for me to move faster. </p><p>It was incredible that she was still feeling horny after last night, not that I had any problem with it. While Sarah leaned down to grab the bottle from the fridge, I closed the distance in a few quick steps, standing behind her. “Let me help,” I whispered. </p><p>“No need-“ she started, only to freeze halfway as she felt the same shaft she had been watching earlier slip under her skirt, rubbing against her core, her panties the only barrier between our skin. </p><p>And a weak one at that. </p><p>“I can help,” I answered even as I pushed my hips forward, sliding my shaft between her legs in a manner that would awaken all sorts of memories. She froze, no doubt caught flat-footed at my sudden daring while Carrie was still in the other room. </p><p>Which, considering the last night, shouldn’t be too surprising. </p><p>“I insist,” I added in a throaty tone just to make sure the impression stuck properly. She trembled, under the assault of shock and desire in equal amounts, no doubt recalling the memories of the night before, when she learned the true meaning of the pleasure. </p><p>She held on the side of the fridge to balance herself rather than trying to grab anything from the fridge. She didn’t move even as I pushed my hips back and forth a few times — well, only after discounting her shivers. </p><p>Then, a moan exploded off her lips, catching all of us in surprise. </p><p>Sarah pushed me back in panic as she stood up, desperately looking toward Carrie. Carrie, who had been trying to catch a glimpse of the show without being too apparent, was caught flatfooted at Sarah’s sudden move. </p><p>Carrie froze, convinced that she had been caught. </p><p>Luckily, Sarah’s mortification and fear at the sudden moan was enough for her to miss Carrie’s guilty expression. “I hit my toe to the coffee table,” she muttered in panic. </p><p>“Fridge,” I whispered, unable to prevent a snicker from escaping my mouth. After all, the kitchen was conspicuously absent of coffee tables. </p><p>“Sorry, fridge,” Sarah muttered as she looked down, making a great show of stumbling toward the counter, looking down like she was trying to check her feet, which gave Carrie just enough time to return to her seat. </p><p>Sarah leaned against the counter, not realizing that Carrie had been seen my nakedness when she was standing up.  </p><p>“Oh, you seem to be needing help,” I whispered even as I once again walked behind her, and I closed in the distance, my shaft pressing against her ass once more. </p><p>However, this time, my hands slipped under her skirt as well, pulling down her sexy panties before she could even realize it. She looked down once more, but despite her superior vantage point and the angle, the dominance she showed earlier before was nowhere to be seen. </p><p>Replaced by arousal and anticipation. </p>
