        <p>A smile forced itself to my face as I looked at her obedient moans, the decision about the next step easy to reach. She had deserved a reward. The dazed expression on her beautiful face suggested she was already daydreaming about said reward. </p><p>Such an alluring Queen to spend time with. </p><p>“So, Your Majesty,” I murmured, my voice enough to break through her reverie. “Do you think you have deserved a reward?” I asked, my hand slowly stroking her inner thigh, each movement sending shivers through her body.</p><p>"Err, maybe..." she murmured in an uncharacteristic confusion as she looked at me, battling against her own arousal while she did her best to understand what was going on in my brain. Not that I blamed her, because her body was being rocked with pleasure, preventing her from formulating a rational thought. </p><p>The time was logic was far too gone, replaced by the age of pleasure. </p><p>“Good answer, Your Majesty,” I whispered even as I positioned myself toward her entrance, my throbbing presence more than enthusiastic to finally dip into her depths. And the presence of the chains around her wrists, still keeping her prisoner like I had suffered for months, made things even more fun. “Too bad none of your loyal subjects are lucky enough to see completely divested of your clothes, chained against the wall, begging for it.” </p><p>“Then they should have worked harder,” she moaned back, surprising me with her answer. </p><p>“Yes,” I murmured in her ear, my seductive whisper bringing my hot breath on her ear to make her remember how my mouth felt on her body, not that she needed to go deep to remember that particular detail. “Those lazy idiots would have needed to work harder,” I said as my hand slowly moved up, sliding up to her hips, yet didn’t slip in her wetness yet. </p><p>A moan escaped her mouth as her mind was alighted with pleasure, not helped by the lazy rubbing of my shaft delivered gently around her entrance. </p><p>I stop for a moment, which was not by choice. The desire in her voice was simply too mesmerizing to do anything else. Yet, that didn’t last for long, as her legs parted even more even as she moaned, inviting me inside. </p><p>Who was I to reject the request of such a beautiful queen?</p><p>“Oh, yes,” she gasped as I pushed my hips slowly, proving her entrance with my shaft, her eyes closed as she leaned against the walls of the cell. I decided to help her a bit, adjusting the chains so that they were tense enough to keep her upright if she got too overwhelmed with pleasure. </p><p>She moaned even more as she realized just how tense the chains had got, enough to forcibly keep her arms open to prevent her from sitting down. Her legs weren’t chained, but still, her legs widened in her own accord, creating a beautiful spread-eagle look, helpless under the rush of pleasure. </p><p>“What a nice Queen,” I mocked her even as I pushed myself even deeper, enjoying the way she tightened around me. “Tell me how does it feel getting fucked by the same Dark Lord you have worked so hard to capture?” </p><p>“It’s—“ she gasped before a moan interrupted her, as I chose that moment to impale her harshly. She threw an angry glare at me. “Not like it’s the first time,” she finally gasped, trying to sound angry, but coming across cute. </p><p>“Well, it’s the best time you’re properly aware of it, at least,” I added even as I slapped her ass, enjoying her resulting moan. </p><p>That made her still a moment before she moaned again. “It’s better than serving a merchant,” she admitted, earning a chuckle from me. </p><p>“Too right,” I said, unable to suppress the temptation to slap her breasts, enjoying the way they swayed. That hardly helped her to contain even as I slowly moved in and out of her, my hands moving to her ass, firmly holding her hips in place.</p><p>She looked at me, her beautiful blue eyes clouded with excitement and desire, telling me that she had completely shed any pretense of denying what was going on in her body. I had no idea what played the most part, my amazing skills, the fact that she had surrendered repeatedly, the side effects of her tantric spells, the fear of losing everything due to upcoming danger… Nor that I cared. </p><p>From this moment, she was mine. That was all that was important. </p><p>“Tell me who do you belong to,” I whispered even as I kept my fingers on her quivering body, my hips picking up speed. </p><p>“I belong to you!” she moaned, her voice cracking, yet it was more delicious than an epic song. </p><p>“Such a beautiful statement,” I whispered. “Luckily for you, you’re going to have a lot of opportunities to prove your obedience in the short term.” </p><p>“Good,” she said as she let herself go soft, her quivering body a work of art. But as she loosened, I picked up speed, enjoying her wetness even more, pushing deeper and deeper into her core until my shaft started disappearing completely with each rhythmic thrust, sinking into her warm depths. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time she was stretching under my assault, but that did hardly anything to her harm her tightness, each push glorious as I invaded her persistent wrap. I grabbed her hips as I lifted her, making her body more angled. Her shoulders were still pressing against the wall, and the chains were helping her to keep up — though not completely painlessly processed for her, yet she moaned even louder. </p><p>For a moment, I said nothing, enjoying the way her tits swayed hypnotically under my assault, the angle I created giving them the free space for them to do so under my relentless fucking. Her tits danced and tumbled, creating one of the most beautiful works of art I had ever enjoyed as she only hold onto the chains for support. </p><p>Her beautiful ass jingled no less impressively with each thrust, her body adapting to my rhythm.  </p><p>It was a pure, unadulterated experience of pleasure as I slammed into her harder and harder. “Oh, gods above and beyond, yes, harder,” she started to gasp dazedly, breaking the silence. </p><p>“You love this, don’t you, my slut Queen?” I whispered as she grunted positively. “Good, this is your reward, after all. Tell me what else do you want?” </p><p>“Fuck me even harder,” she gasped. </p><p>“I don’t know,” I murmured jokingly. “It’s such an annoying chore for me, maybe I should think about it for a while.”</p><p>“Jerk,” she managed to gasp between her moans, though the momentary smile that appeared on her face showed she was just as serious as her statement. </p><p>“Okay, you win,” I said, amused by her reaction as I picked up speed even more while she spread her legs even more, more obedient as the queen than the dancer she disguised herself as. </p><p>I smiled as the sound of our hips colliding filled the room, the sound deafening as I plunged deep into her and spread her lips wide. “If that’s your wish,” I said, while she moaned repeatedly. I might have added a statement about ruining her for other men, but considering I had no intention of letting there be any other men for the rest of our life, that would have been redundant. </p><p>She was mine, and she was going to stay mine… </p><p>Her back arched under the pleasure as her tits pointed at the ceiling, every vigorous slam making her body rock dangerously as she rubbed against the wall. I had no doubt that her shoulders had started to hurt as a side effect, yet she made no complaint. </p><p>She was surprisingly nimble for a noble, though she probably owed that to her secret career as a dancer… </p><p>Time and environment lost their meaning as I fucked her to my heart’s content — which was an achievement considering the importance of the time under the mysterious circumstances we were facing, and the significance of our environment — each magical second bringing us closer to a climax that would no doubt be legendary. </p><p>Even with the life, I had lived, this moment was certainly a contender for the most erotic moment of my life, split between surreal and extremely realistic. </p><p>And what a great sign of the amazing life I was living, I thought in satisfaction as I enjoyed Sapphire’s warmth, for even such a moment failed to take undisputed first spot. </p><p>Yet, as her tightness suddenly intensified, grabbing my girth stronger than the chains around her wrists, I focused on the present, enjoying the reality of the situation. </p><p>A loud grunt escaped my mouth as I slammed into her for one last time, the sound mixing into her desperate cries as the climax hit her hard, leaving her a trembling mess. I closed my eyes, focusing on the unique pleasure of filling the soft core of the reigning Monarch of the Empire… </p><p>Nor that the moment lost any of its radiance as I finished filling her insides as I pulled back, enjoying the way she continued to shiver as her feet touched the rough floor of the prison once more, her legs lacking to strength to support her properly as the chains kept her upright. </p><p>She kept her eyes closed, moaning softly as she enjoyed the pleasure of our most spectacular time together. </p><p>Until now, of course… </p>
