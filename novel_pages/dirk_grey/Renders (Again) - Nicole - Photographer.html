    <body>
        <p>Hi everyone, </p><p>As you remember, I had been doing some renders in the past, but I had stopped because my computer with a decent GPU had died. </p><p>However, a friend of mine had left his computer with me when he's going to travel for a couple of months as a favor, so I can give another stab to rendering. </p><p>Please share your opinions about my work. It would be much appreciated. </p>
