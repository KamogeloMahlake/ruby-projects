        <p>“You don’t need to fear anything, sweetie. Everything is going perfectly,” I said as I hugged her. She responded, her arms tight around me, radiating her stress. She was not handling her new identity as a cultivator well. </p><p>Luckily, I had the skills to distract her. I hugged her as well, but my arms were looser, while my hands danced on her back, occasionally caressing her shoulders, helping her to get in the mood. </p><p>I could have asked her to serve me, and she would have done so immediately, and enjoyed it as well. Ironically, she was too enthusiastic about serving me in any way possible, so asking her would make her shelve her personal concerns while she was with me … not exactly an ideal solution. </p><p>Ironically, she didn’t have such concerns during our first time, happily playing the role of the master ordering her students around, but that was before she realized my many talents. </p><p>I kept my hands in safer spots, slowly dancing on her skin while she trembled, preventing her from panicking too much. Soon, her hands, which were clamped around me, started to loosen. I started humming, and she accompanied the song. </p><p>As she hummed her song, it took a while for her to realize our lips were close. She blushed once as she realized it, still shy despite everything we had done together. Admittedly, it had been a while, enough for her to feel reticent. </p><p>Ironically, she might have pulled back if she was a more assertive person. Instead, she stayed in my arms, waiting for me to make a move as her lips parted, a little too much to be purely accidental. I held back a chuckle. I might be the only man she had ever been with, but a waitress, her flirting hadn’t been stilted at all. </p><p>It was her sense of worship toward me that was holding her back, and there was nothing better to break that than frustration. I acted unaware of her changing mood and sat down, while still hugging her, and she ended up on my lap. </p><p>What followed was a torturous teasing session that lasted about twenty minutes while she desperately gave every possible signal she could without breaking the cultural implications of her role as a servant, where it was perfectly alright for a master to request sex, but it was a scandal coming from a servant. </p><p>I wondered if that was why she didn’t recognize even my most obvious seduction tricks during the last hour. After all, in her mind, if I wanted sex, I could have easily requested it. </p><p>It was fun to watch her trying to convince me to take her without being obvious, but the real benefit was her mood. There was nothing like trying to seduce someone to stave off an existential crisis. </p><p>I didn’t know what finally enlightened her, but her beautiful eyes widened in ... well, not anger, but the closest thing to anger that she was capable of showing against me. “You’re doing that on purpose—” she gasped, which I interrupted by a kiss. </p><p>Admittedly, teasing her even more until her pseudo-anger turned into real anger, but there were two problems with it. I still had some important tasks to finish and couldn’t spend my whole day here — no matter how tempting.</p><p>And, she wasn’t the only one feeling the frustration of arousal. Teasing her was fun, but that fun did nothing to blunt the desire awakened by a sexy girl on my lap, doing her best to seduce me, particularly since, while her moves were subtle, they were certainly not unskilled. </p><p>As I kissed her, the beginnings of the anger she had displayed faded just as quickly, her body melting under my touch obediently. </p><p>She readily parted her legs when I freed her body from the oppression of her clothes, leaving her only in her underwear as she was pressed against the smoothest section of the cold cave wall. A pull was all that was needed to get rid of her panties while she dealt with her top, leaving her body free for my perusal. </p><p>“Marvelous,” I whispered, which was not an exaggeration. She was already a beautiful woman, but all that time practicing a flexibility-based martial art style turned her already beautiful body into a masterwork that would drive artists crazy. </p><p>And, currently, that marvelous body was melding against mine while she did her best to equalize our nudity. As she freed my shaft, I put my hand on her thigh, slowly moving back and forth. “More, please,” she begged. </p><p>Not exactly a shocking display of initiative, but it was progress, and it deserved a proper reward. I let my hand move upward a bit until it dipped into her glistening core, and a moan rose in response while she tried to caress my shaft in response. </p><p>Her fingers trembled too badly to be successful. </p><p>“I …” she murmured fleetingly, words slipping out of her mouth before her unique brand of passivity could assert itself thanks to her weakening self-control. </p><p>“Tell me what you want,” I said even as I squeezed her breast in celebration of such an important benchmark. </p><p>“I shouldn’t,” she murmured, her voice tight as she treated requesting something during sex as indecent due to her perception of our relative classes. </p><p>“Tell me,” I ordered. She was panicking, but it was far more different than her earlier existential panic. It was a sexy one, adding a new layer of eroticism to her incredible beauty. </p><p>“P-please, please, go further,” she begged. </p><p>“Are you asking me to fuck you?” I asked, amused at her indirect language. She nodded. “How do you prefer. Soft, or hard? Or how about I mercilessly?” </p><p>Her blush was incredible, but so was her answer. “T-the l-last one,” she stammered, her cowardly tone contrasting greatly with her request, making her even more alluring. </p><p>“As you wish, beautiful,” I said as I grabbed her hips and slid inside her, hard enough that her pelvis would have shattered if it wasn’t for her martial cultivation. That reduced the pain, but it did nothing about the clapping sound that accompanied it. </p><p>“Yes, yes, yes,” she repeated like a mantra every time I slammed inside her, her beautiful breasts dancing wildly with each push as I fucked her as mercilessly as she requested, wailing and moaning as she put our current location in the wilderness to best use. </p><p>After all that play, it didn’t take long for her to climax. “I … I need to catch my breath,” she begged and moaned, but I didn’t even slow down. After all, she chose merciless, and letting her recover for a while before the second round felt an awful lot like mercy. </p><p>“Did you change your mind about wanting the last one?” I teased her. </p><p>Her eyes widened, but soon her expression settled on determined. “No,” she whispered determinedly. It had been the last thing she had said for a while as I kept her locked against the wall, pounding against and again until she had experienced her second orgasm, then a third one, during which I finally exploded in her. </p><p>She collapsed against the side of the wall, and I kissed her temple. “Don’t forget, meditate, and don’t go anywhere,” I told her as I quickly dressed and left her behind. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had important tasks to deal with… </p><p><br></p>
