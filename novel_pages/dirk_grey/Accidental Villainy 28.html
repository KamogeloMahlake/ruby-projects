        <p>As I left the guild headquarters and walked away, I had a big smile on my face, surprised by the welcome benefit. The initial trip was just supposed to help me better understand the layout of the guild to see if I could poke around.</p><p>I certainly didn’t expect to find, let alone seduce, a superpowered but neglected receptionist. A win for me, even if her superpower was possibly just as useless as it looked. I could see several ways it could be combined with my power, with the potential to give me the edge I desperately needed. </p><p>Enough of a potential to make me ignore my growing headache. </p><p>I didn’t immediately start dreaming about the future and the potential combinations. To properly test the synergies, I first needed to convince her that the guild wasn’t the best place for her to work … and I doubted it would be easy. If the message from the puzzle was even halfway accurate, it showed that the Guild was willing to do a lot to keep the people working for them.</p><p>Assuming Emily could resign easily just because her power was not remarkable would have been a dangerous assumption. </p><p>Of course, that was a future concern. I first needed to make sure her initial attraction grew into something more fascinating. </p><p>A quick check of the cameras showed that there was nothing going on around my bar that needed my immediate concern, giving me the time to swing by the store and buy a new phone. I had no idea how her power worked, but I rather be safe than sorry. </p><p>I started texting, and Emily responded immediately … too quickly to be just about her enthusiasm. She was clearly using her power. </p><p>I was tempted to just talk her through the phone for hours, but instead, I chose to text a few minutes, take a long break, and take another break. No need to overwhelm her immediately. </p><p>I had to be careful, because there was precious little my power could feed through text messages. </p><p>While I texted her, I went back to the bar at first, getting rid of the disguise. Tara was at the bar, cleaning the bottles from the dust her digging had created. “Everything alright, sir?” </p><p>“Yes, everything is perfect,” I answered as I grabbed her from behind, enjoying the whimper that she let out, tempting me to pull her down for some fun. Unfortunately, I needed to go around and be visible. </p><p>The more visible I was, the fewer questions the villains would ask about what I was doing outside their notice. I got rid of my disguise and changed into thick jeans and a leather jacket, looking like a classic biker. “Be careful, and don’t leave the bar,” I ordered Tara. “I’ll pick up dinner on my way back.” </p><p>My plan was to drive all around the city, both as a chance to get a lot of general observations to put my power to use, and to give the villains something to pay attention to. </p><p>I soon decided to add another benefit. I started taking occasional photos with my new phone and sharing them with Emily. I was not exactly a professional photographer, but my power allowed me to catch some interesting stuff that I would have missed without my power helping me to catch them. </p><p>Of course, I didn’t suddenly start captured by a desire to reflect the world or such nonsense. No, I was sharing those photos with Emily, acting like moving around was a part of my job … all for one aim. </p><p>‘How about you send one back to me,’ I wrote. </p><p>‘I’m just sitting on a desk for a whole day. I don’t have anything beautiful to share,’ she wrote back, followed by a frown. </p><p>‘How about your beautiful face,’ I wrote back. Which was not flirting, despite how it looked.  No, I needed a picture from her, because I was having trouble reading her messages. A picture was not enough to replace real interaction, which gave me much more from her micro-expressions to the way her breathing patterns. </p><p>It was much better than a few lines of text. </p><p>She didn’t send one immediately, but I didn’t panic. I might have not read her with my power, but the speed and content of her messages were still enough to confirm that it was enough. </p><p>I still sent another message. ‘I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked you such a thing. I understand if you want me to stop texting,’ it read, giving one that worked well to highlight to her that she could accidentally hurt me emotionally if she didn’t react to my messages in time.  </p><p>A touch manipulative, maybe, but very effective. My phone buzzed with a message, one that shared a cute, blushing selfie. </p><p>Success. </p><p>‘You look beautiful,’ I wrote, feeling far more confident now that I could see her blushing face and her shy smile. She sent another picture, and I complimented her. Ten minutes later, another arrived, their difference stark. </p><p>The first picture was shy yet panicked, one that she sent to assure me that she was still thinking of me and didn’t want to stop messaging. The second one had a surprising quality … but the third one showed an almost enthusiastic quality. </p><p>She enjoyed my compliments … probably because she wasn’t receiving many with her body hidden behind her unnecessarily loose boring pantsuits.</p><p>Fascinating, I thought, making sure to give a lot of praise and compliments back. I didn’t even need to ask for another picture. Just a few compliments were enough to get another photo. </p><p>While that was going on, I continued to move around the city in a random pattern even as the evening slowly started to draw near. </p><p>‘I’m back at home,’ she wrote even as I was driving back. </p><p>‘How about another picture,’ I wrote back. </p><p>‘Give me a few minutes first. I’m about to change,’ she wrote. </p><p>I sent back a winky face. I didn’t need to see her face to know that she was blushing hard. </p><p>‘I … I can’t,’ she wrote back. </p><p>‘Just your face and shoulders, honey,’ I wrote back, pushing a bit hard. ‘Nothing naughty, I promise,’ I sent another. </p><p>She didn’t send back an answer for a while, which would have scared me quite a bit if it wasn’t for my power showing the depths of her shyness and self-doubt when I overcharged it. </p><p>‘I … I can’t take the risk of it leaking,’ she sent a message, which put a frown on my face. Not because I didn’t get the suggestive photo I had been hoping for, but because I made a mistake reading her. I was confident that I read her correctly. </p><p>What else I made such a monumental mistake…</p><p>Luckily, before I could lose myself in a sprawl of panic, she sent a link. Link of a public app … one that erased the pictures five seconds after opening. ‘It’s not that I don’t trust you, but there’s a lot of hackers,’ she said in a message, then sent several more explaining about the security of it. </p><p>I installed it, glad that I got a disposable phone for that purpose and wasn’t running the risk of some kind of hacking. </p><p>The fact that the app was a public one made it even safer. </p><p>She sent a response back. A wordless one, one that showed only her face and shoulders as I asked, but her blush was considerably more intense than I was expecting. The picture disappeared five seconds later … and, if it wasn’t for my power, I would have never caught the reason for her intense blush, and would assume that it was just about the jitters. </p><p>But, with my power, I was able to catch a distorted reflection of her body on a small ornament. It wasn’t much … just enough to tell me that she was completely nude. </p><p>What a nice surprise. </p><p>I wrote back a lengthy list of compliments as I parked my bike in front of the bar, which worked well to earn a few more pictures, all while she was in her room. None of those pictures showed anything more than her face and shoulders, and none of them had conveniently located small reflective surfaces for me to catch what was going on — the bigger mirrors, she clearly avoided deliberately. </p><p>Yet, her blush told me all I needed about her state of nudity, making me feel very aroused. </p><p>I walked in. Tara was at the bar, going through the prep list I had given to her, dicing lemons, crushing ice, and washing the cocktail implements. </p><p>She heard my approach, but didn’t turn, just raised her ass invitingly. Naughty minx. I said nothing as I approached, kissing her neck, enjoying the way she shivered against my body, tempting me to bend her down and take her against the bar. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was already evening, and on the security cameras, I could already see several bodyguards checking the area, to make sure there was no danger for their bosses.</p><p>Meaning, I would have customers soon. </p><p>“Why don’t you go and change. We’ll have visitors soon,” I said as I slapped her ass, enjoying her shiver, ignoring the temptation of a quickie by pushing her against the bar. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said, disappointed. </p><p>“Work hard, and I’ll make your reward memorable,” I added, which made her skip a step in anticipation… </p><p>Fascinating, I said as I started waiting for my customers. Though, unlike the previous evening, I didn’t expect a crowd.  </p><p>Luckily, I had my texting partner to keep me occupied. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
