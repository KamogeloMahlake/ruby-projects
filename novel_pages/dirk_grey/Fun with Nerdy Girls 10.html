        <title>Fun with Nerdy Girls 10</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Despite the nerdy hobbies of the girls, the lunch had been fun, so for the rest of the classes, I had a smile persistent smile on my face. Though, admittedly, that smile might be about the message I received from Carrie, telling me that she would visit my house after dinner. </p><p>Apparently, with her shyness beaten, she approached sex with the same enthusiasm she displayed for her classes. </p><p>I was feeling the anticipation as I went back home and gone through my exercise routine, only to read an interesting message on my phone after finishing my shower. Carrie was telling me that she was going to visit with a friend. It seemed that Sarah wanted to accompany her in a misguided attempt to help Carrie seduce me, unaware of her progress. To clench her objective, it seemed that Sarah even forced Carrie to bring her swimsuit along. </p><p>I couldn’t help but respect Sarah’s well-meaning determination as I changed into my swimming trunk and a t-shirt, which, unlike the loose stuff I wore for school, displayed my muscles to the best of effect. Carrie had an excellent body, so, seeing her in a swimsuit would have been enough to erase her nerdy image if I hadn’t already studied her body in great detail, without anything in the way to ruin the view. </p><p>Just as I finished leaving a couple of snack plates on the side of the pool to create a small party —minus any alcohol, as I tried not to take any in the first place, but also I didn’t want Sarah to have any mental clutch if I could manage to push the night the way I wanted to— when I heard a car pulling into my driveway.  </p><p>I went there to greet them, only to see Sarah leaving the passenger seat while whispering a number of quick recommendations for Carrie, unaware —or uncaring— that her pose was straining her short dress to the limit, displaying her toned thighs to the best effect. She might have a lithe body, lacking the curves Carrie sported, but seeing her legs naked, I concluded that that particular difference by no means hurt her overall sexiness. </p><p>“Hi, Chad,” Carrie waved after their quick discussion ended, sporting a smile that could be classified as smug when she noticed Sarah had frozen momentarily when she saw me wearing a tight t-shirt that displayed my muscles to the best of effect. </p><p>“Hi, girls,” I said, which pulled Sarah from her daze. </p><p>“Hi, Chad,” she said. “Sorry to come without asking, but I was getting bored at the house, and the idea of a swim was too tempting.” </p><p>“Hey, I’m not going to argue if two sexy girls want to prance around wearing swimsuits,” I said with a smirk, which earned a pair of blushing faces. Admittedly, it wasn’t the smoothest line, but in my experience, flexing a pair of tastefully muscular shoulders went a long way to enhance any flirtatious line. </p><p>I led them to the pool even as I pulled my shirt off, which earned an appreciative hum from Sarah and a shy gasp from Carrie. “Damn, it’s a nice pool,” Sarah murmured in fascination before she grabbed the hem of her dress, only to pull it with a smooth move, revealing her tight body, clad in a relatively modest black bikini set. </p><p>I would have assumed that it was about her trying to help Carrie to seduce me, but interestingly, I could see a hint of vulnerability in her lovely brown eyes as she jumped into the pool in a quickness that contrasted with her brashness. However, no matter how quickly she jumped, it was impossible for her to hide her spectacular-looking ass, its tightness compensating for its relatively modest portions. It was displayed even better when she jumped forward, straining the capabilities of her bottom to contain her tight ass. </p><p>Interesting attitude, delicious body, I noted mentally. </p><p>Her hesitancy disappeared when her body was concealed under the dark waters of the pool. “Come on, Carrie, don’t keep us waiting,” she said immediately. Outwardly, she was trying to help Carrie to push through her shyness, but it was hard to miss the patronizing edge in her tone. If the way Carrie’s eyes tightened was any indicator, I wasn’t the only one to take note of that particular detail. </p><p>I wondered if this particular point of discontent could be useful. </p><p>“Do you mind showing me a room to change?” Carrie asked, which made Sarah’s eyes widen in surprise. </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I followed her. </p><p>Carrie stayed silent until we reached a room that couldn’t be seen from the pool, and I realized the reason for Sarah’s surprised expression. Because Carrie was quick to free her body from her dress, revealing a modest one-piece underneath that somehow even managed to hide Carrie’s delicious curves. </p><p>“I’m so sick of her patronizing attitude,” she whispered as she tried to reach for the zipper on the back. </p><p>“Let me help,” I said as I grabbed the zipper, pulling it down hungrily to reveal her back. “But her attitude is understandable. You’re acting too shy with them, so they don’t know the dirty vixen underneath,” I added as I caressed along her spine. </p><p>Her blush at the word vixen indicated that Sarah was truly not to blame other than a bit excessive patronizing. “Still, she’s too patronizing about it,” she said as she shed her one-piece, revealing her naked body to my hungry gaze. It might not be the first time I saw her in her birthday suit, but it didn’t prevent me from sporting a raging boner. </p><p>“Well, we can deal with that tonight if you want,” I offered with a wide smile as I dwindled the distance between us to nothingness, close enough for her nipples to brush against my chest. </p><p>“L-like what?” she stammered, even more affected by our closeness. </p><p>“Just try to be your confident self whenever we’re alone,” I whispered as I cupped her ass and pulled her tight, pressing my concealed shaft against her stomach. “Other than that, I’ll challenge both of you together until she fails to take the challenge.” </p><p>“You think that would work?” she asked with a cute whisper. </p><p>In response, I kissed her aggressively. “Well, considering you’re confident enough to kiss me naked while Sarah might get curious and wander around, I trust you to handle that.” </p><p>That reminder didn’t help her flailing confidence. And as much as I enjoyed watching her blush spread into her naked body, I actually did need to return before Sarah got suspicious. After throwing one last smirk her way, I left. </p><p>I found Sarah on the corner of the pool, peering inside intently, no doubt curious about what was going on. Luckily, I was quick enough that her curiosity hadn’t turned into suspicion. “Is there anything I can help with?” Sarah asked curiously. </p><p>“No, she said she decided to change her swimsuit,” I explained, and immediately after, jumped in the pool, flexing my muscles to display. </p><p>“Good,” Sarah said. She looked like she wanted to say something more, but with her gaze dipping down to my wide shoulders, I could see her swallowing the next portion she was about to say. Instead, she opened an inconsequential discussion about classes. However, interestingly, I could see her eyes dancing on my muscles whenever she thought I wasn’t looking, with a blush that she relied on the relative darkness of the pool to hide. </p><p>Five minutes passed, but Carrie was yet to appear. “She’s a bit shy,” Sarah finally commented on her lengthy disappearance. </p><p>“Actually, I found her quite a bit more articulate when she’s not in a crowd,” I said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s even more adventurous than you once she warms up.” </p><p>“That’s a bit stretch,” Sarah countered immediately at her pride being pricked, clearly not appreciating my comment, reacting even at the cost of making an indirect dig to her friend. Though I could see that it was unintentional, a reaction to her shyness. </p><p>After all, Sarah’s personality could be only classified as outgoing and dominant compared to the rest of her friends, half of it unable to speak to strangers while the other half with a tendency to lose themselves in their own hobbies. Compared to them, Sarah was a shining example of extrovert personality. </p><p>However, in truth, she was just as shy as the rest, just hiding it better. </p><p>Therefore, when I claimed Carrie might not be as shy as she looked, it assaulted the way she defined herself, therefore reacting easily. Unfortunately, that was exactly what I wanted, because on the end of that road lay some really interesting possibilities. It wasn’t the nicest thing to do, but with the elusive possibility of a threesome tempting me, personally, I had no problem sliding back to bad-boy territory for a moment. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said, adding just enough mocking edge to force her to answer. “So, you’re saying that you push as far as Carrie is willing to tonight if I can successfully goad her into some interesting party games.” </p><p>“Not even a challenge,” she responded quickly. To her defense, she managed to keep her tone relatively even, so much that if it wasn’t for her growing blush, visible even in the dimly lit pool, I might have believed her conviction. </p><p>“Excellent, it’s a bet then,” I said. I didn’t talk about the stakes, because, ultimately, there was nothing I could directly ask that would be more interesting than the consequences of her struggle for the bet.  </p><p>Before Sarah could say anything, Carrie walked in, wearing a red bikini that barely supported her prodigious breasts, not that they needed any support in the first place. It wasn’t a revealing set, or more accurately, wouldn’t have been revealing on someone with a more ordinary bust size. Her breasts strained against the fabric as she walked toward us, each step making her breast bounce. </p><p>Her hips were no less impressive, even if the bottom of her bikini made an impressive effort to hide everything successfully. Unfortunately, the bikini was clearly purchased before Carrie had completed her growth sport, and every step was straining the capability of her bottoms to contain her plump ass, with a delicious result. </p><p>“Sorry about being late, but I had some trouble fitting to my swimsuit,” Carrie said, hiding a smug undertone under her shy statement as she slid herself into the water carefully, which was the correct choice. I doubted whether her bikini could survive such exertion. Even as she slowly moved toward us, her swimsuit was straining to its maximum capacity. </p><p>“So, you decided not to wear the one-piece after all,” Sarah cut in, trying to hide her shock at Carrie’s choice of swimsuit. She was clearly aware of the existence of the bikini that was struggling to contain Carrie’s body, and she obviously believed that Carrie could never wear them in front of a boy. </p><p>If she had been more alert, she might have realized that my goading her into a bet worked suspiciously well with Carrie’s change of swimsuit, but luckily, she was distracted by Carrie’s impressive display, leaving the night bare with a multitude of possibilities… </p>
