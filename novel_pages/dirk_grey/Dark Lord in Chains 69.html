        <p>Deciding on the exact shape of fun I had offered to Sapphire didn’t take long. With her locked in chains, trembling softly as I caressed her skin as she tried to suppress the effect of my touch. I wanted to enjoy her beauty, yet I wanted to make her suffer a bit to properly fit our environment. </p><p>Ultimately, torturing her with pleasure and with an unmet climax was the only acceptable compromise between those two aspects. </p><p>Amusingly, I thought even as I put my hand on her beautiful bosom, enjoying the sensation, that Sapphire was likely the most deserving person to such treatment. After all the times she had enjoyed teasing men for her own purposes, it was the time she had a taste of her own medicine. </p><p>She moaned as I twisted her nipple, yet to realize just how far I wanted to stretch our little teasing game. </p><p>“So, Your Majesty,” I said as my smile widened. “I remember we were having an interesting dispute about how to define the proper relationship between two of us. Do you have any new ideas about the topic, or would you like to defend your earlier position?” </p><p>“I’m not — your woman,” she gasped, interrupted halfway by a moan as I chose that moment to twist her nipple, giving her a fresh flood of pleasure, though even before that, her statement lost a noticeable amount of sharpness. </p><p>Understandable considering the unfamiliarity of the current situation. We had shared some compromising situations before, even in her throne room, she wasn’t as vulnerable. In the cell, wrapped in magic-blocking chains, dressed in the remains of her conservative dress that left anything above her waist naked, she was just a delicious prey. </p><p>A prey that I fully intended to tease properly. </p><p>“I admire your determination,” I said as I caressed her belly, though, with my smirk and mocking tone, it was hardly a sincere statement. </p><p>Her blush, creeping even deeper into her beautiful complexion, showed that she was very much aware of that. Yet, her embarrassment, combined with my ongoing admiration, worked wonders to keep her beautiful mouth shut, letting it pass without prompting. </p><p>“No wonder you’re the Queen of such a great Empire, You can reject the call of pleasure so decisively,” I said even as my fingers continued to stray lower, finally grabbing her dress once more. The moment I made contact, I noticed her nipples hardening even further in anticipation, making me chuckle. </p><p>This time, I didn’t rip her dress. No need to do so, when a stiff pull was all I needed to push it to the floor, revealing her nudity. “What a shame,” I murmured even as I admired her excited body. “Maybe the Empire is in an even worse condition than I expected. Otherwise, how could the Queen couldn’t even afford underwear for herself.” I chuckled again. “It’s not like such a vaunted political figure neglect to wear any underwear for the sheer reason of making a secret prison trip naughtier, right?” </p><p>She crossed her legs, trying to hide her growing wetness at my words. Unfortunately for her, after all the little sessions of pleasure, we had shared, her concealment attempts weren’t working as well as she intended. </p><p>“You’re wrong…” she started before letting her words fade, smart enough to realize it was not a topic she could argue easily. At least, not under our current circumstances.  </p><p>I stopped for a moment, enjoying just how sexy she looked while wearing nothing but a pair of chains. Her naked bust looked spectacular as her breasts pushed up repeatedly thanks to her out-of-control breathing, her nipples hard enough to create a safety hazard, though even that wasn’t as alluring as her long legs, crossed to hide her wet core. </p><p>Pity that I had no intention of allowing her to succeed on that particular task. </p><p>“Let’s start with your punishment,” I said as I closed in the distance once again, pushing my leg between hers, parting them enough to reveal the well-trimmed treasure between them. Though, despite my aggressive assault, her hips rose to match my movement — as much as she could manage under the circumstances — while my fingers got closer. </p><p>The shiver that danced along her body, making her curves tremble as I touched her core was simply beautiful. </p><p>She said nothing as my fingers danced. She tried to look calm, but hiding the impact of the sudden flood of pleasure was not something she was able to conceal successfully. Soon, she started moaning, unaware that I had no intention of letting her arrive at a quick climax. </p><p>The moment I noticed the signs of an impending climax, I pulled back. “So, since you had the time to consider my question, do you want to change your mind, or do you want me to continue your punishment.” </p><p>“Punish me,” she said, though it sounded less like a challenging declaration, and more like an explosive reflection of her desires. I had no problems punishing her, of course. </p><p>Though, I doubted she would be as enthusiastic if she knew my exact plan of punishing her. </p><p>My fingers landed on her body once more, but this time, rather than directly connecting with the treasure between her legs, they started from her calves, soft and inviting, before starting to move up in a slow, teasing manner. She moaned at first, but those moans soon lost their strength as they moved much slower than she expected. </p><p>She glanced down, but I was ready to catch her gaze, my grin managing to arouse a trickle of shame in her as her lips closed, killing the words that seemed to be ready to burst from her lips by informing her that her current plight was intentional. </p><p>“Any change of mind,” I said mockingly even as my fingers continued to climb up, arriving at her plump thighs, enjoying the speed they parted together invitingly despite her earlier declarations. The pleasure was difficult to reject…</p><p>Even if the target wasn’t a Tantric mage who was still struggling through the backlash of her own spells. </p><p>“Hurry up,” she soon whispered, proving just how badly the aftereffects of her spell were affecting her. I glanced upward, only to see her eyes closed — though, with the perks of the angle, it took a while to focus on her face. I couldn’t help but chuckle in satisfaction at her quick surrender, but that didn’t make my fingers move any faster. </p><p>“Why? Isn’t this supposed to be a punishment,” I answered calmly even as I scaled her inner thighs in a lingering slowness, enjoying the way her eyes popped open as the realization hit her? </p><p>“But—“ she tried to start, only to fade into a moan as one of my fingers moved upward, caressing her entrance for a lingering second, working wonders. </p><p>Yet, I pulled back again. </p><p>She tried to press her thighs together to handle it herself, but I pushed my leg between before she could succeed, preventing her trick from succeeding. “You’re evil,” she gasped. </p><p>I pressed my hand to my heart and gasped theatrically. “You wound me, Your Majesty. How can I handle being called evil?” She avoided my gaze as she realized the comical absurdity of blaming a Dark Lord for being evil, looking everywhere but me. “Maybe I should leave and take a walk to process this overwhelming insult.” </p><p>That suggestion was enough to suppress the shyness resulting from her earlier blunder as her gaze found mine, her eyes wide in shock. "No, please!” she gasped, the last pieces of her dignity as a Queen abandoned in the face of unmet desire. </p><p>“You’re lucky that I’m not an evil man,” I said, unable to prevent myself from delivering that dig even as one of my hands returned to her wet core, caressing gently, while the other landed on her beautiful bosom, much more aggressive. </p><p>Yet, even during that glorious double-assault, I made sure to keep her away from the toppling point, each touch earning even needier moans. If she still had access to her magic, I had no doubt that she would have done her best to take that last step with her Tantric spells, but with her mana blocked, she was helpless. </p><p>“So tense,” I chuckled as I leaned forward, taking her beautiful nipple to my mouth, teasing it carefully through an alliance between my tongue and my lips. </p><p>“Please,” she gasped, her need echoing in her tone, enough to melt the heart of a more merciful man. Unfortunately for her, I might be many things, but merciful was one trait I had tried to cultivate, her needy gasps only triggering my desire to play with her more. </p><p>Not to mention, considering her secret identity as the exotic dancer that drove her customers insane with unmet desire, the irony of her position made the torture even more delicious. </p><p>“I don’t know, I might have displayed some kind of mercy to my woman, but you’re just a stranger. Why should I show concern to your needs?” I asked. </p><p>The expression on the conflict on her face was beautiful, especially since it barely survived a handful of seconds. “I surrender,” she purred beautifully as her gaze met mine. “I’m your woman.” </p><p>“What excellent news,” I said as I leaned forward, capturing her lips in a searing kiss, enjoying the feeling of her beautiful lips. </p><p>Though even as I enjoyed her kiss, a question danced on the back of my mind. Should I reward her, or continue to play with her?</p>
