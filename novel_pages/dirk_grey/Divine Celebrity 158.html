        <p>“You’re awake,” my unnamed nurse gasped in shock as she looked at my face. </p><p>“Of course, beautiful,” I said as I made a show of stretching, which displayed my naked shoulders — courtesy of my gown gathering around my waist during the sponge bath. “And, since you’re here, dressed like this, it should mean that the game went well,” I said. </p><p>“The game?” she asked, questioningly. </p><p>I frowned. “Of course, the game. Why else you’re here wearing a costume…” I said before stopping. “Wait a minute, you’re wearing a real nurse's outfit, and not a sexy one. So, unless you’re a cheerleader that’s very dedicated to roleplaying…” I muttered, and she shook her head. I looked around. “I’m in the hospital, aren’t I?” I asked. </p><p>“Unfortunately, yes,” she said. </p><p>“What happened,” I said, and she suddenly froze, remembering the strict instructions of the doctor. I was tempted to start deducing stuff as I looked around to mess with her. If she was any less beautiful, I might have actually done that … but I had a better way. “Let me guess. You can’t tell anything to me. Doctor’s orders,” I said. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she stammered. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. I can guess. The last thing I remember was that we were at the football practice. I’m guessing that I had received a nasty hit, triggering a concussion, maybe some short-term memory loss, and the doctor is afraid of questions creating some kind of strain.” </p><p>“Something like that,” she said, her relaxed expression extremely obvious. </p><p>“Good,” I said, then looked at the sponge in her hand. “You were giving me a sponge bath,” I said as I shifted to a standing position. “Let’s continue.” </p><p>“I …” she said as she took a step forward, before freezing in her place. “I don’t think it’s necessary since you are awake,” she said, clearly working hard to hold herself back. </p><p>It was good to see four years of living underground didn’t take anything from my attractiveness. “Well, if you rather start me questioning just how long I was in the hospital to need a sponge bath instead,” I flirted, giving her my best smile. </p><p>Her blush was spectacular. “Well, you drive a hard bargain,” she said, trying to sound somewhat reluctant … and failing spectacularly. The speed of her steps gave her away. </p><p>“I’m in your hands, my nurse,” I said with a big smile, which earned a nice giggle as she put her sponge on my shoulder, and started dragging it slowly. Her touch was gentle and flirty, echoing through me. </p><p>“Why don’t you climb on the bed. It’s hard for you to reach from there,” I suggested. A forward request, but it worked excellently with her clear attraction. </p><p>“Well, we need to be quick,” she murmured as she followed my request and put her knee on the bed. </p><p>“Oh, really. Why do we need to be quick?” I said. </p><p>“N-nothing,” she rapidly corrected, realizing that she had made a blunder. I could have pushed the issue to tease a bit more, but instead, I grabbed her waist to pull her up. “Naughty,” she gasped, but she clearly preferred that to me pushing her about her latest blunder. </p><p>“I’m just being a gentleman and helping you,” I answered even as I helped her up, and she knelt at my side, slowly washing my back. </p><p>“Oh, really,” she said as she continued to caress my back. “Then, why are you still holding your hands there.” </p><p>“Because I don’t want you to fall off. It would be a sin to allow an angel like you to get hurt,” I said, flirting more rather than mentioning the unnecessary way she leaned against my arm, her large breasts squashing against my arm. </p><p>Why ruin such a beautiful moment like that. </p><p>Instead, I kept my fingers on her waist, slowly moving up and down very occasionally, caressing her in a way that could be excused as an accident, aware that, even with her attraction, pushing too much would ruin the fun. </p><p>I didn’t have my fame anymore. I might have been a local hero back then, but even without the disaster, four years was too long of a time period for people to remember about minor celebrities. </p><p>So, I kept my hands on her waist, right in the compressed part of her beautiful hourglass figure, not daring to explore the true peaks of her anatomy for now. </p><p>Luckily, while my fame might have gone, the same wasn’t true for my skills. With my ability to read her reactions, I didn’t need to move away from her waist to turn her budding attraction into arousal. Soon, my hand moved to her back, caressing along her spine. </p><p>“You’re too naughty, stay still,” she said, but her tone implied something else. Moreover, she started moving up and down, rubbing her breasts along my arm. </p><p>“Well, I need to entertain you somehow,” I said. “I can show you a magic trick instead,” I said. </p><p>“Magic, sure,” she answered with a deadpan voice, and I felt her attraction dwindling almost instantly. I smirked as I dragged my finger up slightly more, using the meager amount of Intent I possessed to give a small push to her bra to untie its straps … allowing me to free it in one pull. </p><p>And, just like that, the arousal was back. She pulled back in surprise while she wrapped her arms around her chest reflexively. “How?” she gasped. </p><p>“Oh, a magician never reveals his secrets,” I said. “But I can do it again if you want. To see if you can catch it.” </p><p>She looked indecisive but still reached her bra. I had a different plan in mind. I slipped my fingers under her top, my finger slipping to the side of her pants, caressing her panties. “Not that, perv,” she gasped as she made a move to grab her bra. I pulled it away.</p><p>She tried to reach again, this time giggling. “Give it back,” she said, but since she was still keeping an arm around her chest, there was no hope of her doing so. </p><p>I just kept holding her waist to prevent her, which soon turned into tickling. “S-stop it,” she said, giggling even louder, seemingly forgotten that she was supposed to be tending to a patient who had just woken up from a coma. </p><p>I tickled her again and lost in the moment, she let her other hand drift away from her chest. The way her breasts danced, as she laughed, showed the reason she wore scrubs two sizes too large very well. Unfortunately for her, our current position tugged her top, making it stick to her body, and ruining the whole point of loose top. </p><p>I chuckled as she continued her ‘struggle’ still trying to reach for her bra while my fingers danced on her naked belly. </p><p>That laughter suddenly gained a heated quality as my fingers climbed up slightly, touching her ribs. Her eyes widened as my naked touch climbed up, but she did her best to hide that expression, happy to play the part of innocence like she didn’t realize the way things had been developing. </p><p>She wasn’t very successful in that, but I wasn’t a moron, so I didn’t point that out. “It looks like I have a stubborn patient,” she growled playfully as she stopped making a move for her bra and grabbed the sponge. I put her bra in the drawer, and started enjoying my treatment. </p><p>However, even as I stopped tickling her, I let my hand rest on her naked side, the presence enough to ride her scrub up quite a bit, showing far too much skin to be appropriate. She dragged her sponge on my body. </p><p>As she let her sponge dance over my body, my fingers started to get restless once more. Slowly, they started to climb higher, discovering sensitive spots along her body, even earning a moan in the process. </p><p>She tried to hide it as a cough, but once again, she wasn’t particularly successful. </p><p>My fingers climbed even higher, caressing the underside of her breast. She didn’t say anything, but I could feel the way my Lust Domain echoing off her, the intensity of the Intent she provided growing. </p><p>Rather than letting the System devour that bit, I created a small storage, ready to use on the reporters to generate some kind of advantage. I continued teasing her, feeling her attention firmly focused on me. Her emotions were intense, but no matter the intensity, the amount of Intent one person could generate was limited. </p><p>It was a meager amount, even when I compared it to the amount I had collected from my first fateful chess tournament. </p><p>Not that I let it dissuade me. It wasn’t like I had a better alternative to collect Intent while I waited for the reporters to arrive… </p><p>More importantly, it wasn’t like teasing my sexy blonde nurse with an hourglass figure that would make any model jealous was a great hardship. </p><p>“I think that’s enough with that sponge,” I said. </p><p>“Right—” she said, her tone disappointed, which was suddenly cut off as I suddenly flipped her, and she ended up on her back, while I grabbed the sponge. </p><p>“Now, it’s my turn to give you a bath,” I said. </p>
