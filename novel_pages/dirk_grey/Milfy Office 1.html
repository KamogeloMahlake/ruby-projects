        <p>The moment Vernon stepped into the office where he was supposed to be interning, he immediately adjusted his plans. </p><p>Initially, he had been planning to make a call to one of his acquiescences. Playing the quarterback during his college days, even as a backup, had its benefits, almost as much as his family's money. </p><p>And, considering it was his father that arranged the internship — as a part of his ridiculous attempt to set him up with the daughter of his business partners, thinking that he was building a dynasty just because he was rich — he couldn’t use his family contacts. His father arranged it so that he could meet with the daughter of his business partner without an official setup. </p><p>Apparently, she was rather picky. </p><p>The office he was joining as an intern was a new one, one that was set up for the daughter, who was apparently just graduated, and was enthusiastic about cutting off from her family — like renting a downtown building and converting it into a freelance architecture agency meant cutting from the family. </p><p>Vernon didn’t care much about seducing a rich heiress — though only because it was supposed to be a permanent thing — and he was ready to use his contacts to free himself from the obligation …</p><p>But a glimpse at the receptionist changed his mind. A sexy redhead, looking sexy enough to die for even when she was wearing a boring t-shirt. Though, it looked far more impressive on her body, sticking to her amazing tits. </p><p>Maybe he could stick around a day before changing his internship location. </p><p>“I’m here to start as the intern,” he said. </p><p>“You’re Vernon,” she said, raising her gaze. Vernon was happy to see a blush on her face. Sticking around a day was certainly a good idea. “You’re late.” </p><p>“The building was hard to find,” he said. “Maybe you can show me around and make sure I don’t get lost.” </p><p>Her blush increased. “Maybe, but we need to make sure—“ she started, only for her words to cut off with a gasp, and she turned toward the other end of the office, where a very distinctive clack of a heeled shoe reached to his ear. </p><p>Curious, he looked there, only for his thoughts about his stay in the office immediately. Maybe he could stay for longer than a day. </p><p>The reason for that change. A sexy Asian, wearing a skirt that was far too tiny for the office environment, and an even sluttier shirt that showed her cleavage … along with her absurdly large tits. Just the view alone was enough for him to stick around a couple days more … not to mention all the implications of the way she dressed implied. </p><p>Especially her makeup, shouting neediness.</p><p>Vernon guessed that it wasn’t a usual thing, because the sexy receptionist gasped next to him. “T-that whore,” she said as she stood up, the intensity of her shock showing it was not a regular thing. </p><p>Maybe she prepared for his arrival. </p><p>Interesting. </p><p>He watched as the sexy redhead dashed forward. “I can’t believe you dressed like this, Hina. This is a place of business.” </p><p>“Come on, Margaret. Calm down, just because you don’t dare to dress up a bit doesn’t mean that we all need to walk around like nuns,” she answered. “And what’s the harm. I don’t see our dear boss around.” </p><p>“She might be here any day…” </p><p>“Not if she extended her holiday,” Hina answered with a smug smirk. </p><p>“How do you know that?” Margaret answered. “You can’t know that!” </p><p>“I follow her on social media,” she said, and while the redhead froze in shock, she bypassed her and continued walking toward him, the sway of her hips doing nothing to hide her sexiness. </p><p>Oh, Vernon would definitely stay here for a few days. Until that entitled prospective fiancee of his return from her holiday, at least. </p><p>“As you might have heard, I’m Hina, a big fan,” she said. </p><p>“A fan?” Vernon said, amused. </p><p>“I have seen you play against us, and you demolished our team. You were amazing,” Hina said. She tried to sound confident as she said it, but up close, Vernon could see that she lacked confidence. </p><p>Vernon knew the type. A nerd, probably a scholarship student, whose college life had ended the moment she entered the college, not daring to change it. And now, she was desperately trying to change that reputation in her new work, not realizing that she was pushing too much toward the other side. </p><p>Even the way she dressed confirmed it, excessively revealing and slutty, even slightly transparent. Hardly the smartest location. </p><p>“Oh, always nice to meet with a fan,” Vernon said, leaning slightly slower. The slight panic mixing with excitement, followed by the speed she leaned forward showed that Vernon would have a very quick conquest on her. </p><p>The perfect thing to spice up his short office life. </p><p>“Enough, Hina. You can leave. We still need to assign his tasks.” </p><p>Hina walked toward her. “No need to be jealous, just because you can’t get any, miss prude.” </p><p>“I - I’m no prude, just selective,” Margaret answered, though her tone was evasive. </p><p>Hina laughed mockingly. “And you’ll continue to be … selective as long as you come here dressed like this.” </p><p>“It’s better than to dress like a slut,” Margaret answered, though it didn’t have the impact she hoped to have, leaving her frustrated. As Hina walked away, Margaret rushed to him, her beautiful face contorted in anger. </p><p>“You can go start sorting the files in the archive room if you have time to look around and do nothing,” she ordered. </p><p>Vernon could have argued against it, but instead, he let it slide. She was angry, and if he argued against her, he would give her a  chance to target him. Instead, he followed her direction, leaving her trembling in anger. </p><p>He couldn’t wait to see the poor decisions she would do in that terrible state of mind. </p><p>His first moments in his office were certainly fun… </p>
