        <p>“You should get someone to look at that driveway. Parking is a hell. I never had so much trouble parking,” I said the moment I entered and saw Charlie’s worried expression, doing my best to look frustrated. </p><p>“I told you so,” Mark whispered, thinking that it went unnoticed, and Charlie relaxed as well. </p><p>It was a simple trick. From their perspective, I was the classic incompetent middle manager. I played the frustrated card because that required a big and fragile ego. I wasn’t naive enough to think that my ego was not big, but it wasn’t enough to feel a sense of failure if I failed to park a car.</p><p>However, they believed it to be so, which gave a reason for my late appearance. </p><p>“It can be tricky in the dark. I have been meaning to add some extra lights,” Mark answered, quick to create a bogus excuse for me as a professional bootlicker. I kept my disdain hidden. Mark’s attitude rubbed me wrong. It wasn’t so much the lack of a spine, but his utter confidence that he was the smartest person in the room, despite not having a single shred of evidence to back it up.</p><p>I would have enjoyed fooling with his wife even if Tiffany hadn’t been such an absolute redheaded bombshell, with a fun personality to match. </p><p>Charlie was different. I liked the kid enough that, I wouldn’t have messed with him if he didn’t try to follow Mark’s idiotic suggestion and tried to play me. Even then, I probably wouldn’t have been so heavy-handed if he didn’t have a treasure for a fiancee. </p><p>Umi was not only a diamond, but also a raw diamond. Her beauty was already fascinating, and there was a bonus sense of pleasure I got from slowly chipping away her sense of shame and propriety, leaving a striking beauty behind. </p><p>I said nothing else as I approached them, and went over the presentation. It was completely useless, had no actionable items, and carried a lot of idealistic nonsense theories that relied on assumptions that would never work in real life. For any practical purposes, it was completely useless. </p><p>In other words, the perfect corporate presentation. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I said. Mark smiled proudly, while Charlie just nodded, still looking miffed. Considering our last encounter included me ordering his fiancee to remove her underwear while I watched, all the while blaming him for the situation, not shocking. “However, there are still some changes to be made. The second page, for example…” I said, and gave them some corrections.</p><p>As we worked, Umi and Tiffany arrived with some delay. I planned to call them to stop working, but when Tiffany shook her head with a playful gesture, I decided against it. She had a plan. While I had never been much of a follower, Tiffany had proved herself enough. I said nothing as, after the momentary chat, they went upstairs. </p><p>We continued working until the changes started to get overwhelming. It would take hours to fix. A portion of those changes were necessary, but most were just there to create some extra work for them. </p><p>My ego might not be fragile, but I never claimed not to be petty. And, messing with them was a good way to kill some time while waiting for the two. </p><p>The only thing that saved them from a staggering amount of work was the disappearance of Tiffany and Umi didn’t last long. They came down merely fifteen minutes later, having changed significantly. </p><p>Umi was still dressed as a secretary, but she had changed her top to one from Tiffany. It was still a white blouse, but unlike the other one, which had a limit on how sexy it could be considering she actually wore it to the office, it was tight enough to be fit to a stripper, and transparent enough to be classified as erotic rather than suggestive. She still wore her blazer, which blunted the impact. Her nipples stayed hidden, for example. </p><p>But not enough to prevent her fiancee’s frustrated gasp. </p><p>Mark kicked him under the table, reminding him about the ploy they were trying to pull on me for my goodwill, unaware that I had long realized their intention and took far more. He was also unaware that I wouldn’t be willing to extend any favor to him for his beautiful wife’s hard work. </p><p>Tiffany was the one who worked, and she would choose her rewards. And, up to this day, she steadily chose her own benefit over her spineless husband’s career. </p><p>Not that I blamed her, particularly when the only reaction Mark showed when Tiffany walked in was a soft growl of frustration, one that he tried to hide when I glanced at him. For once, I was impressed with him one of his achievements. </p><p>Tiffany was dressed to kill. </p><p>Her outfit was one of a card dealer, the cute bowtie and the distinct sleeveless black velvet vest were recognizable enough. The little green dealer visor her head, along with the cards and chips, further confirmed the nature of the costume. </p><p>Admittedly, they were needed, because she had neglected a very important part of the outfit. Those vests were designed to be worn with a shirt … and a bra. Absent in both, the voluptuous redhead radiated an erotic energy. </p><p>Her tiny plied skirt hardly helped to blunt her sexiness in a way that would make it acceptable for her husband, yet Mark hid his frustration. </p><p>“Hey, honey. I hope the work is over, because I’m ready for the game night you asked from me,” Tiffany said, with a very sharp focus on the last four words. Mark’s eyes widened, showing that he caught that as well. </p><p>I didn’t need to ask about what happened. Mark probably asked her to flirt with me heavy-handedly, using a game night as an excuse … and, considering she looked more regretful than angry, I guessed he wasn’t particularly careful while asking that. </p><p>Angering a redhead was never a good idea.</p><p>“Actually, we still have some —” Mark started. </p><p>“Nonsense. I told you all that’s needed. I trust you to fix the rest,” I said, not bothering to hide my lecherous gaze as I enjoyed Tiffany’s boundless cleavage. They were kind enough to serve, so I would take it. </p><p>Such initiative would be enough to make Mark happy in any situation where his wife wasn’t dressed as a porno version of a casino dealer, but he swallowed his complaints. Charlie threw an incredulous glance at Mark, realizing exactly what he committed by following Mark’s suggestion. </p><p>I would have pitied him, but he ruined that chance earlier in my office. </p><p>“Honey, why don’t you go and pick the drinks from the kitchen,” Tiffany asked. </p><p>“Let me help,” Charlie said as he stood up, frustrated. I would have tried to interfere under different circumstances, but Charlie wore an expression of frustration and anger. Not exactly in the mood where he could convince Umi that they should leave. </p><p>He would try, but he would come too strong, too frustrated, and it would only make Umi more stubborn. With any luck, he might actually try to browbeat her, thinking that she was still the same old meek girl… </p><p>They went out, while Tiffany started to set the table. </p><p>It was shaping out to be an excellent night. </p>
