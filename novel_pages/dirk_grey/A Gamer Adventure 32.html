    <body>
        <p>I couldn’t help but to feel excited as I walked around the rock and stepped into Aviada’s line of sight with a naked Helga behind me, who managed to miss the fact that she was still naked while still trying to process her last orgasm. Aviada’s face was a work of art, still carrying hints of the pleasure that invaded her body, but the frustration was clear on her face. </p><p>“Bastard,” she growled the moment she noticed me, but despite her disrespect and anger, I was familiar with her enough to see her respect underneath. My forceful attitude was clearly working wonders on her. Things changed a bit when Aviada’s gaze turned to Helga, beset with jealousy. “And the whore is here as well,” she said with an angry smirk, trying to vent her frustrations on her instead. </p><p>Helga stiffened at the insult, her shoulders slouched in a habit born from endless bullying. The insult was dissatisfying enough, as I worked too hard on Helga’s self-confidence to appreciate it being undermined once more, but the insult reminded Helga about her nakedness, and she wrapped her arm around her chest in an effort to hide her amazing breasts, still carrying the marks of my hungry treatment. She would have dashed away if it wasn’t for my hand around her wrist. </p><p>I let her hide behind me even as I took a step forward, a disapproving expression on my face. “That wasn’t nice,” I said, but my tone wasn’t angry. I tried to replicate the tone of a nice but disappointed teacher. Seeing Aviada’s anger flare, I smirked inwardly. I used that tone, because, for all its lack of obvious display of power, it came with an implied superiority. Aviada, despite her spectacular defeat, still saw the situation between us as on the same tier, so she didn’t appreciate the assumption. </p><p>“So what if it wasn’t nice,” Aviada spat with renewed anger. “What are you going to do about it!” </p><p>Aviada was a sharp woman just like a sword. However, just like a sword, her mind worked straight and on right angles, so it took less than a second for me to decipher why she turned her anger from Helga to me. She was trying to goad me into taking a direct action in anger, which would put me in the same position as her. Instead of giving her what she wanted, I sighed deeply. “I’m disappointed, Aviada. I would have expected you to act more mature, but it seems that you haven’t learned your lesson yet. It seems that I need to punish you more. </p><p>She smirked at the mention of punishment, watching me in anticipation as I waved my hand, and a chair formed out of the ground, giving me a comfortable seat. Aviada looked confused until I flexed my magic and her chains suddenly lengthened. Not expecting to lose her support, she failed to resist as she fell forward, and found herself on my lap. “No,” she said in dread as I pulled her pants down, but I disregarded her complaint to land a spank on her bottom. Her shocked cry was a melody to my ears. </p><p>“How,” she murmured in shock. It was understandable, considering her level, I shouldn’t be able to hurt her unless I hit her hard enough to actually inflict damage, and my lazy spank was far from doing that. However, what she didn’t count on was my biomancy skill, modifying her pain resistance temporarily. Aviada lacked the magical ability to notice, but from the soft hum she made, it was clear that it didn’t slip Helga’s attention. </p><p>I ignored the question and spanked her bottom once more, enjoying the blush that was spreading to her naked bottom. Aviada spewed an endless string of threats, each more visceral than the last, but I ignored them in favor of covering her bottom with endless spanks. Five at first, then ten… Soon it reached thirty with no hint of stopping just like Aviada’s insults, but unlike her insults, my spanks didn’t lose the power behind them. On the contrary, each hurt more than the last as Helga examined the spell carefully, occasionally whispering her findings into my ear and allowing me to make changes to increase its effectiveness even further. </p><p>She was truly a genius. Converting her to my side was a true coup. She stood behind me, leaning forward to press her breasts against my neck, as if to remind me that she wasn’t just a genius but a true display of sexiness, which was enhanced by her recent charisma boost. From the impressive radiance she displayed, I guessed that she received three points to her charisma, maybe even more. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had other things to finish before I could taste her new state. With a renewed enthusiasm, I landed several more spanks on Aviada’s bottom, whose insults and arguments were fading rather rapidly after the last modification. “How long are you going to continue?” she murmured. </p><p>“Until I feel that you’ve learned your lesson,” I said even as I landed yet another slap to her crimson bottom. “So, for a start, definitely not while you continue to insult me.” </p><p>“Sorry,” Aviada murmured from her squeezed teeth, and when my hand landed on her ass once more, she stayed silent. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 48%]</p><p>I found it interesting that the companion tracker chose that moment to move forward, but it, more than anything, showed that Aviada was getting off from being dominated. The sudden wetness of her core the moment she apologized was another piece of evidence to support that. Curious, I thought. “Excellent, ten more and we’re done,” I said as she shuffled on my lap, but said nothing. </p><p>I silently counted ten more spanks, but rather than stopping, I continued. “Hey, you promised only ten!” Aviada exclaimed when I was around fifteenth. </p><p>“Yes, but how do I know whether we reached ten?” I said in an exaggerated tone even as I slapped her bottom once more. </p><p>She squeezed her teeth so hard that it was audible, but still, when my hand landed on her bottom once more, her mouth parted open. “One,” she said obediently. I smirked as I slapped her bottom, but this time, instead of pulling it back immediately, I let my fingers momentarily dip into her wetness to reward her obedience, which returned me a tremble in her tone as she counted the second spank. My fingers slipped down, the duration increasing with each spank, so when we reached the end, Aviada was panting in arousal. “Ten,” she said with a sigh, followed by a moan as my fingers danced on her entrance.</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 49%]</p><p>Aviada continued to lay on my lap obediently, enjoying my caresses while I used biomancy to cure her bottom and dispelling the pain sensitivity spell at the same time. In that moment of laziness, I couldn’t help but think about the implications of the companion system, progressing only in certain situations. With Aviada, there was almost always a domination aspect on the line. Curious, I decided to test that. </p><p>With a flick of my wrist, the chains that were holding Aviada’s arms and legs disappeared, but before she could react, I grabbed her arms, locking them behind her just like I had done before, easily maintaining the grip despite her struggling, much weaker than she was capable of. Even if she had used her full strength -which was higher than mine- I would be able to maintain it thanks to my leverage. I lifted her to slide under her, and took a position behind her, her bottom rising instantly. </p><p>My other hand was empty, but it was easier to cast a spell to free my shaft from the confines of my pants while using my hand to caress her entrance. However, my gaze slipped to Helga, who was looking at me with a frown, and no small amount of jealousy. I caught her gaze, and gestured for her to sit, giving a reassuring smile when her expression gained a questioning quality. </p><p>She wasn’t entirely reassured, but she still followed my order to take a seat. Meanwhile, I pushed my hips forward, pressing my shaft against Aviada’s entrance. “You handled your punishment well, and it’s time for a reward,” I said, chuckling softly when she pushed her hips back enthusiastically. I didn’t let her succeed, pulling my hips back once the crown dipped deeper into her wetness, giving her a small taste to whet her appetite. “Don’t be impatient,” I added, punctuated by a spank to her bottom. “There’s just one thing left to do. You need to apologize to Helga for insulting her earlier. It wasn’t fair for you to call her names.” </p><p>Aviada twisted her neck to catch my gaze, her astonished look replicated by Helga, who was frozen in her seat. Despite their questioning gaze, I just shrugged and stayed silent, waiting for Aviada to speak, which didn’t take long. “If you think I’ll apologize to that little slut-” she started, only to receive a stiff spank to her bottom, which, without the pain enhancement spell, caused an ignoble amount of pain, only the past memories keeping her silent. Which was okay, because the spank was nothing more than to cover for the two spells I applied to her. One to clean and lubricate her backdoor for my invasion, and another for her punishment.  </p><p>“Either that, or I’ll punish you for real,” I said even as my empty hand moved up and grabbed her hair. </p><p>“Do your worst,” Aviada spat out with a satisfied smirk, with the full confidence that she would enjoy the punishment as much as I would. </p><p>That was where she was wrong, but it wouldn’t be apparent at the beginning, at least to her. Helga had a sufficient magical aptitude to understand the aim of the second spell, so she just smirked victoriously as I leaned forward, pushing the tip of my shaft into her puckered hole. Despite the lubrication, her bottom wrapped around my shaft tightly, an effect that was enhanced further by her endless exercising. Her ass was perfection itself, and the prospect of ruining it gave me a fascinating pleasure. </p><p>I attacked her hole mercilessly, impaling repeatedly without waiting for her to adapt, which would have been a disaster to someone weaker, but a high HP pool had usefulness above and beyond killing monsters. Aviada cried, but it wasn’t filled with pain but pleasure instead, my reckless assault pushing her closer to her climax bit by bit, but my and Helga’s smirks got wider the closer Aviada came to a climax, who was too distracted by her own pleasure to notice it… </p><p>A minute later, the reason for it became apparent for her as well. Aviada moaned loudly, her back curling in a beautiful arc in preparation of an explosive orgasm, only to stop confusedly even as I continued to slam her tight hole — which wasn’t as tight anymore. “Is there a problem, Aviada,” I said even as I tightened my grip on her wrists, which proved to be a good idea because she started struggling a moment later, which proved to be ultimately fruitless.  </p><p>“I’ll kill you!” she answered, her angry cry mixing with the sound of flesh hitting flesh. “I’ll make you pay!” </p><p>“Come on, sweetie,” I said even as I increased the pace of my assault, which caused the build-up of another climax thanks to her already charged body, but rather than mollifying her, it only made her struggle harder because of the ending of the process familiar. Helga was watching the situation silently, but from the way she was rubbing her legs together, she was clearly enjoying the sight. Not surprising, considering after all those times she had to suffer under her smug noble peers, it was exhilarating for her to be the observer for once. </p><p>I decided her attitude deserved a reward. Casting the spell to transfer the sensation between two people was a complicated affair, impossible to do while I was struggling to pin Aviada motionless while also pushing her toward another climax. Reversing an already existing spell, however, was much more trivial. I waved my hand, and Helga’s eyes popped open and a moan of shock was ripped from her mouth. She understood what I was trying to do, of course, but my instantaneous casting didn’t give her a chance to react before the ghost of my anal assault started invading her body. </p><p>Helga moaned loudly, enough to break Aviada’s annoyance, who understood that Helga was experiencing the same phenomenon she had gone through minutes ago. Their moans mixed together as they raced towards orgasm, but unlike Helga’s, Aviada’s were tinged with frustration, which was justified, because when Helga’s buildup exploded into an explosive climax, Aviada’s silently disappeared once more, leaving only frustration behind. </p><p>I doubted Helga’s explosive squirting covering her face helped. </p><p>What surprised me was the notification that appeared.</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>The sudden boost in my mana regeneration surprised me in the best of ways. The reason for it was obvious, considering it only happened after I reached fifty percent in Helga’s companion progress, and it triggered only when she climaxed. But the reason for it wasn’t as important as the effect itself. Seeing my mana steadily climbing up was a benefit impossible to overstate, giving me the solution for the biggest mage problem. Combine that with my already huge mana capacity, and my melee abilities to reduce consumption rate, it gave me unparalleled survivability on the field.  </p><p>The unexpected bonus gave me a renewed desire even though I was yet to discover the exact conditions of triggering the perk, or what a perk was. The name was obvious, but I had never heard a mention of them on the books I had read, or any of the doctors that tended to me when I was young had never mentioned something like that either. Regardless, it was another tool in my growing arsenal, even though it came with certain obligations like protecting the source of it. </p><p>Like hanging around a sexy and voluptuous blonde who was as smart as she was sexy was a great chore. </p><p>I decided to focus on that particular finding later on and shifted my focus back to the disobedient brunette who was doing her best to keep herself from moaning—and failing horribly. We had to repeat the cycle of orgasm denial twice more before Aviada opened her mouth for anything other than insults or frustrated moans. “I’m … sorry,” she whispered, impossible to hear without my enhanced senses. </p><p>“Can you repeat that louder?” I asked casually even as I picked up the pace, pushing her toward yet another orgasm, which was getting easier and easier as her frustration built up. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she repeated petulantly, which put a smirk on my face and astonishment on Helga’s, who was clearly enjoying the superior position she had, though the several orgasms she had experienced was definitely not hurting. </p><p>“Not a bad start, but after all the time it took, I’m not going to accept it without you proving your sincerity.” She turned to me with a questioning gaze. “Helga, open your legs,” I ordered even as I pushed Aviada’s head in further, my painful grip on her hair coming handy. </p><p>Helga followed my command, failing to hide her excitement at the idea. However, Aviada was a completely different issue. “Never,” she spat out as she struggled to get back. </p><p>“Well, your call,” I said even as I picked up speed, steadily pushing her toward another vanishing climax. She turned to me, her eyes filled with a begging expression, but I continued explaning, the amusement in my expression contrasting greatly with my exaggerated clinical tone. “You brought it on yourself by trying to mess with me  close to such dangerous territory,” I said, neatly ignoring the fact that my so-called punishment was much more distracting than her little prank. </p><p>She managed to maintain eye contact as her orgasm drove nearer, her disobedience melting with each second until there was nothing more than a simple flicker in her eyes. But despite her best effort, she wasn’t able to hide the enjoyment she was getting from my total domination. After all, she believed in strength, and what she was experiencing was the purest reflection of it. </p><p>Without saying anything else, she turned around and her head disappeared between Helga’s legs, whose expression brightened in shock and desire. It was nice, but not as nice as the notification I had just received. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 50% - Second Stage Completed +10000 Exp]</p><p>[Achievement: Tough Teacher. Be firm in educating a wayward companion. +1000 Experience, +2 Wisdom]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Expert Biomancy, Expert Elemental, Advanced Speech] </p><p>Gaining another boost to my power was always welcome. As much as having a better aptitude on healing spells or better speech ability would have come useful, I was about to launch a long hunting trip, making elemental the best choice. The fact that it would increase my hand against Cornelia during my evening meeting was only a bonus. </p><p>But leveling up wasn’t the greatest benefit of the activity. No, that honor belonged to Aviada’s companion progress. The fact that it was completed after forcibly bending Aviada to my will told me a lot about her personality. Still, instead of spending time trying to assess the implications of that particular discovery, I turned my attention to the spell that was preventing Aviada from reaching completion, and dispelled it with a wave of my hand. A few pushes later, Aviada started trembling with an intensity I had never seen before, threatening to send her to the land of unconsciousness. Thankfully, her endurance was high enough to maintain her consciousness under the rush. </p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 2. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>The confirmation about the perk system was a nice benefit, and that the effect was stacking was the amazing bonus that came with it. It meant that I could experiment with my elemental abilities freely during the hunt without thinking about saving mana for a dangerous situation, because with the bonus, it would only take thirty minutes for my mana pool to refresh completely, a great improvement to several hours of meditation or sleep like it would normally take. </p><p>I pulled out of Aviada and let her collapse on the ground. She needed to catch her breath before we could start hunting. With a sudden instinct, I reached out and pulled Aviada’s sword from its sheath, stiffening myself for the impact, but it didn’t come. Yet another evidence of my total domination. </p><p>I pushed the sword in the nearby rock, impressed by the effortless manner it disappeared before turning my attention to Helga. Since Aviada was going to need several minutes to gather herself, why shouldn’t I entertain myself in the meanwhile… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 16    Experience: 128050 / 136000 </p><p>Strength: 17    Charisma: 24</p><p>Precision: 12    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 14     Manipulation: 19</p><p>Speed: 12       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 13      Wisdom: 20</p><p>HP: 1088 / 1088    Mana: 1326 / 1440        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [69/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [50/50]        </p><p>Expert  Elemental [28/75]</p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration</p>
