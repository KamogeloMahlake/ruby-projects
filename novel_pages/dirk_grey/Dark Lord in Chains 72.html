        <p>“That was … amazing,” Sapphire murmured softly, taking deep breaths, the chains around her arms the only thing that was keeping her trembling legs upright. Meanwhile, I took a step back, enjoying the way she was trembling in front of me. </p><p>“Not was, my sweet Queen,” I murmured even as my smirk widened. “You should be familiar enough with me to know that I had no intention of stopping here.” </p><p>“Promises, promises…” she whispered, her smile widening. I might have been surprised by the sudden change of attitude if it came from the other girls, but coming from Sapphire, it was rather understandable. After all, there was a reason for her to manage an Empire successfully for such a long time, and it wasn’t her beauty. </p><p>Not that her beauty was nothing but spectacular.  </p><p>I had been planning to give her some time to recover before moving to the next step, maybe even allowing her to rest for a while, but her reaction told me that she had other ideas. </p><p>Well, who was I to disappoint such a beautiful Queen? </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured playfully, amused to get such an opening. “If you want a repeat, why don’t you put up a show of your conviction.” </p><p>“I would,” she murmured as she tried to move, her breasts jiggling as well as the chains. “But I can’t exactly move, can I?” </p><p>“You’re right,” I said as I waved my hand, loosening her chains enough to allow her to move around. </p><p>She looked at her wrists, still wrapped in chains. “That’s it?” she asked. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” I whispered. “After all, for a dancer as famous as you, a couple of chains shouldn’t be too much of a problem, right?” </p><p>The flash of frustration she displayed was beautiful, and the expression of determination that followed it was even more beautiful. “If you wish,” she said as she took two steps forward — which was almost all she could do with the movement range the loosened chains allowed. </p><p>“Such a majestic sight,” I murmured, smiling widely, enjoying the irony. </p><p>It earned a frustrated glare, but that didn’t prevent her from taking a step back before her body started swaying softly, a tantalizing show that required only seconds to remind her why she was able to moonlight as the most famous dancer of the Empire. </p><p>The plan was to stay back and watch her dance, but after watching her twirl and dance for barely a minute, my body decided to rebel, forcing me to take a step forward. A primordial feeling of satisfaction swept through me as my hand landed on her ass, enjoying her soft skin. </p><p>“You weren’t supposed to touch the dancer,” she whispered softly, her voice alluring. </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured before I slapped her bottom, enjoying the way her skin wobbled under my touch. “Why don’t you call the guards to drag me away, then,” I said, leaning forward to steal a daring kiss. </p><p>As our tongues battled, my hand continued to dance over her body, caressing her inner thighs for a moment before arriving at her hot core, earning a muffled moan as I slipped inside her softness. </p><p>“I … I can handle myself,” she murmured after I pulled back, her breathing quick, which was hardly helped by the fact that my finger was still in her, pumping slowly to trigger the residual pleasure from her last climax. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, unable to help a chuckle escaping. “Maybe I should trust your experience?” Yet, as I said that, my fingers continued their relentless dance, enjoying the way she tightened around them. I was simply unable to contain myself. </p><p>“Maybe you should pull a chair, then,” she whispered as she gestured to the sole chair in the room. </p><p>“Oh, am I allowed to sit on it,” I said, amused by the sudden blush on her face that had little to do with the pleasure of my fingers, no doubt remembering the gleeful way she had informed me that I wasn’t allowed to use the chair when I was first captured. Normally, I would have pushed her more about that, as I was hardly the most forgiving when it came to such disrespect, but Sapphire went a long way to earn that beautiful forgiveness. I just chuckled as I cast a simple spell, dragging the chair close. </p><p>And I sat down in front of her. </p><p>Sapphire said nothing, just continuing to sway in front of me, seduction oozing from her. She turned a bit, giving me a glimpse of her from the profile before she closed in the distance, her breasts pressing against my chest beautifully. </p><p>I put my hands on her thighs, gliding on her legs up and down around her hips, until she slapped them away. “No touching,” she warned. </p><p>I followed her request, amused by her initiative. She continued to dance, lowering herself down slowly and seductively. Of course, her body finally connected to my lap, her wetness sliding back and forth while my shaft trapped by her ass, gave me a fresh flow of pleasure. </p><p>A pleasure that only got more intense as her hips pressed tighter against my crotch. </p><p>"You naughty Queen," I whispered she continued to dance, her body tight against mine, no doubt about her deep arousal. She said nothing, busying herself to follow the rhythm of an imaginary melody, each second making the moment more delicious. </p><p>My shaft started throbbing in anticipation, and in response, she just continued to grind her hips into me, doing her best to disappear into my lap. At this moment, her sensual yet distant dance was abandoned in favor of a show that would have been only found in a much seedier scene… </p><p>I suppressed the temptation to grab her beautiful hips as she started thrusting her hips and moving her body faster, her breasts swaying whenever she leaned back a bit to free them from the support my chest provided. She said nothing else as the minutes passed slowly, nor that she needed to with the way her body was reacting, telling a story of arousal. </p><p>Her nipples, poking aggressively against my chest, was the punctuation of that little story. </p><p>I couldn’t help but gasp in disappointment as she decided to stand up, even when she grabbed my head to bury my face between her beautiful tits, giving me a trip to that beautiful valley. She ran her hands through my hair as she stood up, the chains jiggling once more. </p><p>Then, she turned her back, straining the chains as she gave me a beautiful view of her plump ass. Yet, this time, she didn’t waste her time in a slow, teasing descent, but moved down aggressively. </p><p>Then, I felt her wetness envelop me once more. It was a beautiful feeling, much superior to her velvety back pressing against my chest, my raging erection enveloped in her core. Her chains jiggled, making the moment even more beautiful, her hips rocking as fast as her heartbeat. With her arms crossed under her breasts as the chains were forced, it looked even more </p><p>I brought my hands along her torso, cupping her breasts against her orders. “I thought I said — no touching,” she murmured, unable to contain her gasp as her hips devoured my presence aggressively, creating a very beautiful sight in the process. </p><p>“Well, you did,” I said. “But did you really think that your words would be enough to keep me away from your glorious beasts forever,” I whispered into her ear, enjoying her shiver? I clenched my jaw to contain a moan when she reacted by quickening her hips even further. “Maybe you should have a better view of what was going on,” I whispered as I conjured a magical mirror in front of us. Her eyes widened as she caught her sight in the mirror, her mouth half-open in shock as she took the amazing beauty she was displaying. “It’s beautiful, right? Definitely worthy end for a Queen who is about to lose her throne after dying in a tragic accident.” </p><p>“It is —“ she started, only for her eyes to widen as she realized the implications of my words. “W-what?” To her credit, despite the ominous meaning of my words, her hips didn’t stop their movement, signaling she understood what I had been implying. Her lips stayed closed for a moment, her hips rocking faster and faster as a thinking expression invaded her face. </p><p>I examined her reflection in the mirror as she continued to consider my words, taking them with a calmness that surprised me, especially considering she was a Queen under the total mercy of the Dark Lord she had captured… </p><p>I continued squeezing her breasts even as she considered my words — her hips ever-moving — until she caught my gaze from the mirror. </p><p>“Explain,” she ordered, her voice still carrying the haze of pleasure despite the sharpness she tried to inject…</p>
