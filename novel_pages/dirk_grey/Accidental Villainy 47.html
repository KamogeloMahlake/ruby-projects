        <title>Accidental Villainy 47</title>

        <p>I was glad that I felt no warning signs from her as she pulled my hands to her smooth stomach, because rejecting the invitation would have been very difficult. Instead, I let my hands dance over her belly, enjoying her warmth while she continued to rub against my lap with her beautiful ass. </p><p>I shifted my hands to the side slightly as she bent forward, showing her incredible flexibility — which was not from her superpower, but her dance training, I noted — while challenging her panties’ already deficient capability to keep her ass hidden. </p><p>I decided to have some fun as I pulled a stack of money from my pocket, and hooked a hundred to her panties. Her eyes widened as she received it … and I noticed her excitement. “Wow, a generous patron,” she whispered throatily. </p><p>“Only fit for a generous dancer,” I whispered. “Impress me, and there’s far more.” However, my excited tone was fake, because I was distressed with her response. She was too excited about the money, which didn’t make sense. </p><p>It was enough that I overdrove my power once again despite the stabbing pain, and slipped another hundred to her panties … once again checking every little observation. She was actually excited about receiving the money, which contrasted with her villain identity and her upbringing.</p><p>Then, I realized her excitement was a little different. It wasn’t a desperate, intense reaction like Tara had shown about the sudden richness she enjoyed, but something more measured. Still, she appreciated the money. </p><p>Which was interesting. It wasn’t surprising to see that she was rich in the past, but fell poor. But, how could a villainess could be excited by earning a couple hundred dollars… The best explanation, she had a controlling boss, and she appreciated some extra spending money. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the pain, I would have kept my power active to dig deeper, maybe even ask a few probing questions, but I let it slide. It was not immediately urgent, so I decided to focus on keeping her happy, especially since it had the very welcome side effect of maintaining my happiness. </p><p>I slipped another bill into her panties, but this time, let my hand linger there, caressing her ass. There were no warnings about not touching, so I took the clue and let my other hand climb up, caressing the underside of her breast. </p><p>She leaned back until her back was against my chest, her dance heating up. A beautiful gasp escaped her mouth as my fingers danced around her tits, pushing her already high arousal even further. The music continued, and the sexy redhead whose real name I was yet to learn continued her intimate dance. </p><p>Meanwhile, I pulled another bill from the small stack added to her g-string. </p><p>This time, I didn’t linger around her ass, but moved to her inner thigh, caressing a location that was dangerously close to a no-touch zone even for private clubs. Yet, other than a momentary stiffening, she said nothing, allowing me to access her soft skin while I further fueled her arousal. </p><p>Too bad getting too close to her wetness earned a subconscious rejection, showing that she wasn’t ready to go that far. </p><p>Instead, I brought my hand up, grabbing her nipple with a sudden aggression, squeezing just hard enough to make her moan. Her body might as well be a puzzle with a cheat sheet for me. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she warned, but her voice was filled with desire. </p><p>“Honey, you need to work hard to earn your tips,” I answered, keeping my tone light to give the impression that I was joking. “And, consider that me helping you.” </p><p>“I guess you’re right,” she answered, the huskiness in her tone driving me mad as she stood up. “I need to work harder.” </p><p>When she sat down again, she was facing me. Her hands landed on my neck, her nipples pressing against my chest, hard enough to be felt through my thin shirt. She whipped her head again, while I decided to break another cardinal rule of stripping. </p><p>I leaned forward and started kissing her neck. </p><p>She moaned. </p><p>Her hands tightened around my neck as she started moving back and forth with a renewed desire, each second driving us to a new high. Once I pulled back, she stared directly into my eyes as she danced, like daring me to go further. </p><p>I had a feeling that, at this moment, she had forgotten that she was an undercover super. Too bad that I didn’t dare to push too much without the assistance of my power. She already surprised me a couple times, enough to keep my greed under control for the moment. </p><p>Of course, just because I didn’t dare to escalate things too much didn’t mean I wasn’t willing to escalate at all. I leaned forward to capture her nipple between my lips. “How dare you—“ she tried to exclaim, but as I bit her erect nipple gently, her complaint turned into a moan. </p><p>That unexpected moan worked wonders to destroy her earlier statement, and I used the opportunity to enjoy her breasts. I stayed there until she was dangerously close to climax, then pulled back, leaving her on the edge and desperate. </p><p>Therefore, baiting her to use her unique position to the limit. She rocked on my lap even more desperately as I stopped touching her, the lap dance effectively turning into simulated sex. The best part was it was an insidious move that she barely noticed. Her desire and arousal drove her crazy, all the while she was under the impression that she was the one making the moves.  </p><p>Under the shadow of her arousal, she didn’t say anything as she rocked again and again. </p><p>When she suddenly stood up, for a fleeting moment, I thought that I had pushed too much. Yet, before I could make any move, she pushed her panties down,  leaving herself completely naked before taking the exact same pose. </p><p>As she danced, I forced her legs part even more, which meant she was feeling the pressure of my hardness completely. </p><p>She just moaned again and again … until she was finally interrupted by a desperate climax. </p><p>I had no doubt that, if I let her recover, she would have regained clarity and realized the absurdity of her moves. However, I chose that moment to lean forward, finally making a reckless move that she would have reacted very badly. </p><p>I kissed her. </p><p>The intimacy hit her as much as the pleasure, but with my hands landing on her naked ass, forcing her to dance while my tongue invaded her mouth kept her obedient. There was no complaint about boundaries, just muffled moans. </p><p>I kept it going until she was at the edge of another climax, then pulled back from the kiss. “W-what,” she stammered, shocked and dazed. </p><p>“Play with yourself,” I ordered. It was reckless, but rather than getting angry, she just followed that clue, her fingers disappearing in her depths. “Keep your eyes open,” I added, catching her gaze. </p><p>Her blush contrasted with her desperate fingers, but the view was incredible. It took mere seconds as she brought herself to a climax just in seconds, her breathing chaotic. This time, I let her recover. I could push her … but I was afraid of her organization checking if she stayed out of contact for too long. </p><p>The situation was complicated enough. </p><p>“I … I think that’s my loss,” she whispered throaty manner as she realized just how close she came to surrendering completely, her panic as delicious as the earlier pleasure. </p><p>“There’s no shame trying again. You’re welcome any time,” I answered as I leaned back, watching as she slowly dressed, her earlier confidence replaced by shyness. Once everything was in place, she looked at the door. </p><p>“Come here,” I said, still in my seat. She followed my order and stood in front of me. I grabbed her beautiful red hair, pulled her for another kiss, and used the chance to slip a couple thousand to the side of her panties, giving her another reward. When I pulled back, she was gasping softly. “I’ll see you around,” I said. </p><p>She nodded softly, and stumbled out in a daze. I continued checking her from the camera. Not that I was worried about her safety. She was clearly strong enough. I wanted to see her reaction more. </p><p>So, I watched her as she took a blind alley two streets over, leaning against a wall to catch her breath. But, my elation died when her feet got snagged by a random debris. She cursed, waved her hand …</p><p>And a blue forcefield destroyed it. </p><p>Just like that, I recognized her. A super of national renown, one with a reputation of destruction, who stopped appearing in the news a month ago after causing hundreds of millions of property damage. And, not for the first time, enough to earn the nickname, Lady of Destruction. </p><p>Or, officially known as Blue Princess.  </p><p>A hero.  </p><p>Like my life wasn’t complicated enough… </p>
