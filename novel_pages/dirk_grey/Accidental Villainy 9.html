        <p>It took a while for me to start speaking. The vision of her trembling beauty was beautiful … especially with every second pushing her pleasure to a new level of obedience. She was like a beautiful spring, getting tenser and tenser. </p><p>Only when I started seeing the signs of snapping, I spoke. </p><p>“So, what do you have to say for yourself.”</p><p>“A-about what, sir,” she whispered, her voice trembling beautifully, begging for forgiveness even before she started. </p><p>“About hiding your powers, and making me a target, of course,” I said, acting like I wasn’t guilty of the exact same thing. One advantage of my shitty power, it was near-impossible to catch it unless someone had me tested. </p><p>“Please, sir,” she begged. “It was a mistake. I … I didn’t expect it to create problems,” she begged. </p><p>I sighed. “You’re lucky that I’m a merciful boss. I won’t fire you. That, and we don’t actually know whether you created any problem for me or not…” I said. Admittedly, any contribution she had to my problems was about her beauty and the way she distracted me rather than her powers. </p><p>Those helped me to avoid a nasty injury. </p><p>“T-thank you, sir,” she gasped. </p><p>“Of course, we still need to have a lesson about trust,” I said, my smirk suddenly getting wider. “By hiding such important information, you proved that you need another lesson about trust.” </p><p>“Please,” she begged. “It was a mistake. I won’t do it again.” However, as she did so, her hands were already twitching, showing that she was just as enthusiastic about removing her shirt. </p><p>Frankly, a part of me was tempted to keep her standing for a while more, to see if she would actually crack. And, if it was anytime else, I might have actually done that. However, tonight was different. </p><p>After my own surprise brush with death, I was more than enthusiastic about affirming my own life. Having an excuse to ignore the potential long-term implications of taking down three henchmen was just a bonus. </p><p>“I want to believe you, but I need you to prove me your loyalty,” I said. Admittedly, I was probably skipping a step or two, but considering her barely held-back enthusiasm, it wasn’t exactly a huge mistake. </p><p>The speed she pulled her top off was impressive, though not as impressive as the fact that it still stayed intact. She had an incredible control over her powers. Her bra suffered a similar fate, just as fast, removed before her top could hit the floor. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I said. I kept my gaze on her face to exert my dominance further … but it was difficult. </p><p>But not useless. As our gazes met, she shivered and closed her eyes, showing the great hold I had over her. I was glad for her closed eyes because she missed my hungry expression as I devoured the sight of her beautiful body. Not for the first time, but still as impactful as ever. </p><p>She deserved to be a criminal because hiding that flawless body under those horrible boy clothes was a crime. </p><p>Of course, even as she turned her back and pushed down her jeans, I couldn’t help but wonder once again if her beauty was a part of her power. </p><p>She wouldn’t be the first heroine with that power. Otherwise, it was impossible to explain the existence of many heroines with their amazing bodies, and their skin-tight costumes displaying it excellently. </p><p>However, as she pushed her pants down, I ignored that track of thought and focused on the present. She kept her eyes closed as she slowly slid down her pants. It was a pity that her panties were wide and boring, hiding her incredible ass successfully. </p><p>Maybe I should invest some of the money I liberated from the henchmen into a shopping trip.</p><p>Luckily, the smoothness of her toned legs gave me something to focus on while she pulled her underwear down and faced me. It was cute that her arms were still twitching slightly as a desire to cover her body, contrasting with her arousal. </p><p>“Good, now sit down,” I said, patting my table. She said nothing as she circled around my desk, every step small … yet her body swayed beautifully, showing that she was a quick learner, already implementing our earlier training. </p><p>She was radiating hesitance as she perched on the edge of the desk, her legs crossed to her wetness. I let her do so. </p><p>“Very good. Obedient. You’re a good girl,” I said even as I put my hands on her hips, slightly below her ass, and she shivered. “Your powers are your only problem,” I added, and she tensed. “You’re lucky that your obedience is more valuable than the problems that might be created by your powers,” I added, and just like that, tenseness was gone. </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” she whispered as she grabbed my hand, holding it gently. I might have treated that as a step too far, but the sight of her gratitude was too beautiful to be interrupted. I let her enjoy for a moment before I continued. </p><p>“That’s assuming you’ll follow my orders until you solve the problem you created with your powers, of course,” I added, testing the waters to see whether her obedience was just sexual, or it extended to her powers. </p><p>“Of course, sir,” she declared, her voice direct. She didn’t even think a second before committing to that. </p><p>“Good,” I said. “I don’t think I can use you as a waitress,” I said, and she froze. This time, her stress was not intended, so I continued quickly. “You’ll be my secretary and my bodyguard. Do you accept?”</p><p>“Y-yes, sir,” she declared, her excitement palpable. </p><p>“Good, then your first mission will be to go to your motel immediately, checkout, and move to my studio apartment. It’ll be a bit cramped, but we have to survive that inconvenience for a while while experiencing that.” </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she said, but there was a sadness in her tone that surprised me. </p><p>She had to actually stand up for my words to click. </p><p>“Make that your second mission,” I corrected as I grabbed her waist and pulled her onto my lap, she surprised yelp enough to drive me mad already. She said nothing, but the way she settled on my lap was all the answer I needed. </p><p>Still, I made a note to be careful about exactly what I asked of her in the future. Just in case. </p><p>“Y-yes, sir,” she whispered in a trembling voice as I dragged my fingers over her hips for a while, her words delayed … and made even more erotic by it. As she shuffled on my lap back and forth, the fiction of punishment was abandoned — for the moment, as I had no doubt both of us would want an encore on that aspect. </p><p>“Good, now let’s celebrate your promotion, in a way worthy of a traditional secretary.” </p><p>She might be met, but she was certainly not stupid. She immediately understood what I was driving at as she abandoned her new seat, her fingers already on my buttons. She pulled off my pants, the ease she displayed a reminder of the great physical difference between us. </p><p>It only made the moment tastier as she leaned forward and captured the head of my shaft between her pretty lips, devouring easily. “Very good, beautiful,” I said, the compliment making her shiver even more intensely than her task. </p><p>I reached down and cupped her naked breasts, enjoying their perfection once more, this time without the barrier of our fictional punishment play. A paper-thin barrier, yet still, the difference was incredible. </p><p>This time, I didn’t need to use my power. Well, I still did, but this time, I wasn’t trying to see which move wouldn’t end with a broken arm, but making sure her enjoyment climbed upward at the fastest possible speed. </p><p>As my fingers danced around her nipples, her moans immediately turned charged, showing that my power was even more useful than I expected when I focused on a singular task rather than trying to split it in many different directions. </p><p>A thought entered my mind, making me smile. Maybe I should have got a job as a high-class escort rather than opening a rundown bar… </p><p>Of course, that was just a joke, as anything high-class was either regulated by guilds, or controlled by the villains — not that it made much difference either way — and expecting the sex trade to be the exception was simply a folly. Though, even if that had been an option, I wouldn’t have chosen it. </p><p>My pride prevented me from being a henchman to be used … accepting such a fate would have been the same thing. No, even worse. </p><p>After all, as Tara’s lips moved up and down my length, it wasn’t the physical pleasure that drove me crazy. That part was still amazing, especially considering her enthusiastic yet clumsy delivery, but the real pleasure came from the way she surrendered to my control. </p><p>It was an incredible sensation. I wanted more. </p><p>“Let’s make it really fun, my beautiful secretary,” I said as I grabbed Tara’s hair, and pushed her down…</p>
