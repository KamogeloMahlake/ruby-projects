        <p>I pulled my gaze away from the mirror once I noticed Megan’s destination, not wanting to get caught. It wasn’t that I was shy, and didn’t want to be caught looking at her while she was in her revealing state. </p><p>Her amazing mood was about my lack of perceived attention. The setup would have been ruined if she noticed my gaze. </p><p>Kim was busy devouring my shaft, unaware of the little interplay, too aroused to do anything else. For her, there was only pleasure.  </p><p>The blonde figure of Megan passed next to me without stopping, doing her best to get my attention. The way her hips swayed was one of those methods, and to her credit, it was beautiful enough to instantly climb to the list of erotic moments. </p><p>It was incredible enough to pull my gaze despite the amazing service Kim had been providing. </p><p>Yet, that was not the only strategy she had used to get my attention. As she passed me, she made sure to brush her arm against mine in a very noticeable manner. Adding that trick suggested that she wasn’t fully confident in the beautiful dance of her hips to appropriate my attention. </p><p>She sat on one of the large seats next to the bed, and lay on her back, her head pointing at me. Of course, as she lay, her towel, which was barely holding onto her body, accidentally come undone, giving me a full glimpse of her beautiful breasts. </p><p>I had to admit, they looked amazing, the light hitting just at the right angle, enhancing the glistening of her breasts. Of course, if the beautiful redhead busy devouring my shaft without rebelling had any attention to spare, she would have a few corrections to further enhance her friend’s beautiful pose, but I had no critical feedback. </p><p>“It had been a tough day, isn’t it,” I said with a chuckle, giving her some attention, but not in the way she wanted. I didn’t want her to get discouraged enough to stop, but giving her the type of attention she wanted would only make her pull back with a victorious smirk. </p><p>“Yeah, cheering from stands is clearly tougher than playing, if you can be this energetic,” she said, her voice biting as she shuffled in her place, and took a sitting pose. As she moved, her towel slid to bunch around her waist, but she just crossed her legs, not bothering to fix it, revealing her hardened nipples without any impediment. </p><p>How spectacular. </p><p>Yet, if she was hoping to get a hint of repentance from her slight needling, she was very wrong. I was not one of those rich kids not knowing how to handle a prickly woman like her. </p><p>Kevin was an excellent example. Lacking the ability to confront her, maybe not even noticing the calculative nature of what lay underneath, he clearly just played along to get a place he had no hope of arriving, unaware that he had been being used for his popularity. </p><p>But my calculated disinterest worked wonders to trigger the desire for attention. </p><p>“Constant practice helps me to keep in a good shape,” I said, smirking, not showing the slightest hint of shame. “Not to mention, it had been a tough week, and I need some release,” I said, then let one of my hands drift down, slapping Kim’s hips. “Luckily, my girlfriend prepared me the perfect gift to release that pent-up aggression.” </p><p>“You’re welcome,” Megan answered, her sarcasm thick enough to consist of a physical presence. </p><p>“Thanks, sweetie,” I said with an exaggerated warmth that belonged to a lovely sitcom rather than our current situation, contrasting beautifully with her sarcasm. </p><p> Meanwhile, Kim’s eyes were cycling between us, my earlier slap finally making her take notice that we had an audience. She looked hesitant for a moment, making me think that she was on the edge of surrender. </p><p>Amusingly, it was Megan that prevented that. With our little discussion over, she turned her gaze to Kim, her gaze sharp, with no doubt about the meaning behind her gaze.</p><p> She was asking Kim to stop. </p><p>It was an amateur mistake that  I never expected Megan to make. Not only, for all her faults, she was an expert manipulator, but also Kim was one of her best friends — maybe even the best one — and she knew her habits very much. </p><p>Yet, she was unsettled enough to try to give an order to Kim, the perfect way to trigger the more combative parts of her personality.</p><p>To her credit, it took only a second for her to realize her mistake, but it was enough to destroy Kim’s blooming doubt. </p><p>She closed her eyes as she grabbed my thighs, pulling her forward fast enough to make my hands on her head useless, her gags of struggle joined by exaggerated moans of pleasure. </p><p>“The perfect gift, indeed,” I said as I caught Megan’s gaze, my smile as sarcastic as I could manage. Normally, sarcasm was not an emotion I had trouble generating, but an enthusiastic deepthroat from a sexy redhead was one of the few events that made it difficult to reflect that sarcasm.</p><p>The huff of protest Megan let out was beautiful, her bouncing gaze showing that both of us were the target. I had no doubt that, at one point, she would make me pay for that, but that day was not today. </p><p>That was enough attention, I decided as I turned my attention back to Kim, ramming into her throat again and again as the arousal between her legs grew more and more. </p><p>Meanwhile, Megan pulled out her phone, taking a few photos while playing. I might have intervened otherwise, but with the existence of the System, I was not afraid of any kind of leak. </p><p>Not to mention, she would never do so in the first place. Even if her friendship with Kim broke, Kim also had a great number of revealing photos that would ruin her reputation as well. </p><p>Mutually assured destruction was a surprisingly comforting concept. </p><p>I turned my full attention to Kim, enjoying the way she was busy pushing again and again. Minutes passed as the presence of her throat become a constant fixture around my girth, giving me a comforting feeling. </p><p>I was feeling the stirrings of a climax, and I was about to let it go, when I noticed a movement in the corner of my eye. I shifted my attention back to Megan, only to meet with a beautiful surprise.</p><p>She had raised her phone, recording us, her earlier attempt to keep it subtle abandoned at one point, but that wasn’t the surprising part. The surprising part was the fact that she was holding the phone with only one hand, and the other under her towel, making suspicious movements. </p><p>It was nice to see her indulging herself for once, I thought even as I did my best to hide my attention, knowing her enough that any attention on my part would make her pull back. </p><p>Since we had an audience, I decided to put on a proper show. </p><p>At this point, it was getting troubling to keep me back, but since we had such an enthusiastic audience, I decided to make a proper show rather than just exploding inside her mouth. </p><p>I pulled out at the last moment, spraying her face and chest generously. Amusingly, Megan gasped in shock, her tone enough to show that she expected her friend to react to that surprise move negatively. </p><p>Contrary to her expectations, Kim mewled beautifully even as she pressed her hand on her chest, spreading them along. The intense pleasure worked excellently to awaken the more submissive parts of her personality once more. </p><p>And that made Megan look at me in shock, having trouble believing her prickly friend acting as obediently as an aspiring sorority girl during the last day of her pledge week. </p><p>At this point, pulling Megan into the situation would have been easy. Her shock, combined with her arousal, made it a trivial achievement. I just needed to pull her on top of her friend, making a delicious marmalade sandwich for my midnight craving. </p><p>And, I would have done so, if Megan hadn’t left me on the edge more than once. Making her payback was simply more attractive, I decided as I grabbed Kim’s hips, flipping her down. </p><p>“Let’s see just how loudly you could cry,” I said even as I pressed against her entrance, my shaft already hard. </p><p>Recovery was not just useful for football practice.</p>
