        <title>Crossover worlds - New 10$ Tier Bonus</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hi everyone, </p><p>I decided to give another bonus for 10$ tier, though it's experimental so I might or might not repeat going for the future.</p><p>What we're going to do, essentially, is for you guys to let comment which stories and characters you want for a crossover, and I'll pick one (based on likes on comments as well as just how much it fueled my imagination) and try to write a reasonable one-shot crossover based on that. </p><p>Also, you guys might request just different environments for the stories, like A Gamer Adventure, but modern college etc. </p><p>Feel free to comment under this announcement for the first attempt. </p><p><em><strong>Unfortunately, no fanfiction is allowed due to copyright laws, but you can request different original environments for existing characters. </strong></em></p><p> </p>
