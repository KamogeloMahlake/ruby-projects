        <p>“And, stay down, ugly bastard,” I said even as I pushed my abomination of a spear through the skin of an even uglier giant insect monster, feeling excited and satisfied at the same time. </p><p>After all, I had just brought a skill from nothing to its limit in less than half an hour. </p><p>[Swift Spear (Uncommon) 98 -&gt; 100]</p><p>[Perk Options — Fleeting Step / Charge] </p><p>“I wonder if that’s a record,” I said even as I ripped the shell of the giant monster I had taken down, and started my trek back to the forge. Now that the skill had reached its limit, I could create a more fitting weapon than the ugly monstrosity I had created to abuse the mismatch. </p><p>Just like Hammer of Might required a proper heavy-headed hammer to show its benefits, Swift Spear required something tall and with a decent elasticity to properly show its power. </p><p>While I probably couldn’t create something that would show the full potential of the technique without high-grade wood — as there was a limit to the elasticity that could be shown by a pure metal handle — I should still be able to replicate it somewhat. </p><p>However, while I was on the way, I made sure to choose a perk option, one that didn’t require even the slightest thought. Fleeting Step. </p><p>After all, I had my Hammer of Might for situations that required power, and Stalwart Guard was excellent when I needed to defend myself. Meanwhile, Swift Spear, true to its name, focused more on mobility. It wasn’t exactly my strongest suit, but considering the effort it required, I was still more than happy to take it. </p><p>Fleeting Step transformed the skill somewhat, giving me an even better ability to dance between the attacks. But, even as I tested it, I could feel that, somewhat, it was my stats that weren't supporting it properly. </p><p>My guess was that my Dexterity had been barely enough to allow me to learn it. </p><p>“Not that I’m complaining,” I groaned as I charged among a small swarm, intentionally letting them surround me, yet dodging them with ease. Not even a splatter of a ranged attack landed on me. I could have dealt with them easily, but instead, I let them attack me, while I limited myself to deflecting their mandibles. </p><p>Just because I had a skill at its limit didn’t mean that I could use it well. </p><p>The skill was fascinating, especially with Fleeting Step mixed in. It allowed me to dance among the attacks from the monsters with the elegance of a dancer. It didn’t make me run faster at longer distances, but it actually helped me to climb the cliffs and other surfaces. </p><p>I couldn’t simply climb a ninety-degree surface, but anything with a rough surface was a fair deal. If a mountain goat could climb it, I had a fair chance. “Fascinating.” Of course, in a world where people could actually fly, it wasn’t as fascinating, but that was just the reality. </p><p>It meant I could actually ditch the swarms by using the natural impediments, which was a good thing. That way, I didn’t have to kill the monsters in the first two floors, which should keep the others from getting suspicious about the lack of monsters in a certain direction. </p><p>“And, that’s not the only benefit,” I muttered as I switched weapons, and started engaging with monsters using Stalwart Guard. I had already used my lessons from the hammer technique to improve it, and when it came to it, sword and spear had much more in common regarding the fundamentals. </p><p>Which was why, the progress I had made when I  had arrived back at to forge was only to be expected. More than enough to impress Eleanor. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) - 57]</p><p>The best part was that I hadn’t even pushed it to the limit. But, for once, I decided to slow down. I wanted it to look impressive, not unbelievable. </p><p>Once I forged myself a new, seven-foot-long spear, I decided to leave everything but my hammer in my forge. Searching the gate for the next floor while running as fast as I could manage seemed like a fitting task. </p><p>One particularly great advantage I had was my Strength, allowing me to break the shell just as easily without waiting for the beast to attack. It was even a better fit for hunting on the first floor without damaging the shell as long as corrosion wasn’t a concern. </p><p>But then, without the corrosion effect, a lot of things were easier. </p><p>As I faced my next challenge — four giant monsters in one horde — I was suddenly glad that I decided to add the spear to the mix. Hammer had the necessary power to take down the beast in one hit as long as I could hit a weak spot thanks to Shattering Blow, but reaching that weak spot had been the problem. </p><p>With Fleeting Step, I could simply climb on top of them, the corrosion effect uselessly crashing against my metal greaves. </p><p>Suddenly, the fights were less like a deadly struggle, and more like an action movie. Cheating was truly fun. Once I climbed to their back, all I needed was to switch to the hammer. One blow and the giant insects died. </p><p>Too bad piling four of them together still granted me with an Uncommon skill, one that I couldn’t even use. </p><p>I had been hoping for a Rare one. </p><p>“Maybe next time,” I muttered even as I continued my dedicated dash, not even slowing down to pick up the shells or the crystals. The only thing I slowed down for was to take note of the various geographical features to prevent myself from getting lost. </p><p>No, I just wanted to find the gate, and while the density of the giant monsters had given me a direction to search, it was not exactly a compass. And, the twenty-yard vision range wasn’t exactly making it easier.</p><p>The dungeon fog — which was not a real fog but a weird energy — was a mixed blessing. Its existence was an inconvenience to be sure, but only because it was there, I had dared to set up a hidden forge. </p><p>“Finally,” I shouted in celebration when I arrived at the gate I had been searching for. Around it, there were eight giant monsters, which had been not exactly inconvenient to deal with with the trick of combining two skills at their limits. </p><p>I was able to kill all of them in under one minute. Throwing them together had been the bigger challenge. </p><p>They were not exactly small. Even with my strength, I couldn’t casually pile them. </p><p>“It’s worth it,” I said when I found a skill that had been glowing in an unfamiliar pattern. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Rare)]</p><p>I examined the skill. It was rare, yet it didn’t have any kind of qualifier. I wondered if it was something that could happen for all skills. Was there an inferior version of Mana Forge that I could get from dungeons, or was it only something that was relevant for the Nurture skill… </p><p>Frankly, it wouldn't be the first way the System discriminated against the Farmer class. </p><p>I was tempted to absorb it, but I decided not to. It was tempting, but it was far from the most urgent task I had in mind. I put it in my sack before I turned toward the next challenge I wanted to face. </p><p>The gate. </p><p>“Unto the breach once more,” I said as I took a step forward, finally ready to face the next batch. It was a risky step, one that I would have been far more reticent to take without Swift Spear and Fleeting Step. But then again, it wasn’t the first time the dungeon offered a nice solution to the problem it presented. </p><p>As I landed, the first thing that caught my attention was the mist. Not just the dungeon energy we referred to as such, but a real one, enough to make the vision even more difficult. </p><p>That meant I had no idea how many monsters I had to deal with. But, I could already count six giant monsters mixed with a true swarm. </p><p>They charged. </p><p>I jumped. </p><p>Frankly, I didn’t know what I could call the following encounter. It was a baffling mixture of boring and exciting. My conscious mind treated it as a disaster, wave after wave of insects popping out of the mist to overwhelm me, like I was in a desperate last stand. </p><p>But also, it was boring. The only thing I really paid attention to was keeping track of the death of the first monster of the pile while they routinely disappeared because I had been using them as a platform to fight rather than letting the bog close around me. </p><p>But, their disappearance was not a waste. As, without exception, they all faded into Rare skill stones. Two of them were Nurture, which I recognized without touching. The others were a mystery. However, the endless wave of attack continued, preventing me from checking it. </p><p>The monsters continued to appear endlessly, showing me the reason why Eleanor regularly cleansed the first two floors. </p><p>It was truly endless. I fought and fought, the battle slowly turning into something as routine as forging another weapon. </p><p>I would have complained if it wasn’t for a very welcome notification. </p><p>[Level 36 -&gt; 37]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +2 Dexterity]</p>
