        <p>“She’s an enthusiastic one, isn’t she,” I said as Carol sat next to me while listening Amy’s deep moans, not mentioning just how Carol’s presence intensified her reaction more. </p><p>“Well, she enjoys fun … though it has been a while she brought in one of her one-night stands,” Carol said absentmindedly. Amy didn’t answer, partly because she was not in a state to do so, but I doubted she would have done so even without it. </p><p>After all, it would require her talking about her crush, and she was clearly terrified of emotional vulnerability. </p><p>I continued to push inside her, enjoying the way she wrapped around me, her already impressive tightness turning phenomenal at Carol’s presence. “Well, it makes what we’re doing a public service, then. Why don’t you help me make it memorable.” </p><p>Even the suggestion was enough to make Amy shiver helplessly. I let her down, allowing her to bury her face to the pillow. “I don’t know. Isn’t a bit much.” </p><p>“Don’t you think it’s rude to keep your hands away from her during a threesome,” I asked, willing to goad her. A proper threesome would be much more fun … and also, it was a good idea to keep Amy happy. </p><p>After all, she was going to work for me for a long time. </p><p>“Well, it’s even ruder to ignore her. Don’t you think so, Amy?” I asked, forcing her to contribute and admit that. It wasn’t exactly a declaration of love, which she was clearly incapable, but it was a start. </p><p>“Yes, it’s — rude,” Amy moaned, unable to contain the cry of pleasure that interrupted her, overwhelmed by the possibility. </p><p>“R-really,” Carol murmured, her sudden blush, particularly considering the circumstances, was intense enough to suggest more self-consciousness that was warranted, implying that it was her first threesome. </p><p>Interesting, and not just because she had been a very rich girl, a demographic that was famous for endless partying. The speed she had responded to Amy’s challenge and the way she ‘fought’ against Nicole made me feel like she was at least familiar with it. </p><p>But now, I could see that she was being driven by her inherent competitiveness and anger even more than I had first realized. </p><p>Fun. </p><p>Just, not as immediately fun as Amy’s cries when Carol leaned forward and pressed her lips against Amy’s neck. I continued pumping into her, enjoying her howling and shrieking as she tightened even more. I fucked her relentlessly, her delirious moans encouraging Carol to be more adventurous, her hands exploring Amy’s breasts gently. </p><p>She had already done more than a few caresses, but they were under my direct command while she was lost in her pleasure, which made quite a bit difference. She slowly explored Amy’s body while Amy just moaned, and I continued to impale her from behind. </p><p>“I’m sure she has been an annoying roommate at times,” I suddenly said to Carol, who looked at me askance, trying to understand why I interrupted her fun with such a random comment. “Enough to deserve a few spanks, even,” I added, soft enough that Amy wouldn’t hear due to her own moans, allowing Carol to read my lips. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she whispered back. “Isn’t it … too much?” </p><p>I didn’t even bother to answer, just nodded toward her hands, tied beautifully, and chuckled. Carol caught the implication. “Y-you’re right,” she answered, much louder. “She had been a terrible roommate. She doesn’t clean. She’s careless with her leftovers. She leaves the door open…” she counted, and Amy stiffened, not understanding the sudden shift. Though, it was hard to blame her. It must be hard to think under the circumstances. </p><p>“How rude,” I agreed theatrically. “What do you plan to do?” </p><p>“She deserves a punishment,” Carol responded even as she raised her hand, and landed it on Amy’s ass, the smack echoing in the room. Amy was already near her climax, and it was enough to trigger her climax. She started trembling, and Carol looked at me questioningly. </p><p>I nodded, signaling her to continue. Now that Amy was finally getting what she wanted, there was no harm making it even more memorable. Carol spanked her again, and I continued to push inside her, determined to pleasure her like no other man ever did. </p><p>Admittedly, I was cheating a bit … but if you weren’t cheating, you weren’t trying. </p><p>“You’re such a messy roommate, Amy,” Carol muttered as she spanked her once again. “Are you sorry about leaving all the messes?” </p><p>With her face buried on the pillow, Amy was unable to answer. Since I was a gentleman, as always, I decided to help. I grabbed her arms — still bound with my belt behind her back — and pulled. Carol took the clue and grabbed her bright pink hair to pull her head back as well. “Yes!” Amy moaned as Carol spanked her again. Carol smiled, happy with the response. </p><p>“And, do you promise to be more careful around the house?” she asked even as she spanked her again. </p><p>“Are — are you going to spank me again if I don’t?” Amy asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Carol declared, spanking her again, even harder as she started to get into the mood. </p><p>“Then, I won’t,” Amy answered, somehow managing to sound playful and cheeky despite the pleasure she was suffering under. </p><p>“You bitch,” Carol chuckled as she reached to Amy’s dangling, spectacular tits, and twisted her nipples aggressively. “I’ll make you sorry.” </p><p>“You’ll try,” Amy declared, far too happy by goading Carol to actually care. Amy clearly enjoyed Carol’s rough treatment, more than I suspected that she would enjoy if I pushed that much. </p><p>Love conquered all, even the misguided, cowardly kind Amy clearly felt. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I watched them interact despite the aggressive drilling Amy was suffering, rough yet playful at the same time. Ironically, despite the little interaction, I could see that they would have made a good couple if it wasn’t for two things. </p><p>Carol clearly wasn’t ready to commit to a relationship, too obsessed with success and regaining what she lost, and Amy had a warped sense of self and would never believe she deserved a happy relationship, and subconsciously, she would do her best to sabotage any relationship. </p><p>It was amusing just how much I was able to decipher about their personality, but it was the quirk of sex. People revealed a lot about their true selves, with a kind of honest expression that a therapist would require months to coax out even out of a willing patient. </p><p>They were lucky that I was one of the good guys … well, given a value of goodness. I could have easily used what I observe from the situation to shatter and destroy them … but instead, I was actually considering playing the matchmaker. </p><p>Well, the fun way, of course. Neither girl acted like they particularly minded a fun threesome, giving me several fun ways to help them explore their emotions. </p><p>Once Amy climaxed once again, I pulled out, letting her catch her breath. Even a strong punk beauty like her needed her rest. I even reached and unwrapped her hands, letting her move. She flipped and lay on her back, breathing deeply, satiated. </p><p>I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for Carol’s presence, it was the point Amy kicked me out and never called me again. </p><p>“Huh, I expected her to last longer …” Carol murmured, no doubt comparing it with the occasional one-night stands Amy enjoyed. </p><p>“Probably the long break you mentioned,” I said, giving Amy an excuse as she was clearly too dazed to speak. I didn’t want to explain how she was drained by the emotional roller-coaster she had been experiencing since my arrival. Carol didn’t look too convinced, so I decided to distract her. “Why don’t you clean the mess your precious roommate made,” I said as I grabbed her hair and pulled her down.</p><p>Her lips opened, and my shaft, still slippery with Amy’s climax, went into her mouth, preventing any follow up questions and distracting her appropriately. </p><p>And, since we were still on top of Amy, she did get an excellent view. She was lucky that Carol was too distracted to look her face, because, at this moment, her expression was an open book, showing all the emotions she had been enjoying at the same time. </p><p>Jealousy, arousal, desire, regret … truly a beautiful bundle of fun. </p><p>Carol, on the other hand, kept her eyes closed as she took my shaft deep into her throat, pushing herself deeper than I expected … far more than it could be about just pure pleasure. It was her competitiveness once again. </p><p>And, while I was nice enough to help them get together, I wasn’t nice enough to enjoy her unhealthy sense of competitiveness fully. I grabbed her head, pulling her forward as I enjoyed her aggressive deep-throat without restriction until I exploded into her throat, but pulled back halfway to cover her face ass well. </p><p>Desperately breathing to recover, she made an excellent sight as she collapsed next to Amy, who immediately hugged her. She might be too cowardly to tell Carol how she truly felt, but she was clearly not too cowardly to use the warped circumstances for a comfortable cuddle.  </p><p>I decided that it was enough for the day … especially since I still had another meeting for the night. </p><p>“I’ll see you both at work tomorrow, at nine. Don’t be late, or there’ll be punishment,” I said as I walked away. </p><p>Wondering if I actually incentivized them to arrive late. Well, I would learn that tomorrow morning. </p>
