        <p>“So, let’s start,” I said as I gently grabbed her chin, enjoying the way she trembled under my touch. </p><p>“R-right now,” she stammered in shock. </p><p>“Well, nothing like the present,” I said as I used my free hand to pull her glasses, then peered deep into her eyes, letting my baby blues work their magic, making her shiver. “Unless you are not feeling comfortable, of course,” I added. </p><p>“No, I trust you,” she answered immediately, which could have been a disastrous mistake on her part. Luckily for her, I was one of the good guys. </p><p>Well, kind of. </p><p>“Perfect,” I said even as I examined her face, which was much lovelier without those bulky glasses. A little natural makeup wouldn’t have hurt, but luckily, we were away from any road light, so when I flicked the interior light close, the soft lightning worked wonders to enhance the effect, and her natural blush of excitement handled the rest, turning her into an innocent princess. “You can tell me to stop or wait whenever you feel uncomfortable,” I offered, even as I dragged my finger on her lip, making her shiver. </p><p>“O-okay,” she said, once again stammering helplessly as she tried to process the situation. </p><p>Her phone buzzed once more, but this time, before she could reach for it, I grabbed it and threw it on the backseat after silencing it. “No phones during the class,” I said in a sharp, authoritative voice, and her eyes widened further, in a way that suggested she might have more than one classroom fantasy. Something to visit later on. </p><p>She just nodded, still under my touch, while her irises widened as I slowly closed in the distance. But just as the distance was about to collapse into zero, she closed her eyes. I hummed as my lips pressed against her, enjoying their delicate softness. </p><p>I wouldn’t lie. It was an awkward kiss, mostly because she was frozen in shock. Not exactly the peak of eroticism. It was clearly her first kiss. Still, I maintained the contact as my lips slowly moved, trying to coax her to move. </p><p>Ten seconds into the kiss, I finally had a response. It was an awkward, weak response, barely noticeable, highlighting just how much she needed our tutoring sessions. </p><p>It was almost a minute into the kiss that I pulled back, leaving her gasping and panting. “Wow,” she gasped. “That was…”</p><p>“Delicious,” I completed her words, and before she could respond, kissed her again. This time, she was much more active. She was still doing trembling softly, flushed and nervous, but she responded much stronger. </p><p>It was time to push the envelope a bit, I decided as I gently grabbed her face, letting my tongue probe her lips, asking her to part them. She opened her lips, and let me slip inside. Her tongue tried to copy mine, starting a battle, begging for me to dominate her, but I kept myself in check, not wanting to scare her and cut it short. </p><p>Not when I was starting to enjoy it. She was surprisingly pliant, and I could feel my shaft awakening with her kiss. With the moving and everything, it had been a while since I had any female company, after all. So, ultimately, our little kiss evolved into an amateurish and sloppy, but nonetheless delicious, French kiss. </p><p>This time, the kiss lasted more than five minutes before I pulled back, leaving her panting and gasping. She said nothing, but her looks conveyed her dissatisfaction. She said nothing, but aroused by desire, her eyes begged for more. </p><p>I just chuckled as I pushed my seat all the way to the back, giving me the space I required before I grabbed her wrist and pulled her onto my knee. She yelped in panic. “It’s hard to reach over all the stuff. It’s more comfortable this way,” I explained, earning a hesitant nod. </p><p>Seeing her loss of confidence, I was quick to seal her lips with mine once more, a task that she was more than enthusiastic to assist. Our tongues battled once more, her skill level rising by the second. After another minute, I decided to bring things up to a new level. </p><p>However, in a different way. Rather than trying to fondle her, which would inevitably scare her, I grabbed her wrist and dragged her hand to my chest, letting her feel my muscles. “Oh, my!” she gasped as she felt the chiseled muscles under my shirt, caressing them enthusiastically. Meanwhile, I just wrapped my other arm around her waist, letting it hang there lazily. </p><p>Her fingers soon started working over the buttons of my plaid shirt, giving her access to my naked chest muscles, which she started caressing in fascination. “Second base already?” I asked when we pulled back for a breather, and her hand jerked back immediately. “Calm down, sweetie,” I whispered as I kissed her cheek, while simultaneously dragging her hand back to my chest. “I’m just messing with you.” </p><p>My kisses, which started from her cheek and trailed toward her ear as I followed her jawline, worked wonders to resolve her panicked response. She moaned softly as she slowly slipped down to my abs. Meanwhile, I started dragging my fingers across her spine like caressing a kitten, making her purr. </p><p>As we continued, her chest pressed against my biceps more than once thanks to our closeness, which clued me into one very important fact. I wasn’t the only one that was hiding an impressive body under loose clothes. Her waist was thin and smooth, while from what I could feel, her bra was overstuffed tightly with her breasts. Pity that if I tried to unhook it to see what lied underneath, I would have scared her off. Even when she was caressing my chest enthusiastically, she felt like a little bird ready to jump away. </p><p>I decided to tame her first. I let my kisses trail down from her jawline to her neck, showering her sensitive skin with soft kisses. She just enjoyed it without making a sound —or more accurately, without saying a word, as her moans were sufficiently loud. </p><p>It was a great misconception about the neck. Compared to moving onto the breasts, which was deemed as a benchmark of progress, therefore made the girls very alarmed, the neck was much more accessible. However, it was almost as sensitive as the breasts —or even more sensitive in some special girls, which I made them climax just by a dedicated assault of their elegant necks. </p><p>Carrie wasn’t one of those extremes, but still, as I kissed and licked her neck, she started squirming on my knee, making me wish that she was wearing a skirt, which would have made things so much easier. Still, I spent the next ten minutes alternating between her lips and her neck, while she explored every inch of my naked torso. </p><p>Her moans got louder and louder, signaling that while a climax wasn’t in the immediate vicinity, we finally stepped on that beautiful road, while doing nothing but foreplay. “You know,” I whispered as my hot breath caressed her ear. “We can go a bit further if you want.” I could have pushed without asking, but it would have made her tense. At this stage, it was better for her to feel in control. </p><p>It would only make it better when I finally take it back. </p><p>“I -” she started, only to be interrupted by a moan as I nibbled on her neck. “I don’t know,” she whispered. “Isn’t it a bit much…” </p><p>“Your call, my sexy nerd,” I whispered back. “If you think this is enough, then this is enough. If you think we can play a bit more, where I could show you the true meaning of pleasure, rather than the introduction we were handling, that’s your call as well.” </p><p>“True meaning,” she murmured in shock, before shaking her head. “W-we better not,” she said, then quickly added, “Not yet!” afraid of pushing me away. </p><p>“As you wish, my sexy nerd,” I answered back. “How about another kiss, this time a bit more heated?” </p><p>“More heated?” she repeated, gulping in anticipation as she nodded, and I stole another kiss of her soft lips. </p><p>This time, it was different, a true hurricane compared to the soft winds of the previous one, aggressive and domineering, breaking down her walls, taking control of the assault.</p><p>Carrie stiffened in shock at first, but it didn’t last long. Soon, she was doing her best to kiss me ferociously. Even though she failed to gain the upper hand, she didn’t feel like she had any complaints. Her hands reached to my chest, dancing over my muscles as she drew big circles, but each repeat brought her hands a bit lower. </p><p>Her ultimate aim was so clear that I would have laughed at her under different circumstances. However, I wasn’t stupid enough to do so when there was a deliciously curvy girl on my knee, trying to sneak a grope at my erection. </p><p>Soon, her fingers reached to the waistband of my underwear, dancing at the perimeter, but failing to take the final step. </p><p>I decided to take that as a signal to push my game to the next level. My hand slipped under her shirt, finally caressing her naked skin, though I stayed focused on the small of her back. My motive was the same as her neck. Not as alarming as removing her bra, but still an excellent erogenous zone to get her worked up even further. </p><p>Even with my lips doing their best to muffle her voice, her moans filled the car, making me glad that it was winter, which made us keep the windows closed. Otherwise, even in such an uninhibited place, we would have got the attention of the others. </p><p>It was time for the next step, I decided as my fingers snaked upward, finding her bra clasp. All it took was a flick to free her breasts from the imprisonment, but feeling her subtle stiffening, I immediately moved my hand lower to calm her down. </p><p>Luckily, a searing kiss and an attractive, musclebound torso proved just enough to distract Carrie from putting her bra properly, which finally gave me the chance to move onto the most exciting part of the evening. </p><p>Her surprisingly large breasts. </p><p>I couldn’t help but moan as well as I grabbed them over her shirt, allowing me to feel them properly without the pressure of her tight bra. They were tight, and they were supple. I felt like a pioneer who just bought some arid farmland, only to struck oil. </p><p>Carrie had a face that would be beautiful after the slightest effort, but even without that, she would have hordes of boys following her, if she just wore something form-fitting to show off her spectacular globes —and maybe with a hint of cleavage to highlight the impact. Discovering her was a rather entertaining coincidence. </p><p>Emboldened by my touch, her hands got braver. She found my belt, struggling to open it for a while before changing her mind, and started caressing my bulge over my jeans, while I finally slipped my hands under her shirt, touching the naked skin of her breasts. </p><p>It was weird. After all those girls, getting into the second base with a nerd shouldn’t be exciting, but it was weirdly electric, something I hadn’t felt during the string of cheerleader hookups I had experienced as a quarterback. Maybe it was the expectation, or maybe it was the lackluster reaction of the girls, who felt our hookups were a part of their expected routine. </p><p>Whatever it was, I decided to enjoy the moment rather than wasting my time trying to analyze it. I focused on her dangling tits, squeezing their huge expanse, thumbing her nipples. And what I found, from the firmness of her breasts to the suppleness of her skin, was undoubtedly the best I had experienced. The warm, heavy, firm, and paradoxically, somehow unbelievably soft at the same time.</p><p>Carrie moaned in pure ecstasy, wrenching her mouth away from mine just long enough to desperately whisper, “It feels amazing. Do it harder!” signaling that she was starting to lose control.  </p><p>A gentleman could never turn down such an urgent request, so I squeezed her tits harder even as I resumed the kiss, my tongue ravaging her mouth. In response, her hands over my bulge quickened, pushing me closer to an explosion of my own. Too bad it was a slow journey. </p><p>“Mmm--mm!” she moaned loudly, and I let her do so unfettered, stopping the kiss for a moment. However, this time, I had a better place to focus than her neck. I yanked up her shirt enough to reveal her tits, the cover of her bra inconsequential. </p><p>For a moment, I stopped to enjoy the glorious sight of her naked tits. “Damn, girl, you have amazing tits,” I whispered, completely honest for the first time in the evening. </p><p>“You think-” she started, only to be interrupted by a moan. This time, the culprit was my lips, clamping on her nipple. </p><p>She let out a gasp, and started rubbing my cock with wild abandon, which was all the confirmation I needed before I started to suck aggressively while my fingers explored every inch of her naked tits after they wasted a few seconds to completely remove her bra. </p><p>We were quick, like we were trying to win a race or something, our hands a blur over our bodies. Soon, she started trembling as her inexperienced body hit its limits, triggering an explosive climax. She started trembling on my knee so much that I had to wrap both arms around her waist to keep her upright, which had the added benefit of crushing my face against her chest, giving me the most amazing sensation of suffocation I had ever experienced. </p><p>She was like a firecracker, loud, messy, but nonetheless, spectacular as she shone under the darkness of the night. </p><p>It took several minutes for her to properly recover, a time I had utilized by lazily playing with her tits. </p><p>Unfortunately, as she recovered, she also slowly regained her wits. I could have pushed her before she recovered of course. With my experience, it wouldn’t be difficult to transition onto the backseat, but that wouldn’t be fair to her. </p><p>I said nothing, but smiled kindly as she blushed, then fixed her shirt, depriving me of the amazing view. Luckily, she forgot to put her bra back on, which gave me the beautiful sight of her erect nipples pushing out of her shirt. </p><p>“That was…” she murmured, unable to finish her sentence. </p><p>“Beautiful, and so are you,” I completed her, which put a smile on her face, especially when I followed with a kiss on her cheek. </p><p>Her smile was positively radiant, unrestrained by her shyness for the first time, which elevated her homely cuteness into a real beauty, so much that I had to bite my lips to constrain myself. Even then, a low grunt escaped my throat, suggesting a lot of interesting things. </p><p>That reminded her of the last remaining problem. “Should I?” she asked as she subtly glanced at my crotch, only to avoid it immediately, which told me that she was in no way ready to do that, especially after the hesitancy that crept in after the big explosion. </p><p>“No,” I said, and she flinched, her lack of confidence quick to invade the surface of her emotions. “Not yet, at least,” I corrected immediately. “You’re clearly overwhelmed, and it wouldn’t be fair to ask you that.” </p><p>“But it’s not fair-” she started, only for me to cut her off, mostly to flex my new nice guy persona. </p><p>“No, what is not fair is for any party to push themselves into they are not comfortable just because they want to pay back.” I chuckled. “And, don’t forget that I’m your tutor, I can handle a bit of discomfort.” </p><p>“Right,” she chuckled, her smile once again deliciously cute. </p><p>Then, we drove off silently into the night, excited yet satisfied… </p><p><br></p>
