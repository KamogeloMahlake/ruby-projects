        <title>Immortal Freeloader Ending - What's Next?</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hi everyone, </p><p>With chapter 172 done, we have finally reached the end of the story. For those that are interested in, I want to say a few things about the story. </p><p>Immortal Freeloader had been my first foray into writing a cultivation story, which, I have to admit, had quite a few challenges that I hadn't been expecting when I had started, especially since I had mixed it with both a cheat and isekai concept. Overall, I enjoyed writing it, but I can also understand why it wasn't my most popular story ever. </p><p>Frankly, my initial objective was to make the character more of a nihilistic wanderer than anything else, but at some point, the story transformed in a direction that I hadn't initially planned. </p><p>I wanted to end the story, mostly because our dear freeloader had reached the end of his journey, not only fighting mysterious interdimensional enemies, but also against ethos of avoiding responsibility. While it could be written even more, without continuing the conflict between his morals and the world, I fear the story will turn into a bland mess. </p><p>I know that there's many open plot points, from the true nature of Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, to the fates of Pearyin, Janassa, and Aisnam; not to mention the conflict between the martial arts and the cultivation, but that's intentional. I'm already planning to write a sequel, but it won't have the same main character. </p><p>Instead, it'll analyze the situation from a different perspective, showing the aftermath of the situation from a unique - and hopefully entertaining perspective. </p><p>Though, that brings me to my last point. The next story that will take its place in the update schedule. Blacksmith vs. the System will continue in its usual 7 chapters a week pattern, but another story will replace this in the schedule. (Though, probably after taking a break one or two weeks to plan it properly, but Blacksmith will continue to be published in that period.) </p><p>I want to ask your opinion about what should follow it? </p><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> The sequel from the perspective of a different character that I had mentioned above, which will mainly be another cultivation story, but this time from the perspective of a native character, and without a cheat system like the previous ones. </p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Continuing Wild Dragon of Rome to completion. </p><p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Rewrite A Gamer Adventure (Leveling through Lust). It's probably a controversial choice, particularly for the people who want a continuation of it. I actually tried to write a direct sequel to it. The problem is that it was my first long-form story, with a lot of structural issues that make a sequel an unappealing challenge without aggressive, sweeping changes. But, be warned that, if I rewrite it, I'll significantly reduce the amount of erotica it contains. </p><p><strong>Option 4:</strong> A brand new story, which you can think of it as a lootbox with a completely random result will pop off. I have a few ideas, but even I don't know which one I'll ultimately go. But, there's a good chance it'll be more sci-fi-themed than the usual. </p><p><em>Just a little reminder that I'm not fully guaranteeing with the winner of the poll, as there are other factors that'll affect my final decision, but that's naturally only if the results end up being close. </em></p>
