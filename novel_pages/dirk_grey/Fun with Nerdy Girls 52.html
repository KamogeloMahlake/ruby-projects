        <p>Ida had an uncharacteristically sharp smile on her face — even for the alter-ego she displayed while she had a camera in hand — as Irene reconnected with the floor and breathed excitedly. </p><p>“Chad, grab the ax and repeat the earlier pose,” she ordered, but she continued to look at Irene as she said so, suggesting that I wouldn’t be the target of her next move. “Irene, drop the cape.” </p><p>“W-wait,” Irene gasped, the exuberant elation she had been feeling moments earlier replaced by a fresh wave of shame as she realized the implications of replicating the earlier trick without a cape. </p><p>Too bad her friend clearly had no intention of letting Irene argue. Ida took a step forward, making Irene stumble back — which was even less successful than Ida’s earlier attempts to avoid me, as I was standing right behind her. Before she could even take a half step forward, her body hit mine. </p><p>She tensed as she felt my presence, especially my shaft, which had already reached the apex after Ida’s sloppy intervention. </p><p>Yet, that same shock cost her the only protection she had. Ida used her distraction to untie the string that was keeping the cape in place, and I leaned back slightly, letting it slide down the ground for a fleeting moment before leaning forward once again, once again making the distance between us to nothing. </p><p>This time, with one great difference. Nothing was preventing the connection between our bodies. Almost a full connection, I realized as felt her presence against my body. The bottom part of her costume was barely more than a  g-string on the back, showing that she had been relying on her cape excessively. </p><p>And, since my own loincloth was still dislodged due to Ida’s intervention — not to mention very difficult to fit properly now that it was fully awakened even if I tried to fix it— it meant the naked contact was significantly more complete than it would have been otherwise. </p><p>“C-Chad—” Irene stammered in shock, only to be interrupted. </p><p>It was Ida who interrupted her. “Smile,” she ordered as she started taking photos, the exploding flash more than enough to stagger Irene’s words for a moment. </p><p>I put my hand on Irene’s smooth belly, pulling her tight against my body as I raised the ax with my other hand, leaning against her ear. “You know what you’re feeling against you is your fault for being so sexy,” I whispered. </p><p>Which wasn’t exactly correct, as her friend had played a greater role than one might otherwise expect, but my particular weight against her body was distracting her from focusing on such little details. </p><p>Especially since Ida continued to move around us, recording every second of our excessive contact. Irene leaned against me even harder when Ida moved enough to get a glimpse of our bodies from the side, using her beautiful ass — just the right degree between tightness and plumpness — to hide my shaft. </p><p>A glance down was enough to confirm that it didn’t succeed, the crown peeking outside, visible thanks to the beautiful curve of her back, but Irene stayed unaware of that even as Ida created several pieces of photographic evidence of the scandalous nature of our pose. </p><p>A minute passed as Ida photographed us, still displaying her unique aggression, and Irene got tenser and tenser — a fact that I was able to observe easily thanks to our full-body contact. </p><p>I had expected that to be the end of that little adventure when Ida once again moved, this time standing behind us as she took photos. I loosened my grip around Irene’s waist, deciding that I had messed with her sufficiently. </p><p>And, that seemed like the correct choice as Irene used that opportunity to move forward immediately. </p><p>Key word being seemed… </p><p>She took a step forward, and I expected her to follow up with another one to increase the distance even further, escaping the room. So, it was surprising when she reached to her back and grabbed my shaft. </p><p>It was even more surprising when she used that reach to adjust my shaft so that when she took a step back, it was firmly locked in her thighs, a certain wetness caressing the topside. </p><p>Daring, I thought even as I felt surprised — though, a voice back on my head mocked me for being surprised. After everything else the rest of her little naughty group had committed, it wasn’t even enough to properly register in the list of top ten. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean she had no hope of not getting a seat on that great list. After all, she was just at her rookie debut as far as that vaunted list was concerned. </p><p>Her hips started to move, rocking back and forth, showing that she was willing to fight for it. I said nothing, enjoying the delicious pressure of her inner thighs even as she moved back and forth, creating a delicious tremble around my shaft. </p><p>She moved slowly, though I didn’t know whether it was about her self-consciousness limiting her movement speed, or an attempt to keep it hidden from Ida. </p><p>Although, if the latter was her objective, it was certainly a misguided one. Avoiding Ida’s attention might have been possible if she didn’t have the camera in hand, as she would have almost certainly failed to look at such a scene in a firm manner, but with the camera, it was much less likely. </p><p>Add in the fact that we were her models, and she was leaning up and down to immortalize our sight from many different angles, and it was impossible. </p><p>Soon, I felt Ida’s presence behind me, her hand sneaking through between my legs to caress the underside of my shaft without touching Irene, confirming my guess about her awareness. </p><p>Irene missed that fact, occupied by the sensations generated by her movements, the little scrap that was supposed to function as a skirt but barely managed to compare to a bikini bottom — while looking much sexier than one in the process — doing scarcely little to limit the sensation of touch against her core as she went back and forth subtly. </p><p>Or, in a way she thought to be subtle, as, along with her pleasure growing, her movements started to get bigger and bigger, the combined warmth of her thighs and her wet core enough to challenge my ability to keep back. </p><p>Especially with Ida’s fingers, assisting Irene’s task underneath. </p><p>It was certainly a special treat, I thought as I held back a moan, but Irene wasn’t as successful, and a soft moan escaped her mouth. “A - a cramp,” she gasped panickedly immediately after the moan left her mouth, doing her best to explain. </p><p>It was not a convincing argument, but in a way, she was lucky as success was hardly a requirement with Ida being aware of everything. </p><p>“Doesn’t matter as long as you don’t move,” Ida answered harshly. “Photos don’t capture the sound.” </p><p>“Right,” Irene answered, the earlier tenseness replaced by enthusiasm after coming to the false realization that she managed to hide her naughty trick from her friend. </p><p>She was such a special treat, I decided even as I let my hand climb upward on her body, caressing the underside of her breasts. That earned a shocked glance from her as she tried to look back, only to be interrupted by Ida. “Don’t move, you’re ruining the pose,” she said even as she pressed the shutter without caring about the target, busy caressing the base of my shaft. </p><p>“Yes, Irene, don’t move, you’re ruining the pose,” I said even as I let my fingers slip under her top — which was easy considering just how loose it was — and finally let my fingers dig into her beautiful tits. </p><p>I leaned into her ear even as I did so, and whispered. “Do you really think I wouldn’t do anything after you —“</p><p>The sentence left unfinished, but it wasn’t Irene that interrupted me, but Ida. And she did so in the form of a slap on my ass, hard enough to echo in the room and leave a soft, stinging pain behind. “Don’t change the pose.” </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I answered, more amused than anything at her attempt. Being dominated by such a petite example of beauty was certainly entertaining, and while Irene’s presence prevented me from retaliating immediately… </p><p>Sometimes, waiting for the dessert made a much more pleasurable experience. </p><p>We fell into a routine.</p><p>Though, considering that routine was defined by a redhead doing her best to make me cum with a thigh job while I massaged her generous breasts while an exotic petite beauty did her best to massage the areas that were left untouched by the redhead to complete the sensation, it was certainly not a routine that could be classified as boring. </p><p>A few minutes later, just as I was about to be convinced that it would be the limit of our little adventure, things took an interesting turn. The first move came from Irene, in the form of her hands slipping under her little loincloth. I expected her to tease the head of my shaft or something similar, but she chose to pull the little portion that was between my shaft and her core, preventing direct contact. Although its wetness had compromised its ability significantly, it was still a barrier, and the direct touch was certainly amazing. </p><p>And, with that gone, Irene’s hips got more unbridled, the motion getting large enough that the head of my shaft started rubbing against her entrance at its apex. Of course, that meant that even the illusion of keeping her movement hidden was gone, but she was just too far gone to notice that. </p><p>Yet, that was just the setup. The real surprise came from Ida, who had noticed exactly what was going on, her body getting tenser at Irene’s daring as it challenged her authority — which I could feel very intensely as her body was still pushing against mine. </p><p>I prepared myself against Ida’s intervention, not willing to go with whatever little payback her little devious mind was developing. </p><p>She managed to surprise me, and rather than trying to push me, she reached around me and grabbed Irene’s hips, pulling them before we could react, choosing the perfect moment to do so… </p><p>Irene was too busy moaning at the sudden invasion to say anything about that, finding herself halfway skewered by my shaft — a rather explosive start as her first time, making me glad that we had been going through a very extended foreplay to loosen her. </p><p>Ida’s surprises were yet to be over, and before we could react, she walked around us once more, her camera raised. “I told you not to move too much,” she said, acting like what happened was just an accident. </p><p>“Now, let’s continue with the shoot.”</p>
