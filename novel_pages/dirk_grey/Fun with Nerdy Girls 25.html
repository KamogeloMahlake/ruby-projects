        <p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I watched Naomi walk in front of me, the tightness of her body apparent despite her loose clothes  — which was a touch of pity. I examined her as she looked around the house. Still, it was a disappointing development. </p><p>But then, she did something to renew my hope. </p><p>“Where can I change?” she asked. </p><p>“You can use the downstairs bathroom,” I said. “I’ll be in the garden.” </p><p>She nodded, her cute light chocolate skin gaining a lovely hue as she blushed, though the fact that my torso was naked paid a good role on that. Then she turned away and walked toward the bathroom with a speed that was almost on the edge of being classified as a dash. </p><p>“So cute,” I murmured as I went back to the garden. My exercise schedule was complete, but there was no harm in subjecting her to an impressive view once she came. </p><p>Naomi stayed in the bathroom for almost ten minutes later, which was excessive just to change into another loose t-shirt and sweatpants combo — something I had expected her to consider the way Carrie usually dressed. </p><p>Sarah had dressed more revealingly, of course, but that was a combination of Sarah’s self-appointed role as the group leader and the importance of the last night, contrasting with her idea of she was the most outgoing one between her friends — and she responded by revealing more and more of her body in a misguided effort to prove she was more ‘progressive’ than Carrie. </p><p>Then the door opened, giving me a big surprise, the nice kind. </p><p>She was wearing nothing but skin-tight yoga pants and a tight top, leaving not much to doubt about her body. </p><p>Not that she had any reason to hide her body. She looked delicious as the sun shone on her skin, revealing the hidden muscles behind a soft layer of fat. </p><p>Damn, I thought, barely able to suppress a surprised exclamation. What was going on with those nerds, each with a body more beautiful than the cheerleaders I had been wasting my time with their annoying entitled attitude. I had no idea whether it was something unique to their group or I had been wasting my time ignoring such a wondrous world. </p><p>But that was a topic for a different time. Instead, I focused on the way her deliciously curvy ass danced even as she walked casually, her stomach contracting to give the impression of strength under her soft skin. Her top was tight, and the sports bra underneath prevented her top from jiggling, but not tight enough to conceal the great treasure that lay underneath. </p><p>I let the weight I was lifting fall on the ground with a great commotion, making her flinch, but not enough to pull her gaze away from my muscles. She was clearly as impressed with the sight she met, even without the shock value. </p><p>So impressed that, she said nothing for half a minute as she looked at my body, blushing more and more, affected by the sight even more than Carrie and Sarah had been. </p><p>“Shall we start?” I said with a smirk. “It’s better if we do some stretching before I start to cool down.” </p><p>“R-right,” she said as she quickly walked closer. “Have you ever practiced yoga before?” </p><p>“Once or twice,” I answered. </p><p>“Maybe we should start with a few basic poses,” she offered. “Try to follow my instructions.” </p><p>“No,” I said with a smirk, which surprised her. I explained quickly. “I learn better by watching. Why don’t you give me a quick rundown for me first so that I know what you expect from me.” </p><p>“Sure,” she said with confidence, but at this point, it didn’t surprise me. I had seen the same flip on Carrie and Sarah several times now, their shy and hesitant personality melting away the moment they faced an area that they were confident in. </p><p>And clearly, yoga was Naomi’s area of expertise. </p><p>She started moving, her muscles contracting beautifully to reveal the surprising power her otherwise gentle body was holding, though I was equally interested in the way her already tight yoga shorts stretched further, revealing every line of her body. </p><p>As she moved, her earlier shyness was nowhere to be seen. </p><p>I stayed back, enjoying the show she was providing, shuffling just enough to keep my body warm after my exercise. But my focus was on the light perspiration she was developing, highlighting the beautiful contours of her body, from her pouty lips to her shapely calves. As she bent for one of the downward poses, enhancing the tenseness of her hips even further, tempting me to cut this little game close. </p><p>I managed to ignore that desire, though the lengthy morning gift I had received paid a big role in it. “Do you think you can do it?” she asked, a surprising cadence in her tone, one that reflected authority expecting obedience. </p><p>“There’s only one way to test,” I said as I took the first form to the best of my ability. </p><p>“Slide your foot further,” she said, walking behind me and pushing my foot to the correct position, launching a painful and excruciating yet thrilling episode. </p><p>She certainly didn’t pull any punches. After a few stretching exercises making sure I was flexible enough, she forced me more and more difficult poses, which challenged me more than I was expecting, not helped by the fact that she turned out to be a true slave driver during the training. </p><p>If it wasn’t for her beautiful slender fingers curling over my shoulders and pressing into my back to push me further into the poses, I might have called the exercise short. But her soft caresses, lingering over the contours of my muscles quite longer than strictly necessary was a good enough reason for me to do otherwise. </p><p>“You’re nimbler than I expected,” Naomi said even as she ordered me to change pose. </p><p>“I take my workouts seriously,” I said. </p><p>“It’s so nice to have a friend that does so. Carrie and the others always find excuses not to join my sessions.” </p><p>I chuckled. If she was pushing them half as hard as she was pushing me, no wonder they were determined to avoid her. Even for me, it was a true challenge. But before I could inform her of my opinion, she spoke again. </p><p>“That’s enough warm-up, let’s start with real exercises,” she said, forcing me to another position, even more difficult. But that difficulty didn’t come without its own benefits. She leaned against my back, the sensation of her chest gloriously soft as she helped me to lean. </p><p>That, I was writing it off as an accidental move, done when she was distracted by her own movements. However, when the next move also kept our body in unnecessarily close contact, followed by again…</p><p>Yeah, she was flirting with me. Rather badly, I had to admit, just like Carrie had been doing at the start of our relationship. If another boy was in my place, especially one of the guys that seemed to gravitate around them due to their social status, they would have been long intimidated under her aggressive teaching, ruining any chance of taking the next step. </p><p>And from there, a retreat was the only outcome. It was rare for a boy, especially an insecure one, to accept being the physically inferior one, especially with the way Naomi seemed to push that angle aggressively. Luckily for her, I was confident in my own physical skills enough to be amused by her aggressiveness. </p><p>Which meant, I was able to resist the pain and discomfort enough until she had reached the next stage of her flirting, her body mashing against mine more and more. However, even as her movements got more confident, her expression was getting hesitant, like she was breaching an area that she never reached before. </p><p>I was suspecting that while her approach was something she felt comfortable in, the level she was pushing was goaded by someone else, eerily reminding me of my first study session with Carrie, where she was doing her best to touch my arm with her friends goading. </p><p>A minute later, Naomi confirmed that indirectly. She reached her phone, quickly typing something, only for her phone to buzz immediately. It must be an interesting reply, because her eyes widened as she read. </p><p>“L-let’s try something different,” she murmured immediately, too shocked to actually delay a bit to hide the fact that she was getting instructions from her phone. </p><p>“Lay prone,” she ordered suddenly. It must be something really excessive, because her confidence — which had been eroding slowly — shattered completely, leaving its place to a cute hesitance. </p><p>I followed her request and lay on my chest, a smirk on my face as I waited for my sexy volunteer trainer to act. </p><p>“It’s going to hurt, try holding it as much as possible,” she said before I felt a weight on my back. And without only thin yoga shorts in between, it wasn’t hard to guess exactly what part of her body was pressing against my skin, wriggling with a suspicious frequency. </p><p>Though, it was hard to focus when she was pulling my leg hard enough to hurt very much. An interesting way to flirt, even as her fingers slowly trailed down my leg, getting higher and higher on my thigh, carefully caressing dangerously close my length. </p><p>If her pinky finger had dragged along it a couple of times as she continued to torture me, I was sure that it was completely accidental. The same went for the expression on her face when we finally finished our pose. After all, nerds were famous for their shyness and their avoidance of sex. </p><p>And I could certainly not think of an example on the contrary. Not at all. </p><p>Her treatment lasted ten more minutes, falling rightfully in between pain and pleasure, before she finally called a stop. </p><p>“Thanks for your help,” I said as I stretched, which also gave her a perfect view of my glistening muscles, loosened excellently after her long treatment, as well as my erection straining against my short. “I definitely some help.”</p><p>“Not a problem. It was a pleasure for me as well. The girls don’t like to work out with me,” she said, her gaze bouncing all around the garden, her shyness back now that we got away from her area of expertise, like she hadn’t been caressing my body aggressively to stretch me for the last thirty minutes. </p><p>Though, if the earlier intensity was what she brought to her workout sessions, one that I found challenging me despite my ambition to be a professional athlete, I could see why they were trying to avoid her. </p><p>However, before I could make a comment, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Carrie. But when she read that, her blush covered her face explosively. “S-sorry,” she stammered. “I need to go. E-emergency.” </p><p>“Sure,” I said, but she was already dashing away. My phone buzzed a moment later. A message from Carrie. ‘I think I scared her, sorry,’ she wrote, followed by several sad emojis. </p><p>‘Not a problem, sweetie,’ I said. After all, not only Carrie was the one to arrange it in the first place, but also her amazing performance in the last twenty-four hours was enough to compensate for much bigger screw-ups. </p><p>‘But don’t worry, I’ll make it up to you,’ she replied, leaving me wondering what kind of trick she had in her surprisingly dirty mind. </p>
