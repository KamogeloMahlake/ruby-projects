        <p>“It’s good that you made the correct decision,” I murmured even as I closed the distance between us in slow steps. “I’m sure that you’re going to enjoy my tribe’s celebration ceremony.” </p><p>She said nothing, still looking shocked, like she couldn’t believe herself accepting my conditions. I could feel her determination flailing, like she was about to change her mind once again. However, once her gaze dipped down, seeing my naked shaft, dangling freely, she swallowed her words. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the only thing she swallowed tonight. </p><p>I continued walking, doing my best to look threatening, but not threatening enough to actually intimidate her. She continued to lay on the bed, trembling in anticipation, but making to move to increase the distance between us. </p><p>When I stood on the side of her bed, she shuffled, trying to align herself for a pounding. Too bad for her that I had other ideas. </p><p>“Not so fast, honey,” I whispered even as I grabbed her hair, holding just tight enough to give a sting of pain, though it was incomparably soft compared to the treatment Cera received earlier. Dominating the noblest ladies of Rome was fun, but ultimately, I couldn’t forget that, under the circumstances, I was just entertainment for them, and there was a limit for my pushing. </p><p>That didn’t mean I was going to act cowardly, of course, evidenced by the way I pulled her head toward my crotch inches away from her full lips. “You can’t be serious. I’m not a servant or a slave. If you think I’ll do something that disgusting—“ she gasped in shock. </p><p>Too bad for her that I was experienced enough to catch the excitement in her gaze even as she exclaimed her arguments, pulling her head even closer, pressing my shaft against her plump lips. “I told you I’m going to show you my tribe’s victory celebration,” I said even as the pressure grew, forcing her down, silencing her as my crown pressed against her lips. </p><p>She froze, excitement battling with shame. Too bad for the shame that excitement had a robust reinforcement. </p><p>I watched in amusement as her lips parted despite her submissive position, blurring the lines about who was the servant and who was noble, her lips wrapping around my girth as I pushed my hips forward. </p><p>It was a hesitant wrap, showing that despite all of her obvious sexual experience, she seldom found herself pleasuring a man with her mouth. </p><p>She shuffled until her knees sink into the soft bed, allowing her to get a better balance on the soft surface, but as I pushed my shaft deeper into her mouth, she managed to look up, arousal and shock dancing in her brown eyes. </p><p>Under my sharp gaze, she opened her jaw, even more, allowing my shaft to fit comfortably, which was exactly what I needed to slide inside her hot mouth mercilessly, the crown hitting the entrance of her throat immediately. </p><p>She gagged, unable to hide her shock, closing her eyes as she tried to process the sudden invasion. “Not bad for a pampered noble,” I said as I pulled my hips back, only to slam once again, this time slipping the head into her tight throat a bit, earning an even louder gag in the process. </p><p>While I was busy dealing with her, Cera sat on the bed, her gaze firmly on the show, though it was impossible to hide the glee she was feeling. She was clearly enjoying the ignoble fate of the noble lady who had been forcing her to serve just moments ago. Her legs parted, her hand disappearing between them as she enjoyed the show properly. </p><p>Good for her, I thought even as I turned my attention back to the noble lady that was struggling under my merciless assault. “Oh, imagine if the door opened, and your exalted husband entered,” I commented. “What would he say seeing his precious wife servicing a lowly gladiator.” </p><p>She trembled, fear mixing into the excitement that could only be given by a taboo. Pity that it didn’t magically solve her deficient oral abilities. </p><p>“Cera, come here,” I ordered. She was quick to respond, though our noble guest looked shocked. Even when I pulled out of her mouth, she said nothing, limiting herself to a helpless wheeze as she tried to catch her breath. </p><p>“Cera, show her how it’s done,” I said as I grabbed her hair, though before I could pull her down, she had already thrown herself over my glistening cock. I pulled her closer, forcing her to swallow more of my erection, her gags and wheezes filling the room. </p><p>However, she didn’t let her obvious discomfort prevent the completion of her glorious task, swallowing it with a surprising speed. A part of it was her experience from our earlier, very memorable, encounter, but I couldn’t help but feel the other part was her desire to one-up the rich noble that was dominating her earlier without showing her the slightest respect. </p><p>Such dedication needed to be rewarded, I thought even as I slapped the beautiful bosom of the noble lady. “Pay attention how she does,” I said, not bothering to hide my disdain. </p><p>Shame invaded her face, followed by shock as she realized the absurdity of the shame she was feeling. I didn’t bother hiding my chuckle, curious whether she would try to exert her authority by commenting on it, or refuting the impression. </p><p>She stayed silent, too focused on Cera’s achievement. </p><p>“Enough,” I said after a while and pulled out, only to slam it back on our noble guest’s throat once more, her tits dangling gloriously with each push. Cera was fun, no doubt about it, but I had a more important mission tonight. </p><p>The expression of shame didn’t disappear, but as my shaft started to invade the depths of her throat, pleasure joined the mix, even bringing in a hint of pride when she glanced at Cera, as if she was declaring her superiority. </p><p>Her reward, was a sudden change of pace. </p><p>She looked shocked as I pulled my shaft out, leaving her dazed and shocked at the sudden change of pace. “That was the first part,” I said. “Now, lick it.” Her gaze wasn’t exactly filled with enthusiasm, so I gestured to Cera. “We can always use her if you don’t think you can handle it.” </p><p>It was a simple trick, one that wasn’t supposed to work in a self-possessed and experienced woman like her. Unfortunately, she had two factors working against her. One, she was already battling with a confusing attraction toward me thanks to my glorious public fights and my physical attributes. Second, after the rough treatment she had received, she was deprived of air, impairing her decision-making even more. </p><p>And just like that, she reached up and grabbed my shaft with her soft hands, staring at the bulbous tip of my cock with trepidation. Still, she shuffled in her place for better balance before leaning forward slowly, her pouty lips already parted, her tongue pushing out. </p><p>Her inexperience was showing as her tongue darted out, going back and forth along my length as she tried to replicate the show she had no doubt watched countless times by those of lower birth of status. I couldn’t help but look at Cera, amused at her triumphant, arrogant smirk. She was lucky that our noble lady had more important tasks than paying attention to her. </p><p>If not, Cera would have paid for her disrespect after I left. </p><p>The tongue over my shaft danced faster, covering it with a fresh coat of glistening warmth as she tried her best to compensate for her lack of skill with speed. I was impressed by the speed she was adapting to her submissive position, no doubt helped by the assurance that it had no long-term consequences thanks to our statuses. </p><p>After her initial reluctance was broken, she adapted to her submissive role with surprising efficiency. </p><p>“That’s enough,” I said as I grabbed her head. “It’s time to open your pretty mouth again.” This time, she didn’t even try to complain as she stretched her jaw wide and took the head in her mouth, sucking the tip for a moment before I pushed it forward, the huge head pushing into her throat. She choked and gagged, creating a beautiful backdrop, but my grip didn’t allow her to retreat. </p><p>"Just relax your throat," I advised her even as I pulled her even tighter, forcing another inch of my thick shaft to disappear into her precious mouth. She bobbed her head with great effort, showing her determination not to be a passive participant, impressing me. </p><p>I rewarded her with another slap on her gloriously big breasts, which made her speed up even more. </p><p>Teaching prestigious and sexy Roman nobles about appropriate behavior in the bedroom was such a beautiful privilege… </p>
