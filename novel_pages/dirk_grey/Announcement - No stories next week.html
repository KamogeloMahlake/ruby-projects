        <p>Hi everyone, </p><p>May is another month that has five Sundays, so as usual, I will be taking one week off during May, and that week is going to be the next week. </p><p>Also, please note that I will be traveling during the week, so there's a chance that I'll respond to your comments and messages with a delay. Apologies in advance. </p><p>I hope everyone has a nice week, and see you guys on 14th with new chapters.  </p>
