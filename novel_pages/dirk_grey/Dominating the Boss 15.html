        <p>When Jenny returned from the kitchen, she was prepared to drown her annoyance with liquid refreshment, carrying a generously-filled wine glass for herself, and another scotch for me. “Thanks, Jenny, you’re an angel,” I said, and she blushed. It wasn’t the first compliment she had received from me during the dinner, but it was the first one that I delivered correctly, both in tone and in timing, letting my eyes on her face just enough to convey attraction without being pushy. With Natalie away, I could finally start my efforts of seduction. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured. “So, how is working with Natalie, is it enjoyable?” she asked, a bit quicker than normal, signaling that my compliment worked just as intended. </p><p>“It’s a delight,” I said, and launched a few stories from the work, all of which factually correct at the core, but details slightly transformed to create a portrait of strong alliance, where I was working with Natalie to save the business from the brink of destruction, while experiencing quite a few humorous situations on the way. </p><p>I already knew from her earlier treatment that Natalie hadn’t told her anything about the exact balance of our relationship, but the genuine reactions she showed to my stories confirmed it. Another mistake on Natalie’s part, letting her allies ride to the battle with misinformation. Well, she would learn her mistake when her ally ended up being ridden all night long.</p><p>The tales continued until Jenny was focused on my words rather than the annoyance she felt towards Natalie. At one point, I stood up to tell a particularly lively part of the story, and when it finished, I sat next to her rather than across, reinforcing my message with a few innocent touches, which made her breath quicken for some reason! </p><p>“Actually, there is something I wanted to tell you,” I said after a brief lull in the conversation. “We were talking with Natalie before she left, and she admitted to me that it wasn’t just for a social gathering that she called me here.” She looked at me questioningly. “She mentioned something about returning the favor for her birthday.” </p><p>“Right…” Jenny murmured absentmindedly before her eyes grew in shock. “Birthday!” she exclaimed. “As in…” she tried to continue, but the embarrassment didn’t allow her to finish. Her eyes darted to the stairs, which led to her bedroom. </p><p>“Exactly,” I said. “I know it’s a bit awkward to open, but I wanted to see if you’re on board with the idea. I didn’t want you to be ambushed with it.” </p><p>“I - yes - maybe - I don’t know,” she said with rapid succession, confusion overwhelming her. She jumped up to her feet, going back and forth, trying to sort her thoughts. She pulled her phone, ready to call. “Maybe you should text,” I reminded her innocently. “It’s better if Elena doesn’t hear, is it?” I added. </p><p>“Good idea,” she acknowledged before turning her attention back to her phone, her fingers dancing rapidly on the keyboard. Messaging took a few minutes, but I could see her relaxing more with each message, her gaze lingering on me longer and longer. </p><p>I pointedly didn’t say anything as she closed her phone and put it back in her pocket. She was equally silent, but she chose to sit next to me once again, which I took as a positive sign. “So,” she murmured, trying to keep her eyes on the floor, but occasionally darting towards me.  </p><p>I said nothing at first, just stood up and walked behind her, putting my hands on her shoulders, gently rubbing while waiting for her to process the enormity of the situation. Her stiffness melted under my touch, and soon, she started to purr under my touch like a cat. </p><p>A few minutes later, I stopped massaging, and walked in front of her. She avoided my gaze, feeling shy, so I grabbed her chin, gently raising until I was looking directly into her eyes. “It’s your choice,” I said. “But maybe a trial would help you to make a decision.</p><p>“How-” she asked, but that was the only word she was able to utter, cut short by the presence of my lips. She stiffened at the sudden intrusion, but that stiffness lived even shorter, her lips following the rhythm of mine. Soon, her speed started to pick up, like her excitement broke through the dam of her control. </p><p>Soon, I felt her hands on my body, particularly on the lower half of my body, where my legs merged with my torso. “Naughty,” I said when I pulled back for a breather. </p><p>“You can’t expect me to decide before inspecting the merchandise,” she answered, trying to be glib and confident, an attitude that would have been more convincing if it wasn’t for her face, a shade lighter than her auburn hair. </p><p>“Go ahead, then,” I said even as I stood upright, which, since she was still sitting, gave her the perfect angle to play around with her object of interest. Her eyes darted up, only to slid away when met with my amused gaze, but her shyness didn’t prevent her hands from continuing their exploration. Apparently, Brenda was even more right than I had given her credit for about Jenny’s desire for her type of threesome. </p><p>At first, she restricted herself to caress over my pants, making me worry about her patience. Things would get really complicated if she decided to wait until Natalie’s arrival. But luckily, her self-control turned out to be more frayed than my worst-case assumptions, evidenced by the number of the times her fingers moved around the zipper of my pants. </p><p>“Waiting for Natalie to unwrap the gift,” I asked. </p><p>“Umm, yes,” she murmured. “That’s what I should do, right?” she asked, but her tone was begging to be convinced otherwise. </p><p>“That’s for you to decide, but you should consider the fact that she was the one that decided to leave us alone, using the airport trip as an excuse. Maybe she had a reason for that.” </p><p>“Maybe,” she said, but in her tone, there was a resistance I failed to break. She stilled as she considered my words, but she made me relax when she reached for her phone for another quick text, her smile brightening with the reply. </p><p>“Should I assume a positive response,” I said, but she had more important things to worry about than my rhetorical questions. An intense concentration was on her face as she pulled my zipper down and reached inside. She was happy with the proportions of the gift she had found under the wraps if her suddenly-brightening expression was any indicator. She had to pull her hand out for a brief struggle with my belt when she had trouble pulling it out of the confines. </p><p>“So big,” she whispered in fascination as she wrapped her hand around gently, her fingers failing to meet around the thickness of my endowment. Her hand moved up and down on its length like she was trying to assess whether she could take its entirety together, her lips parted, her tongue darting out, tempting me to push forward in a reckless abandon. </p><p>That, unfortunately, was not on the menu yet, not until Natalie’s arrival, where I could use the consequences of our bet to change the balance of the evening even further. I didn’t say anything, and I hadn’t needed to, not when Jenny was examining my length with her full attention, coming closer and closer like a butterfly fascinated by the flame. </p><p>“Do you mind if I sit down,” I said suddenly, making her flinch just before her lips touched my shaft. I wanted her to start, of course, but continuously standing up while she tried to gather her courage to push for more would get tiring quick. And I needed the energy for the rest of the night. </p><p>She nodded after flinching, realizing what she was about to do. I sat down next to her before she could process that, and put my hand on her knee, not high enough to scare her, but enough to keep her from standing up. Not forcefully of course, but for a woman with her personality, a subtle touch was stronger than chains. </p><p>“Feel free to continue,” I said to her, which made her ears burn red, but she nevertheless took the offer and wrapped her fingers around my shaft once more. I waited until the beats of her movement quickened, then put my hand on her shoulder in a gentle caress that went unnoticed in her concentration. </p><p>I matched my intensity with hers, increasing it further as her grip tightened around my girth. She gave me complete access to her back as she leaned further, which was already uncovered by the backless dress she was wearing. But the tightness of her dress was preventing her from reaching her real reward. </p><p>Like any selfless person would do, I decided to help her. My fingers found the complicated knot around her neck, the one that was holding her dress in place, and started to pull it, slowly to not to alarm her. Distracted by the circumstances, she only realized it when her dress started to slide down, her hands too late to prevent its descent, meeting around her chest instead, managing to hide her spectacular breasts before I could get more than a fleeting glimpse. </p><p>She sent an accusing glare at me, but I just nodded towards my lap to remind her of the situation, a slight smile on my face to convey just how ridiculous her reaction was from my perspective. After all, we were about to start a threesome the moment her girlfriend entered the room, not to mention she was getting a preview of the main selling point. “It’s a bit silly, isn’t it,” she said as she let her arms go, revealing her breasts for me to enjoy, adorned by her pointy nipples. </p><p>“I hadn’t said anything,” I answered, and she snorted. But more importantly, when she wrapped her hand around my girth once more, she chose the lower half, reserving the topside for more interesting activities. </p><p>“Do you think Natalie would be angry if I sampled the goods a bit,” she asked once again, her tone begging for a positive response. </p><p>“Of course not,” I answered. “Why would she, after going all the trouble to give you the present you deserve.” </p><p>That small push was enough to help her make the decision she wanted to make all along. She leaned forward in a torturous slowness, so I started to caress her back, hoping the pleasure would make her go faster. She shivered, but picked up speed, until she captured the head of my shaft, celebrated by an enthusiastic moan. </p><p>She stayed like that for a moment before her lips started to dance over my length, accompanied by moans. It wasn’t really pleasurable at first, with her movements choppy and mechanical, making me fear that she was inexperienced in dealing with males, but the skill she was showing started to increase soon after, suggesting that she was just a bit rusty due to her almost-exclusive relationship with Natalie. </p><p>Ignoring the ever-present temptation of pushing her head down for a surprise deepthroat, I let my fingers dance over her back, and she followed the rhythm by increasing the speed she was caressing the lower-half. When her other hand joined the fray, playing with my balls, the pleasure I had been feeling compounded even further. </p><p>I let my fingers to slide even lower, helped by the fact that her dress was already down. After a brief dance around the edge of her breasts, where I distracted myself by feeling her heartbeat on my fingertips, I started to move towards the center, leaving a spiral track behind. Her only response was to increase her speed further.  </p><p>But it wasn’t true for my next action. Continuing their path, my fingers ended around her nipples, which were nice and stiff, begging for my attention. I squeezed it softly, which made her pull back for a moment to let out a moan, only to return her task immediately after. </p><p>I was expecting her to react by pulling back shyly, but it was a fortunate miscalculation. As she returned the task on hand, or more accurately, in her mouth, I used the opportunity to introduce my other hand to the game. </p><p>I put my hand on her knee once more, but this time, climbing upward at a determined pace until I had the total control of her inner thigh. That made her stiffen in alarm, but it wasn’t an alarm that was intense enough to make her pull back from the delicious activity she had been conducting. </p><p>It was a good thing that Jenny was distracted, because it allowed her to miss the fact that her phone had been ringing for the last few minutes, something I noticed when I glanced at her side, where she had put her phone. It was Natalie calling. Luckily, it was in silent mode, so Jenny hadn’t noticed it. </p><p>I checked my own to see a message from Elena, from five minutes ago, informing that Natalie had dropped her at the airport after a long, but ultimately fruitless -for Natalie- flirting session. I pulled away from Jenny’s toned legs for a moment and pushed her phone between couch cushions with a subtle push. I didn’t want Jenny to talk with Natalie until I could seal the deal. I wanted Natalie to come home suspicious but without certainty, only to see the scene of her total defeat with her own eyes. </p><p>But for that, I needed to make her stop the blowjob she was delivering in a torturous slowness, turning more and more intentional as her skills awakened through practice. I decided to use the most enjoyable strategy available, using her pleasure as the weapon of my will. My fingers started to dance on her breasts, compensating their smallness with their sensitivity, while my other hand started to invade higher territories on her leg. Her intensifying moans suggested that I was on the right track. </p><p>I could have pushed her more, of course, but under the circumstances, it was for the best if she took the next step herself. That didn’t mean I would let her stay in the same position for a long time, of course, but thankfully, the removed that need by pulling herself back, her face flushed with pleasure and desire, a dazed look dancing in her eyes. </p><p>Her distracted state was useful for my next step. When I grabbed the skirt of her dress and pulled up, she rose in her seat absentmindedly, allowing me to roll her dress up, revealing the fact that she had chosen a dainty g-string as underwear, which had failed miserably to hide anything after being subjected to her wetness. She raised her arms equally absentmindedly when I pulled the dress off her body. </p><p>That distraction didn’t survive the next step, when I grabbed her arm and pulled her to my lap, letting out a panicked yelp. “Don’t worry, nothing extreme will happen, you still have your panties,” I said, neatly avoiding their unlikely chance of survival. </p><p>“Maybe it’s too much,” she answered worriedly, but her body apparently didn’t share her apprehension, evident by the way she straddled on my lap, directly above my presence, and started grinding. Once again, it wasn’t the most amazing I received, but her clumsy enthusiasm went a long way to compensate for it. </p><p>I didn’t give an answer to her assertion, and she didn’t repeat it, too busy gasping under my attention when I leaned forward and put a lingering kiss on her neck. Her hands wrapped around my neck, pulling me closer, suggesting that her sensitivity wasn’t limited to her nipples. </p><p>Meanwhile, her hips started to pick up the pace, with a speed even greater than I had been expecting. She must have missed the touch of a male even more than I had first assumed. To help her forward, I brought my lips against her nipple, assaulting it with a wet kiss, her moans loud enough to fill the room. </p><p>Deciding to test my luck, I brought my hands to her g-string, carefully holding from both sides before pulling, ripping them off a simple but sharp action. Somehow, she didn’t even notice their disappearance, or too overwhelmed by our naked touch to actually comment on it. </p><p>Without the protection -however limited- of her panties, it was only a matter of time before she caused an accident. It came when I brought my hand on the small of her back, caressing softly. That managed to distract her enough to pull back a bit more than necessary, and a sudden warmth enveloped my length when she moved forward. </p><p>“Oh, no!” she cried, but none of the protest her words implied could be found in her tone. She tried to pull back, but it a weak, listless move, easily prevented by my strategically-placed hand. </p><p>“There is no harm in starting a few minutes early, right?” I asked reassuringly. “And, isn’t it her fault for being this late. She should have hurried back home faster.” </p><p>“I- you think so?” she replied, grabbing my weak excuse with both hands, not even waiting a moment before starting to move back and forth, each repeat pushing me deeper into her tight grasp. </p><p>Since she didn’t need an answer, I hadn’t bothered to give her one, instead, choosing to slide my hand through red strands of her hair, and pulled her head back, making her reveal her eyes, with a hungry excitement dancing in their green depths. I considered capturing her lips with a searing kiss, but decided against, just in case it would make her pull back. I had already won the bet, but I wanted Natalie to see the evidence in her own eyes, which was the reason I was using the living room for it. </p><p>Jenny was jumping on my lap with a reckless abandon, her arms wrapped tight around me when the door opened and Natalie stepped inside, a pose I had arranged to make sure she would miss the initial shock on the face of her girlfriend. </p><p>And what a delicious expression of shock she had. It was the same expression I had seen on her face in the casino, where she had managed to lose all of her personal investments and a significant chunk of company expense accounts due to a miscalculation. Like that night, she stumbled forward silently, trying to process the moment. </p><p>Victory, I mouthed silently, not bothering to hide the sense of superiority I was feeling. </p>
