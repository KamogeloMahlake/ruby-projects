        <p>Laura lay without moving, fulfilled and relaxed in a way she had never experienced before, she could do nothing but murmur dazedly. Even minutes after the explosion, her body was still shaking, something that his presence inside her had not helped at all. The gentle wrap of his muscular arms stayed wrapped around her, making her feel secure in a way she hadn’t felt since she was a young girl. </p><p>At that moment, there was nothing that could penetrate her bubble of comfort. Not her classes, not her obsessive desire to be the first one, something she had developed as a child hoping to control at least one aspect of her life, not the bitter memories of her family both before and after that fateful event that ended with her being disowned. </p><p>“Is it supposed to be this amazing?” she murmured dazedly, but stiffened even as she asked that, cursing herself for her mistake. </p><p>After that amazing encounter, the last thing she should be doing was to remind him about their relative difference, both in age and in experience. She wasn’t stupid enough to miss the fact that their friendship began not because he saw her as an equal, but he pitied her —something she might have taken as an insult if the moment he had picked hadn’t been the lowest point she had experienced in her short college life. At that point, even pity was more than she needed. </p><p>Though, it took a while for her to realize that. At first, she had thought that Mark was humoring her because he needed her help for the classes. He wouldn’t have been the first pseudo-friend that hung around her to mooch off her academic credentials, something she was more than happy to do to pay back. </p><p>Lost in her own perspective, it took an accident to realize it was just another ploy to make her more comfortable. One day, she had a class canceled at the last minute, and went to the library to join Mark, only to saw him working through a worksheet rapidly, while a similar one took almost half an hour the day before. As much as she liked his kindness, she was also frustrated by the evidence he wasn’t seeing her as a friend, but someone to coddle. </p><p>After that, she made sure to maintain a more equal relationship both in terms of accepting his help, and also offering assistance in a way that he might actually find useful. It hadn’t been particularly successful in the past. Her growing attraction toward him didn’t help the situation in any way. </p><p>She was attracted to him, but that was a given. After all, not only he was a sexy older man, but also he was kind and humorous. She had decided to date that annoying hippie, because she was sure that there was no chance he would find her as a valid target for dating, which was the reason she never made any move, until the accidental statement that escaped her lips while she was lamenting yet another failed relationship. </p><p>The fact that she was lying in Mark’s arms, in his bed, his erection still stuffed inside her, stretching her in a way she had never felt before was nothing less than a miracle. </p><p>Which was why she was angry at herself for that offhand question. The moment they just shared was special, and not just because of the spectacular pleasure she had enjoyed. No, it was the first time she had felt like he had treated her like an equal. Her question was perfectly tailored to remind him about their equality. </p><p>As she felt the comforting wrap of his arms unwrapping and his shaft pull back, she couldn’t help but tense, expecting a speech about how much of a mistake it had been considering their age difference, maybe even a subtle jab about her morals for coming to his place wearing only a sexy set of underwear under her coat. </p><p>Lost in her fears, she obediently accepted his touch on her shoulder with her eyes closed, pushing her away and making her turn to face him at the same time. She didn’t want to see his expression, afraid of the patronizing expression she would find… </p><p>Which was why she felt surprised to feel his body heat against her once more, his hands gently grabbing her waist. “Yes,” he whispered with a gentleness that surprised her. “It was special…”  </p><p>She opened her eyes no matter how much she didn’t want to, afraid of finding a patronizing expression. She doubted that she could have handled that. Still, keeping her eyes closed would only validate that she was a scared little girl, afraid to face the reality. She steeled her heart, and opened her eyes, her mind already preparing and cataloging dozens of responses, to be picked for the correct circumstance… </p><p>Only to see Mark’s face, inches away, carrying an unusually serious expression, the kind that turned her blood into flames and her heart into a tornado. “No,” he whispered with uncharacteristic honesty. “It was amazing for me as well.” </p><p>His words burned through her prepared responses like an out-of-control forest fire, leaving her without an answer. Luckily, there was a way for her to respond without relying on any kind of word. She closed in the distance between them and started kissing him. </p><p>It was a soft, lingering kiss, conveying her sudden relief and her elation far better than any words could convey. She put her hands on his shoulder, gently caressing as their tongue danced gently. She moaned in appreciation as the kiss lingered for minutes, before she finally pulled back. </p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured, hoping that her voice could convey everything she wanted to convey. Her gratitude, her happiness, her desire… “Thank you for being such a good teacher, showing me how the pleasure is supposed to feel like…”</p><p>Then, she started pulling back, feeling bittersweet happiness, sad that it came to an end. But before she could properly extract herself, his hands tightened around her waist, keeping her in place. “Where are you going?” he growled, his throaty tone different than his usual kind yet disinterested tone. It was a primal growl that made her bones tremble, and her skin tingle… </p><p>“H-home,” she stammered, not daring to hope that his question meant what she thought it meant. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie,” he answered, his tone still throaty, but the growl was replaced by a smoother tone, though its effect on her was not lessened in any way. “It was just the lesson introduction. The actual class hadn’t even started yet.” </p><p>Laura gasped, unable to believe what she was hearing. Even in the depths of the pleasure, she was sure that it was going to be a one-time thing, something Mark was doing partly as a favor, partly for novelty value. After all, weren’t men famous for their endless appetite for one-night stands. And Mark certainly didn’t look like one that lacked opportunities in that aspect. </p><p>She had never expected him to ask for a repeat, not unless she actually begged for it. She couldn’t answer. This time, it wasn’t about losing her words, as she had many answers dancing in her mind, begging to be let out, but Mark leaned for another kiss, preventing her words from going out. </p><p>This time, it wasn’t a soft, lingering kiss. No, this time, his tongue invaded her mouth, stealing her breath, so much that she barely paid attention to his hands, once again on her shoulder, but this time, rather than pressing her against the bed, he lay on his back and pulled her on top of him. </p><p>Laura was more than happy with the result. After all, while his bed was comfortable, she definitely preferred to feel his muscles under her. She responded to the kiss enthusiastically while he held her tight, nestling her into his arms. She threw a glance toward the full-body mirror, examining their reflection. With their height difference, their position might even be classified as cute, if she had been wearing anything other than a lacy garter belt, and he was wearing something… </p><p>His presence under her was growing, but she didn’t try to take it inside. She wanted to enjoy the kiss from her new position before moving to that step, because, from her recent experience, she knew that once he was inside her, she would lose the control he so thoughtfully bestowed. She ran her hands over his bare chest, trying to commit the lines of his body into her memory in case they only had that night. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean that she couldn’t have some fun while teasing him at the same time. Her hand slid down until her fingers were caressing his erection, throbbing in excitement, moving up and down repeatedly. Whenever she pulled her hand away, she slid down until she was straddling his midsection, grinding in a way that sent shivers to her body, temping her to abandon her little plan. </p><p>She knew that she wasn’t an expert when it came to teasing a man, but Mark’s enthusiastic moans suggested that she wasn’t as bad as she feared as well. Encouraged, she rubbed her body against his even more enthusiasm, her mind busy on how to follow up. Maybe a blowjob, just like she had practiced on an overly large toy she had purchased together with her sexy clothing —though she was surprised to see that Mark had an even bigger one attached to his body— or maybe a unique massage using her breasts —as she had caught his lingering glances to her bosom more than once during their tentative friendship… </p><p>But as Mark growled in satisfaction underneath her, she was confident that her choice, whatever it might be, would be greeted with great enthusiasm. </p><p>Mark was really a great teacher… </p>
