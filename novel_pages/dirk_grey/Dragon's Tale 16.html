        <p>I examined Astrid carefully even as I walked toward her almost-naked figure, her knees on the ground and a shocked expression on her face. I was enjoying the sight of her beautiful breasts, especially since she didn’t even bother covering them. </p><p>Pity that I couldn’t turn my full focus to them, as I had to pay attention to her mood. She was currently stuck between a beautiful mixture of fear, shock, and arousal, and it was my job to lessen the impact of the first two and enhance the last. She was a sexy vixen, the way her crimson hair spilled on her shoulders enough to harden me even if her beautiful tits hadn’t been in the display. However, no much I wanted to push her down and take her, I needed to make sure about the future implications. After all, for the next twenty days, she was my only guide, and I didn’t want to piss her off. </p><p>So, no matter how much she looked like she was ready for the next step, I need to take it slow, no matter how much I wanted my fingers to disappear into the vast expense of her beautiful breasts. I stood in front of her, towering with a great margin since she was still on her knees. “So, you decided to be a little naughty,” I murmured even as I put my finger on her chin, caressing gently while carefully looking for signs of revulsion and reluctance. </p><p>I was happy to see that the expression that bloomed on her face was almost pure desire, though it was soon polluted with other concerns. “I’m sorry, leader,” she murmured. “It’ll never happen again.” </p><p>“Really?” I said. “So, you’re saying that I should just forgive you without a punishment,” I said. I was expecting her to nod, so when she shook her head, it caught me with surprise. “Explain!” I ordered. </p><p>She raised her head, her green eyes burning with desire she was barely able to suppress. Clearly, the show I put through Lillian had worked even better than I had expected. I didn’t know why. Maybe she had lesbian leanings, or maybe she was too excited about the prospect of punishment. Maybe it was a combination of it. Regardless, I was happy with the way her eyes shone. “I deserve the punishment, leader,” she murmured. “Only by internalizing the punishment, I could learn from them.” </p><p>It was a good answer, delivered with conviction. Unfortunately for her, my eyes were too sharp to miss the stiffening of her nipples, nor had I missed the way her legs tightened in a desperate attempt to remember. “Interesting,” I said. “Did the previous leader punished you a lot?” </p><p>“No,” she said, but I could see that there was more to her answer. I gave her a pointed glare, reinforced by a tap of my foot. “He never dared to. His wife, Matron Helena, would have taken his head if he dared to touch anyone else, especially me,” she continued, and I waited a bit more. “It was the matron that punished me.” </p><p>I could see her getting even more aroused the moment she referred at the matron. Since I wasn’t an idiot, I decided to push for that angle. “And how did she punish you?” I asked in a throaty tone, and even let a wisp of mana to escape, giving a sense of pressure over her, betting that she would enjoy it in the context. </p><p>From the way she gasped, I was willing to bet that I was right. “She liked to use a crop,” Astrid murmured. “But never hard enough that a simple healing spell wouldn’t cure the next day. Sometimes she tied me and let me hang, stretching in pain while she caressed my body,” she added. </p><p>How interesting, I thought even as I listened to the little tricks her leader had been applying to my little Astrid. I had to thank Helena for training such a spectacular little bundle of joy, then ship to me untouched. I knew a lot of nobles would have turned their nose at her, preferring their soft and carefully trained pleasure slaves, but even the idea of it was repugnant to me. Sex was enjoyable, but also it was a game. What was the point of playing with an unwilling opponent… Astrid, on the other hand, was perfect. Wild enough to make it dangerous, skilled enough that her presence was not a burden, and with a potential for the magic that if groomed correctly, would make her a minor powerhouse. </p><p>Her beauty, and her delicious reaction to her own tales about her punishments were definitely impressive bonuses though. Maybe I should keep her even after we reached our meeting destination. With Lillian going back to her family, I would definitely need a travel companion. </p><p>“Difficult competition,” I murmured after she finished the full list of punishment she received from her matron Helena. “I guess I need to be creative if I really want to make an impression,” I added even as I caressed her cheek, before suddenly tightening my grip. “Do you agree, sweetie?” I said, my tone much darker than my words. </p><p>She whimpered in a way that indicated a positive response, so I started walking. When I arrived at her back, I forced her arms to her back, using the ripped remains of her top to tie them in place. She whimpered in a way that made my pants uncomfortably tight, so when I walked back in front of her, I decided to show just what she had caused. I grabbed her hair and pulled her close until she was smashed her face against my erection, which, unfortunately, was still in my pants. “My discomfort is your fault,” I whispered. “What are you going to do about it?” </p><p>I loosened my grip around her hair, letting her pull back. Surprisingly, she didn’t pull back, and even more surprisingly, when she opened her mouth, it wasn’t for speaking. Instead, she grabbed the string that was keeping my pants in place with her teeth, and loosened it with a tug. Her movements were choppy and unpracticed, and sexier because of it. When she followed it by pulling down my pants with her teeth, it was a small miracle that I didn’t explode into her face. </p><p>“How about this, leader?” she said even as she pressed her lips against my shaft, now naked, before slowly traveling down, leaving a string of kisses. However, despite her enthusiasm, she wasn’t able to hide the way her eyes widened when she first saw his shaft. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said dismissively, but made sure to smile at her for a moment to remove the sharpness. She was showing great aptitude, so I didn’t want to scare her too much. At my words, she smiled even wider before parting her lips before capturing the head between her beautiful lips, making me moan softly. Her eyes looked proud. </p><p>Unfortunately, the rest of the treatment didn’t go as well. She tried her best, but it was obvious that she wasn’t used to it, or any kind of sexual encounter with men. It wasn’t a problem, of course, as the smoother experience was definitely no substitute for my own untouched —by male hand at least, as Helena’s stories were definitely not just punishment— redheaded barbarian priestess, willing to fulfill my desires. </p><p>“We’re going to move on with the punishment, relax your mouth,” I ordered even as I grabbed her read hair, enjoying her brief moment of panic as I pushed myself deeper into her mouth, stopping as the crown tickled her throat. I stopped there, no matter how much I wanted to push even deeper, not wanting to shock her at the first moment of her experience. </p><p>When I pulled back, the movement was accompanied by a moan from her, and a groan from me. She might be inexperienced, but the sensation of her tongue was simply divine. I pushed back and forth, treating her mouth like a toy, and she just moaned, tempting me to push even deeper into her throat. I didn’t push it in, but only because I had been facing an even greater distraction. </p><p>Her breasts. Her huge, perfectly shaped, perky breasts. </p><p>She let out a disappointed sigh when I pulled my shaft out, only to be replaced by a shocked gasp when I pushed her down. She found herself laying on the floor in an uncomfortable position, with her hands still tied at her back, but it didn’t look like she was bothered by it, not when my shaft took the prestigious position between her breasts, my hands pressing them from the side to create a nice sense of pressure. </p><p>Then, I started moving, our moans mixing together. And it was a spectacular sensation, the warm grasp of her breasts, giving me jolts of pleasure with each push. “Damn, you’re delicious,” I murmured. </p><p>“Thank you, leader,” she moaned even as she lay obediently, her expression of desire thickening with each passing second. She was clearly enjoying the rough treatment I had been subjecting her to. My mind was already dancing around the other possibilities I could subject her to, but it was a pity that we were in the middle of an opening, with a hurry to disappear. Even the current break we were taking was rather excessive considering the circumstances, but my desire needed a release. </p><p>She must have released my urgency from the way I sped between her tits, so she leaned forward until she captured the crown between her lips, her tongue dancing furiously at the top. “Good girl,” I said in appreciation, enjoying her display of initiative. The small shudder that went through her body at the compliment hadn’t gone unnoticed as well. </p><p>She was deliciously submissive. </p><p>I decided to give Helena a lavish gift if we ever had the opportunity to meet —assuming she wasn’t already dead due to coup— because she had gone such trouble to train Astrid to my specifications while also leaving her untouched. I really owed her one. </p><p>Wanting to test Astrid’s limits, I decided to slap her breast softly, only to receive the loudest moan yet. “Excellent,” I murmured in appreciation even as I slapped her other breast, this time hard enough for the slap to echo between the trees, and her only reaction was sucking my shaft even more enthusiastically. </p><p>No matter the changes I had gone through, I was still only a human, and constantly sliding between the tits of a redheaded beauty while the said beauty’s lips were clasped around the crown was impossible to resist. Especially when each spank to said spectacular breasts made her moan even harder. </p><p>I pulled back just before I exploded, leaving her confused for a fleeting moment before I started spraying, covering her breasts and her face with a thick layer of my seed. The expression of aroused surprise on her face made me laugh. “Good girl,” I muttered once more upon seeing that she was licking her lips obediently. </p><p>I felt relaxed, but after that display, she deserved a release of her own as well. I grabbed her arms and gently pulled her on her feet, then sat to a nearby rock and pulled her to my knee. “Open your legs,” I ordered, and she did so immediately, allowing me to easily slide my fingers into her underwear, which was already sopping wet. My fingers danced at her wet entrance, and she moaned and gasped, which, unfortunately, had the effect of resurrecting my hard-on. Pity that we didn’t have the time to enjoy that. </p><p>I grabbed her still bound hands and pulled them hard, and the jolt of pain pushing her toward the edge. She climaxed with an earth-shattering moan, and started trembling on my lap. I wrapped an arm around her waist, but still leaving her tied up as she enjoyed the aftershocks of her orgasm. </p><p>“Fix yourself, and keep a watch on Lillian,” I said even as untied her hands. She stood up, but her legs were still trembling. “I’m going to find a good spot for camping, and maybe even hunt a bit if I can arrange it.” After a moment’s thought, I added one last order. “And try not to antagonize Lillian too much before I return. I don’t want you two fighting without me to keep it from going out of hand.”  </p><p>“Of course, leader,” she said, the last word once again underlined with arousal and desire. I didn’t know if it was desperation, my impressive magical display, or the pleasure she had just experienced, but she was being very enthusiastic about accepting her new lot in life. </p><p>More power for me, I supposed. </p><p>I would have liked to stay and watch Astrid as she washed her face and chest to clean herself from my seed, but I already had a raging boner, and didn’t trust myself to maintain control. And if I lost control, we would have ended up without a good camping spot, meaning we would be exhausted the next day. </p><p>Luckily, it took less than five minutes for me to find a well-concealed location with a small river nearby, with plenty of fish to enjoy. When I returned, I was met with the sight of Lillian and Astrid facing each other, glaring daggers at each other. The fact that Astrid’s chest was still covered in my cum and Lillian’s panties were still dislodged made the situation even sexier. My erection was resurrected in an instant. I decided to listen to their argument, curious whether Astrid would be able to keep her moans under control. </p><p>“I’m not going to say it again,” Lillian said angrily. “Stay away from Marcus, he’s mine.” </p><p>“Really?” Astrid said, before pointing at her breasts that were still covered with my marks. “Those seem to disagree.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” Lillian answered sharply, too sharply even. The way her arms rose to her own chest protectively told me that she was feeling some jealousy under the circumstances, an understandable feeling. As a whole package, Lillian was as impressive as Astrid, but in the chest department, she was horrendously outmatched. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter. He’s going to go back with me in a month, so the only way you could follow him was to accept a position as a slave.” She smirked evilly, but it somehow made her even sexier. “And I would enjoy having you as our slave.” </p><p>Astrid wasn’t flapped by her statement. “Are you sure he’s going to go back with you,” she stated confidently. “From what I had seen, he seems like he’s enjoying his freedom despite the challenges.” </p><p>“It’s a passing fancy,” she said with a wave of her hand. “He might have some problems back at home, but it’s nothing my family can’t solve.” Lillian giggled. “They will do their best to help my future husband.” </p><p>“I see,” Astrid murmured despondently, not happy with Lillian’s last words, before a sudden realization hit her. “Wait, does he know about the husband part?” </p><p>“W-what?” Lillian stammered, blushing furiously. “N-yes, maybe, it doesn’t matter anyway,” she rapidly spat out, frustrated. Astrid smiled at her in a superior manner. “Why do you care anyway,” Lillian sniped. “It’s not like he’s going to marry a barbarian trash like you.” </p><p>Unlike what Lillian intended, Astrid took her assault in stride. “Of course not,” Astrid said in a matter of fact tone. “He’s extraordinary. Brave and strong, and while forceful, he’s also kind and caring. I can never hope to hold a position of equality. My best hope would be to be a mistress, but I would settle to be a bedwarmer.” </p><p>“You worthless slut,” Lillian gasped. “You’re just going to throw your body at him to stay with him.” </p><p>“And it’s different from what you’re doing, how?” Astrid answered. “Also, don’t forget that you’re the idiot that forced me to dress like this, making me get his attention. Do you think he would have noticed me in my previous clothes,” she added, giving her one last smug smile before walking away. </p><p>Lillian’s expression of shock was beautiful. Astrid’s last comment wasn’t accurate, of course. Even in those clothes, she was a delicious vixen, and it was a matter of time I seduced her. At most, it would have delayed things a day. Still, it was masterfully delivered to unsettle Lillian. </p><p>I stayed hidden, watching the girls silently mend their clothes, clean, and dress, finding their half-naked chores enticing. </p><p>When I returned to the opening and informed them about the camping spot, their answers were calm and subdued, but their eyes burned bright as they planned to resolve their argument in a different way while camping. </p><p>I was very excited about the prospect… </p>
