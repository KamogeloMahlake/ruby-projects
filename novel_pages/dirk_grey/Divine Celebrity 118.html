        <p>As it turned out, it took only seconds for her to realize the absurdity of her suggestion. She caught my eye as I walked, hesitant, so I did my best to push an expression of hesitant discomfort on my face, hoping that her pride and vindictiveness would be enough to keep her committed to this absurd idea. </p><p>I walked around her once more, and stood on her back. She said nothing, which was all I could have hoped for. She shuffled in discomfort as I put my hands on her body, and if I dared to directly grab her breasts, I had no doubt that she would have been alarmed. </p><p>My hands were on her back, right at the area her bra had been covering earlier, the safest spot to further sell my aura of hesitancy. Moreover, I wasn’t above cheating, and continued to flood her back with my healing energies — though more was a relative term, as it was still just a warmth to provide comfort, nothing compared to the flood that I had given to the poor tortoise I had brought back from the dead. </p><p>“Ahh,” she gasped as I massaged the only point I hadn’t rubbed before, dealing with the knots there, her arms twitching up and down as she tried to decide whether to cover her breasts or not. </p><p>Ultimately, she did not, giving me a chance to continue my massage while enjoying the glorious sight of her caramel skin unobstructed. My only pity was that she was still wearing the pants off her suit, depriving me of her legs, which were doubtlessly as amazing as her breasts — which made it very easy to handle that particular ‘disappointment’,</p><p>I continued with my massage, feeling her relax under my touch … which was exactly what I needed to push for more — but not without another trickery. “What do you think about this scheme, I’m particularly proud of it,” I said as she moved to a new printout. Of course, I was aware that she was just looking emptily at the last few schemes and putting her signature, but she didn’t know that I knew, which allowed me to use that to trick her. </p><p>“In what way?” she asked, her automatic response tinged with a touch of fear, understandable as despite looking at the paper for twenty seconds, she didn’t even bother tracing even the simplest aspect. </p><p>Her question was about the invitation I needed. I reached over her shoulder — which allowed me to get a much better view of her breasts, especially when she hesitantly raised her head, making the view even more beautiful, her pouty lips trembled with hesitation tempting me to dip down and steal them. </p><p>Pity, it was too much. </p><p>Instead, I put my finger on the paper, and started explaining. “The trick of this play relies on the location of the Running back. It looks like a standard rush from the interior, but he’s too far away. At first, it’ll look like a simple mistake, but then he’ll take a fake step, and take an outside route. With the tight ends blocking …” I said, explaining the plan in great detail. </p><p>Unnecessarily so, at least in terms of tactics. When it came to the massage, it had a different objective. Even as I leaned forward, my left hand stayed on her back, moving in a manner that I tried to convince her that it was absentminded as I ‘lost’ myself explaining my tricky play and all of its variations. </p><p>At the same time, my careless caresses started dragging me to other places. The side of her body at first, teasing spots that I hadn’t touched earlier, the movement slowly drifting away from methodical and turning erotic… She tensed at the change, and even sent a hesitant glance up. </p><p>I was not bad at acting, but I had a feeling that it was her own growing pleasure that worked to convince her rather than my skills. After all, the stress she had been under for the last few days had been … painful, and suddenly replaced that with pleasure, especially through a literal magical massage. </p><p>Even for a strong-willed, no-nonsense woman like my sexy coach, it was too much. After all, she had needs. </p><p>So, when my fingers drifted to the side of her breasts, her lack of any kind of complaint was very noticeable despite its inactive nature. I acted like I hadn’t noticed that even as my fingers started dancing at the edge, and I felt her shuffle. </p><p>“The chair is very uncomfortable,” she muttered after, trying to convince me that the shuffle was about anything but the pleasure that was slowly invading her body, which wasn’t particularly convincing. </p><p>Especially since, even as she shuffled, she made sure not to move her upper body much, like she was afraid of scaring my fingers from their task, still under the impression that the reveal was too much for me. </p><p>Clearly, she didn’t know much about the gossip about what I had been doing back in the den if she was buying my shyness this much. </p><p>I was tempted to dissuade her of this notion, but after some consideration, I decided against it. Instead, I pulled my fingers back to the safer spots first — amused by her tensing when I pulled back — before letting my hand drift down, caressing her smooth stomach, one that showed she had been spending most of her time in the gym not only training others, but also herself as well. </p><p>The whimper escaped her mouth when my hand climbed ups, caressing her breasts once more, this time from underneath her breasts, enjoying her trembling as I did so. Her body tensed even more, giving me the tell-tale sign of an upcoming orgasm, not immediate, but then, not too far away either. </p><p>Time to shift gears. </p><p>“You must be really suffering from the weight, let me help you properly,” I whispered as I leaned down, my tone suddenly not hesitant, but throaty and erotic. </p><p>She was shocked by the sudden change in my tone — though, admittedly, her shock might have something to do with my hands landing on her breasts, squeezing hard. </p><p>I squeezed hard, but it was not a reckless move. The extended teasing session taught me a lot about how she reacted to my touch, and the touch was just strong enough to flood her body with pleasure. </p><p>Enough that, when she opened her mouth, what escaped was a beautiful moan that filled the room. Her beautiful chocolate eyes widened in shock,  but even as she desperately pressed her lips together, I continued mauling her breasts, enjoying their perfection recklessly.</p><p>An amazing way to spice up a boring meeting, I decided. </p><p>For a minute, she said nothing, her head dipping down to hide her beautiful face even as I squeezed her breasts repeatedly, each moment enhancing her pleasure more. She battled against the sensation, but with her nipples between my finger, being squeezed repeatedly, she didn’t have much chance. </p><p>She raised her head soon, giving me a helpless glance, begging … though whether to stop or continue was a mystery. </p><p>And I was more than happy to use that ambiguity for my benefit, and continued teasing her breasts. I was initially planning to add another layer, but as I played with them, I realized she was even more sensitive than I expected, and decided to embrace the challenge of teasing her endlessly. </p><p>Each touch made her shiver more. </p><p>Her gaze got more and more intense. “Ill …” she managed to whisper as her anger flashed on her face, realizing I had been playing her earlier, interrupted by a moan.  </p><p>I decided to retaliate. After all, her actions were hardly innocent. “Come on, Coach,” I whispered throatily. “Come on, my beautiful Coach. What could I do after you went and revealed those amazing breasts to me? I’m only human.” </p><p>Her blush was spectacular. </p><p>“That was—” she whispered, pausing to let out a moan as I chose that moment to twist her nipple. “That was an accident,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, reflecting disbelief — which was fake, as I knew it was my own magical accident that triggered it. “What about after then, when you didn’t even bother covering these amazing wonders?” I followed, letting my fingers dig into her breasts, as if there was any chance of misunderstanding what I was referring to in the first place. </p><p>That, she failed to answer. After all, even with the way I had been acting, there was no doubt about the true nature of her actions. She was the one that chose to weaponize her spectacular breasts for amusement, and a good massage was hardly a valid excuse. </p><p>Yet, shame was a beautiful aphrodisiac, and, combined with my treatment, she started trembling with the orgasm. The pleasure invaded her … but even with her moans, I could feel that she would retaliate against her earlier loss … and it would certainly not be sexual. </p><p>So, I chose to beat a hasty retreat. “Feel free to finish the rest of the plays in your own time, Coach,” I said as I pulled back, and when she realized what happened, I was already at the door. “I’ll visit to pick the signed plays tomorrow evening,” I said. </p><p>She froze, still unable to process her explosive orgasm… “And, don’t play games if you’re not ready to lose, I might not be merciful the next time,” I said before slamming the door behind me. </p><p>Did teasing her made any sense from a sense of safety? No. But sometimes, the temptation was too strong to deny. </p><p>I couldn’t wait until our next encounter… </p>
