        <p>As I watched Aria walked closer carefully, trying not to spill the tea, her every step riding her short black negligee up to reveal her absolute lack of underwear, I finally made my mind about how to progress. Since she had already shown such a beautiful initiative to look sexy, I decided to let her take the lead for a while. </p><p>“Thank you, sweetheart,” I said even as I leaned forward and grabbed the tea, using the proximity to place a gentle kiss on her lips. Wearing that sexy nightie was already given her a nice full-body blush, but the intensity was nothing compared to the one that blossomed when our lips touched. </p><p>“It’s nothing compared to the delicious breakfast you prepared for me,” she whispered even as she leaned and put the tray on the bedside table —and treating me with the amazing sight of her hips as her nightie rode upward— before she took her own cup, and sat next to me in her bed, but with a foot of distance between our bodies. </p><p>Silence stretched as we drank our teas in a surprisingly domestic scene. I focused on enjoying the high-quality tea, acting like I hadn’t noticed as Aria slowly scooted closer whenever I closed my eyes. Her shyness, overwhelming even when she was daring enough to change into such a sexy piece, made her much cuter. </p><p>In a sexy way, of course. </p><p>I consumed my tea slowly to give her the chance to break through her shyness and take action. With every sip, she slid closer. First, our arms touched, then pressed against each other. She was restless, playing with her hair and shuffling in her place alternatingly. However, despite her slow pace, her leg was firmly pressing against mine as I took the last sip from the tea. </p><p>“The tea was delicious-” I started, only to be interrupted in a shocking manner. My words were cut short by a pair of hot lips, carrying the taste of honeyed tea, pressing much stronger than I had been expecting. As much as I wanted to slip my tongue to get a more direct taste of that delicious aroma, I kept myself back. It was Aria’s time to shine. </p><p>And shine, she did. </p><p>She didn’t waste any time before she climbed on my lap, with only my pants to limit contact thanks to her noticeable absence of underwear. Her lips danced bravely, and soon, her hips joined to our little game, rocking back and forth. I wanted to pull her tight against my chest, to see whether her delicate nightie could survive the sudden pressure. </p><p>Luckily, while I battled with that desire, she had acted. Her fingers latched on my shirt, unbuttoning it with a surprising aggressiveness. It seemed that, with her initial reticence gone, she was going to be much more active than I expected. </p><p>Not that I complained. As I put my hand on the small of her back gently, her soft finger was already caressing my naked chest after pulling open my shirt. Luckily, with her lips still firmly against mine, I hadn’t needed to consider the relative merits of silence versus trying to encourage her further. </p><p>Not that it seemed to be necessary. She was doing an amazing job. I hadn’t even needed to pull her closer, because she put her whole weight behind the movement as she moved forward, her breasts pressing tightly against the broadness of my chest, her silk nightie too thin to reduce the impact in any way. And she continued to grind against me, making me get bigger and harder. </p><p>As her hips picked up speed, I couldn’t help but let my hands allow more adventure. One of my hands moved gently down her back, caressing the small of her back before resting on her ass outside her nightie. She said nothing, but continued rocking against my crotch. I decided to stay limited to there. </p><p>Unfortunately, my hands seemed to have a different idea, and went too far. They slipped under the already high hem of her nightie, cupping her naked ass. Luckily, that didn’t trigger her shyness, but instead, she started to move even more, her every move electric. </p><p>Lost in the moment, she barely registered as my hand moved up, caressing her waist before arriving at the underside of her breast, caressing tantalizingly. My move naturally pushed her nightie up as well, slowly converting her near-nakedness into total-nakedness. </p><p>She pulled back from the kiss, letting out a sharp breath in the process. However, before I could even properly consider whether I pushed too much, her fingers hooked around my pants, pulling them down with an aggressiveness that surprised both of us. </p><p>I was so turned on. </p><p>Her move pulled her delicious breasts away from my hands, but luckily, that didn’t really matter when she suddenly grabbed the front of her nightie and tugged, the soft silk failing to resist even for a fleeting moment before parting with a soft whisper, leaving her naked breasts to my view. </p><p>Just like that, she slid back on my lap, trapping my length between her thighs, her wetness covering the topside of my length. She leaned forward, but with another important change. This time, rather than silencing me with her lips, she chose to use her delicious bosom. </p><p>Being buried in the amazing expanse of her soft tits, especially when I was enjoying the softness of her bed, was not too much different from being in heaven. I displayed my eagerness as my lips closed around her engorged nipple, sucking and biting for a while before starting to kiss their wide expanse. </p><p>They tasted amazing, and the fact that her hips didn’t even stagger during their delicious grind made it much tastier. As I alternated between soft kisses and naughty bites to mark the borders of her treasure, she moaned helplessly. She looked extremely sexy as she threw her head back, moaning repeatedly. And the fact that she was still wearing the scraps of her nightie made it even sexier than she would have been if she had been naked. </p><p>After a lengthy delay, she moved, once again initiating a kiss as tits once again pressed against my chest, this time without the barrier of her nightie. Meanwhile, I cupped her ass once again, helping her as she moved back and forth on my lap. Technically, my determination was to avoid taking initiative and letting her do whatever she wanted, but my fingers rebelled once again, finding her wet entrance to tease her knob, only for her tongue to go wild in my mouth. </p><p>Luckily, she just leaned against my fingers, allowing my thick fingers to slip inside her, adding another source of pleasure to our extended foreplay. It was hard to believe that she was just a shy virgin just a few days ago… </p><p>I pushed my finger deeper and deeper, and it didn’t take long before I added a second one to my surprise assault, something that was greatly appreciated by her. She sped up in response, paying back my efforts with delicious pleasure. </p><p>Then, without saying anything, she moved back, leaving both my lips and my fingers idle. I caught her gaze with a questioning expression, only for her to smile shyly. However, I didn’t feel concerned, because it wasn’t her usual shy smile. It failed to hide the arousal bubbling underneath. </p><p>“It looks painful,” she murmured. It was clearly an excuse to touch my shaft, but with her soft fingers wrapped around my shaft to massage, I wasn’t in a position to care about her overreliance on excuses. Her fingers moved, starting from the base and started climbing upward. However, that didn’t stop her from leaning forward. </p><p>Her lips landed on the crown of my shaft as a gentle kiss before leaving a trailing lick on the side. As she did so, her naked tits pressed against my thighs, creating a spectacular sight. Then, things got even better as she engulfed the head in a wet, sloppy kiss, while her hands continued to work on the base. </p><p>Her tongue joined the fray as she swallowed the first couple of inches of my length as she continuously massaged the base. Her hands stroked my length repeatedly, twisting and stroking up and down, showing a spectacular instinct to give pleasure. My hips buckled as the pleasure hit. </p><p>I let my hands fall on her shoulders before traveling down, caressing the sides of her breasts to pay back for her selfless service. I didn’t hold her head to push her down, but it turned out to be unnecessary. Her mouth parted wide as her movement range extended, swallowing half of my length without the slightest hesitation. </p><p>She was truly learning. </p><p>As she continued, I bit my lips, trying to suppress my instincts to grab her head and skewer her aggressively. She earned that much with her enthusiasm, no matter how much her slow play frustrated me. I felt like a king, enjoying the service of my concubine before going to my throne… Well, considering I was being serviced by the crown princess of the Empire, it wasn’t a completely inaccurate impression. </p><p>It was even more pronounced when considering who had been taking that particular role the last night.</p><p>I just leaned back, enjoying the softness of the pillows as my smoking hot little blonde Princess lay on top of me, wearing nothing but scraps of sexy black sleepwear, her every erotic spot on display, sucking me like a true champion. </p><p>She moved deeper and deeper, her muffled moans mixing with mine as her grip tightened around my thighs, trying to use them as leverage. With every repeat, she was getting quicker and quicker, with the occasional gag or wheeze not even slowing her down. </p><p>She was hungry for the explosion… </p><p>Her nose started to caress my skin when I finally felt the familiar signs of an explosion. I could have kept it contained, but after she worked so hard for it without prompting, I decided to reward her. </p><p>My climax triggered, and suddenly, there was a huge rush of liquid traveling across my length before exploding in her mouth before traveling down her throat. She did her best to swallow it, licking the occasional drop that slipped from her lips. </p><p>She withdrew only after making sure that she had got every last drop. She didn’t bother to stand up, just slid upward and snuggled into my lap, her body softer than any blanket. I wrapped her with my muscular arms as she let her head rest on my chest, creating another sickeningly-sweet domestic scene as we tried to catch our breath… </p><p>I wasn’t exactly idle at this point, gently caressing her back, but occasionally slipping to massage her tits, their perfection as fascinating as usual. She started kissing my neck before sliding down to my chest, drawing the silhouette of my muscles with the ghosts of her kisses. </p><p>All that needed was to decide what to do next… </p>
