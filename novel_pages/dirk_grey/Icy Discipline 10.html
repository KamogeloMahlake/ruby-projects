        <p>As Carly pushed forward, an unbelievable tightness wrapped around my shaft, one that was far superior to her earlier little flare, making me throb in excitement. </p><p>“Ohh,” she moaned as she continued to push after a brief pause, one that marked her graduation from virginity, the temptation overwhelming. Though, even that brief pause was the closest I got to actual torture, my mind filled with a desire to push forward, to complete the process spectacularly. </p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t the only one dealing with an overwhelming wave of arousal, and despite the discomfort of the unfamiliar presence and her spectacular tightness, she didn’t waste any time before started rocking back and forth, her beautiful face giving me a range of expressions, each more beautiful than the last. </p><p>Accompanied by her moans, of course, loud enough to hurt my eardrums, but I was more than happy to listen to them. </p><p>Despite the explosive show she was putting on, she was barely able to take a fraction of my length inside her, though considering she was a virgin just a minute ago, I was willing to let that slide. </p><p>So, I suppressed the temptation to push forward recklessly and teach her the real meaning of fun, letting her get acquainted with the process first. </p><p>After all, that cursed storm was at least useful for something. </p><p>That didn’t mean I was entirely passive. I wanted to kiss her pouty lips, but not as much as I wanted to continue listening to her desperate moans. I compromised by leaning forward, and started raining kisses on her neck with an intensity that would rival the blizzard outside. </p><p>It made her moans get even more intense, though, amusingly, her eyes stayed closed. The movement of her hips, on the other hand, changed. </p><p>They were still steady and rhythmic, shockingly so considering her inexperience, but I assumed all the modeling experience gave her the ability to move steadily even under unfamiliar situations. </p><p>Such as lying under me, desperately trying to take more of my shift inside her. </p><p>Of course, steady didn’t mean monotone. As her familiarity increased, her movement started to change in two ways. One, her speed continued to increase, teasing me faster and faster. And two, her movements devoured more and more as she slowly got used to the sensation. </p><p>Luckily, our extended foreplay worked wonders to enhance her wetness to a spectacular degree, turning the process into a smooth adventure.  </p><p>I didn’t just enjoy her rocking passively for long. Soon, she parted her legs invitingly and raised her hips, wordlessly asking me to start moving. </p><p>Who was I to reject her beautiful demand, I thought as I pushed my hips forward, meeting with her movement, invading her wetness aggressively. Her response was to moan even louder, which made me quicken my beat. </p><p>I was still careful not to hurt her too much, letting her get used to the pace. She wrapped her arms around me, pulling me deeper inside with greater urgency. </p><p>“Are you sure, sweetie?” I said rather than following her wordless demand immediately. </p><p>“Yes,” she whispered, the contrast between her explosive moans and her barely audible whisper making me chuckle. It was funny watching how her selective shyness worked.  </p><p>“Can you speak louder, sweetie?” I asked, enjoying the way she avoided my gaze. “I can’t hear you.” </p><p>It took a moment for her to answer, and even then, it was barely louder than her first attempt. “Faster, please. Do it … faster.” </p><p>“Who am I to reject the request of a supermodel, I’m here to serve,” I said teasingly, but if she had any problems with my teasing, I didn’t hear because the moment I finished my words, I leaned forward, capturing her beautiful lips in a searing kiss. </p><p>As I did so, my hands landed on her shoulders, pinning her in place, and my hips started to move much harder. </p><p>She reacted by wrapping her legs around my waist, once again showing the extent of her surprising strength, imprisoning me inside her. I could have escaped if I wanted, but it wouldn’t be an easy challenge. </p><p>Fortunately, escaping was not something I wanted to do in the first place. </p><p>Her moans rose once more as my hands slid away from her shoulders to her breasts, once again exploring their great expanse. And, their great sensitivity hardly helped her to resist the pleasure. </p><p>Her tightening declared her climax, and her trembling showed the growing impact… </p><p>I pulled back from the kiss, mostly to listen to her gasps and moans without any interruption, her cries more beautiful than the greatest song.</p><p>Giving our next-door neighbor a lesson in singing… </p><p>Yet, her climax wasn’t a reason for me to stop, but intensify my rhythm. I slid my hands to her hips, raising them a bit more before I started drilling mercilessly, finally truly invading her depths. </p><p>It was a touch uncomfortable, adding a layer of pain to her cries, but her gaze showed that she had no problems with that addition — which wasn’t entirely surprising after her reaction to spanking and her internalized obedience.  </p><p>Maybe I should send a bouquet to her agent. She had managed to train Carly excellently — unaware that a freak accident would deliver her to a horny scientist. </p><p>And, the addition of pain worked wonders to keep her awake under the rush of pleasure. </p><p>Though, even with that, I was surprised by the first words she managed to utter after her explosive climax. “Harder,” she begged. </p><p>If I was in a different mood, her reaction might have surprised me, but as the pleasure invaded my brain, I just smirked in anticipation. “As you wish,” I said as I grabbed her hips, and started drilling her mercilessly. </p><p>The sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room, my grunts mixing with her moans as our fun turned into something explosive… Something overwhelming… </p><p>Yet, as I felt an awakening of my vigor, ready to turn into something physical, I didn’t slow down. We were well past the point of savoring the experience. It was time for a desperate rush toward the finish line. </p><p>“It feels … amazing!” Carly shouted recklessly, lucky that we were literally the most deserted part of the world, with only one person to hear our commotion. I had no problems with Maria listening to our show — though I had a feeling Carly had just forgotten about that part. </p><p>As I looked at her beautiful face, contorted with pleasure, I guessed even remembering her own name would require a monumental effort. </p><p>As Carly stretched her lungs to the limit to leverage the lack of civilization, I just moved faster and faster, trying to stretch the pleasure to the limit before the inevitable end arrived. </p><p>One that wasn’t particularly distant. </p><p>As that moment knocked, I straightened my posture, catching a sight of her beautiful figure, her skin flushed, her mouth wide with moans, her eyes filled with pleasure… </p><p>Her beautiful tits dangling freely with each push, stroking my desire even further…</p><p>And just like that, I wasn’t as angry as the ruined experiment. I doubted that I would share that opinion once the pleasure was replaced by exhaustion, but at that moment, it was impossible for anyone to choose science over the beautiful blonde busy climbing toward her second climax. </p><p>“I’m cumming,” I warned her despite my desire to fill inside her without a warning, giving her that choice. But, when her only response came in the form of her tightening legs, I didn’t try to change her mind as well. </p><p>She was a big girl, and she could make her own decisions. </p><p>Even if those decisions were extremely poor — not that I could blame her, as it was hardly a better decision from my end. </p><p>And just like that, I filled her to the brim, the invasion of the warmth enough to trigger an even more spectacular climax in her… </p><p>I tightened my grip on her hips to prevent myself from collapsing under the greatest pleasure I had ever felt, enjoying the desperate tightening of her walls, trying to milk the last drop off me. </p><p>“So, how well did you enjoy our services in the Antarctic hotel,” I whispered mockingly after a few desperate breaths as I collapsed next to her. </p><p>No answer came, which was rude. I looked at her, to see whether she deserved a little spanking after our little adventure… </p><p>Only to see her breathing softly, unconscious, overwhelmed by pleasure. </p><p>“Not bad for her first time,” I said as I pulled the cover on us before hugging her, closing my eyes, the sound of the storm raging outside just a lullaby to my ears… </p><p>Maybe I should continue the sleep that been interrupted rudely…</p>
