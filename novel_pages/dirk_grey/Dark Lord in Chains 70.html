        <p>“You earned a proper reward,” I whispered to the beautiful queen, her eyes still wide after our searing kiss. </p><p>“Really?” she gasped, the hopeful tone of her voice especially beautiful. </p><p>I said nothing else as I grabbed her skirt, pushing it down to finally reveal her naked body to my anticipatory gaze, leaving the chains around her wrists as the only piece of coverage on her beautiful body — through a couple of inches around her forearm could hardly be counted as obstructing her amazing beauty. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I wasn’t tempted to continue teasing her despite her surrender, driving the idea even deeper into her psyche before I finally buried myself in her wetness, but three things worked against that path. First, with everything going on, I needed to discuss a lot of boring politics with her, forcing me to spend my time more effectively. Second, she had finally folded, and it was certainly worthy enough for her to get a reward. </p><p>Third, even with everything that happened, it was very hard to resist the temptation of her busty body when she was chained against the wall, her magic blocked, quivering with unmet desire. </p><p>After all, I was only human. </p><p>“About the reward,” I whispered even as I put my hands on her knees, slowly widening them. “You need to take a big breath and relax, Your Majesty. I cannot do my job if you are too tense" I said, acting like her state had nothing to do with me.</p><p>Sapphire froze for a moment, her lips parting open. I expected her to mention the exact point and blame me for her extended torture, only to be surprised pleasantly. “As … as you wish,” she whispered throatily as her legs widened, revealing her beautiful core for me. </p><p>I couldn’t help but look down in delight, though that expression slowly turned to awe as I slowly turned my gaze up, first catching her beautiful breasts heaving with her every breath, then her face, colored with absolute surrender. </p><p>“Too beautiful,” I whispered, which added another blush on her face, though different than the current pinkness of her body, underlined by shyness rather than desire. It was beautiful, because even just a couple of days ago, she would have been feeling fear and horror if she had been at this exact point, yet at the moment, the only thing she longed for was my touch. </p><p>Sometimes, I was truly awed by my own achievements. </p><p>I knelt down to get an even better view of her wetness, slowly leaning forward. “Now, let’s reward you,” I whispered as my tongue darted out, brushing against her core. </p><p>The moan that she let out threatened to break the walls of our little prison cell. </p><p>“Calm down, beautiful, it’s just a start,” I said, and my tongue darted out once more, brushing against her softness again to create another beautiful moan, this time even louder. </p><p>“I … I can’t help,” she murmured while I treated her wetness to slow yet sensual service, feeling a beautiful mixture of victory and a sense of worship at the beauty. </p><p>“You should,” I whispered back, enjoying the way her body started to tremble faster and faster with each measured brush of my tongue. My initial intention was to tease her slowly, in a measured manner, building another proper climax before exploding, but against the beauty of her bare pussy, those plans soon turned into ashes and cinder, replaced by a desire to bring her to a quick completion. </p><p>“That’s a good Queen,” I whispered as I put my hand on her inner thighs, parting her beautiful legs even further before letting my tongue cut loose, aggressively dancing around her knob for a while before dipping down to her wetness, filling my heart with desire and arousal. </p><p>Under the intense assault of my tongue, she drove steadily closer to an explosion, until her whole body clenched, and her juices started to flow. Then, a tremble so hard hit her body that her legs lost all their power, and she started collapsing despite the chains, helping her to hold her weight if she had used it properly. </p><p>I was quick to grab her waist, preventing painful collusion. “Don’t worry, Your Majesty,” I whispered into her ear even as I felt her weight over my body, happy to take that particular burden. “I’ll hold you.” </p><p>As she trembled, I pressed my lips over her neck, alternating between kisses and soft bites, leaving my mark. After all, she was mine, and there was no harm leaving physical evidence of it. Her soft yet appreciative moans suggested she didn’t have a particularly strong objection against the idea either. </p><p>“So,” I whispered into her ear as her trembles slowly subsided, breaking her reverie. </p><p>Her body jumped slightly, the familiar voice enough to remind her of the exact situation she was in. Yet, she didn’t try to pull back from my hug, showing just how far she accepted the idea of standing next to the same Dark Lord that had been her prisoner just a few days ago. </p><p> There was no doubt that she was hyper-aware of my presence next to her as our bodies rubbed against each other, her skin softer than silk. </p><p>I wanted to match her on the state of undress, but I didn’t want to stop hugging her beautiful body. Luckily, magic was useful for more things than escaping prisons and fighting against difficult odds, I thought as I flared my mana, which turned into a simple spell to remove all of my clothes simultaneously without forcing me to change position. </p><p>And Sapphire’s eyes widened at the display of power. Although the effect of the little magical trick was simple, achieving it without using any kind of pre-designed spell structure required quite a bit of finesse. Yet I achieved it easily despite my hands full with her beautiful body. </p><p>There was no harm in the occasional display of strength to remind her she had made the correct choice. Loyalty was something that needed to be nurtured carefully, supported by a combination of awe, desire, rewards, and the possibility of punishment. </p><p>“What do you want to do next, Your Majesty,” I whispered, still deliberately using her title, though, at this point, I didn’t even need to put a diminutive edge on my tone to make it a mocking reference. After all, her earlier declaration of obedience did that excellently. </p><p>“I…” she whispered, suddenly shy as the monumental nature of her earlier declaration hit her now that her mind wasn’t occupied by an overwhelming thickness of pleasure. Yet, she made no attempt to take her words back, or alter our deal by adding conditions. </p><p>Good Queen, indeed. </p><p>“Let me give you a few examples,” I whispered as I shifted slightly, lifting her up as I brought my face at the same level with her beautiful breasts, and my lips parted once more, this time to capture her erect nipples in their war prison. </p><p>Sapphire gasped as I started nibbling the hardened texture of her beautiful nipples, enjoying their gentle trembles. “Maybe,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>“No need to hurry,” I answered as I pulled back momentarily, using the opportunity to leer at her beautiful breasts from a close encounter. “As you know, we have a lot of options. Let me give you a few more before you make up your mind.” </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned, her voice enough to make my naked shaft throb in anticipation, but I managed to suppress my desire to abandon our little game and slide inside her aggressively.  </p><p>One of my hands landed on her thigh, gently caressing to awaken waves of passion through her body. “It’s also an option,” I whispered as my fingers climbed up, caressing her entrance softly. Uncontrollably, she tilted her head back, her eyes closed as she let out a small moan, showing she was more than happy with the option. I smirked as I pulled my fingers back.  “Although, after our latest dance, it would be too repetitive.” </p><p>“T-there’s is no harm in repetition,” she managed to gasp between her quickened breaths. </p><p>“Of course, there is, Your Majesty,” I said. “Your Royal body certainly deserves the most spectacular treatment possible.” </p><p>Before she could answer, I learned once more, but this time, rather than focusing on her nipples, I started enjoying the soft texture of her amazing breasts, and her moans exploded as each soft bite burned as hard as a forest fire, leaving the mark of pleasure behind. </p><p>“Well,” I murmured softly as I pulled back. “Do you have any idea what you want as a reward?” I asked. </p><p>“No,” she whispered, which surprised me. I looked at her beautiful face, only to see her eyes closed, pleasure covering her face as she lost herself in the moment. Though, it didn’t surprise me as much as her next words. “You can do whatever you want to me,” she gasped. </p><p>What an amazing offer, I realized. I just needed to decide what to do…</p>
