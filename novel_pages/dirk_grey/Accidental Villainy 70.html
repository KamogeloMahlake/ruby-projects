        <p>Tara walked steadily toward the door, faking being wounded. I had noticed Daria’s suspicious gaze, clearly too experienced to buy the fake wound. I nodded. While I would have preferred Tara to be a better actress, there was little I could do to change that in short order. </p><p>I asked her to lock the door rather than doing it myself, because I didn’t want to trick Daria when it came to the capabilities of Tara. Letting her underestimate us too much wouldn’t be to our benefit. </p><p>That, and if the Lady of Destruction decided to demolish our bar, that little subterfuge wouldn’t help us any. </p><p>Admittedly, Daria wasn’t any better when it came to acting. Even with everything we had done together, a spoiled party girl was supposed to react badly when she suddenly found herself locked in a seedy bar regardless of anything else we had done. Yet, she didn’t even acknowledge the possibility of the risk. </p><p>She wasn’t a bad infiltrator when she was properly briefed, but when left to her own devices, she was nowhere as impressive. The difference was stark enough that I started to get even more curious when it came to Rose, her mysterious ally and trainer. </p><p>But, that was for another time. </p><p>“So, Amelia,” I said as I teased her, deliberately using her fake name. “You want to check my cameras because you lost a personal item,” I asked, enjoying the way she nodded confidently, mostly due to the way it made her mostly-naked tits dance. Tara was still in the room, which made the moment even more erotic. </p><p>“Yes,” she said. </p><p>“Really,” I added. “And, couldn’t you come up with a better lie, sweetie,” I added, and she flinched. </p><p>“W-what do you mean, lie,” she said, tense, but not enough to throw her off her role. Normally, an inexperienced undercover agent like her would have panicked. Of course, such panic would have been about fearing for her life, which was not exactly a problem for her. </p><p>Amusingly, it worked more to my benefit rather than hers, as it allowed me to push her more without truly scaring her off. </p><p>“I mean, isn’t it obvious. You’re not that good of an actress,” I said, which made her eyes widen as something clicked in her gaze. I could see her tensing, ready to show off her power. I immediately continued, as the last thing I wanted was for her to actually reveal her power. I didn’t want her to know that her heroic identity was known. It would make things much more difficult than necessary. </p><p>“It’s clear that the local police probably saw us together, and now forcing you to be an informant for them to deal with the drug trade,” I continued in a casual, smug tone, like I was playing poker and saw her bluff. </p><p>“What?” she gasped, surprised by my conclusion. </p><p>“Actually, I would love to hear about the details. Tell me, were you actually caught with drugs, or are you silly enough to help them just as your civic duty.” </p><p>“I …” she muttered, pausing for a moment as she realized just how convenient was misunderstanding was, and choosing to believe that it was just a coincidence. </p><p>A dangerous assumption on her part. </p><p>“No need to lie, I can read you easily, sweetie,” I said as I reached forward, twisting her nipple, the familiar move working two ways. It not only distracted her from thinking too deeply but also it convinced her of the perception of the situation even more. “Now, just tell me how the useless local police managed to convince you that just coming out and asking you to see the security cameras of my excellent establishment is a good idea.” </p><p>“You mean this dump,” she answered, smirking far too confidently for a woman who was supposed to be caught as a snitch by a dangerous criminal, but considering my palm was still over her breast, it wasn’t entirely unrealistic that she didn’t feel the threat for her life. Her chastity would have been a different matter, but that ship had already sailed. </p><p>“Hey, it’s my dump you’re mocking,” I said playfully. The way I twisted her nipple was far less playful, along with her incredible moan. “But, about the situation.” </p><p>“Well, apparently there’s a federal case targeting the drug dealers, and they promised to help some of my problems go away if I could visit this place a few times and use a wire to stake the warehouse,” she said. </p><p>“I hope you’re not wearing a wire right now,” I teased her. </p><p>“Well, you can always search me and make sure,” she offered. </p><p>It was tempting, particularly since I could see the way her eyes brightened with desire as she offered. I thought about taking that offer, but I decided to listen to her excuses first. I had to admit, the federal case was a good excuse. Not something a minor villain could just wave away, but not dangerous for me either, giving her an excuse to hang around. The wire excuse was particularly good, giving her an excuse to hang around more, while also letting me know that those imaginary agents were not targeting my bar. </p><p>“Later,” I said. “Are you sure they are not targeting my bar,” I added even as I moved my hand to her hair, and suddenly pulled her closer, making sure the pain was kept within the limits of what she enjoyed. Her moan confirmed that I pulled it off. “Because, I would make you pay.” </p><p>“Pay, how?” she moaned, showing just how much she enjoyed the idea. </p><p>I smirked, enjoying the sudden stiffening of her naked nipples. “Maybe I would chain you in my basement. I’m sure the feds wouldn’t care about their slutty informant disappearing too much, and your sinful body would be enough to pay for my losses.” </p><p>“Please, I’m worth a hundred of this dump,” she declared between moans. </p><p>“Well,” I muttered as I leaned closer, about to capture her lips. “I can’t argue with that, slut. You’re worth my whole fortune,” I said as I captured her lips, deliberate in my compliment. She wanted to be treated roughly by her criminal paramour, but that didn’t mean she wanted to be treated as just another disposable whole. She clearly wanted the danger — well, the illusion of it — but also her warped version of pampering.</p><p>I was happy to give her. </p><p>“It doesn’t mean much, considering your place —” she said, only to moan as I bit her neck playfully. </p><p>“Believe me, sweetie, I’m worth much more,” I declared, deliberately pompous. “But, before talking about that, we need to make sure that you’re not wearing a wire,” I said as I gestured to Tara, who had been in the room, watching from the shadows, to walk closer slowly. </p><p>She walked silently, which was why I made a point of looking at her until Daria noticed her slow approach. As much as I wanted to set up a spicy inspection scene, I didn’t want to surprise her. </p><p>Surprising any super from what could be classified as an attack from behind was a terrible idea in principle, and that principle went tenfold when the super in question had the word Destruction in their title. And, as distracted as she was, Daria was still a hero with a lot of experience. She caught my gaze, and used the bar mirror to check behind her, noticing Tara’s steady approach. </p><p>I noticed her tense just slightly, no doubt ready to use her powers to defend herself against Tara if she decided to attack her, but it was a subtle thing. She was clearly not afraid. I smiled smugly, like I was about to pull an incredible prank. I ‘subtly’ gestured for Tara to grab Daria’s tight leather pants before speaking. “Now, let’s get rid of those leather pants. Who knows if you have a wire there…” </p><p>“Do you want me to remove them slowly like the last time —” she started, only to gasp playfully when Tara grabbed her pants. </p><p>The next gasp was far more honest when Tara pulled her leather pants, ripping them with shocking ease as she used her strength, leaving Daria in her panties, a sexy, crimson thong. “I … that…” she gasped, excited and surprised, but not shocked. Clearly, she was aware of Tara’s strength, which was not exactly a great secret considering she had publicly dismantled a power armor with her bare hands. </p><p>“Sweetie,” I said smugly. “I’m the boss here. Do you think it’s my job to pat down suspicious customers? No, that honor goes to my sexy sidekick here,” I whispered. “Now, put your hands on the bar and spread your legs, so she can examine you properly.” </p><p>Daria followed that immediately, her expression a beautiful mixture of shock and desire. </p><p></p>
