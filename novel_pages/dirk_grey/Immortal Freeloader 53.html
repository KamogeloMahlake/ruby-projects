        <p>There were a lot of guards on the walls, but none of them had any higher cultivation than an Initiate, which meant that bypassing them had been a simple endeavor in the dark of the night. Though, it was also enough to show that they were struggling.  </p><p>Unlike the slums, there was a strict curfew, but the streets were filled with patrols. The city was tense, but the number of burnt buildings and other issues suggested that the worry was for nothing. The enemy spies were clearly working hard. </p><p>I didn’t interact with them, but I moved around the city, taking note of the changes. Some of those changes, like the burnt remains of the three schools that fought against the city lord, were expected. Some, like the lack of movement in Snow Blossom Apothecary and Volcano Forge, not so much. </p><p>Especially since, Volcano Forge had been rebuilt, and both places were protected by a full squad of city guards. Interesting question, but since I didn’t have the option to question anyone, I went to see Marana. </p><p>But, not before spending some time putting on some makeup to look like the same mysterious old apothecary that engaged with Marana in the past. </p><p>Then, I sneaked into the Crane school. The security was tight, but the secret entrance was still free. However, rather than barging in, I knocked on the secret door twice, loudly, then took a few steps back. The door opened a while later, revealing Marana in her uniform, her beautiful face contorted with anger. “You,” she said, doing her best to look calm, but I didn’t miss both fear and anger on her face. </p><p>“Yes, it’s me,” I said with an ominous, cracking voice. “I came to collect my debt.” Angering her was not the safest thing to do, but to sell the role, I needed to act more aggressively. Now that I could use Qi to defend myself, I was far more confident in acting that way. </p><p>“Come in,” she said, frustrated, but also a challenge. As if, she was challenging me to dare to walk in. I chuckled as I followed her, and soon, we were in a familiar room. </p><p>I decided not to waste time and torture Marana pointlessly. “You remember our deal,” I said.</p><p>“Yes, but first. How’s Arthanum?” she asked, once again showing her softhearted nature. </p><p>“Don’t worry. His situation is better than yours,” I said, then, after a momentary thought, I decided to add something that would excuse my future appearances. “I had made him an offer of employment, and he found it more palatable than going back to his family,” I said. </p><p>“Did you force him?” she said. </p><p>“No. He’s very happy to make that deal,” I said. “After all, not everyone could help him reach the Skin Refinement realm quickly,” I added, adding just enough to give some flexibility for the future. “But, that’s enough chitchat. Do you have the manuscripts?” I asked. </p><p>“No,” she said.  </p><p>“Interesting. I wonder if you even mentioned the deal to them, or decided to handle the consequences yourself?” I said, unable to help but tease her. After spending time together, I had a better sense of how she thought. </p><p>Luckily, they were not needed in the first place. </p><p>“Does it matter?” she said icily. “We had a deal, and I’m willing to fulfill my part,” she said. “I just need to make sure the crisis is over, then I’ll follow you as my honor demands—” she started, her tone like she was accepting a death sentence. </p><p>I interrupted her with a gesture. “It looks like there’s a misunderstanding. When I said you’ll follow me, I was being more metaphorical. You don’t need to leave,” I said. She looked surprised, and I chuckled. “I wanted you to follow me, because I needed someone to collect herbs and other materials for my new apothecary business,” I said. “And, looking outside, you can easily handle that from here,” I said. “I doubt there are many villagers that dare to forage. The herb harvest should be abundant as long as a team went deep enough.” </p><p>She looked conflicted. “I can’t risk the lives of my students. The deal is for me only,” she said. </p><p>I sighed. “What risk. A team of Bone Forging martial artists should be able to handle going in and out easily,” I commented. </p><p>She had no Bone Forging martial artists in her school, but the widening of her eyes suggested that she understood what I was driving at. “That’s…” she started, then paused. “Why?” </p><p>I shrugged. “Loyalty is a rare coin, as I learned from the past.” </p><p>“And, you trust me, despite everything?” she said. </p><p>I chuckled, acting like I had seen everything. “And, what happened. I helped you against your enemies, and now, I’m offering you enough pills to revitalize your school. In turn, I just need to collect herbs for me. I don’t even need you to give them for free. I’ll pay for them with essence pills and other medicine. Truly, what a horrible hatred we have?” </p><p>“Then, why…” she started, clearly suspicious. </p><p>“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask!” I added, suddenly looking angry, even going as far as flaring my essence chaotically. “I’m offering you a deal. If you’re truly that reluctant, you can reject it.” I chuckled darkly as I made a symbolic gesture to reflect the city outside. “I’m sure you can protect your students easily with the mess.” </p><p>I was deliberately being meaner than necessary, but since excessive niceness would be too suspicious. Hopefully, it would be enough. </p><p>“I accept,” she admitted after a long pause.  </p><p>“Good. Never reveal the deal to anyone even to your students,” I added. “There’s a lot of people that’s  invested in seeing this city fall, and it won’t be nice to stick your head out too much.” She nodded, and I didn’t bother talking too much. Ultimately, she might be softhearted, but she was also competent enough to build an independent martial arts school from nothing. </p><p>She could handle herself. </p><p>“Now, go out and bring out everything you have in storage. Also, find me a few decent cauldrons. I couldn’t sneak one into this blasted city. You’ll need some pills if you’re to be helpful,” I said. </p><p>As she walked out of the room, she was frowning at my attitude, but I didn’t mind it too much. Instead, I looked around, taking note of the room I lived for a week. That time, Marana could have taken me down easily. Now, even in a fair fight, I could take her down. </p><p>What an interesting reversal. </p><p>When she returned, she led me to her private kitchen, which was the most appropriate room to turn into a temporary apothecary. I said nothing as I set up multiple cauldrons. “Wait outside and stand guard,” I ordered, which she followed readily. </p><p>It was hardly an unusual request considering most experts valued their secrets. </p><p>With my new cultivation, refining a pile of pills hadn’t been hard. With my advanced recipes, I was able to refine a lot of high-grade pills, both to replenish essence and to assist breakthroughs. In four hours, I  refined a lot of pills. Half of it, I put into a bag, wanting to bring them to the capital. </p><p>Once I opened the door,  Marana looked at the pile I created, her eyes wide. Understandable, as that achievement was even better than what I had revealed before. “Keep it a secret,” I reminded her. </p><p>She didn’t say a moment, trying to believe what was in front of her eyes. “All those … in four hours, they are all Profound Peak-Grade,” she stammered.  </p><p>I revealed my success deliberately. Someone greedier might have been tempted to act out, but I expected that it would make her more cooperative. </p><p>“Yes,” I said. “It was tiring, but I don’t want to stay here any longer than necessary. I still have a lot of work to do.” </p><p>She paused, then asked another question. “Can you heal my students?” she asked. </p><p>“As long as they are unconscious,” I said. “I don’t want to be seen by anyone but you. Understood?” I said. Marana just nodded rather than arguing pointlessly. She went out for a bit more, then she returned to lead me to a private room. </p><p>I examined the patients. Some had visible wounds, while the others were merely unconscious, but every single one of them had serious damage to their cultivation. One by one, not only I treated their problems, but also I modified their bodies so that their cultivation would progress more easily. </p><p>Her eyes widened as I explained that to her.  “Just like that,” she said, looking shocked. </p><p>“That’s nothing compared to raising Connate Realm artists. Speaking of it … you can lay down as well,” I said. </p><p>“Me too?”  she asked, surprised.  </p><p>“Sure. How else you reach the Peak of Connate Realm,” I said, treating it like the most trivial achievement. “I might have ended up in this godforsaken corner of the world, but I need proper employees.” </p><p>She paused. “But, if you can help someone, why did you cripple Arthanum’s future?” she asked, her anger leaking despite her attempt to keep it concealed. </p><p>I chuckled, amused that even now, she was worrying about me. I didn’t choose wrongly. I decided to give her a better answer to prevent future resentment. “Simple, how else I could test his determination,” I said. </p><p>“You’re saying that what you did is …  reversible,” she added. </p><p>“Easily,” I said. “Now, lay down. I don’t have all day…” </p>
