        <p>Tara’s eyes were diluted with desire as she stayed on her knees, obedient and gentle like she wasn’t strong enough to bring down a building. “Open your mouth,” I ordered. </p><p>She did, her beautiful face gaining blush in the process. </p><p>“Now, put those beautiful lips to better use.” </p><p>After a loving gaze, she leaned forward, capturing my shaft between her beautiful lips. I couldn’t help but grin despite the headache. She was truly beautiful. </p><p>“Look at me,” I said, and she did so, her beautiful brown eyes filled with warmth, her earlier depression gone like I had spent weeks coaxing and pampering her rather than ordering her to serve me. </p><p>The day she walked inside my bar was the luckiest day of my life. She looked at me with such warmth that, if it wasn’t for the clear displays showing that she enjoyed her unique situation even more than I did, I might have even felt guilty. </p><p>Instead, I leaned against the cold ceramic wall while she did her best to do her task. I grabbed her hair, but I didn’t push her forward, just pulled slightly. She took the signal, and her movements quickened, following without hesitation. </p><p>Tara took me down her throat with ease despite her gags, once again putting her power to good use. Her eyes stayed open as she moved, treating me as an object of worship, each second pushing me deeper into desire. </p><p>“Slow down. You’re supposed to clean it gently,” I teased her even as I grunted approvingly. I simply didn’t want to explode early and ruin her enjoyment. She was quick to follow that order. She pulled back, instead slowly running her tongue along my length. </p><p>I tightened my grip on her hair, and she moaned. Yet, she continued licking my shaft gently, and steadily, her innocent expression making it a truly wondrous look. </p><p>“Now, the head,” I said. She took the head of my cock into her mouth slowly, sucking with a leisurely pace, like it was a delicious dessert. Her moans of pleasure, on the other hand, were incredible. </p><p>It was amazing. I let her play for a long while, and she continued with enthusiasm. “Now, open your mouth wider,” I asked. Her eyes widened, realizing what was about to arrive. Yet, rather than pulling back, she stabilized in preparation. </p><p>And, I started fucking her throat mercilessly. She squirmed in joy as I reshaped her throat, humming happily. That impacted me incredibly considering my location, and I started to cum. </p><p>“Don’t waste a drop,” I warned as she worked hard. I had to admit, she looked far too fascinating as she completed the task, filling me with desire. </p><p>I said nothing as she cleaned it off. Hardly necessary considering the water was still cascading over us in the shower, but I let her do so. “Now, the towel,” I asked her, and she was happy to slowly dry me off. </p><p>“Excellent work,” I said as I hugged her, gently kissing her temple. </p><p>She smiled happily with my ‘reward’, especially when I dragged her toward the bed. The headache was still a problem, but thankfully, the pleasure worked wonderfully to counter it. Unfortunately, it was not a panacea. As I lay on my back, I was still feeling exhausted. </p><p>Luckily, there were some options that didn’t require me to work too hard. “Ride me,” I asked as I lay on my back. She followed my order, shivering with excitement. </p><p>A simple command was all she needed to take a position over my body, her excitement visible. A moment later, she lowered herself down, impaling herself with my presence, which already regained its life. </p><p>It was hard to do with my beautiful bodyguard naked next to me. She started moving slowly at first, but soon she picked up speed, her beautiful tits bouncing. “Excellent work,” I said as she rode me in the cowgirl position, every move of her incredibly beautiful. </p><p>She managed to keep her moans down, but it was clearly a close call. </p><p>I grabbed her hips, but it was less about helping him, and more about enjoying her beautiful thighs. Her hips stilled for a moment, waiting for an order, but a nod later was enough to make her move faster and faster. </p><p>“So, do you have any questions about what happened downstairs?” I suddenly asked. Though, the moment I asked that, I realized it had been a stupid thing to do. I had a super with enhanced strength on top of me, yet I was questioning her about her opinions about receiving a naked lap dance from another woman. </p><p>“I … I don’t,” she answered before I could take that back. I could see that she had a question but didn’t dare to ask. Luckily, she didn’t seem angry, and continued moving. </p><p>I slapped her ass. “You clearly have a question. Don’t lie to me,” I pushed. </p><p>She blushed as she stopped. “I didn’t mean to—” she started. I interrupted with another spank. </p><p>“I didn’t ask you to stop either,” I added, her blush turning apocalyptic, yet she moved once again. “I didn’t mean to lie, sir. I was just… I wondered what were you trying to do with her?” </p><p>“Why didn’t you ask? Do you think I won’t answer,” I said, rising with a sudden gentleness as I kissed her lips, making her tremble before I lay on my back once again. “What do you think I was doing?” </p><p>She blushed. Without my earlier warning, she might have stopped again, but with that clear in mind, she continued to grind against me. “Since you said she’s a super … I thought you might be trying to recruit her.” </p><p>“And, what would you say if I was trying to recruit her?” I asked, once again pushing her. Again, it didn’t seem like a smart question, but since she displayed no sign of dissatisfaction talking about the sexy redhead who gave me a lap dance I decided to push my luck nonetheless. </p><p>She gave me an earnest look while continuing to jump and down on my lap. “I can only hope that she’s strong, so we can protect you together.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at her simple answer, showing no jealousy. She was really a true submissive. She was lucky that she was with me rather than someone even more evil … though, admittedly, I was not the nicest man either. </p><p>“I don’t plan to recruit her, at least not yet. I still don’t know who she’s working for?” </p><p>“So, she’s an enemy?” Tara asked. </p><p>“Not at the moment. She’s not working for the Syndicate. That much, I’m reasonably sure, but anything else is hard to guess. But, if she comes here again, be careful around her, and don’t attack her unless she leaves you no choice.” </p><p>“What if she damages the bar?” Tara asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. A bar can be rebuilt, you’re the only priceless thing here,” I answered, enjoying her blush. After all, just because she was an obsessive submissive didn’t mean that I should neglect the compliments, especially since she wasn’t afraid of being abandoned once more. </p><p>Also, there was a fact that the bar would be destroyed the moment the Lady of Destruction fought near the place. She destroyed city blocks accidentally. I had no idea what she could do purposefully.</p><p>However, there was no point in discussing it anymore. I grabbed her hips and flipped her, putting her under me. She might have super strength, but she still weighed the same as an ordinary girl, which made moves like that possible. </p><p>I started invading her core aggressively. She lost her control over her moans, filling the room with her beautiful voice. </p><p>Soon, she started trembling under me, climaxing beautifully. I sealed her lips as I exploded inside her, then rolled to the side while hugging her, still buried. “Good night,” I whispered as I buried my face in her hair. </p><p>The day had been painful and exhausting … but, ultimately, I was happy about how it ended.</p>
