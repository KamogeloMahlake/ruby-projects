        <p>Watching Penny sway in front of me, wearing nothing but a red ribbon was certainly beautiful. Beautiful enough to tempt me to reach forward and give a tug to the little knot that was keeping her improvised ribbon together. </p><p>Yet, I kept myself back, deciding to let Penny take the initiative for once. For a submissive beauty like her, a change of pace like that was certainly a novel change, enough to break my usual attitude when it came to having fun. </p><p>After all, Penny certainly worked hard to earn that treatment.  </p><p>So, I stayed still despite my instincts begging me to take an action, even as she took her place on my lap once more, rubbing and swaying, her breasts arriving at the eye level thanks to elevation advantage of her. </p><p>Penny looked down, her excitement battling with trepidation as she found herself in the position of control, a rare situation in our relationship — if one could call our weird entanglement a relationship.</p><p>Yet, it was a sign of her improvement that she barely stilled for a second before she grabbed my head and pulled me into the glorious valley between her breasts, the ribbon stretching between them barely a barrier as I got buried in their beautiful depths. </p><p>Penny squealed in pleasure as she rocked back and forth on my lap, each second giving me more time to enjoy her barely covered bosom. “Not a bad start,” I murmured, making her blush, which was apparent even in her bosom. </p><p>It was amazing that she could act shy under my words even when dressed like that, rubbing against me at a speed that would make a stripper self-conscious. I wanted to raise my head and catch her gaze, but I had a feeling that, if I did so, the little confidence she was able to collect would collapse spectacularly, and while that would have been fun in its own way, I decided to let it slide nonetheless. </p><p>Still, it was impossible to reject the temptation of not playing her completely. I put my hand on her back, gently caressing as it moved back and forth along her spine, my touch enough to make her tremble. </p><p>“N-no,” she stammered. “No touching,” she added after a deep breath, one that did some interesting things to her bosom, interesting things that I got a direct view of thanks to my face still buried in her breasts. </p><p>“As you wish,” I answered as I pulled my hand back, my voice muffled the best way possible. However, I didn’t pull back without a little trick. I had delivered a little tug to her ribbon, which dislodged the knot that was holding her costume together. </p><p>That raised no comment, signaling that she had missed it. Not that it surprised me. It wouldn’t be the first time she had missed an extremely important detail that led to amazing amorous situations that went against her initial intent. </p><p>She was truly a rare treasure. </p><p>I said nothing as she shuffled on my lap back and forth, each move giving me a deeper sensation of pleasure, tempting me to push forward and ruin her plan. Only the slow crawl of her ribbon, getting looser each second, kept me back. </p><p>Soon, a moan escaped her lips, one that suggested that she was having even more trouble rejecting the temptation of the last step. It was a beautiful one, colored with arousal and desire, making my fingers tighten in anticipation, begging them to move lower. </p><p>Before I could take that move, however, Penny decided to stand up. Not fully, which would have strained her ribbon and left her naked, but a half-rise, a transitory move before she knelt in front of me. </p><p>Yet, her hands stayed on the side, making me think that she had no intention of helping me divest my clothes. “Tease,” I whispered. </p><p>“Are you sure?” she answered, this time managing to deliver that without a stammer as she looked toward me. I quirked an eyebrow, feeling lost about her meaning, even when she leaned forward, using her teeth to grab the sash that had been holding my robe together. </p><p>A tug, and it lost the ability to keep it together, my shaft finally springing free from its protective layer. </p><p>And even better, that move finally caused the end of her gift wrapping. Not because the move finally strained the knot that was holding me together, but because it finally strained my patience to the limit. </p><p>I grabbed, a pull enough to free her body from the already-deficient grasp of the ribbon. “Best gift ever,” I murmured even as I grabbed her waist, and threw her on the couch. </p><p>“S-such a rough little boy,” she managed to say, trying to sound coy despite her shyness. “Didn’t you learn to open your gifts more gently?” </p><p>“Never,” I said mockingly. “I’m not the one that cares about the gift wrapping, only the gift itself…” I stopped for a moment, my smirk widening. “Sorry, the gift herself.” </p><p>The blush that spread through her face in response was simply spectacular, the confidence she showed earlier as she was on my lap nowhere to be seen. I said nothing else as I sat on the couch as well, and gestured for her to spread her legs. </p><p>Ironically, her shyness might prevent her from saying anything, but it certainly didn’t stop her from widening her legs invitingly.  Meanwhile, I finally followed the desire of my heart and put my fingers to her wetness, my fingers danced around her knob. </p><p>And just like that, her moans exploded, destroying any chance of a reply. </p><p>After an extended teasing, I could feel her excitement reaching to climactic level rather rapidly, signaling me to act faster if I didn’t want her to collapse before I could make a move. </p><p>The way she shivered was all the evidence I needed to signal the seriousness of the challenge. </p><p>Yet, even then, I wasn’t the one that would keep myself back. I leaned down, pressing my lips to her inner thigh for a moment before starting to move up, leaving a trail of kisses over her beautiful stomach, each kiss earning a louder moan, exploding once my head disappeared between her legs, her lips wet under my tongue, her aroma delicious.  </p><p>She just moaned loudly, making her amazing breasts jiggle again and again, though the rapidness of her cries warned me not to delay that assault for too long, or risk spoiling the fun. </p><p>Instead, I suddenly pulled back, the disappointed gasp of her easy to mollify by replacing my tongue with a certain other, harder, part of my body.  </p><p>Her cry was enough to show just how much she appreciated the sudden change of approach. She pushed her hips forward even as her beautiful, plump thighs tightened around my waist, entrapping me in the most amazing prison imaginable. </p><p>“Harder,” she murmured dazedly, her voice suggesting that her mind was blanked in a thick layer of pleasure. I waited for another moan to explode from her beautiful lips as I grabbed her hips for leverage, my fingers sinking deep into her flesh, the softness spectacular. </p><p>My shaft started throbbing in anticipation, increasing her pleasure even more even as it signaled she wasn’t the only one that was dangerously close to a climax, her tightness telling the story of growing arousal, each second getting more intense. </p><p>Even more, even as I impaled her aggressively, I could feel exhaustion growing in my body, noticeable even with all the adrenaline that was growing in my body. Understandable, as it had been a very long day, starting from the exhausting encounter in the morning, followed by an exhausting work day, and topped up by the encounter in the bathroom. </p><p>Still, it was a pity as I would have loved to continue until the early hours of the morning, teasing her skin glowing under the first rays of morning. </p><p>Penny moaned, still under my touch, distracting me from such unimportant details like my own exhaustion or alternative plans. I hummed as pushed my hips forward even harder, enjoying the way she tightened around me, her climax just seconds away… </p><p>Yet, she managed to surprise me once again. Before I could explode, she suddenly rose — which also freed my shaft from her core —  and pressed her hands on my chest. I could have resisted her push, but her move was simply too interesting to be stopped, so I let her succeed. </p><p>She pushed me down until I found myself lying on my back, which would have been a sad conclusion to our encounter if she hadn’t followed up immediately, sitting on top of me, skewering herself with my glistening shaft once more. </p><p>I said nothing as she put her hands on my chest once more, this time using it as support as she started rocking her hips with a desperation that pushed me toward the end far faster than I expected. </p><p>Luckily, she still arrived first. </p><p>She cried as her tunnel tightened around my girth, loud enough to wake up the dead. Still, surprisingly, it wasn’t enough to actually wake up Nancy, who had been still sleeping in the other room. </p><p>Apparently, I wasn’t the only one that had been exhausted during the day. </p><p>Yet, as her hips rocked, Penny’s hands tightened on my shoulders, her fingers biting deep enough to leave their mark. Not that I was complaining. With the pleasure radiating in my body, pushing me toward that final explosion, the pain just become another facet of the pleasure I was feeling. </p><p>She had long collapsed against my chest when I started filling her insides, shivering softly against my body as the pleasure hit her hard, her eyes closing for a moment. Clearly, she was no less exhausted. </p><p>I thought about lifting her, but her comforting warmth was simply too comfortable. I closed my eyes, just to catch a moment of sleep. </p><p>Though, the couch was rather comfortable as well… </p>
