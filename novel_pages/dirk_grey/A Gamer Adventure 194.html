        <p>A groan escaped my mouth as the tight throat of my tiny dragoness enveloped my girth, the passionate bobbing of her head, well-earned after all the effort I spent preparing her amazingly delicious and mana-filled breakfast. </p><p>Then, I pulled back, giving her a breather. “D-delicious,” she murmured as she took a deep breath, but her tongue was quick to jump out, giving a lick to the side of my shaft, getting the remains of the chocolate from the side while triggering a shiver for me.</p><p>Simply spectacular.  </p><p>I smiled as I look down, no less hungry, though unlike her, it was less about the deliciousness of the food, and more about how tasty she looked with her lips stained with chocolate and cream, the black and white creating an interesting contrast with her bright emerald hair and even brighter emerald eyes. </p><p>I didn’t know whether the heaven existed — the existence of a sexy angel withstanding — but even if it did, I doubted that it would be superior to the current moment I was enjoying. </p><p>While my thoughts slipped toward the cosmology of the universe, she assaulted my erection once more, but not before grabbing the bowl of chocolate and coating my length with the black liquid once more, and started licking again. As her tongue moved, the chocolate quickly dwindled. </p><p>I expected her to pull back for another refill, yet she didn’t do so, which told me that, at this point, it was just an excuse for her. </p><p>I just watched passively as Janelor’s tongue danced around my length whenever she took a breather, even after the food that covered my length long disappeared, her stained lips looking excellent whenever she took a more aggressive stance in bobbing. And the angle was making the scene even more beautiful, especially when her breasts pushed against my thighs, changing their beautiful shape for a fleeting moment. </p><p>A moan of satisfaction arrived, knocking on the door, and I let it go, giving her an audio clue that her treatment was working excellently, curious whether it would make her more passionate, or reawaken her arrogance. I wanted to believe that the first was the case… </p><p>Yet, she pulled back, an arrogant smirk on her face as she looked up, confirming that she chose the second path. </p><p>Confirming that fucking the arrogance out of a dragoness was not as simple as I wanted to assume. </p><p>Luckily, I hardly had the intention of stopping my attempts. “You missed a spot, let me help,” I said as I grabbed her head. </p><p>“Wait—“ she tried to say, but that was all she was able to manage before I pushed my shaft into her beautiful throat. A sharp sound escaped her mouth, between a moan of pleasure and a cry of distress. </p><p>Despite its mixed nature, it was exquisite. </p><p>I moaned in satisfaction once again, this time even louder, but with her head locked by my hands, she didn’t have the luxury of escaping unless she wanted to change forms, and that was only viable if she wanted to stop completely. Yet, her muffled gags and moans suggested that escaping was not a thought that occupied her mind. </p><p>Happy with her performance, I continued to push her deeper, doing using her to bring myself closer to a climax. And, with her puffed cheeks and excited eyes, she was clearly happy with my assistance with her task.</p><p>“You have a beautiful throat, your dragoness,” I murmured, unable to hold back a compliment as I pushed her even deeper, but this time, a momentary change. The next second, I pulled my hips back and pushed her on the bed. “But, you have finished your mission of cleaning it. Now, it’s time for the real event.” </p><p>She said nothing as she found herself lying on her back, nor that she needed to. The speedy way her legs parted open told everything I needed to know about her mood. “So, do you want to see my impression of a rampaging dragon,” I said as I moved forward. </p><p>“Don’t get too arrogant—“ she started, but that was all she was able to say before I grabbed her hands and pushed her up, tensing her body to push her beautiful breasts even higher before I pushed forward, invading her warmth once more.  The beautiful moan she let out was beautiful, my hands pinning her down making it even easier to handle things. </p><p>“Really?” I said as my hips started to move, invading her phenomenal tightness. She left my comment unanswered, though her moans were an acceptable substitute. Not that those moans surprised me as I sank into her glistening arousal, impaling her aggressively, without a hint of mercy. </p><p>Much faster than I would use against the others — with the notable exception of Oeyne — but my arrogant dragoness clearly needed another lesson about who was the true master despite the amusing fiction I still entertained. </p><p>Her hands grabbed my hair, pulling hard enough to trigger a flash of pain as her fingers tightened around the strands, but that only earned a slap onto her beautiful breasts. </p><p>“How dare you!” she managed to say between her moans. </p><p>“How dare I, what?” I said, acting oblivious as I continued to spank her beautiful breasts with the same merciless rhythm of my hips, the explosion of the multiple sources filling the room beautifully, steadily destroying any hope of her establishing power over me, certainly not through the bedroom — or any other places I might enjoy her beautiful body. </p><p>Not that she had any chance of doing so in the first place with the way she fell into pieces under the rush of pleasure without the slightest hope of resisting. </p><p>With that trait, it didn’t surprise me when she soon started trembling under the merciless assault of the pleasure, signaling a beautiful climax. </p><p>But certainly not her last one. </p><p>“Where are we going?” she murmured a moment later as she recovered from her pleasure, only to realize I had already lifted her in a bridal hold, walking away. </p><p>“To get a better place than the bed to properly start our fun, of course,” I said. </p><p>“But…” she murmured dazedly as she looked in the direction that we were walking. “But there’s nothing there but the dining table.” </p><p>“I know,” I answered even as pushed against the table, her legs barely able to touch the floor as her tits smashed against the cold wood, resulting in a beautiful gasp in the process. “But, considering we were eating on your bed, it’s only fair that we use the dining table instead of a bed,” I explained. </p><p>“But we already did that—“ she started to comment, only for her voice to fade halfway as she felt my shaft pressing against her hole, but not the one I had been invading earlier. </p><p>“Not this one,” I murmured even as I started pushing into her tight hole, only stopping for a moment to flare my mana.</p><p>[-928 Mana] </p><p>Most of the mana was a reward for the pain she was about to go through, but a small portion of it went to create a layer of lubricant, allowing me to slip easily into her beautiful hole. </p><p>And her bubble butt — with a shape and tightness that certainly deserved the term — gripped my shaft with an iron grip, showing just how necessary was the lubrication. </p><p>“You can’t do that! Not there!” she gasped as my shaft invaded her tightness mercilessly. “That’s wrong!” </p><p>“Not particularly wrong,” I said even as I pushed even deeper, leveraging her dragonic endurance to invade her mercilessly, even spanking her beautiful ass in the process, adding another layer to her little pain. “It’s even tighter than your beautiful lips, and as an added bonus, it doubles as an excellent way of teaching an arrogant dragoness her lesson.” </p><p>“You—“ she tried to say, only to be interrupted by a spank. </p><p>“Of course, we can always stop if are too weak to handle it,” I commented as I slowed down, which was all that was needed to silence her. </p><p>Pride was an emotion easy to abuse. </p><p>I continued to push inside her bit by bit as my shaft slowly disappeared inside her. She managed to keep her mouth shut until halfway, even with the occasional spank that landed on her ass, but that proved to be her limit, as her grunts mixed into the sound of my spanks. </p><p>Against someone else, I might have waited for her to get used to it, but against a dragon learning a lesson, mercy was clearly not the greatest idea. I pulled back, but before she could complete her relaxed sigh, I pushed forward, invading her core more aggressively, her pained cry echoing in the room. </p><p>“Slow down,” she gasped. </p><p>“Only if you admit you can’t handle it,” I said, glad that my healing abilities allowed me to walk the line between mildly painful and actually damaging very easily. </p><p>“Of — of course, I can handle,” she answered rapidly, her pride leaving no place for another answer. </p><p>“Good, then,” I said with a smirk, and pushed forward.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
