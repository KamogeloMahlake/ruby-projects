        Sarah was sitting on her living room, cycling between two messages she received a few minutes apart. <p>Earlier in the day, she had achieved a small miracle, managing to slip through the front door without getting caught. Neither a neighbor nor her husband saw her as she left Erik’s car and dashed inside, half-naked. Annoyingly, the former was even more important. She could have explained her lack of clothing to her husband as an attempt to seduce him, and it would work swimmingly as long as he hadn’t noticed that she came from outside, or why her makeup was disturbed and her lips were stained with a white sheen. However, there was no real way to explain why she was getting out of an unfamiliar car, wearing nothing but a skirt to a neighbor. </p><p>After her stressed afternoon, she decided that had deserved a treat. She drew himself a bath, opened a good bottle of wine, and started consuming it in the grasp of the bubbles after a shower to get rid of the stains. It helped to calm her nerves after her latest ordeal. </p><p>She was out of the bath, laying on her bed, wearing a fluffy bathrobe while trying to finish the bottle of red when her phone buzzed twice. The first one was a familiar tone, informing her that the sender was her husband, so she ignored it. A communication blackout was the least he deserved after he had deserted her in the restaurant. She knew that she was being unfair, that he didn’t know the indignities she had suffered to make sure his business deal went without a hitch. But her knowledge was little help soothing her anger.</p><p>She wouldn’t have opened the phone if her phone hadn’t rung in another familiar tone. It was from Megan, Thomas’ younger daughter from his first marriage. She reluctantly reached her phone. Megan, unlike Kelly, was very supportive of her marriage, so she did her best to be accommodating to her whenever she needed something. If only she wasn’t that needy, Sarah thought with a sigh, but she felt a stab of guilt in her heart in the same instant. She knew that Megan wasn’t trying to abuse her goodwill, but more often than not, she had found herself in a compromising position. All because of her gullibility. </p><p>Sarah knew that Megan wasn’t stupid. Academically, she excelled enough to get a major scholarship, and she continued to shine in college. But she had a very innocent way of looking at people, easily believing whatever bullshit they were spewing. Sarah had lost the track of how many times she needed to give her a bit of extra allowance because Megan gave all she had to a ‘friend in need’, not to mention endless shopping trips to replenish items that her friends had ‘borrowed’, a category that mainly consisted clothing, but also included a few electronic gadgets, and a laptop. </p><p>Sarah jumped up to her feet in panic as soon as she read the message Megan had sent, informing Sarah that a few of her sorority friends had invited her to the Butterfly club, and asking her whether she would have wanted to join them. “Fuck,” Sarah murmured even as she typed a positive answer, then dashing towards the hair dryer. </p><p>Megan’s destination was the reason for her panic. The Butterfly Club was one of the most exclusive locations in the city, though it was almost impossible to gain admission unless you were a movie star or a rich man that wouldn’t bother to pay a mid-range five-figure tab for a night’s entertainment. But that was the case for men. </p><p>For women, admission criteria were different, though not necessarily easier. A pleasant face and an amazing body was a start, but they also required an informal referral from one of the regulars. Sarah had gone there once with the insistence of her friends, but she felt uncomfortable with the unspoken expectations of her friends, who had already integrated themselves with some of the old but obviously rich guys. Sarah had decided to beat an early night, which ensured that there was no repeat invite. </p><p>Sarah was alarmed, because Megan was too gullible to extract herself from the situation before the danger was present and clear, and at that point, it would be too late. The men there were too experienced in converting starry-eyed girls into their playthings. She wished it would be possible to convince Megan not to go, but she could easily imagine her saying that she trusted her friends, and she could handle herself. If she was there, she could pull her away before things collapsed into a disaster. </p><p>With her hair dried, she stood in front of her wardrobe, looking for an appropriate dressing. She had a clear idea about what appropriate meant in there. A dress tight enough to look like painted, and with a deep enough cleavage to show the absence of a bra. Like the silver dress she had worn yesterday, which pushed her into the disaster she was facing. </p><p>After a quick search, she had decided on a light blue dress. It was tight, though not as much as the silver one. It was almost conservative on the chest area, though it compensated for it by the deep cleavage that went deep in her back, stopping at the level where her panties began. It was still tight enough to not to allow a bra, and the only panties she was able to wear were thin string ones that, for any practical purpose, was non-existent. A pair of heeled shoes, fragile enough to look like it was about to snap, completed the ensemble. She would have preferred to dress more conservatively, but that would just result in her being turned away at the entrance. </p><p>With the question of attire solved, she sent a message to Thomas, informing him that she was going out with Megan to keep her safe, something he wholeheartedly agreed, as he was also aware of her daughter’s issues with people’s motivations. Though Sarah chose not to mention that they were going to the Butterfly Club, knowing he would try to forbid Megan from going there, which would trigger an unnecessary fight that would end with her going there, but angrier. Wolves there would smell her vulnerability from a mile away. </p><p>She called for a cab while picking a long coat that would hide her dress. The last thing she needed was neighborhood gossip about her nightlife, though fending the eyes of the driver was almost as important. The taxi pulled in front of the house a few minutes later, and she stepped inside. “Butterfly Club,” she murmured, trying to ignore the sudden gleam in driver’s eyes at the mention of her destination. But the sudden hunger in his gaze as he tried to penetrate her coat, was just another condemnation of the club. Sarah could only imagine the amount of flesh he had seen. </p><p>Sarah appreciated the fact that the driver hadn’t tried to chat her up, and gave him a generous tip before getting out, her arms around the skirt of her coat to prevent a last-minute slip, much to the driver’s annoyance. She waited a few minutes, watching as richly dressed men, with scantily-clad girls in their arms, got out of their expensive cars, slipping inside the club door. Occasionally, their gaze fell on her, making her skin crawl. Her instincts shouted her to turn back, that nothing good awaited her inside, but she stayed for Megan’s sake. She couldn’t allow her to walk inside alone. </p><p>After a few minutes of wait, another taxi pulled at the entrance, and four young women in various states of undress stepped out, only one of them familiar. “Megan,” she called as she walked over them. She was glad that Megan had the idea of dressing conservatively, or at least, conservative in comparison by the other dresses. She wore a tight jean that looked tight enough to be painted in, a g-string peeking at her back as she leaned forward, and a shirt that left her stomach bare. Combined with her soft makeup, she was barely noticeable with her friends, whose clothes covered less than average swimsuits. </p><p>“Sarah,” Megan exclaimed happily in response. “I’m so glad you can make it.” They hugged, and Sarah used the opportunity to examine her friends, each of them looking sluttier than the last, making her glad that she had come here. “Let me introduce my friends…” Megan introduced them, but Sarah ignored to learn anything other than their names. There was no need. The club would be too loud to talk, and Sarah had no intention extent her presence other than the amount that was strictly necessary to extract Megan. </p><p>“Let’s go inside,” called one of the girls. “It’s chilly outside.” </p><p>Sarah wanted to say that the weather was quite normal for anyone that went outside with something that wouldn’t be mistaken for underwear, but that would have been unproductive, so she stayed silent. They walked at the entrance where two impressively-sized bodyguards were standing guard. </p><p>“Hi, Kevin,” giggled two of the girls simultaneously. </p><p>“Hello girls,” the guy answered in a casual manner. “Another night of partying?” </p><p>“You know it,” one of them answered as she stepped forward without prompt, her arms open. He started patting her body, stretching it longer than what was necessary for a search, not that she could hide anything underneath it. Meanwhile, the other bodyguard started searching for one of the other girls, but he was much more professional. Sarah knew whose hands she preferred to feel on her. </p><p>The girls finished being searched one by one, disappearing through the ornate door. But her plans hadn’t worked as well as she had hoped, because the first bodyguard was significantly slower to finish his search, leaving only her and Megan in the queue as he finished the first girl. She could have walked to professional one, but it would leave Megan in the hands of the other, and she lacked the assertiveness to force him to stop. So, reluctantly, without saying anything, she stepped towards the sleazy one, who was watching her close in with a hungry gaze in his eyes. </p><p>He put his hands on her body, caressing her stomach softly, though thankfully over her coat, but his hands moved much slower than it was necessary. Meanwhile, Megan’s pat-down finished and she went inside, leaving Sarah alone. “What’s your name, sweetie,” he asked in a tone that made her skin crawl. </p><p>“None of your business,” Sarah lashed out before she could consider just how ill-advised it was. Something she considered immediately after under the angry glare of the bouncer.</p><p>“It seems that you don’t want to enter the club,” he said with an angry smirk as he pulled back, taking a step to close the entrance. “Go away.” </p><p>“But…” Sarah murmured, once again cursing her impulsiveness. “I need to go inside, my friends will wonder-” she continued until the bouncer cut her off. </p><p>“They will do nothing,” he said with a matter of fact tone. “Those sluts are busy looking for a sugar daddy to pay for their latest toy, and I doubt they will leave it just because one of their friends had a bigger tongue than her brain.” </p><p>“But, I need to be inside,” Sarah moaned desperately. </p><p>“You should have thought that before trying to treat a working man like garbage while preparing to suck the cock of the rich guys for shiny trinkets.” </p><p>“You don’t understand,” Sarah said, putting her arms over his biceps. “I’m not here for finding a sugar daddy.” </p><p>“Yes,” he deadpanned. “You’re here to study for the finals.” </p><p>“No, I’m just here to take care of my … friend,” she said, deciding to say stepdaughter at the last second, deciding to keep it simple. </p><p>“That’s definitely more believable,” he answered with a flat tone. “Go away sweetheart, before I decide to ban you from the club permanently.” </p><p>Sarah tightened her hold around his arms, her fingers sinking in his shapely biceps. “Please,” she repeated, letting her desperation free. “I need to go there to take care of her. Please.” </p><p>He looked into her eyes for a couple of seconds before letting out a small laugh. “Holy hell, you’re telling the truth. You’re here to take care of your friend.” He stalled for a second. “Let me guess, the ditsy blond who barely managed to fit her tits into her dress, right?” Sarah nodded, failing to comment on the insulting way he referred to her stepdaughter. “Okay, I’ll let you inside,” he said, and a smile popped on her face. “But you need to show me just how committed you are,” he added, and her smile died just as quick. He turned to his friend. “I’m going inside for a more thorough search,” he said to his partner, who just sighed after sending a pitying look at Sarah.</p><p>Before she could answer, she felt his fingers wrapping around her wrist, pulling her in tow as he walked through the entrance, and she found herself in a dark corridor, tastefully decorated with silver and white furniture. Unfortunately, Megan and the rest of the girls were already gone forward, depriving Sarah of the last excuse she could use to save herself from the arms of the brute. She could have just turned back and left, but then, she would have to explain to Thomas why she had let Megan went into such a dangerous place alone. So, she allowed the bouncer to drag her to a door hidden behind a particularly bulky piece of decor. </p><p>She found herself in a small room, barely larger than a wardrobe, containing nothing but a hanger and a chair. “Let’s search you more thoroughly,” he said, an ugly smirk coloring his otherwise handsome face. “Since you are here to protect your friend, maybe you decided to smuggle a weapon was a good idea.” </p><p>Sarah knew that was next, so she didn’t bother to react when he leaned towards her, his hands landing on her stomach once more before aggressively climbing up, groping her tits, barely bothering to dress it up as a search. He looked at her, egging her to say anything, but she kept silent, knowing that there was nothing she could say that would make things better. </p><p>“Remove the coat,” he asked, and she reached for her buttons, struggling against her reluctance to remove them. Only time her indignities in the hands of her husband’s nemesis, she realized, as, before that, she would be trembling helplessly in such a situation. After deepthroating a stranger behind the couch her husband was sitting, the situation wasn’t as oppressive anymore. </p><p>She put her coat on the hanger and turned back, trying to ignore his catcall. It was hard to ignore that, though not as hard as ignoring his hands, which started exploring her body, not bothering to give the slightest pretense of search, sinking into her tits, the thin layer of her dress only thing to separate her flesh from his disgusting touch. For a moment, she feared that he was about to pull down her dress, but he let his hands roam on her body once more, trailing her spine, which left her insides tingling despite her best effort. </p><p>Her breath quickened as his hands landed on her bottom and squeezed hard. But, surprised with the reaction of her body, she failed to react when his fingers hooked around her panties. “Wait-” she exclaimed, but it was too late, as her panties already around her knees. </p><p>“Just lift your feet, and the search is over,” he said calmly, like he didn’t just dislodge the only piece of underwear she was wearing. She just sighed, knowing she wasn’t in a position to argue, and lifted her feet one by one, allowing him to free her panties. “Naughty,” he said, examining them for a few seconds. He lowered it, and she opened her hand. Instead of giving them back, he slid them in his pocket. “You can go now,” he said, his expression insufferably smug.</p><p>“But-” she tried to argue, only for him to cut. </p><p>“You didn’t think I would allow you to get away scot-free after your disrespect, right? You’re lucky that I’m keeping it limited. That’s the deal, take it or leave it.” She looked at his eyes for a few seconds before lowering it helplessly. “Good girl,” he said, then opened the door and left, leaving her alone, with a conspicuous absence of her panties… </p>
