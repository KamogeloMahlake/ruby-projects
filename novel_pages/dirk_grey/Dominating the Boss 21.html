        <p>Jenny was uncharacteristically silent as we stepped out of the cab, and took the first step into the luxury hotel that was going to house us for the next few days. The reason for her silence was understandable. After the excitement of the moment passed, the guilt took root in her heart once more, unaware that her girlfriend had long passed the point of infidelity, well before I had been involved in their little game. </p><p>I could have tried to calm her down, but I let her stew on it, not wanting to have that conversation under the shadow of a curious cab driver, whose attention was on us —or more accurately, on Jenny’s beautiful legs— far more than appropriate. I was afraid that mentioning a girlfriend would distract him too much. </p><p>More importantly, I needed Jenny to properly process the action she had taken, and a silent cab drive, followed by equally silent processing through reception gave her sufficient time to process that. “You can go to the right room, and I’ll come after completing the paperwork,” I said to Jenny as I stood at the reception, leaving her alone. </p><p>“Sure,” Jenny murmured, standing next to me, confused about what to do. Then, after a moment, she leaned in and kissed my cheek softly before skittering away like a confused dove. A sexy, redheaded dove delicious enough to eat. </p><p>The reception stole away quite a bit of my time, almost fifteen minutes to sign all the papers required for the corporate retreat and tomorrow’s arrivals. Still, rather than walking upstairs immediately, I chose to stay at the bar, slowly nursing a beer, giving Jenny even more time to process her slip, before I swooped in for the killing blow. </p><p>It was almost an hour later that I walked upstairs to my room, and took a shower, ignoring the temptation to visit Jenny immediately, who was just a door away —not even through the corridor, as our rooms were connected through the wall, making the situation even more tempting. I wanted to stop there and take her once again.</p><p>Pity I still had one more thing to do before the action. I reached for my phone and made a video call, only for Natalie to answer immediately. Her eyes widened slightly as she saw my body, covered only by a thin towel wrapped around my waist, displaying my torso to her. “What if I was in a meeting,” Natalie murmured in shock, her beautiful face alight in shock. </p><p>“Then you would deserve it by opening a video call from me in a crowded room,” I said dismissively. “Are you alone?” </p><p>“Yes, but that doesn’t justify-” she started, only for her to stop immediately when I raised my hand in warning. </p><p>“Let out your tits, I’ve missed them,” I asked shamelessly. </p><p>“Do you think that-” she started, only to be cut off halfway once again. </p><p>“Yes,” I simply said even as I caught her eyes. It was satisfying to see that even though the small screen of the phone, I could make her flinch from just a word and a glare. Natalie had come a long way in order to accept my place above hers. She was mine, and no one else. </p><p>I was confident enough to ask her for help in completing the conquest of her girlfriend. </p><p>I watched as she pulled her blouse down, giving me a glimpse of her perky breasts, enough to form a tent in my towel even after months of exposure. She might have a rotten personality, but her body was spectacular. “Do you have something to speak about, or did you call just to ogle my tits?” she asked, snapping a bit. </p><p>“Guess who we met on the flight,” I asked, and when she looked with empty eyes, I continued. “Let me give you a small clue. We were in first class, and you were still in denial about the effects of my touch,” I said, only for her to shudder. </p><p>“Don’t tell me that you met with that silly stewardess,” she said derisively. </p><p>“Oh yes, and she was as tight as I remembered,” I answered. “Though Jenny was a bit apprehensive about her presence,” I added, only for Natalie to gasp in shock, and not a little bit of anger. “Don’t tell me that-” she started. </p><p>“Calm your tits, honey,” I said. “Jenny stays untouched by another female hand,” I said, and she let out a sigh. “A male hand, on the other hand…” I added with a smug expression. </p><p>Natalie just sighed, like it was a question she had no power to react to. Though, considering the several threesomes that she had stayed rather passive through, she probably did accept that, probably helped by the fact that Jenny was already carrying my child. After everything, nice lovemaking was not a big problem. </p><p>“However, we have a problem. Unlike us, Jenny still has a conscience, and she feels guilty. We’re going to help her get past it.” </p><p>“Of course we are,” Natalie murmured. “It’s not enough that you’re fucking me every single workday and have threesomes with us almost every time, but also I have to help my girlfriend get used to cheating on me.” </p><p>“Hey, don’t blame me for winning a fight that you started,” I said, amused by her insistent complaints. “Just make sure to tell her that it’s okay for me to help her relax,” I said. “And since you’re brave enough to backtalk, a little punishment is in order,” I said. </p><p>I could see her teeth squeezing, no doubt burning with a desire to ignore my words. “What do you have in mind, sir?” she ultimately whispered in defeat. </p><p>“You remember the little toy we used during the last investor meeting,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>Her expression turned into an interesting mixture of despair, arousal, and amusement. “Are you talking about the remote-controlled pink one,” she said. </p><p>“I can also control it from my phone,” I answered with a smirk. “Put that on, and if you can be convincing enough, I’m going to leave the camera running,” I said, and an excited smile suddenly appeared on her face. She obviously liked the last-minute addition to the plan. For all of her pride, Natalie was a simple creature, easily managed by a mixture of threats and rewards.  </p><p>After closing the call, I knocked on the door that was keeping our rooms separated. “Is that you, Nathan?” asked Jenny. “The door is open, you can come in,” she said. I opened it, only to see Jenny sitting on the bed, wearing a thick bathrobe, putting on a fresh layer of nail polish. She tried to look casually relaxed, but I knew her enough to see the lines of stress on her face, normally a practical impossibility from her cheerful self, especially after a long shower. </p><p>She was a nice woman that deserved more than Natalie —or me, if I’m being honest— but that was the situation. Luckily for her, however, I cared for my own. </p><p>“How are you feeling?” I asked. I ignored her noncommittal shrug and put my hands on her shoulders, feeling her tenseness as I squeezed softly. At first, she didn’t react to my massage, but after two minutes of my practiced caresses, she gasped. Unlike what I expected, however, she tightened up further after that. “You need to relax,” I murmured. </p><p>“It’s not that easy after what I did,” she murmured, her voice suddenly hitched. “I can’t believe I did that, betraying Natalie’s trust just like that.” </p><p>“Hey,” I answered. “Don’t push yourself too hard,” I said. “I’m sure that Natalie will be understanding if we just talk to her.” Even as I said, so, I pressed the volume up button on my phone, which was currently managing the intensity of the small vibrating toy inside Natalie. </p><p>“But how can I take that risk,” Jenny said, her beautiful green eyes wide as she turned to face me. “What if she reacts badly. And there’s a baby on the way-” she continued, suddenly spiraling, but I leaned forward to steal a kiss, more tender than I preferred, calming her down. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I have a plan,” I said, not fearing the reaction of the woman I had been fucking every single workday for the last few months, especially not when she was wearing a remote-controlled vibrator at my orders. </p><p>I raised my phone, once again calling Natalie on video, and also subtly increasing the intensity of her toy another notch. Jenny looked at me in shock, but before she could react, Natalie answered. “Hi, Nat, sorry to disturb you in the middle of a busy day,” I said. </p><p>“No worries, though it seems like you’re interrupting yourself,” she said. </p><p>Jenny flinched, but I hugged her around the waist with one arm, trying to calm her down. For punishment, I increased the intensity by two levels, forcing Natalie to gasp in shock. Luckily, Jenny had other priorities that stopped her from noticing it. “Are you okay, Nat, you’re a bit flushed,” I said. </p><p>“It’s the air conditioner,” she explained in a hitched voice. “It’s making the room rather warm.” Then, she took a deep breath, getting a sliver of control back. “I’m guessing you guys are having a bit of trouble with that as well, considering the way you’re dressed.”  </p><p>“That’s what I wanted to talk you about, actually,” I said before Jenny could panic, and I increased the intensity yet another level, making it almost impossible for Natalie to maintain her composure. “The flight had been a bit hard for Jenny, and she is feeling a bit stressed.” </p><p>“Oh, no. She shouldn’t feel stressed, maybe the spa would help?” she said concernedly, faking it well enough to make Jenny look even guiltier. She was edging for punishment, I decided, forcing the device to the maximum speed without a warning, making Natalie yelp. </p><p>“Are you okay? And what’s that sound?” I asked, my tone just stiff enough to convey my warning. </p><p>“Someone left their phone on vibration,” she answered quickly, biting her lips to hold back a moan. She was lucky that Jenny was looking at the floor in her shame. “So, you were saying about the spa?” </p><p>“It’s not a bad idea, but I was hoping for a more familiar form of stress relief, which, as you know, helps a lot with Jenny’s special condition,” I said, intentionally letting the phone dip down, showing my erection. Next to Jenny who was dressed in just a bathrobe while teasing Natalie remotely worked wonders for my libido. “However, Jenny doesn’t want to do that without you, she says she feels guilty. Do you mind giving us permission for the day to explore our personal dynamics,” I said, wiggling my eyebrows playfully even as I pulled Jenny on my lap, a move that easily pushed away my barely-hanging towel. “The fun way, of course,” I added.  </p><p>“Hmm,” Natalie murmured thoughtfully, and Jenny stiffened, but on her face, hope was more prevalent than guilt. Natalie smirked in a way that made me suspicious that she was going to force the issue, which was an impressive expression to display while she was holding a furious vibrator inside, so I leaned back and sent a warning glare, making her flinch. “No, I don’t have a problem with it, you guys can have fun for today, as long as you have enough energy for me tomorrow,” she said panickedly, but Jenny was too happy to notice that particular detail. </p><p>“Really, sweetie, are you sure?” Jenny said happily, though not completely free of doubt. </p><p>“Yes, Jen, I’m sure,” Natalie answered, at that point, her eyelids were trembling a little as she struggled to hold her moans. I used the opportunity to lift Jenny a bit, just enough to pull the bottom of her robe out of the way. When she sat once more, she sat directly above my throbbing shaft, sliding inside her in one smooth motion. “Considering your situation, I think we’re well past the point of making a bit of private fun a problem,” Natalie said, struggling to hold a moan in.</p><p>Luckily for Natalie, she wasn’t the only one that was holding a moan in, and unlike her, Jenny was rather bad at it. My surprise intrusion forced her to blush, biting her lips desperately. “Well, that started quickly,” Natalie said, but I waved at her and ended the call. </p><p>“That was rude-” Jenny murmured even as I lifted her, only to slam deep inside her once again, interrupting her with a moan. “She allowed us to do so, and you just started immediately.”  </p><p>“I’m sure I can make it up to her,” I answered Jenny even as pushed her on the bed, her robe pulled open in the short tussle, showing her body that was worthy of goddesses. “Be right back,” I said even as I played with my phone a bit, making sure it was recording before I put it on the desk, leaning against the wall, the camera getting an amazing view of us. I promised a show to Natalie, and I was a man of my word. </p><p>When I came back, I was holding a bottle of chocolate sauce. “What’s that for-” she started, only to be silenced as I sprayed her tits with a fresh coat of chocolate, then leaned down immediately to suck them. “Stop, they are sensitive,” she tried to murmur, but this time, it was her own moan that interrupted her. </p><p>“I know,” I said as I raised my head to catch a fleeting kiss that shared the taste of chocolate with Jenny. “That’s why I’m going to eat you up.” </p><p>“Naughty,” Jenny moaned naughtily before she pulled me to her chest, forcing me to suck her breasts. I wasn’t exactly complaining, but I was surprised by the speed of her reaction. I was letting her wallow in guilt hoping for that exact reaction, but the intensity of her move surprised me. </p><p>Still, I wasn’t exactly unhappy in the position I was forced in, the beautiful smell of her body after a shower mixing with the delicious aroma of chocolate while I enjoyed the beautiful texture of her nipples with my tongue. I flicked, and she moaned, intensifying further as I gently sucked. </p><p>She pushed me back, and for a moment, I felt surprised, but then she grabbed the bottle and sprayed the chocolate over my chest. I just smiled, leaning back to enjoy the way her lips caressed the contours of my muscles, her body still carrying the marks of chocolate. </p><p>The covers were going to get ruined badly, not that I cared much about that. Why would I, when I had a delicious redhead to spoil while her forcibly-submissive girlfriend was watching from several hundred miles away…   </p>
