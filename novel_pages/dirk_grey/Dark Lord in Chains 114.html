        <p>It was the blush that covered the face of the spy that allowed me to make that decision, so, as I noticed her trying to scuttle toward the door, I spoke. “Where’s this maid going without you dismissing her, my princess,” I asked loudly, and she stopped. </p><p>“He’s right,” Aria said, immediately following my clue even if she didn’t understand why I made such a request. She looked shy, but not enough to actually keep me down. “Stop.” </p><p>“I … My princess, I thought … I should leave you alone,” she muttered, panicking. </p><p>Her panic was welcome, as I could hear the hint of an accent in her tone. An unfamiliar one, which was more of a clue than I expected. I whispered something in Aria’s ear. “Just do what you’re asked, don’t improvise,” Aria said, trying to sound sharp, but sounding cute. “Or I might fire you,” she threatened, which didn’t even make her blink, which was something I expected. “… along with whoever actually hired you,” Aria added. </p><p>That worked much better, and I caught the widening of her gaze. Whoever hired her was her accomplice. Fantastic. </p><p>Aria would have noticed the irregularity of her reaction as well, if her attention wasn’t lost the way I was grabbing her breasts, far too interested in the immediate aspects of her pleasure to question why I asked a maid to stay. </p><p>“As you wish, princess,” the spy said, her voice tense, but not respectful, giving me another interesting direction about her personality. </p><p>“Good, finish cleaning, carefully, then bring a new tray,” Aria ordered, once again parroting my whispers while she moved closer, her plump ass rubbing against my erection, enjoying the way she shivered. “We need refreshments … to study properly.” </p><p>“Yes,” I said as I pushed her down against the desk, and pushed her dress down. “Study, just like my dear princess wants,” I said, doing my best to sound subservient. If the way the gaze of the spy jumped up with a sense of mercy was any indicator, she actually believed that. </p><p>That was, more than anything else, the evidence that I wasn’t dealing with a professional spy. So, even as she continued climbing, I started poking at her disguise magically. It was a subtle poke, and less about breaking it, and more about understanding the way she was maintaining it. Particularly, I wondered if it was an artifact, or if it was her personal ability. </p><p>Both options had advantages and disadvantages. An artifact lacked flexibility, but the ability to gear a spy like that implied the ability to field a lot of such artifacts. In comparison, the ability to cast such a spell would make a spy more immediately dangerous, but it would also mean that they might be desperate enough to risk a high-level spellcaster. </p><p>Risking an artifact, even an expensive one, had much more different implications than risking a top-tier caster. </p><p>Of course, there was also the possibility that they weren’t afraid of the security of the caster, but that was an even bigger and more dangerous problem. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I watched her blush, yet unable to keep her gaze away from us as I pushed Aria onto her private desk, her tits jiggling beautifully. It was an alluring sight, especially as I prepared to reveal my shaft. </p><p>Meanwhile, the maid-spy retreated, and Aria turned to face me. For a moment, I thought she would question me about what I was doing. </p><p>Instead, she took a second to get rid of her remaining items of clothing, relying on natural beauty before she fell on her knees, and applied the same treatment to my pants. As she did, there was a smile on her face, different than others I had seen. Still shy, but this time, it was underlined with an erotic confidence that was missing earlier. </p><p>She was getting more and more familiar with the true meaning of fun. </p><p>And wasn’t that a was a scary thought? </p><p>With her previous inexperience disappearing further with each meeting, she was turning out to be a dangerous opponent. “You wouldn’t mind helping me do the paperwork, right?” she murmured even as she dragged her finger over my naked erection, her tone gaspy enough to make me tremble. </p><p>“Whatever you wish, my princess,” I whispered back, enjoying the way her eyes shine as I called her mine. </p><p>I sat on her desk, and started working on the details of her paperwork, the details easy to decipher. </p><p>For all the differences in the ideology and other visible areas, the paperwork was nearly identical. </p><p>Amusing. </p><p>Of course, amusement I felt wouldn’t be enough to actually make me work on paperwork if the request came from someone else. But Aria was different — though, the fact she used her free time to cover my lap with her beautiful hair as a certain familiar warmth wrapped my length. </p><p>I leaned forward and actually started to complete paperwork, while her lips and her fingers made sure to keep turning that into a pleasurable activity. I murmured as the enjoyment hit me, enough to turn even the boring act of doing paperwork into something pleasurable. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>I hummed as the wetness around my girth spread further and further, turning the pleasure into a new stage. </p><p>As I heard the footsteps of the maid-spy, I decided to surprise her. Just as she was about to take the turn, I used my empty hand to push Aria down enough that she wasn’t visible when the maid entered. </p><p>“The princess is … gone?” she said, hesitant suddenly. </p><p>“Bring the tea, sweetie,” I said, enjoying her approach, even as I gathered my magic, ready to be released. Not to attack her, but to pull a prank. A dangerous prank … but a prank. “I’m feeling rather parched.” </p><p>“The princess?” she asked, hesitant, but as she failed to see Aria — the sound of her gags and gasps hidden behind a simple spell — I could see a dangerous expression appearing on her face. </p><p>“Are you planning to ask her something?” I said. “Or are you disappointed that you can’t see her naked?” </p><p>As I asked that, I was enjoying the sensation of Aria’s pretty mouth and throat as I pushed her down to the limit. Her hands were on my legs, but she didn’t try to push herself away, just enjoying the treatment as well. </p><p>“Of course not,” she said, her tone much less subservient as she walked toward me angrily, ready to deal with me without the presence of the princess. I could already feel some kind of magic brewing in her. One that I didn’t recognize — but still determine it was painful, but not deadly. </p><p>My little spy was clearly unhappy with the indignity she suffered. </p><p>Too bad for her I had already planned to counter her. “Too bad, she’s here,” I said as I chuckled, and removed the pressure from Aria’s head while I dispelled the silencing spell at the same time. Her head rose, her blonde mane dancing wildly. </p><p>A surprise reveal for our shy spy, though she reacted two ways. First, she lost control of her hands, and the tray she was carrying slipped out of her hands once more, traveling toward the ground with incredible speed. </p><p>Second, she lost control of the mana she was gathering. For an incompetent mage, it might have created a dangerous problem that might have caused an injury, yet for her, it was just a flare, one that was soft enough that even Aria didn’t notice. </p><p>But, it was enough for me to pull my trick. “Careful,” I said panickedly as I waved my hand, sending an incompetent — or, at least, seemingly incompetent — spell toward her, which kept the tray floating. </p><p>But also ripped up her dress, revealing her breasts in the process. </p><p>She gasped in shock as she covered her breasts — spectacular breasts, almost enough to rival Aria — which was amusing and cute. And, while seeing them was amazing, and complimented Aria’s amazing blowjob, even that was not my aim. It was also just a distraction. </p><p>No, out of control spell and its sexy effect was only a cover to dispel her disguise spell. Not completely — as I didn’t want to push her to a confrontation — but just disrupting for a second, one that gave me the truth of her looks. </p><p>What it revealed was arguably the prettiest face I had ever seen, maybe even to surpass the beauty that was between my legs, combined with striking silver hair and silver eyes, their shape-changing slightly, turning more exotic. The combination would have been my biggest focus if it wasn’t for another detail. </p><p>Her ears. </p><p>Her long, pointy ears. </p><p>Fascinating, I thought even as the spell settled back, confirming my guess about her identity. Now, I needed to decide what to do…</p>
