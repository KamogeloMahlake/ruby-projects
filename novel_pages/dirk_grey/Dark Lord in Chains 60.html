        <p>My tenseness slowly drained as I left the secret hideout of the phoenix behind. Despite the relative casualness of the conversation, during the whole duration of it, I was extremely tense. After all, just one mistake from my end, misreading one critical shift of emotion, and it would have turned into an explosive confrontation. </p><p>Still, I wasn’t able to relax completely. Her presence, along with the implication that there were others already in the dark families, turned the already complicated situation even worse. </p><p>However, despite the immensity of the situation, I decided to go back and rest. After everything that happened during one long day, I deserved it. All that needed to decide was where to rest. </p><p>My cell was always the safest option, but unfortunately, it was the least comfortable one as well. With Isolde imprisoned, and with Emma and Aria fully aware of the story, it only left the Queen, and with everything going on, she hardly had time to make an unscheduled visit. </p><p>I was tempted to go lay next to Aria, enjoying her soft, passionate embrace, but in the end, another destination won over. </p><p>Emma. </p><p>Emma’s bedroom had two advantages. First, she was still busy with her latest mysterious mission, which meant I would have an opportunity to restore my stamina. Second, and more importantly, once she arrived, I could not only interrogate her about her mission and the mysterious phoenix, but also see whether she had any knowledge I lacked. </p><p>And as a bonus, I could make her serve me as a punishment even as I interrogated her. </p><p>Decision made, I slipped into the palace once again, the defenses might as well be nonexistent after discovering several secret passages leading in and out. Soon, I was in Emma’s bedroom. A quick shower later, I established a couple of alert wards just in case, and lay on her bed. </p><p>Sleep was easy to attain… </p><p>And waking up was even easier, I thought groggily even as I felt a disturbance in the wards, alerting me. It was good to see one of the survival skills I hadn’t utilized much since I got my throne being useful once more.</p><p>Falling asleep and waking up quickly was an excellent tool to keep fresh during dangerous missions, or situations like warfare.  </p><p>At this ungodly hour that separated the night and the morning, I didn’t expect anyone other than Emma to visit, but with the situation getting more and more complicated, there was no harm in being careful. </p><p>I had dispelled the spell only after Emma entered the room, looking far too distracted to notice my presence even without the shadows. “Good morning, red,” I said with a mocking tone. </p><p>“G-good morning,” she stammered as she looked at me, her expression of shock beautiful. After the day she had, she was clearly expecting to rest as well. </p><p>Too bad I had other ideas. </p><p>For a moment, I said nothing, just enjoying the lingering expression of shock on her beautiful face as she looked at me, like she was trying to convince herself that it was a hallucination. Soon, it was replaced with a desperate realization as she realized she had to explain yet another instance of betrayal to me. </p><p>Honestly, at this point, her political betrayals had almost devolved into a comedic theater. </p><p>“You look surprised, why?” I said. </p><p>“I-I’m not,” she stammered. “It’s just that, it’s a bit late for a talk. Maybe we could talk after I slept.” </p><p>“Sorry about it,” I said with mock sincerity. “But it’s not going to take a long time. You can prepare for your bedtime even as you explain who was your latest mysterious backer.” </p><p>“N-no need,” she stammered as she blushed. “I can explain quickly. I don’t want to keep you from your rest as well.” </p><p>“Oh, such thoughtfulness, but there’s no need. Feel free to start stripping,” I said, my tone sharpening at the last word. I wanted to test the limits of my controls again, now that she might be feeling a touch rebellious after she had found yet another backer. </p><p>“O-of course,” she murmured even as she cast a spell to drag down the zipper of her dress. A sigh escaped her mouth, suggesting that she was already surrendering herself back under my control.</p><p>She turned her back before letting the dress fall. It slid freely until it stuck around her knees, revealing her beautiful silhouette, leaving the task of hiding her beautiful body to her corset and panties. Another spell, and her corset ended up the same way, leaving only her sexy panties to cover her body. </p><p>When she turned back to face me, her arm was around her chest, though unable to completely hide her cleavage, still showing some bruises, the signs of our earlier library adventure. </p><p>“Nice,” I murmured, even as I pointed to her panties, earning a beautiful sigh even as she pulled her hands away from her chest, dragging them down as well, revealing the unrestricted sight of her beautiful body, still shy despite everything that had happened between us. </p><p>Repeatedly. </p><p>“Now, why don’t you be a doll and pour me a drink, so that we can start talking about your latest betrayal,” I said, not bothering to weaken the situation. </p><p>It wasn’t surprising for her to stiffen suddenly, as no one enjoyed being called a traitor. Even if it was true, several times in that case. </p><p>Luckily, her anger was quick to drown under her developing submissiveness. It seemed that some authority and a sharp command was all that was needed to make her follow my orders. </p><p>Not that she had any option but to follow them in the first place, not if she wanted to hide her rapidly-increasing number of mistakes and outright betrayals. </p><p>She was trapped by her own lies and mistakes, forced to keep me happy to have even a hope of surviving the weight of her own mistakes. </p><p>“Quickly,” I ordered. “My throat is dry.”  </p><p>A rebellion tried to spark into life on her face, as I treated her like a maid, but it proved to be short-lived, surviving only for a second before getting doused by reality. She took a step toward the small bar in her room, her legs trembling, in shock and in anticipation in equal amounts. </p><p>“Good girl,” I murmured, and my compliment managed to earn a tremble, showing the depths of her growing submissiveness. </p><p>“As you wish,” she answered, verbally underlining her submission, her tone beautifully pliable. </p><p>She took a large step toward the destination, something I had a problem with. “Slower, beautiful,” I ordered. “Give me a show.” </p><p>That managed to earn an angry glare despite her submissiveness, but that was her limit. Her momentary rebellion died immediately as our eyes met, and it was followed by a saunter in the distance, in a visually pleasing manner. </p><p>Her naked ass swayed with every step, creating a beautiful sight that. I licked my lips to get rid of the sudden dryness. </p><p>There was a certain pleasure in using one of the strongest combat mages in the Empire as an erotic maid, serving me naked, and the revenge components made the situation even better. She filled the glass halfway, the delicious smell of expensive liqueur hitting my nose — though not expensive enough to worthy to be presented as a high-class supporter of the royal family, another snob from the Queen. </p><p>The implications about that intentional snub, and the impact on her betrayal vacated my mind as soon as her return journey started, her assets bouncing softly with each step, her breasts, just right size to fill my palms, firm enough to defy the commands of the gravity. I let my gaze slide down, caressing her beautiful skin from a distance, skimming her flat belly before focusing on the carefully shaved treasure between her legs.</p><p>I raised my gaze only after she closed in enough to pass me the glass. “Thank you, sweetie,” I said, intentionally stretching the last word to tease her. Poking her to test her submissiveness was a special kind of fun. </p><p>Anger flickered on her face once again, but once again, it was short-lived. “It’s not a bother, sir.” </p><p>“Smart girl,” I chuckled even as wrapped my arm around her naked waist, pulling her on my lap. She crossed her legs in an effort to hide even a bit of her modesty. Just a word was enough to prevent that from working, but I let that little defiance survive. </p><p>The sight of her with her legs crossed, her skin illuminated with the faint light coming from the window, the first rays of sunlight streaming through the thin curtains. </p><p>She looked delicious enough to eat. </p><p>I said nothing, letting the silence stretch as I took occasional sips, enjoying her presence on my lap, caressing her spine gently occasionally. I deliberately didn’t ask any questions, which was slowly making her tenser and tenser. From her expression, I could read that she was busy trying to cobble together a story. </p><p>It wasn’t just her beautiful yet conflicted face I watched, however. I paid equal attention to her body, my hand resting on her back softly, enjoying her soft trembles, curious what kind of story she would come up with. </p><p>I needed to come up with a decision on how to progress. </p>
