        <p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I know that, recently, you're a bit fed up with the constant changes I had been making on my Patreon, which is understandable.</p><p>However, this time, it's a nice one. I promise.</p><p>First, the polls. Since there's no 2$ tier anymore, the preference poll is no more.</p><p>Instead, I will have three polls, with guaranteed updates based on scores.</p><p><strong>Focus poll - 5$ tier: </strong>3 guaranteed chapters for the winner, 1 chapters for the runner up.</p><p><strong>Spotlight poll - 10$ tier: </strong>3 guaranteed chapters for the winner, 1 chapters for the runner up,</p><p><strong>Super poll - 25$ tier: </strong>3 guaranteed chapters for the winner, 1 chapters for the runner up, and 1 guaranteed chapter for the third.</p><p><strong>(Ties are determined by me, and the poll numbers are for the stories available for all patrons. For the moment, the visual stories and Villainous perks are not a part of it. )</strong></p><p>Additionally, I have decided to make some changes to my posting content. First of all, my current commitment (4 chapters for all Patrons, 2 chapters extra for 10$ tier, and 2 visual-supported stories for 10$ - with early access to 25$ tier) is going to stay. <em>I will even try to post 5 public stories and 3 chapters for some weeks, but that will be a bonus if I can manage it, but absolutely no promises about that yet. I need to try and see if I can handle it.</em></p><p><strong>In addition to that, i had started writing an a harem cultivation story that I enjoying quite a bit. I will be publishing a SFW wersion of that story on Royalroad. In Patreon, I will have advance chapters for that story (probably something like 10 chapters) + some NSFW chapters. However, please note that this story wouldn't be as dense in erotic content.</strong></p><p><strong>I will be aiming for three chapters each week for that story, and more importantly, I WON'T BE COUNTING ITS CHAPTERS TO MY GENERAL COMMMITTMENT. SO, ASSUMING i DON'T SCREW IT UP, WE'LL HAVE 10+ CHAPTERS EVERY WEEK.</strong></p><p><strong>I hope you guys are happy with those changes.</strong></p>
