        <p>Mark had to admit, seeing Laura in lingerie had awakened a fire that surprised him with its intensity, the kind he hadn’t felt for years. However, that didn’t mean he would just melt into a puddle, of course. So, after a moment of shock where he had been examining her body and murmuring in fascination, his instincts reasserted itself, and he started walking toward her, his steps enthusiastic and predatory despite his slowness. </p><p>Still, despite the fires of arousal burning freely, he had maintained enough presence of mind to continue observing her attitude as he walked closer, searching for any signs of retreat. As she stood in front of him, half-naked, she was a paradoxical mixture of confidence and fear, like a beautiful crystal work of art… Beautiful, but one rough mistake enough to shatter her completely… </p><p>And that fragility only made her more desirable… </p><p>He took another step forward, once again letting his eyes enjoy her surprisingly delicious body, stockings and garter belt framing her legs perfectly, her lacy black underwear thin enough to give a glimpse of the skin that lay behind. More importantly, he enjoyed the way she shivered as he examined her. Step by step, he got closer, watching as her excited trembling intensify. </p><p>Most importantly, however, he didn’t see any last-minute regret on her beautiful face… Which was all he needed to take the next step. She wanted him to teach her about the pleasures of the flesh. Well, he would teach her. </p><p>So, just when he was about to stand in front of her, he took another step, passing her, making her turn toward him with a shocked expression. He deliberately ignored her as he sat on the couch, patted the place next to him. “Let’s have a talk,” he said smoothly, proud of just how smooth and even he was able to keep his tone. </p><p>“O-okay,” she stammered cutely, caught flat-footed by the sudden change of pace, and prepared to sit next to him, only to let out a shocked cry when his arm wrapped around her waist at the last moment and pulled her on his lap. Her eyes widened in shock. “W-what are you doing?” she stammered. </p><p>He couldn’t help but smirk as her confidence and frustration melted into a fresh wave of panic. However, before he answered, he tightened his grip around her waist, making her let out another delicious gasp. “Why, helping you sit down before we have a little talk,” he said as he brought his face closer to her, their lips barely an inch apart. “Why, is there a problem with that?” </p><p> Laura swallowed, tempting him to leave a little bite on its expanse. “No,” she managed to gasp out. “No problem at all.” </p><p>“Excellent,” Mark whispered as he leaned forward to brush his lips against her, but pulled back before it became a proper kiss, leaving her panting in excitement, her heart beating like crazy. However, while he would have liked to say he had pulled back in favor of her, that would be a lie. Not when he felt like he was struck by lightning as his lips touched hers, his heartbeat fast enough to match hers. “I just have something to say before we start. Don’t forget that no matter what happens, you’re in control, and you can ask me to stop, delay, or slow down if you feel uncomfortable at any moment, without any concern. It’s all about you, understood?” </p><p>Laura just nodded obediently, her excitement after their almost-kiss preventing her from speaking. </p><p>“Excellent,” he whispered throatily. “Then, would you like to take the lead, or would you prefer me to take the lead?” he asked. </p><p>“You…” she managed to whisper. Mark was tempted to tease her about her sudden silence, but the temptation to tease her was nothing but a pale shadow compared to the desire burning in his heart to slowly unwrap her gift-wrapped body and enjoy her touch. </p><p>“As you wish, princess,” he whispered instead before leaning forward and capturing her lips in a searing kiss, finally allowing his body to do something he had been desiring since her coat had pooled around her body, triggering something in him. </p><p>It was not a soft, gentle kiss, despite his initial intention. It started that way, but soon, his body rebelled, disobediently intensifying the kiss, his tongue invading her mouth… </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>With his legs under her body, his muscular arms around her body, and his tongue in her mouth, Laura was lost… It wasn’t her first kiss. Even though none of them ended well, she had dated before, and she had kissed other people. </p><p>Or at least, she had thought so, until the moment she had felt Mark’s lips over hers. </p><p>A fire rose from her heart and quickly covered the rest of her body while her skin trembled like she had been struck repeatedly by lightning. If that was what being kissed was supposed to feel like, she was free to admit it was her first proper kiss as well… </p><p>She tried to wrap her tongue around Mark’s aggressive assault, only for her success to turn like snowflakes trying to survive against a roaring inferno. She just accepted his invasion passively, happy to be annexed. </p><p>Her hands, however, were a different story. They were almost hungry as they grabbed the hem of his shirt, pulling it off him. He obeyed the desire of her hands, and pulled back from the kiss for a moment as she freed his torso from the mercy of the fabric, before returning to the kiss with a vengeance, cutting off her breath. </p><p>As she enjoyed the renewed assault, her hands started exploring his torso, tracing every single muscle, sculpted through endless hours spent in the gym, shaped to perfection. Even before that fateful discussion, she had spent one than one night in her bedroom, enjoying a certain buzzing instrument while imagining how it would feel to caress those abs. At no point, however, she had thought that it could be anything other than a passing fancy. After all, she was just a little nerd with past trauma numerous enough to build a respectable-sized hill. </p><p>But despite that, she was in his apartment, sitting on his lap, dressed in lingerie that made her even more exposed than being naked, caressing the same muscles she had imagined endless times. </p><p>When he had finally pulled back after a certain amount of time —the most precise she could describe, as the moment felt both too quick and endless— she let out a desperate moan and leaned forward to continue, only to feel his finger on her lips, preventing her from restarting the kiss. </p><p>“Did I do something wrong!” she asked panickedly as her eyes widened, her mind immediately going to the worst place. Maybe he was dissatisfied by her incompetence. Maybe she didn’t taste good enough. Maybe he had changed her mind… </p><p>“No need to panic, princess,” he whispered. His tone was calm on the surface, but under that surface, she could feel something else bubbling. Something dark… </p><p>Something exciting… </p><p>Paradoxically, it wasn’t the calmness that prevented her from spiraling in panic, but the stirrings of a dark undercurrent, telling her that he wasn’t as calm about the kiss they shared as he would like to pretend. Heat pooled between her legs even before he leaned forward, this time pressing his lips against her neck. </p><p>At first, she had thought that he was just slowing things down. Being kissed in the neck was nice, she thought as his lips slowly trailed down, but it was nothing compared to the passionate kiss they had shared earlier. Still, she just accepted that, because it gave her a chance to fulfill another desire. She used the angle to her benefit, and started kissing his chest muscles, enjoying the same defined lines her fingers had been dancing over earlier with her lips. </p><p>As time progressed, she had realized one important mistake. She had underestimated the impact of his lingering kisses as he moved up and down over her neck, occasionally moving as low as her collarbone, sometimes climbing hard enough to leave a lingering touch on the line of her chin. Every single kiss was soft, fleeting, but soon, she realized that their impact was gathering together, turning her body into a furnace. </p><p>And that was before he had made a discovery, revealing a sensitive spot she had been unaware of. She moaned desperately as the pleasure started to invade her body in a way she had never thought possible. His fingers, gently dancing along her spine, focusing more and more on the small of her back, didn’t help her any in containing that unfamiliar feeling. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she gasped in shock as her back arched as her understanding about her own body had transformed completely. She had never thought such a thick pleasure was possible, especially not when her most sensitive spots were still hidden behind her underwear, untouched… </p><p>Then, much to her surprise, the domination of pleasure continued to get thicker and thicker, invading her whole being. A sudden brightness filled her field of vision as fireworks went off her brain. She closed her eyes firmly, but that didn’t help to curtail the brightness. Her body stiffened and loosened at the same time, invaded by a pleasure she had never felt before. Endless cries echoed against her ear, and it took a while for her to realize she was responsible for those cries. </p><p>Mark decided to silence her with another searing kiss, not that she was unhappy about it. She kissed him like she was drunk, trying her best to adapt to his rhythm. Lost in pleasure, she barely paid attention when his arms tightened around her waist and he stood up. She continued kissing him, lost in his touch, the only reaction of her was to wrap her legs around his waist, allowing him to carry her even easier, to an unknown location… </p><p>When she felt the comfortable texture of expensive linens, however, the realization hit her strong enough to cut through her haze. Although, the fact that he had finally pulled back from the kiss had played a role in them, giving her a chance to realize things were about to take a step she couldn’t turn back from.</p><p>Her clarity of thoughts didn’t survive for long, not when she had looked down to see his head between her legs, using his teeth to drag down her panties with torturous slowness, teaching her a new meaning of being in heat. She just enjoyed the moment. Then, after he pulled off her panties completely, he stood up, holding her panties between his fingers. “Are you ready for the next step, princess?” he whispered, his hungry grin arousing her more than everything else they had done until that moment. </p><p>“Yes,” she simply whispered… </p>
