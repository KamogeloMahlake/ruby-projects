        <p>Watching their amusing competition, it was hard to deny the temptation of loosening their chain and letting them continue, to see just how far they would push,, but I changed my mind after some consideration. </p><p>It was fun to watch them, but who knew what kind of bad habits they would develop if I let them go ahead with such a ridiculous habit. That was enough to swing my determination back to punish them. </p><p>I continued my walk, but my continued approach didn’t get their attention. I coughed pointedly even as I stood next to them, yet they continued to maintain their gaze, ignoring me. I chuckled even as I grabbed their hair, pulling to break their eye contact. “You know that you two are hurting my fragile male ego, ignoring me like that. How shameful.” </p><p>“Sorry,” Cinder stumbled immediately, blushing. </p><p>“Sorry, master,” Isolde said at the same time, her lips twitching in a victorious smile as she scored one over Cinder, declaring her emotions stronger than the bound phoenix.  </p><p>“Sorry, great master,“ Cinder tried to correct her reference, but only received a mocking smile from Isolde, amused by her delayed attempts to copy her. </p><p>“Amazing save,” I said, once again suppressing the temptation to let things continue and see how far those two would push each other as I forced their attention on me. It was an amusingly childish display considering their position in life, one that was interesting to see as the situation slowly evolved.  </p><p>I interrupted it. I raised my hand and cast a spell to direct their chains, tightening their hold to enhance the sense of discomfort. Raising my hand was completely unnecessary under the circumstances, of course, but it was more important to give the appropriate message.</p><p>“Now, let’s see which one of you will fold first,” I added as I walked around them, like a tiger that was circling a pair of appetizing yet trapped antelopes, deciding which to partake.</p><p>Well, partake first. </p><p>Of course, the metaphor not worked perfectly, as the antelopes in this case were competing to be eaten first rather than trying to escape. The increase in discomfort from the chains only increased their anticipation, their earlier competition already pushing them conveniently close to the edge. </p><p>I put my hand on Cinder’s bosom, enjoying the sensation of her flawless skin, a level that was only possible due to her supernatural heritage. I wondered just how many unlucky men had lusted after her, only to fail — a list that included our unlucky blonde friend — as I managed to steal a turn. </p><p>The harder I squeezed, the more satisfied Cinder looked, which made that a punishment. </p><p>Or more accurately, it would have made ineffective if it wasn’t for the beautiful jealousy of Isolde, making it more of her punishment. </p><p>The usefulness of their ridiculous competition was hard to overstate. </p><p>Caressing Cinder was fun, but I didn’t maintain my touch on her skin for long. After all, it was not just a punishment for her, but for them. I let my hand drift over Isolde’s breast, and grabbed her nipple. </p><p>“Tell me how the transformation felt,” I ordered to Cinder even as my touch pulled away, leaving her dangerously close to the edge.</p><p>“R-right now?” she asked. </p><p>“No, tomorrow,” Isolde interrupted immediately, her disobedient interruption earning a spank — though considering her enjoyment, not exactly a punishment.</p><p>“Yes, right now,” I said, deliberately letting Isolde’s interruption slide, as it made Cinder more annoyed than anything I could achieve in a few seconds. </p><p>“O-of course,” she stammered, trying to contain her frustration at Isolde’s daring at her reaction to me simultaneously. The poor girl clearly never had to deal with such complicated feelings at the same time. </p><p>As I put my hand on Isolde’s body, dancing freely to push her closer toward the climax, Cinder started talking. “It felt powerful and … liberating,” she muttered. “Like everything was supposed to feel. I just need to think, and the living fire obeying my requests immediately.” </p><p>I quirked my eyebrow. “Really, is obeying the right word?” I asked, remembering the sensation.</p><p>That looked tough for her to answer. “Yes—“ she started reflexively before she cut herself, a thoughtful expression on her face. “I’m not sure,” she murmured. </p><p>I chuckled at her confusion, which was not helped by Isolde’s excessively loud moans. They were not entirely fake, as, under the steady treatment of my fingers, her steady travel toward a climax continued steadily, but Isolde’s usual response certainly lacked that erotic undertone. She was pushing it just to annoy Cinder more. </p><p>“Maybe you should have a better understanding of what obedience is,” I said, which put a frown on Cinder’s face, and the opposite expression on Isolde's. “For example, what this little disobedient girl is showing here is certainly not obedience.” </p><p>That put a thoughtful spin on Cinder’s feelings as she paused, while Isolde widened her gaze. “Wait —“ she said as she widened her gaze, but that was all she was able to say as my fingers moved down and slipped inside her wetness, pushing her toward the climax. </p><p>With her body pushing toward the climax, Isolde didn’t bother arguing with my comment, more than happy with the direction things were going. Yet, despite her apparent happiness, Cinder had a mocking smirk on her face. Because, unlike Isolde,  she was magically sensitive enough to catch the spell I had cast on her. </p><p>One that Isolde only realized when her pleasure built up enough to trigger a climax…</p><p>Only to continue building.</p><p>“N-no,” she managed to stammer in shock before I cast a silencing spell on her, silencing. Normally, I would have prevented silencing her physically, but considering her distaste, the silencing spell would push the distaste even deeper. </p><p>Her distaste was Cinder’s happiness. </p><p>“Think of it as an example. What this little servant was displaying was not obedience but rebellion, no matter how much she tried to cloak it as obedience. Now, why don’t you try and give me a better definition.” </p><p>Cinder looked at Isolde for a moment, clearly wanting to gloat about her temporary victory, but her arrogance was not enough to ignore how Isolde ended up, silently begging for a climax under my fingers.</p><p>While also providing an excellent example that resistance to pain was based on different attributes than resistance to pleasure. Isolde was strong enough to resist torture for days…</p><p>But under pleasure, it took minutes for her to collapse.</p><p>“I think … the best way to call the attitude of living fire is … indulgence,” Cinder finally mumbled an answer, her pauses showing that she wasn’t entirely confident in her conclusion. </p><p>“Tell me more,” I said even as I twisted Isolde’s nipple, pressing against her back to enjoy her trembles, stretching our little teasing game even more. </p><p>“Ordinarily, living fire is hard to control, willful, and requires respect…”  she murmured. “But after the transformation, it’s different. I just need to think for a second, and the fire is jumping to follow my request with great urgency, without even waiting for a second. Almost like a …” she said, though her explanation faded halfway.</p><p>Almost like a doting relative, I completed it in my mind, but didn’t vocalize it. It was a complicated topic, one that was best not examined while … drilling into other subjects. </p><p>“Interesting, a topic to be examined another time,” I murmured. “I prefer to focus on punishing my obedient servant first,” I said, shifting my focus on Isolde. </p><p>Cinder reacted as I expected. First with entertained satisfaction, but as my treatment stayed focused on Isolde’s naked body, jealousy started to rear its head again. After all, she was still chained, naked, and on the edge, and watching her ‘enemy’ tortured by pleasure was hardly the most helpful view to suppress her arousal. </p><p>“Do you want to help me teach her a lesson?” I offered to help her. </p><p>“Yes, I would,” she answered immediately, which added to Isolde’s despair. Cinder looked at her chains happily as she felt them weaken their hold. </p><p>But her enthusiasm died as quickly as she realized she misunderstood the slackening of the chains. Rather than letting her go free, it pushed her down to her knees, her arms pulled to her back. </p><p>Right in front of Isolde’s wetness.</p><p>She raised her head, shock dancing in her amber eyes as she caught her gaze. Although, the fact that it was the shock and not fury showed just how far we had come in such a little time. “Oh, didn’t you want to punish her?” I asked in amusement. “With her current state, that’s the most excellent way to do so. Imagine the torture she would experience as you help me?”</p><p>“Still…” Cinder murmured as she avoided my gaze, clearly confused. My words were correct, as it was the most excellent way for her to take revenge on Isolde, and pay back for the grudge she had accumulated.</p><p>But to do so, she needed to take a supplicant role, one that was deeply humiliating. </p><p>I showed her a hint of mercy as I continued to work on Isolde. I twisted her nipple once more while considering just how much time I should give my little phoenix to come to a decision.</p>
