        <p>“What a nice, obedient phoenix I have,” I said as I leaned down, my legs on both sides of her while I grabbed her arm. “You earned a proper reward,” I said. </p><p>“R-really,” she muttered, her innocent expression greatly contrasting with the one she wore while looking at Isolde. </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I leaned down, capturing her lips in a searing kiss, Isolde’s taste still distinct on her lips as my tongue invaded her mouth, earning her murmurs. I pulled back, looking at her naked body while she panted. </p><p>The idea of a reward wasn’t exactly repulsive. </p><p>I said nothing else as I grabbed her hips, while a flare of magic commanded the chains that still kept her prisoner, pulling her arms to display her body perfectly. She looked good in chains. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I wasn’t tempted to continue teasing her despite her cooperation, entertaining myself more as I entertained her, but, ultimately, I decided to be faster. Our little trip had already taken a great deal of time, and with everything going on, staying away from the capital for such a long time was not the smartest decision. </p><p>At least, not without a sudden change of mind to abandon the dangerous waters of the capital. </p><p>“Take a deep breath, and prepare yourself for your reward,” I whispered. </p><p>“D-don’t I get to pick my reward—“ she said, interrupted by my finger pressing against her lips. </p><p>“Are you saying I’m incapable of picking you the correct reward?” I asked. The shiver she displayed was simply beautiful. She shook her head, fear and anticipation battling. </p><p>“Excellent,” I whispered even as I put my hands on her knees, slowly widening them. “You need to take a big breath and relax, so that you enjoy it properly.”</p><p>“As … as you wish,” she whispered as her legs parted, revealing her beautiful wetness. </p><p>I dragged my gaze up, first focusing on her heaving bosom, then her face, displaying her surrender. </p><p>“Better,” I whispered, which added another blush on her face, her lips already parted with desire. It was a beautiful moment, her rebellious aggression melted completely, leaving its place for a desire for endless pleasure. </p><p> She started trembling even as I brushed my finger to her entrance, my lips pressing against her neck for a string of gentle kisses, occasionally turning into bites that would leave lingering marks of my ownership until I let her magic free. </p><p>But the important thing was her memory. </p><p>My hands continued to dance at her entrance, preparing her for invasion. Not that it took a long time. Not when our foreplay had taken long enough to collapse Isolde. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” she gasped as I pushed my hips slowly, invading her once more, the chains shifting their shape to put her in a more convenient position. As the head slipped, and I stopped, she tensed. “P-please,”  she gasped. “I can’t wait anymore.” </p><p>I chuckled. “You’re lucky that we need to return to the capital, or you would have earned a lengthy delay,” I whispered. Her transgression wasn’t enough to lose her reward, but there was no harm in creating borders. </p><p>“T-thanks,” she stammered, which melted into a moan as I pushed forward, sliding inside her mercilessly, leveraging her chained position perfectly. </p><p>“So soft,” I whispered, teasing her even as I pushed myself even deeper, enjoying the way she tightened around me in a way that wasn’t supposed to be possible, showing her magical heritage wasn’t only useful for efficient fire magic. </p><p>“Don’t—“ she gasped before a moan interrupted her, as I chose that moment to impale her harshly, followed by a slap into her ass, that, even a day ago, would have resulted in a murder attempt. </p><p>It was fascinating how several amazing sessions of lovemaking and a magical transformation could achieve.</p><p>She said nothing else after the interruption, focusing on her moans. “Better,” I said even as I followed the temptation and slapped her breasts, enjoying the way they swayed. It earned another beautiful moan. Her fiery amber eyes turned to me, clouded with excitement and desire.</p><p>It was always nice to see just how far she was surrendering to pleasure. She let herself go soft, her shivering body a masterpiece. I rammed her even harder, earning another moan as I explored her depths, making my shaft disappear completely with each rhythmic thrust, sinking into her warm depths. </p><p>It wasn’t the first she was stretching under my assault, but her moans were still as enthusiastic, especially after I shifted my grip to her hips, creating an even better angle with the help of the chains. </p><p>I said nothing else, enjoying the sway of her tits under my assault, the angle enhancing their reaction to my relentless fucking even further. I decided to loosen my control over her magic, and immediately, her body was covered with flames. Bright with their new accessory, they danced and tumbled, creating a masterwork of art as she held onto the melting chains. </p><p>Though, even as the chains disappeared and she pressed her hands on the ground to stay in position, her beautiful ass jingled no less impressively with each thrust, her body adapting to my rhythm.  </p><p>She let out a moan, unadulterated with nothing, filled with pure pleasure. “It looks like you’re loving your reward,” I whispered.</p><p>“Oh, the living flame! Yes!” she moaned, her words carrying the slur of exhaustion as I rammed hard. It seemed that, with everything that happened, even her magic was not enough to completely resolve her exhaustion.</p><p>“I don’t know,” I murmured jokingly. “Maybe you can use a break, you sound tired.”</p><p>“No!” she managed to gasp between her moans, her voice filled with an urgency that showed she wasn’t willing to take the risk of treating it like a joke. </p><p>Beautiful.  </p><p>“If that’s your wish,” I said, amused by her reaction as I picked up speed, even more, her legs spreading enough to show the impressive limits of her flexibility... </p><p>I smiled as the sound of our hips colliding filled the meadow, enjoying her total surrender. Her back arched under the pleasure as her tits pointed at the sky, every vigorous slam making her body rock dangerously. </p><p>Pity I didn’t have enough time to see the full limits of her endurance without relying on some tricks. I cast another spell, creating a pair of ice cubes to dance around her nipples. Her flames tried to melt, but I maintained a constant flow of mana to maintain their cold. </p><p>The contrast with her flames made her moan even louder. </p><p>With the assistance of my trick, the steady drilling worked even more effectively, adding another contender for the most erotic moments of my life, her identity making it even more spectacular.</p><p>As I doubt many could claim to have tamed a rebellious phoenix. </p><p>Her tightness suddenly intensified, grabbing my presence even tighter than my chains, warning me that it was time to end it. I slammed into her for one last time, the sound mixing into her desperate cries as the climax hit her hard, leaving her a trembling mess. </p><p>My body responded in kind, filling her insides with my mark. Similarly, our magical connection throbbed with energy, tightening our link even more. It was not as significant as the previous time, but considering it came with some magical improvement, it was hard to write it off as insignificant as well. </p><p>I didn’t expect a reward back, at the end of our session, not that I was complaining. </p><p>Power meant freedom, and more only meant it would be easier for me to protect my destiny. </p><p>I chuckled as I glanced at her, her eyes closed as she was overwhelmed with pleasure mixing with the exhaustion of her transformation.  </p><p>Unfortunately, unlike them, I didn’t have the luxury of sleeping. First, I walked around, reinforcing the wards, which had been strained by our constant efforts, then turned my attention to other aspects, erasing the remains of our presence — particularly any flickers of living flame, my own sensitivity helping to catch those.</p><p>I didn’t want anyone to come here, marking that. </p><p>Yet, as I pulled that mana, a sudden instinct hit me, and I raised my hand, letting the fires cover it for a moment. “A devastating weapon,” I murmured even as I suppressed the flames, immediately feeling the tenseness of pressure after the disappearance.</p><p>A devastating but risky weapon. Still, better having than not having, I decided.</p><p>I turned to look at Cinder and Isolde. </p><p>My little trip had been more useful than I expected. </p>
