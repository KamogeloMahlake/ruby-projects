        <p>“It was a good warm-up,” I whispered. “Now, are you ready for the real punishment?” </p><p>The way her almond eyes widened was simply divine. Her lips parted open. “Real punishment—“ she tried to ask, which died as my tongue invaded her mouth, and my arms closed on her back, which kept her in place as I twisted and turned. </p><p>And she found herself looking at the roots of the tree above us, pointing from the roots. A nice, comfortable position for her to enjoy the show … while giving me absolute control over the process. </p><p>I wanted that to get a better feeling of the connection. A connection that was, even at its weakest, complicated enough to overwhelm me if I allowed that to flow completely. </p><p>I was not in a hurry to let that connect fully. Instead, I pushed, a cute moan escaping Seldanna’s mouth despite my tongue, the position allowing me to invade her fully at my own pace. With my tongue in her mouth, she lacked the ability to say anything… </p><p>Not that she was trying to say anything in the first place, not when she was more than happy to let me take control. As she abandoned herself to my touch, I enjoyed the feeling — pity I couldn’t fully enjoy it, not when I could feel our connection growing slightly, but enough to matter. </p><p>Pity I lacked the necessary stats to understand the fluctuating, confusing nature of the connection.  </p><p>I was familiar with splitting my attention, so even without the full force of my old stats to support me, balancing the carnal and magical aspects of our little dance was not a challenge — especially since my innocent priestess seemed to be happy with the repeated invasions, not looking for any frill. </p><p>Ecstatic even, I corrected myself after pulling back from the kiss, and her cries exploded enough to strain my ears — a beautiful strain, naturally, especially with the rhythmic dance of her breasts, as if they were musical instruments to accompany her cries. </p><p>I had to admit, elves — at least, the spectacular example of her race in front of me — had a natural sense of grace, so even as I invaded her repeatedly, the rhythm of her cries and the sway of her breasts stayed synchronized. </p><p>A beautiful private show, I had to admit. Or at least, that was what I had thought … then, her mana started to get wild. </p><p>My little hideout was already drenched with a lot of nature mana, which was an inevitable consequence of the position at the center of a magical forest that was doing its best to convert an incredible amount of mana from Aether…</p><p>Which meant, there was a lot of mana for Seldanna to use. When the vines burst out of the ground, for a moment, I thought that we would repeat our earlier dance — which was not something I was entirely against it — but then, every single vine burst out flowers, with colors that I had struggled to imagine, covering every inch of the room. </p><p>A little cosmetic change, I thought at first, about to ignore, but as she used that, I felt our connection tremble, strengthening slightly once more. Interesting, I thought. I tried to make sense of it, which was rather difficult while being distracted by pretty colors and even prettier cries. </p><p>“Someone is feeling naughty,” I said as I rolled off the bed, our bodies still connected. It would have been painful, but the floor was already covered with flower petals thanks to her out-of-control spell.</p><p>“S-shut up,” she muttered. “It was an accident. I was … excited.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said with a chuckle, and reflexively sent a little sliver of magic into her. I was glad about it, because I noticed a little change, where her little sea of Divine Spark was resting. It was a subtle change, one that I might have failed to notice if I wasn’t watching in real-time, but I could see the borders of the energy, getting subtler. </p><p>For a moment, I was afraid that the border had been weakening, which certainly wouldn’t have ended nicely. I was ready to stop and help her recover — even if I had to take back most of her Spark, but the collapse I expected didn’t happen. </p><p>I was afraid, because the Divine Sea was similar to the Soul Space of the System. </p><p>For Soul Space, the borders were everything. The stronger they were, the higher the limit, and there was less chance of a collapse — which was deadly, as the experimentation on my enemies had shown.</p><p>Yet, Divine Sea acted differently. As the borders had weakened, I could sense her control over it was strengthening. Not an incredible jump, but then, the changes in the borders weren’t significant either. Just a change that could be measured by percentages… </p><p>The impact was clear, making me glad that I didn’t try to elevate her to the next level by using the same trick of the God Tree on her. I already had the idea such a thing might be bad — as the situation of my dear headmistress and her attempt showed — but still, having evidence was nice. </p><p>As I examined the way she interacted with Divine Spark, I could see that there was a fundamental difference between the Guardian Trees and somewhat with the soul. Compared, it wouldn’t be unfair to classify the Guardian Trees, or the current God Forest, as artifacts.</p><p>Artifacts were capable of autonomous activities, even decisions, but there was a gap between that and sapient beings. </p><p>I took a note not to let Seldanna absorb more Divine Spark before I get a sense of what was going on…</p><p>Then turned my full attention back to the fun side of my experiment, and continued impaling her in a thick bed of petals and flowers, her face contorted with pleasure, unaware of her slowly growing power. </p><p> “So, what do you think, is your punishment working as intended?” I asked. Her answer came in the form of a beautiful moan, loud enough to create a spectacular scandal if we weren’t conveniently underground. </p><p>“Mmm, not as good if you are failing to answer,” I said, chuckling at the panic on her face as she suddenly found herself empty. Luckily for her, I wasn’t in the mood to tease her. I paused just enough to grab her legs and bring them to my shoulders, giving myself an even better angle. “Let’s try something more interesting.” </p><p>Her moans got even more intense as the new angle allowed me to invade her even more aggressively, her moans filling the place spectacularly. </p><p>A beautiful and memorable event for a beautiful first time. Playing with my shy priestess was certainly fun even without the surprise magical advantages and disadvantages… I picked up speed even more even as I decided to turn the sensuality up a bit more. I leaned down and pressed my lips against her neck, her moans rumbling against my neck. Her back arched as her legs wrapped around my waist tightly, helping me to pull even more. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk in satisfaction as she started to get more and more intense. </p><p>Her moans intensified as I moved down. First, I nibbled her collarbone, earning a sharp cry. Then, I arrived at her gloriously round breasts, assaulting her nipples with my teeth to add some edge. As the red marks on her breasts increased, so did her cries. </p><p>The magical side of things got even more interesting as she climbed toward her second climax, as I could sense some of my Divine Spark being pulled. </p><p>{-1 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>It wasn’t an intense pull, certainly not something I couldn’t prevent if I wished so, but I let it move, and feel it settle in between her and me. A soft line, flickering and almost invisible.</p><p>But most importantly, not in the material plane. No, the connection actually extended between us through the Astral plane. </p><p>Interesting, I thought even as I flipped her on all fours, her back arching erotically while her tits swayed with each hit, the slaps invading the room. My thrusts were aggressive as her moans filled the room once again. </p><p>“A good finish, right!” I whispered as the pleasure started to get too much for me, and exploded inside her. I pulled her hair back even as I did so, filling her insides with my energy…</p><p>And feel the connection get even stronger… </p><p>{-10 Purified Divine Spark}</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes,” she started moaning as another climax hit her, the unfamiliar pleasure enough to push her to the land of unconsciousness.</p><p>“Beautiful,” I murmured as I carried her back to the bed, enjoying her graceful looks in the room filled with flowers. I wanted to stay and enjoy it, but after some thought, I decided against it. </p><p>The undead had just attacked us with a renewed attack, and I expected them to come toward us with an even bigger strength in a few days. Going to scout was risky … but the benefits were tempting as well. </p><p>Especially since I finally had a safe-spot for to teleport back…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 8    Charisma: 10</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 12</p><p>Agility: 8     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 8       Intelligence: 10</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 9}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 399}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 2869  Mana: 7331}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>Guardian God Forest - 2050}</p><p>Elven Priestess - 70}</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>
