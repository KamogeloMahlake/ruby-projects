        <p>I didn’t have to wait for long before a doctor arrived for the daily check-up because it was one of the things I had prepared for. I had already left a note on my chart to require one. </p><p>It was important for him to come and diagnose me, and not just because of the requirements of the System, or the possible boredom of lying on my bed for days without doing anything. No, I needed it, because I had already sent several emails to the local tabloids from the account of one of the doctors, alluding to some interesting scoop that would pay out. </p><p>I wasn’t ready to reveal some kind of superhero ability, but I was hoping that, the sudden awakening of a local hero after four years should earn me a middle-page story at least, hopefully with some references to my ‘incredible’ football victories. </p><p>Though, it wasn’t just the potential Intent that mobilized me. The more visibility I had, the more suspicious for me to suddenly disappear in a government facility. Not impossible, of course, so even now, I was prepared for a bunch of men wearing dark suits…</p><p>But there was no harm in making their jobs harder. </p><p>Fifteen minutes after the previous visit, a grumbling doctor arrived, mumbling about useless nurses and wrong measurements. “Like a coma patient is going to just wake up suddenly,” he said as he put his hand on my pulse, then suddenly shouted. “Nurse!” </p><p>A nurse arrived, one that made me wish that I was not faking unconsciousness. Even in scrubs, she looked amazing, though she was busy looking scared. “Yes, doctor,” she called. </p><p>“What’s going on here,” the doctor shouted angrily. “There’s something wrong with his pulse. No coma patient should have such a wild heartbeat. Which idiot decided to give him unauthorized drugs.” </p><p>“I … I don’t know, sir. He’s a new transfer. Maybe he’s waking up?” </p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous, after four years, right after he was transferred. Go check the ambulance records and see if those morons had given —” he continued. </p><p>I decided it was a good time, so I let out a soft but audible groan. The nurse froze while the doctor took a step forward, already lifting one of his pens while he pulled back my eyelid. I didn’t try to suppress my reaction. “I’ll be damned. He’s actually waking up,” he said. </p><p>“It’s fascinating,” the nurse said.  </p><p>She might find that fascinating, but not as much as I found her beautiful blonde hair framing her face, or her incredible hourglass figure that showed itself even with her scrubs that were two sizes too big. </p><p>Just like that, I felt a trickle of Intent flowing to me. Not much from the doctor, his shock momentary, but there was a stronger flow from the nurse. I immediately grabbed that flow before the System could devour it, and pushed it toward the Doctor, one that I tried to turn into a suggestion while channeling my Tactics ability.</p><p>It wasn’t much to work with, but I still achieved some. </p><p>Fascinatingly, it worked. “Arrange a private room for him,. Also, make sure he’s presentable for visitors, I’m sure his family would love to see him,” he said. </p><p>The nurse left the room, unaware the doctor had a different idea. The moment the nurse left, he pulled his phone and called someone from the press. A friend from a local TV channel, it seemed, considering the ease with the doctor offered a delicious meal in exchange for a news story about his incredible medical skills. </p><p>Better. I had only reached out to tabloids, because I didn’t think even the local channels would send a crew to the hospital. But, since the doctor clearly knew the reporter, it worked much better. </p><p>The ease the discussion progressed suggested that it wasn’t the first time.  The reporter questioned several times whether it was true that I had been in a coma since the event. That made me tense for a moment, but I lost that fear once he clarified the details. </p><p>Apparently, he wanted to make an interview while he delivered the changes, to record my shock and dismay about the changes, hoping to get some screen time in the evening news. I could hear the excitement of the reporter, suggesting that it was not a cover story but something real. </p><p>It was truly gutter-level reporting. Jostling a coma patient who had just woken up in such an emotional way was a very dangerous thing. Luckily, </p><p>For a moment, I considered whether TV news was a step too much, but then I decided to let it go just like that. Anyone that I feared about alerting would learn my awakening even if I tried to keep it local, so there wasn’t any point in keeping things low. </p><p>And, if things devolved into a dangerous chase, I rather have more Intent to keep my System fed … and weaponize if necessary. </p><p>Only after a long talk, the doctor continued to check my results. “Miracle doctor cures coma patient immediately,” he murmured, followed by some medical terms as he continued to check me, practicing for an interview, to the point of ignoring some critical steps even I knew. </p><p>Which was certainly not justifiable by the little push I managed to push to his head. It looked like I got a true glory hound. </p><p>Lucky. </p><p>He continued to make my cheeks, and I gave him some more signs of waking up. The nurse returned with two orderlies that helped me to move to a stretcher and brought me to the private room. </p><p>“Stay with him, and make sure not to tell him anything if he wakes up —” he started, before a security guard arrived. “What, newspapers, already?” he said, looking alarmed. ”Don’t let them in,” he ordered as he called his friend. “You need to come quickly. Someone else leaked the story to the papers already. I’ll keep them away but…” he started. </p><p>Excellent. Nothing like a friendly competition to blow up the news unnecessarily. </p><p>Just to be sure, I used the scraps of Intent my small audience generated to give him another push,, making him panic slightly so that it would be obvious he was trying to hide something while he talked with the press. </p><p>The nurse didn’t look happy about the attitude of the doctor, but she followed the stretcher as the orderlies moved me to a private room, which was nice enough for a hospital, but certainly not a VIP one. </p><p>I remembered the last room I occupied in a hospital. It was much better, especially when the two nurses decided to give me an amazing show wearing my jerseys. Of course, at that time, I was a local hero that finally brought them a long-sought victory. </p><p>Pity. </p><p>As I lost myself in my memories, the orderlies put me on the bed and left, leaving me alone with the nurse, who closed and locked the door. “Now, let’s give you a sponge bath,” she said as she approached with the necessary equipment. </p><p>However, the moment she pulled my gown down to my waist, she gasped. I didn’t need to hear her voice to know the source of her shock, the particular tinge of her Intent was quite familiar. </p><p>Lust. </p><p>Pity even with that intensity, it wasn’t enough to move the needle in the Intent counter, showing that even the smallest unit was not small. Still, I let the System devour it. Even the smallest touch mattered. </p><p>“Wow, how do you still have muscles,” she murmured as she dragged her fingers over my chest, though her voice was more filled with fascination than suspicion. Which was a bit absurd, as it was something that a nurse should pay more attention to. </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder whether she was that terrible as a nurse … or it was that weird mental flicker that I had felt when I arrived at the city, one that suggested people ignore anything too extreme. </p><p>Maybe my suspiciously stable muscles after four years were a part of it. </p><p>Either way, I was happy that I didn’t need to spend an hour while they tried to understand that particular detail. As for the public … I rather look good and suspicious than damaged and sincere. </p><p>I had long learned that pity was a terrible way to generate Intent. </p><p>The nurse continued to use the sponge to wash my body, but I didn’t miss the fact that her sponge had been dragging over my chest more times than it was necessary, and lingering for longer and longer, feeling the echo of her lust growing. </p><p>I stayed unconscious for a while more, curious whether she would do something … naughtier, but she decided to stay in a controlled manner instead, showing that her lingering lust wasn’t enough for her to violate her medical ethics. </p><p>I would have left her alone, but time she reached the other side, her scrubs rode up, showing her beautiful and toned legs. If it wasn’t for the control granted to me by the Divine Body, I would have been sporting a huge mast. Even now, it was a challenge to keep it suppressed. </p><p>I had been planning to fake unconsciousness for a while more, timing it better for the arrival of the news crews, but she was beautiful enough to make an exception. </p><p>I made a show of groaning as I opened my eyes, curious whether her medical ethics would still hold her back while I flirted back. </p>
