        <p><em><strong>And here is another test shot, this time with multiple angles and dresses. I hope everyone enjoys it. </strong></em></p><p>Stephen "Are you ready for the next dress, Nancy?"</p><p>Nancy "I don't know. It seems a bit ... revealing. Maybe we should go skip that." </p><p>S "We can, but if we do that, the rest of the shot will be ruined. And I think that, after the last time, it shouldn't be a problem." </p><p>N "Okay... Just give me a minute." </p><p>...</p><p>S "You look excellent. Now give me a pose." </p><p><img data-media-id="33744498" src="/bb/4a/bb4adff8078e638ca32faadb0e0d0aef4ce64f9c05fc2332285655482ca3c72e.jpg"></p><p>N "How was it?" </p><p>S "Excellent.

Just give it another try." </p><p><img data-media-id="33744521" src="/f7/64/f764b913797c231987876a6331e4d06cd4882656b7637a1c966477490b1b0ab3.jpg"></p><p>N "Stephen, I can't find the skirt of this outfit." </p><p>S "Because there isn't any. What you have found is all of it." </p><p>N "But-"</p><p>S "Don't worry. I'm going to use an angle that doesn't reveal anything." </p><p>N "Promise?" </p><p>S "Promise." </p><p><img data-media-id="33744534" src="/71/c8/71c855f7afab4abdec9638c543a3fba2f3fe26090a2336ebcedc604c366d7c03.jpg"></p><p>N "You're sure that you can't see anything, right?" </p><p>S "For the fifth time, Nancy, yes, you're completely covered. Now, focus on the shot." </p><p><img data-media-id="33744538" src="/52/7c/527c6e6986f01fd7ca59a93dff7c8349e4f6a8b46bd8c6fdcf623a166be81308.jpg"></p><p>S "And that was the end."</p><p>N "Turn your back, I need to put on my gown." </p><p>S "Okay." </p><p><em>Click</em></p><p>N "What was that flash."</p><p>S "Don't worry, it was just the capacitors of the flash discharging. It didn't take a photo." </p><p><img data-media-id="33744541" src="/8f/df/8fdf9749cd3e022fb6e35b133eaaaa4f5b6247b12a8dc7ab54fd421eb0dbbd51.jpg"></p><p>S "It was an excellent set, don't you think so, Nancy?" </p>
