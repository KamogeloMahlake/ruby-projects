        <p>Olivia was already watching my glistening body with a shocked expression, and leaning forward while my arms prevented her from extracting herself from the positing only enhanced the domineering weight I was displaying. </p><p>In her eyes, I could see that, for the first time tonight, she had realized that I was more than another slave, wild and strong, capable enough to destroy her before she could let out a spell. And with no servants to rely on, even if she tried to call for help, that wouldn’t have helped her. </p><p>Watching as I dominated her friend — who belonged to arguably the strongest Patrician family in Rome — only drove that message deeper into her subconsciousness. </p><p>Against me, she was completely helpless. </p><p>However, that realization only made her nipples push harder against her dress. Her breathing got faster, her eyes widened, but rather than leaning against her wall which would display her desire to escape, she took a small step forward, almost automatic, her gaze locked to my face. </p><p>“You’re different than I expected,” she said, unable to hide a hint of fear infecting her tone, but that was nothing compared to the thickness of arousal that was dominating her tone. </p><p>“In what way, my dear mistress?” I said with a thick mocking tone even as I leaned forward to let my breath fall on her neck, making her tremble. “Is my barbarian ways are getting a bit overbearing for your delicate civilized senses.” </p><p>“I could cut your tongue for insolence,” she answered, trembling as she said so. </p><p>“It’s your right, mistress, but wouldn’t it be a waste,” I said. </p><p>“Waste, how-” she started, only to be interrupted by an aggressive kiss where my tongue played the main role, displaying the usefulness of said appendage directly. She moaned as her body was locked between the wall and my body, shivering helplessly as I ravaged her mouth. </p><p>“So, do you still want to cut my tongue, mistress,” I said mockingly even as I caressed her lively red hair.</p><p>She didn’t answer immediately, trying to control her breathing, the remainder of her composure shattered completely under the domination of my lips. She raised her head, her lips bruised through the aggressive kiss, forming a pout as she breathed rapidly, trying to fight against the heat that was filling her body. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, breathing was hardly the solution for that heat. I had the solution, and much to her misfortune, I had no intention of giving her the solution immediately. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she growled once she managed to tame her breathing to a degree, her hands on my chest, her nails trying to bite into my chest, though unlike what she might have expected, the pain was negligible. “I can easily execute you.” </p><p>I smirked, knowing it wouldn’t have been that easy to do so. Yes, she was the heiress of an important family, and could easily kill a junior noble with little to no social backlash, but ironically, my identity as a gladiator protected me more. After today’s showing, I was a rising commodity, meaning if she wanted to kill me, she would owe a lot of money to the gladiator school, and paying it would be a matter of reputation for her family. </p><p>The irony was not lost on me. </p><p>Still, it was just an absentminded though, because even as she made that threat, she pressed her body against me as if she was trying to memorize the lines of my body through sensation. “It’s your right, mistress,” I said as I put my hands on her waist. </p><p>“Have mercy, mistress,” I said even as I tugged her dress, which came off easily thanks to its softness, displaying a delicious view in the process. She didn’t even react to my daring move, as after watching a number of her noble peers being fucked into oblivion, she was already burning with desire, and our latest kiss hardly helped. </p><p>“Maybe, but you need to work hard to earn that forgiveness,” she said, trying to sound haughty and impervious, but unable to hide the neediness in her tone in the process, making her less like a noble existence that was supposed to belong to the highest echelons of Roman Republic, and more like a horny peasant daughter hoping for a muscular farmer to tend to her needs. </p><p>I was tempted to tease her for hours until I could make her admit that to herself, begging for me for hours for the mercy of an orgasm…</p><p>Too bad that I had an actual mission for coming to her house, a mission that was critical for my continuing existence. I needed to exhaust her as soon as possible before starting sneaking around, hopefully getting into the library for the research I needed.</p><p>With that in mind, rather than wasting my time with another extended foreplay session, I let my hands-free on her body, molesting her breasts roughly, twiddling her nipples harsh enough to make her gasp in pain, laced with pleasure.  She opened her mouth, ready to argue against the roughness of the treatment, but that barely survived for a moment under the assault of my lips.</p><p>Soon, that attitude was abandoned like a broken toy as she started squirming helplessly under the effects of my concentrated assault. Her moans rose, muffled against my lips, the strength of her wiggling intensifying. </p><p>One of my hands stayed focused on her breasts, just large enough to fill my palms, with firmness to die for, while my other hand moved down her stomach, having a brief pause there, before moving down to her naked core, her wetness covering my fingers. </p><p>When a finger slipped inside her, soon joined by another, her helpless squirming reached another level. </p><p>I pulled back from the kiss, only to lean down and capture her right nipple between my teeth, biting hard enough to leave a soft mark, making her moan passionately. My tongue soon joined the fray, my lips working overtime, pushing her more and more. </p><p>“I order -” she started, only for a moan to explode before she could properly finish her sentence. “I order you to stop teasing me and properly…” she started, only for her voice to fade away as she realized the nature of her order, the realization enough to awaken a momentary shame even under the circumstances. </p><p>I used her momentary lull to pull my body back, only to grab her shoulders and make her turn before pushing her against the wall once more, this time chest first. “Properly, what, my mistress?” I whispered into her ear mockingly. “Properly fuck you like a back-alley whore until you fell unconscious, just like I had done all other noble ladies that was lucky enough to be your guest tonight.” </p><p>She said nothing in response, her lips frozen under my scandalous, daring words, but that didn’t prevent her from pushing her ass out invitingly. </p><p>As much as I wanted to tease her until she pushed through her noble sensibilities to beg for a slave to fuck her, I was strapped for time. So, I decided to be an obedient slave and fuck her until she was unconscious. </p><p>It was the nice thing to do, I thought with a predatory smile. She noticed it from the corner of her eyes, realizing that what I had in mind might not completely overlap with her preferred method, but it was too late. I pushed forward mercilessly, invading her wetness. </p><p>Her lips stayed open, the argument she had been planning to make melting into a cry loud enough to shatter glass. I was lucky that the servants had long been sent away to prevent gossips about the nature of the orgy that was going on. </p><p>Which was good, as I pushed my hips forward, her moans intensified further and further, adding a delicious nature to our joy. Her eyes stayed closed, her skin flushing more and more with each pump as her body was bathed in a rush of pleasure that couldn’t be simply copied. </p><p>“What do you think, mistress?” I asked mockingly even as the sound of flesh colliding filled the room, echoing against the marble walls of the bath. “Am I fucking you furiously enough, or should I fuck you even harder?” I asked, but she only managed to moan in response. </p><p>Even when I started slapping her ass to highlight it. </p><p>To her credit, she tried to answer, and if the nature of the anger flashing in her eyes was any indicator, it was going to be a spectacular response. Too bad that whenever my cock fully slid inside her, disappearing into her depths while forcefully stretching her, yet another moan exploded, preventing her from voicing her righteous fury.</p><p>My hands landed on her waist, using my hold for additional leverage to fuck her even more roughly, and despite all her fury, her hips rose in response, giving me a better angle to invade her depth, rocking enthusiastically. “So, mistress,” I whispered into her ear before letting my lips trail down for a fleeting moment and lick her neck. “Are you happy with the performance of this lowly slave?” </p><p>I let my lips rest on the nook of her neck while waiting for a response that wasn’t likely to come, softly kissing and licking in great contrast to my furious fucking, breaking through her resistance even faster. Her cries got louder and louder, turning into a delicious bundle of joy. </p><p>Under such a thick assault, combined with the extended arousal she had been suffering since the beginning of the evening thanks to the show I had been providing, and the service from Cera’s persistent tongue, it wasn’t shocking that Olivia was getting overwhelmed under the weight of the developing orgasm, moaning dazedly as she tried to maintain her consciousness. </p><p>And when I exploded inside her, triggering her climax at the same time, it dealt the final blow that caused her to lose her battle against the exhaustion. Under the rush of pleasure, her eyelids started to flutter, getting heavier and heavier. </p><p>“You need to work on your endurance, mistress,” I said mockingly even as I grabbed her to a bridal hold and dragged her next to Atia, who was still sleeping comfortably. Without even waking up, her arms wrapped around Olivia, pulling her to her chest, her blonde hair mixing with Olivia’s lively red…</p><p>The resulting sight was tempting me to wake Atia up, allowing me to enjoy a proper threesome with two heiresses, which was not a luxury many men could claim to. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had other priorities, so I cast a sleeping spell on Olivia as well, before casting another spell over the bathhouse, to alert me in case anyone tried to enter. I was hoping that no servant would dare to check their mistress before the sunrise, which would give me almost five hours to find the library penetrate its wards, and hopefully find some books to serve my search… </p><p>Then, I passed through the doorway, with the full intention of robbing the library a Patrician Estate… </p>
