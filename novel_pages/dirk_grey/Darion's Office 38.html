        <p>Mia wasn’t feeling well as she rushed to her office first thing in the morning, having already sent a message to Darion, informing him that they needed to have a meeting. </p><p>The reason, was a message from a friend, sending a picture of Darion walking into Gina’s club the last night … which was a big problem.  </p><p>Mia had no intention of losing him to her rival … and not just because he was critical of the deal. Of course, the long voicemail she had left for him early in the morning didn’t say that, but instead threatened him with a lot of things if he dared to betray her for Gina. </p><p>Admittedly, not her finest hour … but, to her defense, she did get a touch competitive whenever that whore Gina was involved. She regretted the personal insults quickly, which was why she followed with another message, one that promised to make it up for him … as long as he hadn’t actually sold him to Gina, of course. </p><p>It was why she was currently wearing a tiny skirt. Not the usual way she dressed, as she always thought skirts harmed the authority she could radiate during a business encounter, but under the circumstances, she decided that a little weakness wouldn’t hurt. </p><p>Then, she opened the door … and all those thoughts flew away. She was unable to believe what was going on. Her secretary was on Darion’s lap, her lack of underwear as distinctive as her hair, jumping up and down. </p><p>“What’s going on here!” she gasped in shock as she dashed forward, unable to contain her anger. </p><p>She noticed Jenny freezing as she shouted, which was nice. She had always believed that fear was the best motivator. </p><p>“Calm down, sweetie. I know for a fact I don’t need to explain what’s going on here.” </p><p>Mia couldn’t help but freeze at the lazy response, especially when he continued to bounce Jenny on his lap. She expected a lot of things as she rushed in with her anger on display, but a careless dismissal was not one of them. “Really, that’s all you have to say,” Mia said, doing her best to sound disapproving … but even as she said that, she knew it wouldn’t work. </p><p>Darion looked at her with amusement, showing that her words were even less effective than she expected. “Really, boss. That’s the best you can come up with,” he chuckled. Worse, she could hear Jenny chuckling with him as well. </p><p>She tried to come up with something better … but she failed it. She couldn’t threaten him with breaking up, as they were not dating. She couldn’t threaten to fire him, as he could just go to Gina and get a new job…</p><p>She was not used to being on the back foot, but she realized it was starting to become a pattern with Darion. First the deal, then the way he handled Paisley … and now this. </p><p>She didn’t know what to say. </p><p>Even worse, Darion didn’t wait for her to come up with anything. He just stood up, lifting Jenny like she weighed nothing — Mia did her best to ignore the way she shivered at his display of strength, even as he walked around, giving her a better view. </p><p>However, while she tried to suppress her own reaction, she did nothing else, and ended up right next to them. “Come on, Jenny. You don’t have to keep your moans low. Show your boss just how much you like it.” </p><p>“She wouldn’t dare—“ Mia started. </p><p>“Yes, Darion, fuck me harder!” Jenny interrupted Mia. A rebellion, Mia realized, but she was too confused to know exactly how to react, and ended up watching them as Jenny started shivering.  </p><p>It was not how she envisioned the morning to go. </p><p>Darion took a step toward her once he deposited Jenny against her desk. Jenny wasn’t naked … but considering the only thing she wore was a jacket with its front fully open, she took a shockingly provocative pose — even considering what they had been doing when she caught them — which didn’t help any. </p><p>“So, Mia. You asked for a meeting, what was that about.” </p><p>“Really, that’s what you want to talk about. After I caught you defiling my office. I can’t believe you. We can have the meeting once I calm down.” </p><p>“Good, let me help,” he said, and Mia didn’t have any time to react before he took a step forward … and, just like that, she was silenced. She wanted to push him away out of pure spite, but as his tongue invaded her mouth, she felt that determination to drain quickly. </p><p>After all, she still needed to keep him happy, and it wasn’t like a threesome with him was boring. On the contrary. </p><p>She let her body relax, abandoning herself to the pleasure. From the corner of her eye, she could see Jenny getting rid of her jacket. Mia wanted to admonish her for making assumptions, but she didn’t do so. Not only her lips were still occupied, but also she was rather happy to let Darion get rid of her jacket. Hardy the time to take a stance. </p><p>“Much better,” Darion said as he flipped her to the other side, and his fingers landed on her chest, playing with her nipples slowly but efficiently. She couldn’t help but shiver. </p><p>“Do you need help, boss,” Janet interrupted, which was frustrating. The threesome was fun, but not when it started giving her employees ideas. </p><p>“No—“ she tried to say, but Darion interrupted her by twisting her nipples. </p><p>“Go ahead. She needs it,” Darion commented, making Mia freeze. </p><p>“If you think I’m going to let my slut of an employee treat herself as an equal —“ Mia started, only to be interrupted once more. </p><p>“Janet, just like we talked, sweetie. You need to learn how to stand up for yourself…” </p><p>And, before she could even understand what was going on, Mia found herself on the floor, trapped by Janet’s legs. She was unable to say anything when Janet pulled her hair, making it hurt. </p><p>Just like that, Mia realized what was going on. It was just like the night with Paisley … but this time, she was the evil boss. </p><p>Darion’s smile showed that he was very much aware of the comparison, and enjoyed it immensely. </p><p>“Excellent. Now, the next step,” he said. “If you don’t mind, of course,” he added, looking at her. </p><p>Mia couldn’t help but shiver, but she still nodded … and Janet dragged her to lick her while pulling her hair. </p><p>She was already planning how to make both of them pay once the deal with Paisley was over. And, until then, she could always enjoy it.</p>
