        <p>Oeyne’s whisper was all the permission I needed to launch myself off my chair with a mighty push and grab her without slowing down, until she was sitting on her desk, her plump ass squishing the papers she had been working on all night. She didn’t look perfectly happy with the way I manhandled them, but the merciless assault of my tongue gave her something better to focus on. Our lips did the familiar dance, her moans providing the accompanying music.</p><p>“Hey,” she gasped, when we pulled away for a breather. “I need those papers.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” I said, a mocking grin on my face as I grabbed one of the latest papers. “Because from what I had seen as you worked on them, you clearly have no idea what you are doing. The supporting enhancement structure is completely wrong, the magical containment field would self-destruct in three hits no matter how much adjustment you can squeeze through, and even with my limited smithing knowledge, I could see that the alloy for the repairs is completely wrong.” </p><p>“I know,” she frowned. “It’s just an initial draft. I’ll find the best way to work on it sooner or later.” </p><p>Rather than answering, I pressed my lips against hers for another extended kiss, and happy to notice her aggressiveness bouncing up another notch. Deliciously torturing her the last time with all that edge play had been fun, but ultimately, Oeyne was a bundle of excess energy, and I liked her to be more active. As she tried to defend her territory,  my fingers started to wander aggressively, digging into her supple flesh. </p><p>This time, the kiss lasted much longer than the earlier peck, and she was panting and gasping once I pulled back. She said nothing, but trying to look calm, but her frazzled hair and her parted legs were sufficient as the answer about just how much she was being affected by the kiss. Wordlessly, she begged for more. </p><p>I just chuckled in response. “Maybe we should work on it together from the design?” I offered even as I grabbed her nipple, twisting lazily like it was a desk toy to be played with whenever I was bored. She gasped in shock. “No disrespect to you in the field of smithing, but your accomplishment in magic is significantly below mine. And you need me in any case since the princess lacks a competent mage versed in those aspects.” </p><p>“Maybe she does, maybe she doesn’t,” Oeyne tried to answer obscurely, trying to hide the princess’ secrets, but it was too little too late. </p><p>Just to amuse myself, I gathered some cold-natured mana on my fingertip before I dragged it around her nipple, her thin top failing completely to cut the sensation. She gasped in shock while her nipples got even harder, pushing against the fabric of her flimsy shirt, begging to be cut free. And since I was such a nice guy, I ripped her shirt, freeing her tits from the tyranny of their coverage. </p><p>Only then, I answered her attempt to deflect. “Nice try, honey,” I said. “But if she had anyone to help her with that, you wouldn’t ask my help to help you forge.” </p><p>She failed to answer, blushing at her own slip. I was mostly sure, but her latest reaction confirmed that. Oeyne was really not fit for any kind of political intrigue. Living alone in Silver Spires, away from politics was the right choice for her. Still, while she searched for an answer to recover her situation —an answer that didn’t exist— I focused on her breasts, trailing her naked caramel skin… </p><p>She failed to come up with an answer, even when I stayed away from her lips. That didn’t mean I was depriving her of my kiss, of course, not when my lips landed on her cheek before trailing down to her jawline. I stayed there for a while, every kiss bringing me a tiny bit lower, and making her shiver a tiny bit more… When I finished my journey on her jawline and switched to her neck, trailing down much more aggressively, she was yet to find an answer. </p><p>“So, do you want my help in the design process?” I whispered as I nibbled her collarbones, while my hand sneaked to her back and dragging down her spine, making her purr. </p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured, before sighing in defeat. “I do need help. Even from the limited information they were able to send in advance, it’s obvious that the spear is well above anything I had ever seen. I don’t know I could even repair it without destroying it.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, we’ll handle it,” I whispered even as I separated my lips from her skin for a moment. “Why don’t you explain to me the details while I help you relax,” I whispered as I slipped even lower, and took her nipple in my mouth, caressing gently. She tasted sweet, with just a hint of smoke, reminding me of the best whiskeys. </p><p>“It’s made from an unknown alloy, supported by a wide number of magical arrays,” Oeyne started, launching an explanation that lasted almost ten minutes, telling me everything that they were able to decipher based on the spear, though toward the end, her explanation became hard to trace. No wonder she was having trouble developing a preliminary method, half of the magical information she presented contradicted the other half. The problem, we didn’t know whether it was the spear that was truly extraordinary to the point of breaking my understanding of magical theories, or princess’ assistants had screwed their diagnostic spells. </p><p>I hoped it was the first, which would allow me to push my abilities forward, but reasonably, I expected it to be the second. </p><p>Since I had decided that the preliminary work was of limited usefulness, I decided to use my time better, and increased the intensity of Oeyne’s treatment. Moans started to interrupt her explanation rapidly, until her moans overtook the explanation itself. “Please,” she gasped. “It’s hard enough to remember everything already.” </p><p>“No worries,” I consoled her, even as I let my hands finally move down her belly and landing on the waistband of her shorts. “There are too many contradictions on the spell structure, to a point that it’s impossible to solve the problem remotely. We just need to focus on processing the required materials, and some excess, as preparation. Others, we can focus on after the princess arrives with the spear. She just needs to stay as a guest for a few days while we decipher firsthand,” I explained.</p><p>“Makes sense—” she managed to murmur before my hand slipped through the waistband of her shorts, circling around her knob, then her mouth was occupied by her moans. She leaned back, her hands landing on her desk, not caring about damaging the papers she had been working on all night anymore. </p><p>“So, tell me about the alloy structure, and how are you planning to repair such a dangerously magical weapon from a smithing perspective,” I whispered. </p><p>“R-really,” she managed to stammer between her moans. “Right now?” </p><p>“It’s not like you’re doing anything,” I countered, my smirk wide enough to twist her face into annoyance, but it didn’t last long, once again replaced by ecstasy. A measured flick to her clit while coating my finger with ice-mana saw to that. </p><p>“You’re evil,” she gasped, but still, her explanation started. “The root of the problem is creating the correct alloy structure…” she started, her moans slower than necessary.  </p><p>[+1 Craft]</p><p>Happy with the quick skill gain, I slowed down my teasing, mostly to keep her coherent enough to continue her explanation, while distracted enough to occasionally slip one of her precious personal smithing secrets. For some of them, I was knowledgeable enough to understand their significance, though I had no doubt that for every single secret I understood, I was missing ten of them. Luckily, with my Intelligence stat, I was able to memorize her words verbatim even as I enjoyed her juices flowing around my fingers, preparing for future success without sacrificing the present pleasure. </p><p>Multitasking had never been this fun. </p><p>There was a unique sense of pleasure derived from the sensation of control, watching her gasp and moan as my fingers slowly slipped inside her, teasing her most sensitive spot, but never enough to topple her to the other side. Her struggle to hide the impact of my moves made it even more delicious. Then, she reached the end of her explanation. </p><p>[+4 Craft]</p><p>At this point, I could have used follow-up questions to ferret out even more of her secrets, but ultimately, I decided that she had earned her reward through her obedience, and decided to deliver the implied promise. I kept my right where it was, with fingers buried in her snatch, while my left hand landed on the great expanse of her breasts, once again gorging itself with the delicious firmness of her breasts. </p><p>It was all that needed to push Oeyne into the territory where everything but the pleasure lost its significance. As my fingers disappeared in the great expanse of her caramel breasts, she moaned in pure ecstasy, forcing me to snatch her lips in another kiss just to protect my eardrums —not that kissing her plump lips as she writhed in pleasure was by any means a great chore. </p><p>“It feels amazing. Do it harder! I’ll whatever you want,” she gasped when I pulled away from her lips, signaling my victory, not that it was in doubt. And as an honorable warrior, it was my duty to respect such a heartfelt surrender. I squeezed her tits even harder even returned my lips over hers, my tongue ravaging her mouth mercilessly. Most importantly, the dance of my fingers quickened, from a soft caress to a merciless assault. </p><p>From there, it took a bare few moments for her to stiffen for a moment, before trembling invaded her body, losing any coherence of control, relieved to finally arrive at her destination with an explosive climax. She collapsed on me as she trembled, putting her head on my shoulder to maintain her balance. </p><p>Of course, it was just a start, and I still had one important thing to attend, one that was making my pants very uncomfortable. Bringing her to her bed was an option, but I decided to take a bigger step, one that would symbolically clench the new balance of authority between us. I lifted her up in a bridal hold, and walked toward the forge, where a cold stone surface lay in the middle of her tools and equipment, where she created the weapons and tools that she was so proud of. </p><p>I carried her toward the forge, and pushed her down on the smooth surface near bellows, empty of the clutter of her ongoing work. It was inches away from the area where she usually forged, which would have been extremely dangerous for anyone that didn’t share our overwhelming physical stats. </p><p>She tried to speak, only for her breath to explode as her chest hit the smooth surface. Another gasp followed when I cast the spell to clean up and prepare her backdoor entrance, ready for my visitation. </p><p>Her shocked tone was rather glorious as I pressed my shaft against her puckered hole, pushing forward quick enough to make her feel a sting of pain, but not quick enough to actually hurt. “W-what are you doing!” she exclaimed even as the crown disappeared in her spectacularly tight grip. </p><p>“I’m looking for something to distract me while I forged, of course,” I said lazily, even as I quickly cast a couple of telekinetic spells, pulling one of the pure silver ingots she had in storage. It floated along with her hammer. </p><p>“You -” she started, only to be interrupted by a gasp. </p><p>“I, what?” I said mockingly as I slapped her plump ass, enjoying its jiggle. </p><p>“You can’t be serious!” she exploded, however, she continued to lay obediently on the stone surface while I plunged the silver ingot in the ever-glowing embers of her forge, then turned my attention back to Oeyne. </p><p>“Oh, but I am,” I said lazily even as I alternated between squeezing and slapping her ass, enjoying her distraction that followed an orgasm. “Why, is there a problem?” I asked, but at the same time, slipped two fingers in her wet snatch, making her moan in lieu of answering. “I thought so,” I said mockingly, as I slowly pushed deeper. </p><p>“That’s -” she gasped, trying to contain her voice as she struggled under the multiple sources of pleasure. “That’s unnatural,” she barely managed to say. </p><p>“Really,” I said domineeringly as I pushed my shaft deeper into her tight hole, enjoying her grip as I kept going deeper and deeper past her ring, forcing her to widen more and more. She was getting more and more ready for the ultimate penetration her spectacular ass had deserved. </p><p>It took a minute for her useless arguments to fade away, and another minute for her to reach back and spread open her ass cheeks to make my invasion even easier, signaling her changing opinions about anal sex. Her moans rose, deep and low, as she raised her ass, presenting an even better angle for me to penetrate deeper. I followed her invitation, enjoying her tightly constricting grip even further, finally treating every inch of my shaft as I finally pushed my full size. </p><p>A different girl would have been crying in pain, but Oeyne just moaned in pleasure, not surprising me with her pain resistance. Even with all the supernatural protections stats afforded, smithing was a painful business. Since she was moaning enthusiastically, I didn’t bother to warn her before pulling back, only to slam back in, this time harder, testing her tightness further even as her ass jiggled under the unusual blow. </p><p>Then, just before I started really enjoying her tight hole, I noticed the silver ingot glowing in a nice pink shade, signaling that it was finally time to start as well. </p><p>The timing was as perfect as it could get. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 441500 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 36    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 4920 / 4920 Mana: 6300 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [68/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [45/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17] </p>
