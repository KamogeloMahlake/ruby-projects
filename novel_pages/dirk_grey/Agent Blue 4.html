        <p>Seduction was a delicate affair, especially with a target as confusing as Sabrina, showing an impeccable marriage of contradictions. On one way, she was cold and dangerous, and if she was a bit unpolished, her mysterious —but very dangerous— family definitely made up for it. On the other hand, there was an untamed fire in her, one that raged boundlessly at the slightest prodding. And with that flame came an act of unique courage, as while this engagement ploy was deadly for me, I didn’t doubt that it was risk-free for her, not with the stakes. She was too determined to be the little heiress of the rich family. </p><p>Of course, all that made it even more tempting to make her mine, especially when she was growling in frustration as she reached my belt, trying to free it from its confines, enough to pull away from our kiss. And when I smirked at her smugly, she actually looked angry. </p><p>My crime, not losing my mind under her heated kiss. </p><p>“I’m going to show you, you bastard,” she growled, one that made my spine tingle, even as she freed my belt in measured, determined movements. Her gaze fell down, the concentrated expression on her face making my pants very uncomfortable. Luckily, she, very determinedly, unbuttoned it and pulled down my zipper, letting my full erection the space to breathe. </p><p>I was expecting her to slow down a bit, so I was surprised when she pulled my pants and underwear at the same time, leaving my bottom bare. She gave me a challenging smirk before diving back into the kiss, but with one major change. Only one of her hands went to my chest, while the other stayed around my shaft, moving up and down in a torturous slowness, contrasting the passion of our tongues as they danced. </p><p>“You’re playing a very dangerous game, miss fake-fiancee,” I growled when she pulled out of a kiss. “Do you think you can handle the consequences.” I would have liked to say that it was a calculated taunt that was there to arouse her competitive spirit, but that would have been a lie. It was an honest reaction that escaped me, though definitely effective. </p><p>“Bring it on, white boy,” she gasped in response even as her grip around my shaft tightened for a moment. I just smirked as I grabbed the zipper of her dress, pulling it down glacially no matter how much I wanted to rip the dress off her mercilessly, before taking her on the coffee table. </p><p>Still, she shivered as the zipper slowly peeled off her body, allowing my fingers to touch the naked skin of her back, trailing along her spine. That didn’t prevent her from kissing me like there was no tomorrow, nor the fact that she was giving me a slow handjob —though the second part picked up speed soon after. </p><p>When the zipper came down, however, rather than letting her dress fall down, she pulled out of the kiss and used her free arm to keep it in place, hiding her breasts from my view. “You need to work better,” she gasped erotically. </p><p>I decided to follow her direction, leaning forward to press a lingering kiss on her delicate neck, making her shiver once again. My hand sneaked behind her back once more, this time caressing along her spine, while the other hand ended around her waist before tightening around her. </p><p>A shocked cry escaped her mouth as I stood up without a warning, her legs wrapped around my waist reflexively, trapping my shaft with her beautiful body, while her arms ended around my neck, wrapping tight. I just smirked before walking toward a closed door that I hoped to contain her bedroom, slowly and determinedly while I did my best to devour her neck and devour her lips alternatively. Her cries of desire echoed in the room whenever her lips were empty and I was focusing on her neck. </p><p>A gasp escaped her mouth when we finally arrived at her bed and I threw it on quite a bit harder than necessary, but from the way she showed absolutely no resistance as I pulled her barely-hanging dress off her, I was willing to bet that she wasn’t particularly torn about that detail. </p><p>I stopped for a moment, enjoying the sight of her perfect body, her caramel skin contrasting against the white linens of the bed. I would have said that she looked like a classical masterpiece —like her stunning legs and flat stomach and perky breasts definitely qualified— but no art piece from the classical period had such a thick layer of arousal on their face. She was panting and groaning even as I hovered above her, defenseless with her skimpy panties and her stiletto shoes and nothing else. </p><p>At that moment, I could have commented on her beauty, that I could have mentioned that she was a Mayan goddess came to life, that she was free to rip my heart, and for a fleeting moment, it would have been true. However, I know that a single word like that risked the destruction of the magic that filled us, pushing her far more than she was planning in her little ploy. </p><p>I sat next to her, still hovering above, and slid my hand in her panties. The gasp that escaped her mouth was truly spectacular, but I disregarded it, preferring to gently caress her entrance instead. Her back arched beautifully as my fingers danced at her entrance, my own shaft throbbing with unmet desire. Still, I said nothing as I wiggled my fingers, torturing her with a slow wave of pleasure. </p><p>A few minutes passed in that slow, torturous manner, though I used the opportunity to get rid of the rest of my clothes. For a while, she had a defiant expression, clear on what I was trying to do but determined not to let that succeed. Unfortunately for her, I had spent quite a bit of my young life doing card tricks, meaning I had unbelievably skillful fingers, more than enough to wear down her paltry resistance. “Act faster, you bastard,” she finally gasped as her body wiggled. </p><p>“Is this the way to talk to your fake-fiancee, princess,” I said in a mocking tone, and even better, when she opened her mouth to let out a scathing reply, I twisted my fingers, forcing her to gasp helplessly instead. </p><p>It took a while for her to catch her breath under my determined assault, but she managed to do it in a minute. “That fake-fiancee better start acting faster, or I’m going to show him that I’m not just a pretty face,” she said, her trigger finger clenching reflexively, though I doubted she expected me to catch the last part. </p><p>“Violent much,” I said with a chuckle, but before she could interject, I continued in a huskier tone. “Be careful what you wish for, princess,” I said even as I leaned down and captured her lips in a domineering kiss, one that hadn’t used for the evening. If the way her breathing came to a still was any indicator, she was enjoying it. </p><p>Enjoying it too much to actually pay attention to anything else. She missed when I climbed the bed, my knees on both sides of her. She missed when I slid down her panties, leaving her shaved pussy bare for my attention. She missed when my chest pressed against her sexy torso. </p><p>But she didn’t miss when I pressed my erection at her entrance, ready to slam in. </p><p>“No,” she gasped in panic. “I’m a virgin.” </p><p>Admittedly, that came as a bit of a surprise. From the rather great aptitude she was showing, I wouldn’t have expected that. Probably, she was one of the technical virgins, thinking that not taking that last step somehow changed things. Or, I thought, suddenly thinking of her family circumstances, maybe it was a requirement from her family. Her dangerous, mysterious family… </p><p>Knowing that only made me want it more. After all, I was already slated for a very dangerous fate, and whether I took her virginity or not wasn’t likely to have a huge impact on my ultimate fate. Still, I wasn’t asshole enough to actually impale her without her permission, how much my throbbing shaft begged me to do. </p><p>“How about I put just to tip in,” I asked in a soft, boyish tone, one that implied a more innocent type of desire than I had been feeling. </p><p>“You won’t push it in,” she stated, though the question was still implied. </p><p>“Of course not,” I said, before letting my smirk widen. “Not unless you order me to, of course,” I added even as I pushed my shaft into her core, her warmth enveloping me completely. </p><p>“You’re going to wait for a long time,” she said confidently after a moan, which I believed was completely unwarranted. After all, here we were, just several hours after we met, naked, with my crown snugly inside her snatch, making her moan even as I carefully moved back and forth. Of course, rather than arguing the point, I leaned forward, and for the first time, pressed my lips to her breasts. They weren’t huge, barely enough to fill my palm, but their perkiness and perfect shape were more than enough to compensate for the size. </p><p>The minutes passed, and I ended up hoping that it was as much as torture on her that it was to me. I was still above her, in missionary position, both of us burning with desire while the top of my shaft repeatedly slid in and out her, enjoying her slickness while she gushed like a broken tap. My fingers explored her body in a similar kind of laziness while hers roamed over my back with a contrasting wildness, enough to leave more than one red line. </p><p>She was getting closer. I decided it was the perfect time for some interrogation. “Tell me, Sabrina,” I whispered into her ear huskily. “Why are you doing this?” </p><p>She was smart enough that even in the throes of passion, she didn’t mistake my point. “Because I hate being the little girly chip of my family,” she spat in surprising vitriol. “I’m more competent than all my brothers combined, but all of them have their own part of the business, even though they are running it to the ground. But not me, not the little girl of the family. I just need to be a little pretty thing to catch the attention of a couple of low-lives to make sure my family can get into new markets. Just because I’m a girl, the fact that I’m the heiress of the Blue Guard means nothing.” </p><p>“It’s tough,” I said, even though I wanted to jump from the nearest balcony. Hiding my reaction took a lot. Blue Guard was arguably the strongest organization in Latin America, the only thing that limited them was that their reach never passed the ocean, or Central America. They were the kind of danger that triggered a national security alert. </p><p>And like the idiot I was, I was trying to take the virginity of one of the daughters of the ruling family. </p><p>It was madness, but I stayed in position, ignoring the impact of the revelation. My fate was determined the moment I barged into that poker game, and sealed when I entered her room. Now, my only saving grace was the sexy naked girl under me that was twisting with desire. I decided to continue probing her, both literally and metaphorically. “You’re too brave to take this lying down,” I whispered into her ear. “I’m guessing our little ploy is a part of the game. Is there anything else I need to know about it.” </p><p>“Nothing much,” she said, interrupted by a moan as I bit her nipple. “Just never step outside the resort without talking to me.” She didn’t give any reason, nor that she needed to. Even if I hadn’t been a spy, I could have easily imagined possible endings, none of them pleasant. </p><p>“As you wish, my fake-fiancee,” I said even as I pushed forward, just enough to caress her barrier for a moment before pulling back. She gasped beautifully, which was followed by another string of moans as her clit continued to struggle under my smooth fingers. </p><p>Several more minutes passed, filled with kisses, caresses, and a slow, determined assault on her willpower where I was very careful about not letting her climax, then, she let out a frustrated growl. “You’re a pathetic bastard,” she cried. </p><p>I pulled away to catch her gaze, though my shaft was still at her entrance, ready to plunge. “Does that mean you want to stop, my fake-fiancee,” I said with, more cheerful than I was feeling. It might be hard for her to contain the desire, but it wasn’t that much different for me as well, especially while I needed to silence the sound that was begging me to take her completely. </p><p>“No, you bastard!” she gasped. “You win! Impale me! Take my virginity!” </p><p>“As you wish, dear,” I said even as I leaned forward to capture her lips in a soft, gentle kiss, something that contrasted greatly with the merciless push of my hips, breaking through her barrier and graduating her into a true woman. She gasped against my kiss, but not much as I expected. Despite her outward charm, she was one tough woman. </p><p>I wanted to test just how tough. </p><p>It was why I barely let her gather herself before pulling my hips, before sliding inside her once again, this time even deeper, forcing her walls to expand painfully. “Damn,” she managed to murmur between kisses, but when I stayed back to let her speak, she chose to sink herself into our kiss once more, which was more heated than the previous one. </p><p>The more I felt her getting used to my presence, the more merciless I started to plow her, until I was repeatedly ramming inside her while she mewled like a little kitten. “Yes, harder, faster!” she cried, proving that she was more than ready to take the final step, but couldn’t find someone idiotic enough to anger one of the most dangerous illegal families in the world. Luckily, I didn’t anger one. </p><p>I angered three! </p><p>So, it was a little understandable when I started impaling even harder as I realized my climax was coming, reminding me of the utter lack of protection we had. Still, I didn’t pull out, instead, I pushed even deeper inside her before filling her insides, which triggered a spectacular climax in her as well, leaving her trembling and moaning helplessly. </p><p>She was barely moving as I lay next to her before pulling her to my chest, giving her a break to breathe while she struggled to come down from the spectacular explosion that almost pushed her to the land of unconsciousness. Even after she gathered herself, she continued to breathe softly while drawing circles on my chest, while I held her tight. </p><p>“That wasn’t the plan,” she finally murmured. I didn’t say anything, just tightened my grip to comfort her, but when she pulled out, I let her, even though I was sad to let her leave, enough to put a genuine frown on my face. But when rather than leaving the bed, she chose to straddle herself on my lap once more, this time skewering herself on my shaft, taking the perfect cowgirl position. “But since what’s done is done, there’s no harm enjoying it a bit…” </p>
