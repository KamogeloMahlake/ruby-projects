        <p>She floated in front of me like a blue specter of death, hard to read. Hard, but not impossible. “Let me tell you how’s this going to go,” she started, her voice even more threatening with her power giving it a weird echo. “You’re going to give me every recording you have, erase all the backups you have, and in exchange, I’m not going to crush you to a fine paste.” </p><p>A complete bluff. While she was shocked, she wasn’t shocked enough to commit murder. So, rather than begging like she expected, I just smirked. “Is the voice a side effect, or something you do deliberately?” I asked. </p><p>She stilled, shocked by my question. “Are you mocking me!” </p><p>“No, genuinely curious,” I said, which was true, but not the real objective. The real objective was to take over the conversation rather than bargaining based on her threats. “But either way, keep it up if you want to throw a tantrum and make pointless threats rather than talking as adults. There’s no way I’ll erase those recordings, especially not now.” </p><p>“What, so that you can blackmail me!” she said. </p><p>I smiled gently. “Of course not. I’m not an idiot, blackmailing someone stronger than me.’ </p><p>She stilled. “But you just told me that you’re not going to erase them.” </p><p>“Yes, but did I tell you that I’m going to use it to make you do anything. They will stay, but only to make sure you don’t demolish my bar. You do have a reputation, after all,” I said. </p><p>It was amusing to see her power actually flicker as she dipped her head in shame. It seemed that she was sensitive about her identity as the Lady of Destruction.</p><p>She floated above me for a few seconds, examining me. “You’re not afraid,” she commented. </p><p>“Should I be?” I said. </p><p>“Of course. I’m one of the strongest supers, ever.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Irrelevant,” I said. She tensed, giving signs of actual anger. Clearly, she was sensitive about her identity. “Sweetie, I’m a normal man. It doesn’t matter how strong a super is. Even the weakest one could easily deal with me. Hell, even if you had been normal, you could have smashed my head with a paperweight while I was lost in your beautiful pussy. Mortal danger is hardly a new thing for me. You could have killed me then, and you could kill me now. Style points hardly matter.” </p><p>I was distorting the facts a bit, of course, but, it still gave me enough reason to actually ignore the threat she posed. She said nothing. </p><p>“Now, why don’t you sit here, and we can talk about it as adults,” I said as I patted the desk. “Feel free to keep the force field active if you’re afraid of poor old me, of course.”</p><p>Removing the force field had nothing to do with her actual safety, as I had read the reports showing that sneak attacks didn’t work on her. However, she didn’t know that I knew, which made it a challenge to her pride. </p><p>So, rather than dignifying it with an answer, she floated down and sat on the desk. The glow faded off everywhere but her eyes. Unfortunately for her, while removing the glow did nothing to weaken her physical defenses, psychological defenses were a different matter.</p><p>It was hard to ignore the fact that she was naked. She crossed her legs to hide her core, and her arms crossed on her chest, reducing the show. Which, ironically, was even sexier than if she owned her nudity, and more vulnerable as well. </p><p>“Speak.” </p><p>“Let’s continue where we left off. You were about to tell me how many cameras you require, and I was going to tell you how many nights you have to be under me to pay it off.” </p><p>The glow in her eyes intensified. “And, where’s your promise not to blackmail me,” she said. </p><p>I laughed. “Where’s the blackmail. I had already offered you that deal when I didn’t know your identity, and I’m just offering you to continue using the same deal.” </p><p>“And if I don’t accept,” she said, trying to sound in control, but she had long lost control of the discussion. Her belligerent attitude was a way to get back control. Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of letting her succeed. </p><p>“Well, then you can leave,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>“And, how would I know you won’t release … my identity, regardless.”</p><p>I chuckled. “How would I know that you won’t destroy my bar if you feel like it, Miss Blue Princess,” I said, deliberately condescending using her name. “For once, you’re going to just live with the uncertainty like the rest of us mortals.”</p><p>She hissed in anger, yet said nothing, unable to keep up with the discussion, only the glow of her eyes showing that it was not just a lovers’ quarrel based on the way we were dressed. </p><p>I waited for half a minute, letting the silence stretch while she tried to process the situation, before I spoke again. After all, while I wanted her to calm down slightly, I didn’t want her to be completely used to the situation. “Now, it’s your lucky day, because we have a common enemy,” I said. </p><p>“The Syndicate,” she said. </p><p>“Yes, we both want to take them down because of their weapon trade,” I said, deliberately misreading her mission. I knew that they wanted to save the tech expert, but taking down the Syndicate overlapped with it enough to give us a chance to collaborate.</p><p>“And who do you work for,” she said. </p><p>“Whoever pays me,” I said with a shrug. “I’m a mercenary, and I have a mystery client who’s annoyed with all the weapons that the Syndicate is transporting to their territory,” I said. </p><p>“And why are you telling me that,” she said. </p><p>I gave her a deadpan gaze. “You’re a first-tier hero. There’s no way you’re gallivanting in bars because you want to take down a bunch of drug dealers. You’re here, because you know it’s a cover. Not even a good one.” </p><p>She had no choice but to nod. “True, but doesn’t that mean you want to collaborate with me,” she said. “I can offer you much more than … what I had been previously doing. Maybe I can pay you as well.” </p><p>“Sure, if you’re willing to pay me thirty million, with several bonus clauses if I could discover who’s behind them,” I said, throwing a random number that stole her breath. Her gasp was beautiful. “Being a mercenary pays well … not this well usually, of course, but this is a special mission. The Syndicate annoyed a lot of people with their move.” </p><p>“That’s a lot of money —” she muttered, then froze. “Wait, who’s behind them?” </p><p>“Yeah. The Syndicate is not big enough for the national stage. They have supporters. We just don’t know who,” I started, acting like I didn’t notice her shock even as I gave her a pretty big piece of information. At the same time, it showed her that she actually needed me to handle her mission successfully. </p><p>It was good to show her that she could still get the upper hand. </p><p>“We can still collaborate,” she said. </p><p>“It’s difficult,” I said. “My reputation as a mercenary would be gone if it’s known I work with heroes …” Then, I smirked. “At least openly. But, people couldn’t blame me for getting a new girlfriend, could they? And, if my girl browses my cameras while I’m distracted, there’s nothing I can do.” </p><p>“That’s absurd,” she said. </p><p>“Really, it works to your benefit as well,” I offered. “Or, would you prefer to tell your superiors that you were careless enough to reveal your identity and failed your mission,” I suggested. I wasn’t able to tap into their communication a lot, but from what I read, she wanted to impress her mentor quite a bit. Then, I put my hand on her leg, caressing her again. “And, it’s not like playing my girlfriend is something you hate, right … Amelia. We still didn’t have our bike trip, after all.” </p><p>She blushed as my hand climbed up suggestively. With the fear of a near-disaster gone, her adrenaline was coming down. And, such a shift was perfect for rekindling arousal. </p><p>“I don’t know…” she muttered, but I could see that she was already coming around to the idea. </p><p>“Think about it,” I whispered, offering my Faustian bargain. She shivered. The glow in her eyes faded, showing her acceptance. “You will accomplish your mission and earn the admiration of your allies, and you’ll solve a very dangerous problem in the process. And, in the process, you’ll have a lot of fun…” I added. </p><p>“Maybe…” she whispered. </p><p>“Have you ever been fucked while riding a bike at full speed,” I whispered. “Imagine doing that, while wearing nothing but the skirt we have purchased for you…” Her legs parted open invitingly. </p><p>“I still need to think,” she said as she jumped off the desk. “I need to go.” </p><p>“Sure,” I said even as I typed Tara to bring new clothes for her. She might not know her answer, but I did. She would accept the offer. And, while I could hasten the process, I didn’t want her to realize just how little role she played in that decision. A good sleep should help her deceive herself. </p><p>I grabbed her waist and walked out with her. “You know where to find me…” </p>
