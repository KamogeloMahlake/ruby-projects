        <p>Ida shuffled in her new seat, naked and trembling, yet doing her best to defy our comment about being exhausted; but she didn’t even have the energy to raise her camera, the greatest evidence of exhaustion she could have. </p><p>A good way to make a decision. “Let’s see if she can recover enough to immortalize such a beautiful moment while I deal with your punishment,” I said as I pulled her Carrie onto my lap. </p><p>Carrie froze for a moment before whispering. “Aren’t you going to untie me?” </p><p>“Why,” I answered. She couldn’t see my face due to the way she was sitting, but I was sure she had no trouble guessing the kind of smile I had on my lips. “Isn’t keeping you tied down a good start? Just in case you’re feeling … naughty!” </p><p>“No, I’m not naughty, I’m a good girl,” she gasped in protest. Admittedly, it wasn’t as effective as she might have liked to believe, not with her track record — both immediate, and more general. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I whispered. “I wonder how many good girls I would have found naked in my room, watching their friends … graduate…” </p><p>“That’s not my fault, Ida tied me up, and now you’re keeping me prisoner,” Carrie gasped loudly, blaming her exhausted friend. Though, that blaming didn’t prevent her hips from moving back and forth, which was not prisoner behavior. </p><p>At least not the nice kind. </p><p>“So, you’re saying that all I need to let you go and it’ll all be over,” I whispered into her ear, calling her naughty bluff as my touch on her stomach got lighter, making her think that I might actually follow up with that. </p><p>“No!” she gasped, far too quickly as she stiffened on my lap. </p><p>“Oh, a lie…” I whispered. “I thought that you wanted to be free.” </p><p>Carrie froze for a moment, her eyes closed as she turned her spectacular intellect toward digging herself from the little verbal corner she dug herself into. Ordinarily, it would have taken a second for her to do so, but to her defense, she was somewhat distracted. </p><p>“I want to be freed by my own power,” she whispered after a pause. “It’s not fair to do any other way.” The way her hips started dancing despite my hold left no doubt about what kind of payment she had in mind. </p><p>I turned to Ida. “What do you think?” I asked even as I let my hands caress Carrie’s naked belly, enjoying the smoothness. She tried to push forward a bit so that she could slide my shaft inside rather than just rocking on top of it, only to decide against it when my arms tightened around her body. </p><p>Even with all the changes in her attitude, she was still obedient when it counted. </p><p>Amazing. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Ida murmured as she forced herself to sit, showing the extent of her exhaustion. I let her recover. Pity I didn’t have anything to entertain myself while waiting … right. </p><p>I chuckled even as I let my hands rise, cupping Carrie’s amazing tits, enjoying the way she squirmed under my touch like a cute restless rabbit. I let my fingers sink down, once again enjoying the perkiness of her breasts. </p><p>“Come on, Ida,” Carrie whispered. “I’ll model you once, whatever you wish!” </p><p>“Three times,” Ida countered, her exhaustion blinking away immediately at the prospect. Carrie looked thoughtful. “And today doesn’t count!” Ida added,  immediately using the opportunity to push for more. </p><p>“That’s too much,” Carrier gasped, followed by a moan as I twisted her nipple. </p><p>“Oh, then maybe we should let you go. We don’t want to push a delicate beauty like you too much,” Ida answered. I couldn’t help but smirk at her sudden viciousness. It was always a treat to see such a shy beauty suddenly turn cutthroat just because of her passion for her hobby. </p><p>“I … I accept,” Carrie answered, quick to abandon her attempts to bargain at the prospect of a loss. She was not a good haggler, especially not when distracted. Though, if I was reading the way her tongue was darting out correctly, the earlier show had pushed her too much already, and leaving without a proper tumble was abhorrent to her. </p><p>I chuckled at her attitude. Ultimately, I had no intention of sending her away after all the work she put in to make today such spectacular entertainment, first with Sarah, then with Ida. </p><p>“Good,” I murmured as I continued groping her, enjoying the way she trembled under my touch. I let one of my hands climb up until I grabbed her hair, using that to pull her lips to a convenient location for my merciless kiss. </p><p>My tongue invaded her mouth, and her hips responded by increasing the speed of their dance. It would be a lie to say I wasn’t tempted to tease her more … and it wasn’t mercy for her that made me act. </p><p>No, after the long tease with Sarah, I was still burning with desire, and the little show with Ida hadn’t been enough to completely resolve it. </p><p>My other hand shifted to her hips, and I pushed them forward. A little shift in my waist, and when her hips pulled back, her familiar warmth enveloped me yet again. </p><p>Her moan was beautiful even when suppressed by my lips, and she continued to tease me. As I continued tasting her lips, a distinctive click reached my ears. I glanced, only to see Ida already taking photos of the show. </p><p>I glanced at Ida, watching the dance of emotions, from satisfaction to jealousy, dancing beautifully, split between the opportunity to record the show, and taking another turn. I might have been surprised by her naughtiness, but after my experience with the rest of their friend group, the surprise was much more muted. </p><p>I turned my attention back to Carrie, enjoying the way she was dancing on my lap despite the impediment of her bound state. </p><p>The kiss didn’t last for long. Soon, I let my lips drift lower, stealing a lingering kiss of her neck while her moans exploded, her face fully visible once more — a little favor for Ida, who was doing her best to immortalize the moment. </p><p>She failed to say anything, the pleasure enough to steal her words. I let her hair go, and brought that hand to her breasts once more, enjoying the sensation of her perky breasts once more, aggressively, enough to leave several red marks behind. </p><p>Marks that was very interesting, if Ida’s sudden determination to stand up despite her trembling legs were any indicator. She managed to drag her naked body in front of us, before she fell on her knees just a couple feet away, her camera conveniently positioned to take the show fully. </p><p>Carrie said nothing, just moaning again and again, losing herself in the perfect mixture of pleasure of my touch, and the thrill of being observed. Her dance, despite the impediments she was dealing with, was beautiful. </p><p>With her hips moving in their won, I shifted my hand on her hips, caressing her inner thigh. She pressed them tighter. “Part them open, sweetie,” I whispered. “Let’s give your friend the show she deserves after all the trouble she had gone through.”</p><p>“But … that’s too much —“ she whispered, which was all she was able to say before a slap landed on her hip, interrupting her complaint. </p><p>“That’s not fair, sweetie, you promised her,” I whispered. </p><p>“Yes… you promised,” Ida agreed, but that didn’t prevent a blush from spreading to her face as Carrie parted her legs open, which allowed her to get an unobstructed view of my shaft disappearing again and again, elevating the erotic moment into something even more. </p><p>However, her shock didn’t take long, as she raised her camera and started taking photos with a renewed passion. I didn’t expect those photos to come out particularly good, for one simple reason. </p><p>She was holding the camera in one hand… </p><p>The other disappeared between her legs as she stimulated herself recklessly, the passion of the moment enough to overwhelm her professionalism. </p><p>There was only one problem. “Why don’t you open your legs as well, sweetie. It’s not really fair, isn’t it,” I said, challenging her in the exact same manner I had toned against Carrie earlier. </p><p>“I don’t…” Ida muttered, feeling shy despite the camera in hand, which was a rarity. </p><p>“Maybe I should close my legs, then,” Carrie whispered. I knew that was a bluff, as the way she tightened as she parted them open to escalate the nature of the show she was giving showed that she enjoyed being watched — almost as much as she enjoyed watching her friends getting dominated after assisting their seduction. </p><p>However, Ida wasn’t in a position to catch such detail while her mind was blanked with pleasure, and she obeyed Carrie’s request, further enhancing the beautiful show I was receiving… </p><p>Life was good. </p>
