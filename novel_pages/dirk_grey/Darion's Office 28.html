        <p>Anna Presley was one of the most successful businesswomen in the country, a fact she had leveraged not only for her benefit but also for her fun several times. </p><p>Her particular favorite, teaching lessons to younger, less successful businesswomen about the true face of the business. Some blamed her for being anti-women, but she disagreed. She was just helping them to learn about the true face of the business. </p><p>If she wasn’t the one acting as their teacher, they would learn their lesson in a far more humiliating manner than losing their pansy, weak husbands and boyfriends. Oh, there was no doubt that she loved toying with their significant other until she got bored … but ultimately, she was doing them a favor. </p><p> A favor that was bouncing back in a very unexpected way…</p><p>Until this fateful day, she never had any problem treating her boyfriend as she wished. After all, for her target to even dare to talk to her significant other about her naughty offer, she needed to be the dominant side of the relationship, with a man making less caring about maintaining his girlfriend’s financial wellbeing. And, it meant that she could easily dominate and break the men in question … just a frown or two, maybe a subtle threat. </p><p>But, as two fingers slipped into her wetness, invading her pelvis in a way she hadn’t felt for a long time, she was ready to admit that, maybe she had made a mistake. </p><p>“T-this is …” she managed to say, turning to moan. </p><p>“Yes, this is wrong,” he said, finishing her sentence, and for a moment, she thought he would pull back. Instead, he just changed position, and attacked her folds with his other hands while his body pressed against hers, using his fingers in a way she had never felt before. Strong, rough, and determined, but never enough to lose sight of the pleasure. </p><p>“I — we can’t do it here,” Anna moaned, though even as the words escaped her mouth, she hated herself. That was not the statement she should be making. She should be asking him to stop, not change locations.</p><p>Still, for a moment, she hoped it worked when he helped her to stand up. “Here you go,” he said. </p><p>But, her legs, trembling with excitement, betrayed her, and she was about to stumble when he hugged her from behind, his hand far too low to be appropriate. She put her hand above his, but she was unable to pull it away, her fingers rebelling. </p><p>“Oh, thanks for the help—“ she tried to say, doing her best to act normal, but his fingers started dancing in her core, and that died a quick death. </p><p>“Don’t worry, Madam Presley. No need to thank me yet. There’s a lot of things I will do to you, just like I promised to my girlfriend…” </p><p>Anna felt shocked, unable to believe how such a simple misunderstanding could push things to such an absurd situation. When her legs stopped trembling, she moved away. He let her, but his fingers stayed in her core, still fingering her. </p><p>Each pump of his thick fingers drove her crazy. </p><p>She let him do what for a minute … or maybe more, the time passed weirdly in that moment, but soon, she spoke once more. “I think that’s enough with the fingers,” she managed to whisper, ready to stop things. </p><p>She loved the feelings, but she was not ready to surrender control. No matter what. </p><p>“You’re right, Madam,” he said, but, unlike what she expected, he grabbed her arms and pushed her forward, before shifting one hand to her throat, his hold burning. “It’s time for the real treat.” </p><p>“T-this is absurd,” she said, but that was all she was able to say as he pressed his crotch against her ass, showing just how big of a monster he packed. Normally, she wasn’t exactly obsessed with size, but when combined with his attitude, it was breaking her resistance in a shocking manner. </p><p>“Of course not, sweetie. Why waste the private beach,” he said, and she found herself pressing against the bed once more, unable to answer. There was no mirror, but she was sure her expression was dazed, on the edge of a collapse.</p><p>Not exactly something that she was ready to show. </p><p>“Now, let’s open those beautiful legs,” he ordered, as if he fully expected her to follow that order. She was rather surprised when she climbed completely before her legs widened, obeying him just like she expected. </p><p>Behind her, a shuffle reached her ear. She glimpsed back, and saw that he was packing a monster even bigger than she expected. </p><p>“Now, Madam Presley. Let’s see if your pussy can handle the checks your mouth continuously keeps writing,” he said, unable to keep himself from mocking her as he pressed his shaft against her entrance. Her eyes widened as she took the size of his shaft once more. </p><p>“That…” she said, her voice bruised. “That’s a big monster.” </p><p>“I’m sure a woman of your caliber could easily handle it, Madam,” Darion said, this time his mocking tone impossible to hide, telling Anna just how badly he played her. But any answer she might have died as he pushed forward, his shaft parting her core. </p><p>She was not a virgin, far from it. But his size wasn’t exactly easy to handle, and worse was his merciless attitude. She grunted in shock and pleasure while he pushed aggressively, invading her. </p><p>Anna felt like she was lost in her mind as she felt his great shaft disappear into her core, letting it happen rather than asking him to stop. She didn’t know how to assess that, but the pleasure was unmistakable. </p><p>As he continued to push, those thoughts fell to the wayside, invading her core aggressively, The phenomenal level of wetness she managed to acquire was the only thing that was keeping it from turning into a disaster. </p><p>She didn’t remember the last time she got this wet. </p><p>Yet, she found herself opening her legs even more, allowing him easier access. </p><p>“You’re not bad when it came to flexibility, especially for a woman of your age,” he commented. Any other time, a comment about her age would summon hell, but now, she just moaned despite the shame filling her whole being. </p><p>She was being dominated, and she loved it. </p><p>The existential crisis that triggered was immense, but not enough to ask him to stop. Even with the pain that accompanied it, it was the greatest pleasure she had ever felt, and she found it impossible to stop halfway. </p><p>She closed her eyes, enjoying the feeling, even when he flipped, and she found herself on her back, with her legs on his shoulders. “Flexible indeed,” he mocked as his hips moved, exploding against her ass, each hit echoing in the empty beach club. </p><p>And worse, she couldn’t even blame the alcohol for it as she didn’t drink a drop. It was pure pleasure, working wonders to create an even stronger haze…</p><p>Turning her into an observer in her own body.</p><p>“Please,” Anna whispered once she found herself halfway raised. </p><p>“Please what, bitch,” he said as he slapped her thigh, the sound echoing in the opening. </p><p>“Please, fuck me harder,” she begged, unable to suppress the shame that followed. </p><p>“As you wish, Madam Presley,” he said mockingly, each word hitting her harder than the spanks that accompanied those words, leaving her thighs bright red. </p><p>“Please, sir,” she whispered, hating the fact that those words were affecting her worse than the treatment she was receiving. </p><p>And, then the climax hit, far stronger than she was used to. Combined with the shame and heat, she collapsed. “Pity, you didn’t even make me cum,” he said, disdainful. “You’re lucky that Mia is here to finish what you started, Madam,” he said, and walked away. </p><p>Leaving a dazed and confused Anna Presley behind.</p>
