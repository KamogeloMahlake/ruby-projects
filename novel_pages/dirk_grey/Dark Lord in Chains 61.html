        <p>In the end, I decided even as I pulled her hair back painfully and exposing her neck for my aggressive kisses, there was no need to complicate the situation. Emma was never one to handle the pressure successfully, making a more complicated ploy that required many complicated questions unnecessary. The pressure was the best option.  </p><p>Whether that pressure came in the form of political weight, pain, or pure pleasure. </p><p>I could see emotions cycling on her beautiful face as I littered her neck with kisses, panic, and pleasure battling. Though, it didn’t take long for the panic to disappear, leaving its place into acceptance, while the pleasure continued to grow. It was hardly the first time she experienced this particular dance. </p><p>I didn’t push her hard immediately, however. Instead, I pulled back, giving her a moment to cool down even as my hands sneaked toward her clothes, lingering on the edge of her beautiful breasts, giving her a moment to process the depth of the situation she found herself in once again. I didn’t want her to be distracted in a powerless whirlwind. No, I wanted her emotions to cool down, her mind to focus on the full extent of the issue.  </p><p>And, from the way her beautiful emerald eyes transformed, I could read that her confidence, already paper-thin in the first place, was shattering before I could utter a question. My first objective was already completed. </p><p>That didn’t mean I was going to take it lightly, of course. There was no overkill when it came to per-interrogation mood-setting, especially when it would allow me to finish the job I had started in the library earlier. </p><p>A panicked gasp escaped her mouth when, without a warning, I grabbed her hips even as I used a spell to pull my pants down, skewering her hard with my shaft, quicker than I normally would. </p><p>It was still a punishment session, after all. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised to see her silence, already tenuous, broken immediately as my shaft forced her tunnel to widen. She was sopping wet with anticipation, however, allowing it to slide in effortlessly. </p><p>She started moaning as I lifted her for a moment, only to slam her back down. At this point, her pride was too shattered for her to even fake a momentary resistance. A smirk popped in my face as I updated the objective for the evening — well, more of a morning. I still wanted to interrogate her, of course, but I also wanted her to actually beg for it before finally letting her cum. </p><p>Of course, before starting proper torture through denial, I first needed to bring her closer to the cliff. Luckily, after our repeated embraces, I knew the exact way to achieve that little objective. I grabbed her hips, though, at this point, I didn’t need to actually lift her up. She was more than happy to pick up speed, moving faster and faster with each second. </p><p>Just a minute — filled with her growing moans — was enough to bring her dangerously close to the climax. Her body must have been still primed since our earlier library adventure. “Faster,” she begged, even though it was her that was controlling the pacing at the moment. </p><p>It was a pity that her begging had the exact opposite effect. </p><p>A shocked yelp escaped her mouth even as I suddenly grabbed her waist and threw her on the bed, and she found herself laying down, prone. She tried to turn, but I pressed my hand on the small of her back, preventing her from flipping. “Is there something wrong?” she asked in a trembling tone. </p><p>“Of course not. I just realized that it was rude to keep you upright after such a long day of working hard. You earned your rest. Maybe even a beautiful massage session,” I said. </p><p>She stammered a garbled reply, cut halfway as I spanked her ass, reminding her who was the dominant party in our little twisted relationship. Despite the jolt of pain, her breathing quickened, showing just how close to the edge she was. </p><p>For that exact reason, I gave her a moment to catch her breath before I let my fingers move once more. Even worse for her, I could easily read the meaning behind the exact speed of her quickening breaths and twitching muscles, allowing me to keep her on the edge easily, without even resorting to magic.</p><p>At this moment, I could have subjected her to a soft massage, extending her torture gently. Unfortunately for her, she didn’t earn that. Instead, I slapped her ass again, hard, enough to earn another yelp before my fingers slipped inside her, pumping aggressively for a moment, bringing her just at the edge before pulling back, letting her come down. </p><p>“Please,” she whispered desperately, surrendering to my treatment instantly. </p><p>“Not before you answer a few of my questions,” I said even as I leaned closer to her face, half-buried into the pillow. “Like who was that mysterious maid that was accompanying you back in the library?” </p><p>“A friend…” she whispered, making an absolutely horrible attempt of deflection. </p><p>“Really,” I said even as I slipped my hand into her hair, pulling hard enough to earn a gasp. “She was a friend that you were helping to sneak into the palace, just for fun?” </p><p>“Yes—“ she tried to say, only to lose her words as I spanked her again. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie. If you’re going to lie, at least try to make it believable.” </p><p>“It was an agent of the mage guild,” she amended. “They are forcing me to help them?” </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked, acting as I believed her for a moment. “Why?” </p><p>“They work for a mysterious organization from another world, and they want to take control of the Empire,” she was quick to explain.</p><p>“And who is this mysterious organization?” I asked. I knew that she was trying to lie, but just because she was lying didn’t mean her words were worthless. Especially since I knew the exact truth she was trying to conceal. </p><p> “I’m afraid that you won’t believe me if I tell you,” she managed to gasp even as my fingers slipped inside her once more halfway, adding another layer to her distraction once again. </p><p>I smirked victoriously, aware that she didn’t have the angle to see it. She was already broken halfway. The next words that would leave her mouth were going to be spectacularly big, as she was clearly setting up a big reveal, hoping to distract me. What a futile effort. </p><p>The only question, whether she was going to use the truth, or a half-truth to distract me. </p><p>“Are you saying that there’s a probability of you trying to lie to me?” I countered, not bothering to hide my mocking tone. </p><p>“No! Of course not!” she said, quick to correct her words. “I could never lie to you.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said, despite knowing full well that she told that in an attempt to trick me. But, ironically, acting like I believed her declaration made it much easier for me to interrogate her. “Now, tell me.” </p><p>“The mage guild is working for elves,” she declared, twisting her neck as she said, a confident expression on her face. She clearly expected me to react explosively. </p><p>To her credit, I was surprised — though certainly not as much as I would have been before the discovery of an actual phoenix leading another faction — but I had no intention of actually showing my shock. “I see,” I said. “Do you have any concrete idea about their plans?” </p><p>“Y-you believe me?” she stuttered, the nature of her shock suggesting that it was actually closer to the truth. </p><p>“Why wouldn’t I believe you when I had already discovered their presence in the palace,” I said even as I let my hand slide on her back, conveniently resting on her heart to listen to her pulse. The sudden jump in her heartbeat as I said they were already in the palace suggested fear. </p><p>Which meant her claim about the elves was actually true.</p><p>“They had some wards in the palace, set up years ago,” I said, not wanting her to collapse in fear, especially if the source of said fear wasn’t me, even as I considered the implications of the elves. </p><p>Elves were nothing but a myth, but considering the same applied for Phoenixes, I wasn’t ready to write off their existence. Especially since their reputed magical excellence explained the existence of the mysterious wards in the palace very easily. </p><p>Of course, that left one important question. Why the hell elves and phoenixes — and probably other mythical existences — suddenly appearing around, trying to interfere. </p>
