        <p>I wanted to follow her implied request, but not before teasing her a bit first. </p><p>“It’s rare for you to be so kind when giving an order,” I whispered mockingly even as I continued to rub against her body, enjoying the sensation of her flawless skin, each second driving the sensation higher. “What do I owe this change?” </p><p>Another whimper escaped her lips, one she let out in response, showing just how much the pleasure she had been enjoying loosened her attitude. </p><p>Not that I could blame her, as she had been dealing with the weight of her Divine Spark for a very long time, and I could hardly imagine the extent of the stress such a problem caused her without any hope of resolution. </p><p>Add that to the responsibilities of managing Silver Spires, the royal politics that seemed to be determined to include her, undead attacks, and most importantly, the constant presence of the Eternals… </p><p>Yeah, neither her initial stress, nor the elation she felt as the weight of her biggest problem disappeared was entirely surprising. </p><p>“No answer, huh,” I whispered. “What a rude action. And do you know what happens to rude headmistresses?” </p><p>She flinched, but that might be more about me suddenly ceasing my flow of mana, stopping the slow binding process she had been enjoying. “W-what happens?” she found herself muttering reflexively, the shiver she let out as she said so impressive.</p><p>Especially considering she was tightly locked between the wall and my body. </p><p>“They face a choice,” I whispered, stretching the limits of Speech to the limits as I extended the cadence of my tone, wanting to elicit a reflexive response from her. Of course, even with my Speech and Charisma, it was not exactly a simple trick to pull. </p><p>I only dared to attempt it because of her current state. </p><p>“W-what choice?” she whispered. </p><p>“They either stop getting massages, or receive punishment,” I whispered. </p><p>“Punishment,” her answer came immediately, her determination beautiful. I felt her body stiffen as she realized the nature of her words, but before she could rethink her stance or take back her statement, my hand rose, landing on her ass. </p><p>The cry she let out was beautiful. It was certainly not pained, as to actually hurt her, I needed to hit hard enough to ruin the moment. </p><p>Luckily, that was not necessary, as the indignity of being spanked was much more impactful for someone in her position. For better or worse, she had ruled the school with a distant yet unyielding fist, enough to fall into the habit that even the simplest of her comments couldn’t be violated.  </p><p>The lack of pain was actually better, leaving her bereft of an excuse she could rely on to explain her shocked yet beautiful cry. </p><p>After the first spank, she had enough time to change her mind, but chose to stay silent as I used the opportunity to deliver another mana flood, just enough to make her consider suffering the indignity. </p><p>After all, what were a few spanks compared to finding herself pinned naked in her room, obediently giving up her body just for a massage… </p><p>The number of spanks slowly piled up as time passed, each arriving with a cracking sound, and leaving a soft, stinging sensation behind — one that I cast a reversed-healing spell to leave on her ass, making her flawless skin redden. </p><p>The other continued to caress her wings, their spectacular sensitivity not exactly helping her to recover from the conflicting physical feelings she had been enjoying. </p><p>Just as she was starting to get used to the new state, I pushed her limits once more, this time letting my hand slip low after the spank, dripping to a dangerous part of her anatomy. </p><p>A part that was sopping wet. </p><p>“N-noo,” she gasped in shock as my fingers danced around her clit, finally breaking the silence she maintained during the spanking. “That’s too—“ she added, but her voice died halfway as my fingers continued to dance around her sensitive spot, the pleasure building once more. </p><p>“What part of punishment you don’t understand?” I asked even as I finally let go of her wing, letting that hand slip between the wall and her body. Her gasp only intensified as I captured her nipple between my fingers, twisting hard enough to trigger another flood of pleasure, another touch of Healing magic perfect to add a layer of a shock to the equation. </p><p>“I don’t—“ she started, but as my fingers sank into her shockingly large breasts, she was once again betrayed by her own body, the flood of pleasure coalescing into a beautiful moan. It was a tense, throaty one, showing she was not too far from another climax. </p><p>The perfect thing to take as an implicit reaction to push further. </p><p>“You don’t, what?” I asked as I shifted my hands to her waist and pulled her as I stepped out of the bath, once again in the bridal hold, her beautiful wings flapping in trembles. </p><p>Yet, as she found herself lying on her bed, all she was able to achieve was a needy whimper. I grabbed her hips and pulled them up momentarily, preparing her for the real event, earning no complaint as she tried to deal with the invasion of pleasure. </p><p>Her hips stayed up as I pulled back, making no attempt to change her vulnerable position. Yet, I didn’t slide instantly. No, there was still one thing I wanted to do. Something I was being tempted for a long time. Since I had discovered her true nature. </p><p>I grabbed her wings. </p><p>It wasn’t a gentle touch, nor it was a violent move. The best word to describe it as I grabbed them was firm. As I pulled them up, she let out a shocked moan. </p><p>I paused a moment, enjoying the feeling of utter control as I grabbed her wings, her hands flailing helplessly as the invading pleasure ruined her coordination. </p><p>To make things even more fun, it wasn’t the greed that was keeping her obedient, as I had ceased using the mana flood as I carried her. </p><p>No, it was an even more beautiful sin that kept her in place. </p><p>Lust. </p><p>“Such a horny angel,” I said as I tightened my grip around her wings, and slid inside her, accompanied by a spectacular moan. </p><p>And just like that, I took the virginity of a beautiful angel. </p><p>As her warmth tightened around me, I paused, properly enjoying the changes in the nature of our little warped relationship, from the days I had treated her as a distant scary figure, to the days I had treated her as a strong yet naive boss… </p><p>Now, she was just a little horny angel, squirming under the invasion of unfamiliar pleasure as I continued to enjoy her phenomenal tightness, each second driving my intense pleasure even higher. </p><p>She might have an issue with my sudden pause, but if she did, she was too busy moaning with the constant invasion of pleasure to deal with it properly. </p><p>I didn’t stay motionless for long, of course. Regardless of how monumental the moment felt, it wasn’t enough to actually make me disregard the spectacular moment I was in — though, even if I did, she was ready to remind me with the sweetness of her moans, the rhythm of her dangling breasts, and the beautiful contrast of the color of her hips, still carrying the mark of my spanks. </p><p>I pushed forward, something she enjoyed rather well if the way her back arched was any indicator. </p><p>My hold over her wings tightened as my hips started rocking back and forth, pushing forward as her tight body remodeled around me, her moans exploding loudly enough to deafen a weaker man. </p><p>For a while, I did nothing other than moving back and forth, just enjoying the relentless invasion of pleasure, her tightness getting more and more. There was no banter, no teasing, no order. </p><p>Just a steady rhythm of our bodies as I pushed her toward the second climax of her life. One that didn’t take long to arrive, hitting her with all the strength of a collapsing building, pushing her toward the land of unconsciousness… </p><p>Only for me to prevent that by casting a simple healing spell. </p><p>The utility of magic was hard to overstate. </p><p>However, the spell was not there to wake her up directly. Instead, I cast that to temporarily block her natural pain resistance. Waking her up was a task for my hand, stopping and grabbing her beautiful wings for a moment as I spanked her beautiful ass. </p><p>The jolt of pain was perfect to make her open her eyes despite the incredible flood of pleasure. “Do you need a break, or can the great headmistress of Silver spires continue without a pesky break.” </p><p>It was proof of her pride that even under the circumstances, it made her twist her neck and catch my gaze, her expression beautifully tight, showing hints of anger — hints only because it was being drowned in a sea of pleasure and trembling. </p><p>“I’ll take it as a no,” I smirked even as I pressed my hand on her back, pushing her down for another session…</p><p><br></p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>
