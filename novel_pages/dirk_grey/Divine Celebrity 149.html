        <p>“Fuck, you weren’t joking when you were bragging about us lasting all night, weren’t you,” Megan moaned as she pulled up her head. We were still in the middle of nowhere, but that was about to come to an end as I dragged her into the car. </p><p>“Let’s spice things up a bit, things are getting a bit monotone,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, yes, very monotone,” Megan answered playfully. “Just three hours of intense sex, public sex, with more orgasms than I could count. Just a casual weekday.” </p><p>I chuckled even as I gently placed her into the passenger seat, while her clothing floated to the backseat under the effects of the telekinesis. I was impressed that she somehow managed to sound bitchy even after that chain of explosive orgasms. </p><p>“Yes, that’s why the next one, you’re going to actually earn,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, what’s the rules of this little challenge,“ she said quickly even as I sat in the driver’s seat, equally naked. </p><p>“The rules of the game are very simple. I would be driving aimlessly, and you would be doing your best to make me cum. And, whenever you make me cum, I’ll make you cum as well.” </p><p>Her eyes widened in excitement, which was certainly not a surprise. I had seen the way she drove, and she was certainly a speed devil, and the setup was certainly a challenge for her. “Just no cheating,” she said. </p><p>“Define cheating,” I countered. </p><p>“No using magic to prevent yourself from cumming,” she defined. </p><p>“Certainly,” I said, accepting her deal. Another day, I might have used my tricks to see just how far I pushed her, but tonight was a celebration of my first successful Acolyte, and I wanted to reward her.</p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean her job would be easy. “Just make sure to hold on,” I said as I started driving. </p><p>“And you just make sure we don’t crash,” she warned back, but the speed she leaned toward me showed she didn’t have a particular concern about that aspect. </p><p>I started driving slowly — relatively, barely at seventy miles — while she settled into her new position, her fingers wrapped around the base of my shaft, finally testing the length and thickness calmly after our frantic rutting. “A bit small, isn’t it,” she commented, trying to be a bitchy tease. Her words would have been more effective if her fingers could have met around my girth …</p><p>Or, she hadn’t spent the last few hours reaching double-digits in her orgasm counter. </p><p>I just chucked as she leaned further, amused to see desire still shining in her eyes after everything, her fingers dancing back and forth gently. “How interesting. Why don’t you prove it?” I challenged. </p><p>“Of course, how do you want me to prove it?” she asked. </p><p>“If it’s that small, taking it all shouldn’t be a challenge,’ I said, enjoying the way her eyes widened as I put my hands on her shoulders. I could have pushed her down, but I wanted to watch her struggle in her power, so I pulled back after a momentary caress. </p><p>“Of course not,” she answered. Her voice wasn’t as confident as she intended, but that didn’t prevent her from leaning down and capturing my length bravely. Megan might be a lot of things … but a coward, she was not.  </p><p>So, she took my girth bravely even if she had to open her mouth to the limit, sinking down with a sudden aggressiveness. Just a push was enough to take it halfway in. </p><p>An excellent start. </p><p>While she moved up and down, I decided to multitask. Particularly, I wanted to experiment with my car. I had been surprised by the sudden performance it had during the collusion with an armored car, and I wanted to test the limits. </p><p>Spreading my Intent over the car had been easy, allowing me to connect to the car better. It wasn’t suddenly like a new body part, but more of a mental HUD that fed me accurate information about the various aspects and the condition of the car. I focused on the scratches on the side, curious whether my recovery trick would work. </p><p>It did not … but I could feel that I wasn’t too far away. A task for the future. </p><p>Instead, I pressed the gas, suddenly pushing the car to its limits. The sensation of sudden speed was amazing, and I wasn’t the only one enjoying the change if Megan’s sudden change was any indicator. </p><p>Her eyes flashed with desire mixed with fear as she took me fully into her mouth, pumping as fast as she could manage, her gags ringing against the backdrop of the engine noise. It would have been a crazy and reckless thing to do without my supernatural powers, with an accident enough to ruin both of our lives. </p><p>But with magic, it was just a thrilling roller-coaster ride. </p><p>“Do you want me to go faster?” I asked her. </p><p>She pulled back, and paused for a moment to suppress her gasps. “What are you talking about, I know all the parts you have used for your rust-bucket, we’re already going at the limit of what’s possible.” </p><p>I chuckled even as I pushed her hair away from her hair gently, a touch that turned domineering as I grabbed her hair hard enough to make her yelp. “Oh, sweetie, did you forget I have magic,” I reminded her as I pushed her down. </p><p>I didn’t need to keep my hand there as she continued pushing down. Soon, she was doing her best to devour my length, while I pumped even more Intent to the car, and soon, it reached a speed that could be comparable to a supercar. </p><p>And, making turns even a supercar would have failed on the poorly maintained empty interstate highway, giving me a sense of the enhancement. In some sense, I could feel that I was granting temporary traits to the car, Speed and Agility in particular. </p><p>They worked similarly to how they did for me when I received my first Traits when I started playing football, allowing a temporary rejection of physics. For example, it should have been impossible to take such a sharp turn while going faster than three-hundred-and-fifty miles, but not only I managed to take that turn, but also I grabbed Megan’s shoulder to keep her in place so she could continue deep-throating me with a passion that shocked me. </p><p>It turned out physics-breaking speed was her weakness. Her body slid back and forth as her tits smashed against my legs, allowing her to take me in fully without straining her neck. To admit the truth, I loved the sensation as well, and exploded into her mouth far quicker than I would have otherwise. </p><p>Luckily, not too soon, as the moment I exploded into her mouth, she started trembling, climaxing without even touching herself. </p><p>I slowed before her trembling could even subside. “Good girl,” I said as she struggled to swallow the last drops, but before she could say anything else, I pulled her on my lap, already raging to go, not bothering to stop. </p><p>And, started fucking her while going just at the edge of two hundred. </p><p>“Faster!” she moaned as she jumped on my lap repeatedly, taking me deep into her wetness once again. “You owe me another orgasm.” </p><p>“I pay my debts,” I answered. I didn’t know her request for me to go faster was about driving faster, or moving my hips faster. To be on the safe side, I did both, and her cries filled the car, loud enough to suppress the sound of the engine. </p><p>Her eyelids closed firmly as she cried repeatedly, appreciating the incredible fucking she was receiving, just as much as I was enjoying her tightness. “Faster,” she moaned once again.” </p><p>“Are you sure you can handle it, my sexy partner in crime?” I said, but I didn’t even wait for a response as I pumped my hips up mercilessly, giving an even rougher treatment. Just like that, her moans lost any sense of control and moderation, turning animalistic. </p><p>Her fingernails dug into my shoulders, hard enough to hurt, and I responded by fucking her even harder, using the wheel for leverage to push even deeper, only my supernatural abilities preventing a disaster. </p><p>She was close to the edge, and her mind was losing all cohesion, but she still responded by letting her instincts take over and impaling herself deeper in a beastly fury. I had to admit, I was surprised. I would have expected to be calmer. </p><p>Her constant acting to maintain her popularity must have been even more of a challenge than I guessed. </p><p>“You’re mine, Megan,” I growled as I exploded into her, and even as I did so, I felt the Acolyte bond solidify further, not just from my demand, but also from her acceptance. The difference was stark. Earlier, it could be snapped. </p><p>Now, it was permanent. </p><p>I wondered if she knew exactly how deep she found herself in the situation, but that was a question for another time. Now, I exploded into her, celebrating the sudden turn of events… </p><p>It was truly Divine… </p>
