        <p>Hi everyone. </p><p>As the story reaches chapter 79, it marks the end of book 1 where the main focus is showing our 'hero' grow from an unlucky passerby to an ambitious young man trying to survive against much greater forces in a complicated world. </p><p>The second book will focus on the offensive against the Syndicate and the Guild - along with lots of fun scenes. Chapter 79 is essentially an epilog for the book 1 and a prolog for the book 2. </p><p>However, since there's a lot of details I need to decide, I won't start posting the book immediately. There's a lot of details that needs to be decided for the story to continue developing the world and the characters in a fun way. </p><p>Instead, Blacksmith versus the System (A new story) will take its place as my 10$ exclusive story for the next few months. </p><p>Happy reading. </p>
