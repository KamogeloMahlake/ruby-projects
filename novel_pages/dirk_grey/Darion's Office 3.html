        <title>Darion's Office 3</title>

        <p>Darion first glanced around, making sure the office didn’t have any security cameras. He didn’t expect it to have, as very few owners actually did so, but there was no harm to be safe.</p><p>The room was clean.  </p><p>“Now, let’s find those ledgers,” he murmured as he looked around once more, this time trying to find the most convenient place to hide any financial documents in the outdated form. “Who uses paper…” he murmured in dismissal. </p><p>Especially since it was so easy to find, he noted as he noticed the large cabinet leaning against a wall had several scratches in front of it, far more than it would take in such a casual room. </p><p>Darion let a wide smirk invade his face as he pulled it forward, only to find a huge file hidden behind. “Jackpot,” he murmured in amusement as he grabbed the file, putting them on top, intending to take a few photos to record before putting them back. </p><p>He didn’t plan to confront his new boss. He just wanted to have it for the future. </p><p>Before he could do it, however, he heard the door open. He expected that it was his new boss to return, which would have accelerated his plan. Not a disaster, but it was never fun to adjust the plans, no matter how trivial. </p><p>“What are you doing?” a voice said, one that was familiar, yet different than what he expected. </p><p>Maybe he didn’t need to adjust his plans. </p><p>He turned toward the door, only to see the secretary moving closer, her beautiful face contorted in panic, and not annoyance. The distinction was important. Annoyance would have meant she didn’t know what was in the files. </p><p>Panic meant that she does. </p><p>He cut her off, amused by the shock appearing on her face as he did so, and she registered the difference in size once more. “What are you doing!” she warned in anger. </p><p>“What am I doing? Cleaning like just the boss lady wanted, until I found some misplaced files,” Darion answered calmly, curious just how far she would push. </p><p>“She can’t—“ she started, only to stop halfway as she registered her words, realizing that she might reveal more than he knew — or should have known — if she talked more. “Even if she ordered to tidy up, that does mean a general cleaning. Not a deep cleaning, in case the client comes. Now, put the files back in their place, and continue with the other places.” </p><p>“Really, that’s an interesting place to place some files.” </p><p>“What would a criminal know. It’s just a way to keep the confidential files secure,” she stated. “Now, let me go and I can make sure if anything was out of order.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, since they looked important, I made sure nothing would happen to them. I have already made a digital copy of them,” Darion answered, letting his smirk widen as he said so. </p><p>“You did what!” she gasped in fear as she tried to pass, only to bounce off him again. After all, she was not a superhero, and anger didn’t make her suddenly power up or move faster. As always, he loved the fact that he was tall enough to hover above anyone else. “They are confidential company documents, you can’t touch them.” </p><p>He certainly enjoyed the unease it caused on the smug secretary that treated him like garbage. </p><p>“Really,” he said mockingly. “And here I am, willing to bet that they are just some financial report. But maybe I had misread them. What do I know? I’m just a dirty prisoner.”</p><p>“N-no, you’re a productive member of the society,” she said.</p><p>“Of course I am,” Darion said, mock-affronted. “And I’m doing my best to show how good of a worker I am by digitally backing up every file in case they are important. I’m sure that’s even a part of my official work description.” </p><p> “Why can’t you act like a criminal and laze around,” she murmured like I wouldn’t hear, showing that she had some anger problems as well. </p><p>Darion chuckled, looking at her. “Well, after prison, I find myself filled with energy. I think I will continue recording them unless I can find something to distract me.” </p><p>“Like what—“ she started as she raised her gaze, only for Darion to capture her lips in a searing kiss, his tongue invading her mouth, silencing her excellently. </p><p>He expected a rough slap, or an ineffective push. He certainly didn’t expect her tongue to dart out to wrap against his, her hands already caressing his arms like she was doing her best to do so. </p><p>****</p><p>Janet was suddenly feeling dazed as she found a tongue invading her mouth. She should think about why her tongue suddenly responded, but that was not possible…</p><p>Not when she found her thoughts were occupied by the texture of his skin under her fingertips, the hardness of his muscles contrasting with the softness of his skin. Though, her dazed state wasn’t enough to make her forget that it was an absurd situation.</p><p>His hand firmly pressing against her back to pull her closer, rubbing repeatedly to deliver the most aggressive — yet somehow most sensual — massage she had ever received was enough to remind her that. </p><p>A part of her mind whispered to her to let it continue, but then his hips moved, only for something impossibly huge to press against her, telling her that things might reach a truly dangerous place if she didn’t stop them. </p><p>“S-stop,” she managed to say as she pushed him away after a while — a long while, she loathed to admit — and luckily, he followed. Unfortunately, that only came with a sudden sense of loss, as she found herself wishing that he hadn’t stopped. </p><p>Maybe that was clear on her face, because before she could take a step back, he grabbed her ass and lifted her, treating her like she had absolutely no weight. “Just how strong you are?” she found herself murmuring. </p><p>Even as she cursed herself as the stupid question, like that was more important than the secret financial documents being out. </p><p>“Just enough,” he answered as his fingers dug into her ass, her feet dangling, treating her like she weighed absolutely nothing. </p><p>She bit her lips as she tried to come up with a way to bring the discussion back to the financials, but her clouded mind came empty. Well, stating that as empty would have been a misnomer. It was just that, her mind was occupied more with different questions. </p><p>Like, how could a man be that strong … and reckless enough to just lean down and take her. It wasn’t that she was inexperienced with sex. She had several boyfriends, but none of them even dared to treat her badly under her sharp gaze, acting more like servants than lovers, afraid of doing the wrong thing and losing her. </p><p>Only to end up dumped even faster. </p><p>She loved the power that it gave her, thinking that it was more fun than the mediocre thing called sex… Or, at least she thought she did until she tasted his reckless assault. </p><p>And, he was reckless enough to do it in Mia’s office, who was one of the few people that she was actually scared of. </p><p>It took a while for her to realize she had been distracted once more, and that only happened when she realized, his right hand, which was rubbing her ass, had slipped under her skirt while her hazy mind had been lost on the implications of his approach.</p><p>“We need to stop,” she whispered. </p><p>“Why?” he answered idly. </p><p>Janet found herself freezing at the simple answer. “W-what do you mean why?” she managed to answer a moment later. Though, in her hazy mind, gathering that answer was difficult enough that, she was late to react when he moved her toward the desk. </p><p>Or react when her jacket fell open, revealing her absence of a bra. </p><p>What a day to pick a daring outfit, she noted.</p><p>“Please, Mia might return any moment now,” she begged. </p><p>“That’s your only problem?” he asked, his smirk damnable. </p><p>No, she wanted to shout, but her lips chose to rebel. “Yes!” </p><p>“Good then,” he declared smugly as she found herself leaning against her desk. “Because her sister just came and brought her away. It doesn’t look like she would return soon…” </p><p>And just like that, Janet found herself locked in an answer, one that she was supposed to hate. </p><p>But it was very hard to do with her body burning in excitement…</p>
