        <p>It was not without a reason that I was not glowing with happiness even as the first stage of my grand experimentation was a success, and I had identified why my mana had worked much better than the others to contain Divine Spark. </p><p>Tantric. </p><p>In a way, that was obvious considering it was only after receiving that ability I was able to help the ladies that shared my affection in many different ways, from easily refilling their mana in an efficiency that was impossible to copy to help them level up directly.</p><p>However, from a different perspective, it was dangerously damning. Because, until the Divine Spark, everything I had done was somehow related to the System. It was easy to write off the impact of the Tantric as a transitory success, allowing me to achieve something that could be also achieved by the others, just more smoothly. </p><p>The number of high-leveled combatants the Eternals were able to create in bulk certainly supported that conclusion. </p><p>Yet, as I looked at the Divine Spark of light smashing against the walls of its Tantric prison helplessly despite the power it contained, I couldn’t help but think I had underestimated that particular skill. </p><p>Tantric was much more mysterious than just making mana softer and easier to control. </p><p>The question, I thought even as I looked at the fragment of Divine Spark, helplessly pushing against its special container, why I had made that mistake despite the obvious implications on the way. I should have noticed that sooner, I thought for a while, only to abandon that track. </p><p>Before I could delve deep, a more important detail distracted me. </p><p>The Divine Spark was calming down! </p><p>With a frown, I turned my attention toward the imprisoned Divine Spark, trying to understand why it was slowing down. For a scary moment, I was afraid it had some kind of consciousness, therefore realizing the futility of its escape, but luckily, that intimidating thought was invalidated easily, because the Spark continued to lose speed at a very steady pace. </p><p>Then, I noticed the brightness of the Spark was decreasing alongside its aggressive bouncing, giving me another interesting probability. Tantric mana was somehow destroying the Divine Spark, which, interestingly, no less scarier than my earlier theories. </p><p>As I watched, I corrected my assumption once more. Divine Spark wasn’t being destroyed, but transforming. Its brightness and aggressiveness were disappearing, leaving a much calmer concept behind, one that was much easier to transform. </p><p>It was hard to define the remaining energy. It was certainly not another source of mana, not even close. It was still an energy of the same intensity. It wouldn’t be wrong to call it Divine Spark. </p><p>One thing was certain. It wasn’t the Divine Spark of Light anymore. </p><p>Somehow, Tantric was able to get rid of the unique nature of Divine Spark, leaving only the pure energy behind. “So, that was why I could absorb Divine Spark to empower myself while the Headmistress is suffering for centuries,” I noted after taking the risk of absorbing the transformed Spark, feeling a small yet noticeable improvement in my body. </p><p>I repeated the experiment a couple of times, only to notice the more intense the Tantric qualities of the mana I pushed, the quicker the transformation process was, removing any doubt whether the Tantric skill that was responsible. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>I would have loved to continue experimenting, but after a few more tests, I had managed to deplete all the Divine Spark I had managed to pilfer from the headmistress — though luckily, didn’t let it go to waste, most of it going to my body to reinforce it further while the some consumed by the System, hopefully enough to avoid further embargo to my leveling. With that, I needed to stop the experimentation until the next day.  </p><p>Unfortunately, that didn’t mean I was free to do whatever I wanted until the next day. I still had to visit the experimentation room that was built for me by the courtesy of the Princess, not to mention I needed to reveal the mystery behind her aide’s sudden level up and change of skills. Yet, as I summoned my air elemental once more, I couldn’t help but sigh exhaustedly. I was trying to deal with too many different things. </p><p>Getting strong had its own disadvantages. </p><p>After another travel, I was back at Silver Spires, walking toward the temporary Royal residence once more, curious whether I could integrate the discovery about the impact of the Tantric Mana on the storage artifact I was trying to create — though that would have been challenging to do without being caught by one of the many spying wards and spells they had integrated into the room. </p><p>“Please sir, this way,” said the guard, a marked difference from the way they had greeted me the day prior. Clearly, their instructions had been renewed. “Lady Dalia is waiting for you at her rooms for breakfast before you start working, sir.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, nodding to the guard before I walked inside, following a maid who led me to another corridor, until she opened a door, and revealing an opulent room — too opulent, even, especially considering that it was a temporary room. </p><p>“Please take a seat, sir, Lady Delia must be here in a minute,” she said, waiting at the door, waiting for me to get inside before she closed the door. Interestingly, she stayed outside, leaving me alone in the room. </p><p>Interesting choice, I thought even I glanced around the room, taking a more detailed record of the opulent scene. Yet, as I glanced carefully, at my Perception, it didn’t take long to realize the opulence was more of a foil than actual richness. </p><p>The golden statue on the corner was just gold-plated, the silverware that radiated a sense of magic, but it was not a permanent enchantment or enhanced during forging, but just a simple spell to fake value, though it was good enough to avoid my attention if I hadn’t been looking carefully. </p><p>And they were not the only detail. Every single painting in the room, every piece of furniture, every plate was enhanced with spells, spells that had been cast just minutes ago. To their credit, they were cast expertly, more than enough to trick anyone that didn’t have my phenomenal Stats and breadth of magical abilities. </p><p>They were fake nonetheless. </p><p>Luckily, the delicious spread of breakfast food that covered the table was not fake, filling my nose with its delicious smell. It was certainly a feast worthy of the Royal family. Interestingly, there was no maid to serve the food — not that I cared about it, but it was an interesting break from the image of opulence they were trying to reflect. </p><p>When another door opened, and Delia entered, I understood the reason. “Sorry for the delay,” the busty blonde said as she entered the room, wearing a beautiful dress, one that was far too revealing to be appropriate wear. It was a delicious red dress, with a cleavage deep enough to reveal she wasn’t wearing a corset, along with a deep slit that covered the side of the dress that implied the same for her panties. </p><p>Yet, despite the beauty of the sight, it wasn’t the thing that caught my attention. </p><p>No, it was the notification I had received. </p><p>[Level Difference of five or more! No Experience]</p><p>What an interesting development, realizing that her level had changed once more, this time dropping below the target. I couldn’t help but feel curious about which skills I would find once I tapped into her soul space. </p><p>“N-not a problem,” I said, making a show of stammering as I let my gaze stuck on what her deep cleavage was displaying, deep enough to reveal the ghost of her areolas, my attention enough to deepen her smile. </p><p>With the way she dressed, her reaction was hardly a surprise. </p><p>“Still, my apologies,” she whispered throatily as she walked forward, her hips shaking beautifully with each step, the allure radiating off her almost taking a physical presence, to a level that would have been impossible without significant assistance from her Charisma, one that was enhanced further by a few select skills. “I shouldn’t have kept such an exalted guest waiting.” </p><p>I couldn’t wait to discover the exact configuration of skills she had to display such an aura of seduction. </p><p>I gulped loudly. “N-nonsense,” I stammered even as I took a step back, doing my best to look shocked, curious just how far she would push in her little game, and whether I could ferret out the reason why she had escalated her seduction game. </p><p>“Whatever you say,” she said, her smile confident as she leaned forward over the table to reach a plate, enhancing her already scandalous cleavage even more. “Let me prepare a plate for you…” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
