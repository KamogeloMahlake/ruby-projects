        <p>With both showers occupied, I found myself with nothing to do. Well, there was something to do, I could have joined Carrie at the downstairs bathroom, showering together, but doing so would have ruined the whole point of the evening. Carrie was already too hesitant to act, and I doubted the lethargy of an orgasm would push her to act.</p><p>No, I wanted her on edge, struggling for her reward.  </p><p>Instead, I walked upstairs and knocked on the bathroom door as I passed. “Sarah, do you mind giving a shout after you finish your shower, I’ll be in my room at the end of the corridor,” I said, and after receiving a positive answer, I walked to my room. </p><p>I got rid of my trunks with a kick, into the laundry bin, and wrapped a towel around my waist instead, which left my chest naked. It wasn’t an intentional strategy, I just didn’t want to sit naked while waiting for Sarah to finish her shower. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be useful a few minutes later, where I had been distracting myself by playing with my phone. </p><p>“You have a nice room,” Sarah said, her tone, seductive, playful, and, most importantly, intentionally exaggerated. Not bad, I thought as I swiveled in my chair, looking at her. What I saw left me satisfied. Her beautiful black hair was still damp, adding a different aura to her normally uptight state. </p><p>However, the real clincher was the way she dressed. She wore a tight black top, sleeveless to show off her lithe arms, scooped low enough to show a tasteful amount of cleavage, and snug enough to show off the perfect shape of her small breasts—well, compared to the delicious monstrosities Carrie was sporting, but otherwise perfectly-proportioned. The naked line that was left in her stomach just added to her aura of sexiness. It even gave a small peek of her bra when she leaned forward, revealing that she was wearing black there as well.</p><p>Down below, she wore clingy black shorts, barely enough to cover her ass, but clinging to her body tightly enough to reveal the shape and the exact lace content of her panties. Moreover, they looked soft like satin, begging to be caressed. Overall, she was a delicious bombshell, much better than the usual drab tomboyish stuff she preferred for the school. </p><p>I decided to reward her a bit, and as I stood up, I pushed my towel down slightly. Not much, just enough to give her a full, unobstructed view of my abs without making the moment pornographic. The sudden blush on her face as she stammered, swallowing her next words was simply spectacular. </p><p>“I’ll be downstairs in a few minutes,” I said as I walked toward her, amused by the way her eyes dipping lower, widening in shock. Clearly, without Carrie for her to focus on, my naked torso was much more effective to distract her. </p><p>I decided to tease her a bit more. She was late to pull back from the doorway, so I let my body brush against her as I passed, which worked perfectly to dislodge my towel, letting it fall on the floor. “Sorry!” she exclaimed in shock as she slammed her hands on her face, taking a step back, the calmness she tried to reflect evaporated completely.  </p><p>However, I noticed that she was still peering from a crack between her fingers as I refastened the towel around my waist. It took effort not to chuckle as her revealing clothing revealed a full-body blush. Despite her attempts to make her the wordy member of their little club of nerds, she was just as innocent as Carrie. </p><p>I wondered she would be equally unbounded once she got a taste of the joys of physical affairs. </p><p>An upbeat whistle escaped my lips as I stepped into the bathroom, but with a sudden streak of mischievousness, I decided to leave the door cracked enough to be noticeable by an attentive wanderer. Then, the hot water flew over my body, getting rid of the pool water and the shower gel, leaving only cleanliness behind. </p><p>A glance at the mirror, however, revealed that I had an audience, a brunette one. Doing my best not to chuckle, I started washing the lower half of my body, but with a generous amount of bubbles between my legs to hide my half-erect shaft. It was still a preview, after all. </p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t just turn and watch her. Instead, I tried to get a sense of what she was doing from accidental glances of peripheral vision. When I noticed a sharp movement, I thought that she had left, but a lingering one revealed that she had been still in her position, her shoulders moving suspiciously. </p><p>Pity that she was looking through a crack, which hid the rest of her body from my view. I was planning how to tease her more, when a door opened downstairs, and Sarah jerked back, her flickering —and perverted— confidence destroyed by Carrie walking around freely around the house. </p><p>A set of footsteps got away rapidly. I sighed as I quickly finished my shower and changed into a pair of shorts and a tight muscle shirt. Before I could go downstairs, I heard a heated discussion between the girls, which, unfortunately, was not loud enough to be deciphered from upstairs. </p><p>Whatever the reason for their short tussle, I found them sitting on the couch, watching TV with a stiffness that shouted they were deliberately not looking at each other. I coughed lightly, and Carrie jumped up to her feet. “Chad,” she said with her sweet voice, giving me the opportunity to assess her outfit. </p><p>I hadn’t been expecting her to wear something sexier than her swimsuit which she chose for the pool, but somehow, she managed to surprise me. Technically, it was a simple, airy sundress, covered with simple white and blue patterns. On most women, it would be a nice and innocent dress that enhanced their conservative side. But for a woman with the curves Carrie had, it was nothing less than an erotic smoke show. Her arms were left bare, and while the top of her dress was tight enough that it was clearly trying to contain her massive busts, it was failing, and failing because of a lack of reinforcement. </p><p>She wasn’t wearing a bra. </p><p>Just that fact —along with her god-given curves, of course— was enough to turn her conservative dress into an erotic masterpiece. The top of her dress wrapped around her globes, taking its shape enough to create an excellent sketch of her breasts. Her nipples, exerting their presence proudly, didn’t hurt the aura of the moment any. And that was before coming to her cleavage, which was clearly designed to be a modest one for anyone else, but with her tits stretching the fabric, turned into a delicious show. </p><p>And to top it off, it was a thin dress, not thin enough to be transparent, but thin enough to reveal every single detail of her body whenever she moved, from her perfect tits to her plump ass. </p><p>“You look nice,” I said, enjoying the blush that spread her face. From her reaction, I could see that it was not a planned show. She clearly brought the dress to impress, but I had no doubt that until several minutes ago, she had been planning to wear the dress with a bra, which would have reduced the sexiness potential of it several notches. </p><p>I was rather happy with the last-minute change. However, it didn’t take a genius to realize Sarah wasn’t as approving. Part of it was no doubt about her unhappiness about being upstaged —and since she had already shown her outfit to me, changing was not an option unless she wanted to be too direct— but I was prideful enough to hope that my two little back-to-back shows had left her frustrated enough to trigger her anger more. </p><p>“So, what game are we playing, girls,” I said even as grabbed the remote and switched to a music channel that seemed innocent. There was another little trap hidden there, waiting for its time to go off. </p><p>“Do you have any board games,” Sarah asked, which, honestly, surprised me. </p><p>“Sure, the first drawer under the TV,” I said, which contained several board games, purchased as a part of the family decor rather than actually using them. “Nice choice,” I said when she raised a simple tower-building game, trying to hide my disappointment, but with limited impact. </p><p>“It’s an excellent game, rewarding eye-hand coordination,” Sarah said smugly while Carrie stiffened. </p><p>“If that’s what you wish,” I said, trying not to sound flat, but failing. When she mentioned party games, I had been expecting something more interesting than this. </p><p>Then, after sharing a victorious smirk with Carrie, she turned to me, with a victorious expression on her face. “You don’t seem to be too happy about that,” she said. “And I didn’t even finish explaining.” </p><p>“Oh, go ahead,” I said, giving her a dark yet heated glare that worked perfectly in the rapid seduction of the cheerleaders. If their matching blushes were any indicator, it worked equally well on nerdy ones. </p><p>“Well, I was thinking of removing a piece of clothing as a punishment, and that stays removed until the end of the night,” she said, then, once again looked at Carrie. “As long as everyone can handle such a simple forfeit, of course.” </p><p>“Of course I can, let’s play,” Carrie answered rapidly, with a wave of anger that surprised me. Whatever discussion I had missed that managed to galvanize Carrie more than I had expected. </p><p>“Sure, but with a small addendum,” I said. “Everyone has the right to remove the last piece under the blanket,” I said, pointing at the large fluffy one that lay on the large couch, but doing so would mean leaving the game. The first one to lose will have an additional punishment by the winner. </p><p>“Sounds good,” Carrie agreed quickly, feeling challenged by the forfeit despite her anger, unaware of the naughty implications of the supposedly protective scheme I had offered. Sarah, on the other hand, sent me a frustrated look before sat on the floor with no preamble, setting up the blocks with a smoothness that surprised me greatly. She had skilled fingers. </p><p>I sat down next to her, curious about the extent of the skillfulness of her fingers… </p>
