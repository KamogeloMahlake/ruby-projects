        <p>As Sapphire rubbed her beautiful body against mine, my hands caressing her supple skin, it was not hard to come to a decision about the next step. Watching her dance erotically at her own pace was beautiful, but taking her hard against the pile of gold was even better. </p><p>Especially since I still have a lot of work to do by searching the responsible parties for the construction of that mysterious ward. The last thing I want to do was to deal with a third party during my second rise of power — a rise that was clearly going to focus on the Empire of the Light more than the lands of darkness at this points thanks to the rather ‘harmonious’ relationship I had achieved with the royal family. </p><p>Still, I waited until Sapphire turned to face me once more, her hands dancing between her waist and her breasts, her nipples standing out in arousal, her breath panting. Then, she bent forward, her bare breasts swinging freely in front of me as she placed a gentle kiss on my cheek. </p><p>One that enflamed my arousal to a new level. </p><p>I put my hands on her waist, forcibly pulling her to my lap, pinning her against my naked shaft, which didn’t phase her even a second. Her hips started to rock back and forth, marking the side of my shaft with her wetness. I was initially intending to grab her waist to make her hips move, but since she handled that part herself, I pressed my palms against her generous breasts, squeezing aggressively. </p><p>“Ah!” she gasped, making a sound of pain and pleasure as my fingers dug into her flesh aggressively. </p><p>Her hands moved over mine, and at first, I expected her to try to pull my hands away, which was why I was surprised when she started to help me knead them instead, increasing the pressure even further, along with the intensity of her voice. I  pinched her nipples, amazed by the way her back arched as she started to tremble with the telltale signs of a climax. </p><p>As she experienced her climax, her hips rocked desperately, trying to enhance her pleasure to the next level, giving me free rein over her body. </p><p>However, I didn’t exert that control immediately. “Look at you, so-called queen, whoring yourself out just to make sure you can hang on the throne,” I whispered. Normally, I wouldn’t have dared to tease her pride directly, afraid of her reaction even with everything we had done, but not only my position was unassailable by the sudden appearance of a third party targeting her throne, but also her climax pushed her into a rare position where her submissiveness reached an unbelievable position. </p><p>No, mocking her lack of power, even as I brought my fingers to her crotch, slipping inside mercilessly, was the best way to tease her. </p><p>Before she could answer, I twisted our positions, so that she was on her back, laying on the pile of gold — softened by magic — her body arching as my fingers invaded her trembling entrance. The pleasure was so thick that she was unable to answer. </p><p>“Weak whore,” I repeated as my fingers disappeared into her crotch, and she only trembled helplessly her position stationary. She left that unanswered, choosing to moan repeatedly instead.  </p><p>Even as my fingers dominated her, I couldn’t help but feel amazed at the beautiful sight of her body, her face flushes, her golden hair beautiful enough to be mistaken for a treasure among the pile of gold. The fact that she was still wearing her crown made the moment even better.</p><p>When I positioned myself between her legs, my hands on her bare hips, caressing her skin, she barely reacted, her focus on the way my fingers were caressing her core. When I pulled them out, however, she reacted. “No,” she gasped desperately, as I had just sentenced her to death. </p><p>“Don’t worry, Your Imperial Majesty, your loyal subject is going to replace them with a satisfactory substitute,” I said mockingly, once again using her title, making her flinch as she was reminded of her grand identity. Though, her heavy, desperate breathing, making her bosom rise and fall, signaled that she was much more interested in the replacement than the mocking teasing. </p><p>At this point, I could have bargained for every single treasure in the room, and I would receive without a complaint. Pity that doing so would be cutting a treasure tree. Her obedience implied much more things than a quick payday. </p><p>Just to test her arousal, I put my hand on her slit once more, only for her hips to move desperately as she tried to ride herself into another orgasm even with my motionless hand. With a chuckle, I pulled, and she tried to replace it with her own hand. </p><p>That, I had no intention of allowing. I grabbed her wrists, much to her shock. “Please, Your Imperial Majesty. As a loyal subject, I would be ashamed if I would let you take care of your own needs. It’s my honor to serve you.” Even as I talked, I pressed my shaft against her entrance. </p><p>She moaned deliciously even as she tried to throw herself forward, trying to take me in, only for me to pull back, leaving her hanging. “Please, Your Majesty, patience is a royal virtue,” I chuckled, highlighting my words with a slap on her breasts, hard enough that the sound exploded in the room, while they jiggled beautifully. </p><p>“Please,” she begged again, which earned another slap, though it didn’t seem to discourage her. </p><p>After repeating it half a dozen times, each slap making her moan harder, I decided to relent. “Well, as a royal subject, it’s my honor to fulfill your orders, even if your orders include me treating you like a two-silver backyard whore,” I said even as I grabbed and flipped. </p><p>I wanted to play her for a bit more, but there were some things in life even a Dark Lord famous for his patience couldn’t resist. The sight of a beautiful Queen begging for my cock while being roughly bent over a pile of gold in her own treasury turned out to be one of them. </p><p> I pressed my shaft against her entrance once more, and before I could push forward, her ass raised forward, her stomach moving lower, and she took my shaft inside her, her wetness enthusiastic enough to devour it completely. </p><p>Her hips continued to move, but as a gentleman and a loyal subject, it would be remiss of me to work a royal person to do all the work herself. So, I pushed forward, fast and merciless, forcing her to widen to accommodate my presence. Her mindless moans suggested that she was not exactly unhappy about my actions, so I got even faster, her hips rising to meet my slap each time. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel fascinated by her warmth and tightness, never getting stale no matter how many times I enjoyed her, and her furious enthusiasm even as I dominated and humiliated her made it even better. </p><p>Just to add insult to injury, I reached and pulled her crown free, only to put it over her ass, balancing it with magic, one last mockery to her position as the Queen. </p><p>“No,” she gasped as I pulled her crown, but her protest fell flat considering her hips didn’t agree with her complaint, continuing to meet my pushes furiously. </p><p>Grasping her hips, I increased my strength another level, the sound of fleshy slaps echoing from the walls of the treasury — while simultaneously underlining the emptiness of it — losing myself in the sensation of dominating her. </p><p>As our little dance continued, she got wetter and wetter, her tightness increasing even further when I started slapping her hips with a fury equal to my pumping hips, suppressing her whimpers beautifully. </p><p>I was planning to continue that little fun torture for a long while, but, as our little dance continued, she achieved the impossible, her entrance tightening even further, turning her delicious entrance into a corner from heaven. My conviction to keep her teasing for a long while started to melt like an ice cube trying to pass through a wall of flame, and her lustful moans hardly helped me to resist. </p><p>Her back arched, raising her breasts, which was dangling back and forth, vibrating and swaying in tandem, beautiful enough to make a believer out of a heretic. Lost in the flood of carnal pleasure, I surrendered to the joy and abandoned my plans to tease her until she collapsed, exploding her inside, filling her core with my seed. </p><p>In a happy coincidence, however, that triggered her final climax for the evening, leaving her laying listlessly on top of the treasure, while she murmured helplessly in a desperate attempt to stave off her climax, but failing spectacularly. </p><p>I pulled out only when my shaft started throbbing, and when I pulled, a nice stream was dripping down, evidencing my victory. At that moment, she was truly mine, which, looked objectively, was a bigger achievement than anything I had completed during my painful and gritty ascension to the top of the Dark Lands. </p><p>Truly, fate was a fickle mistress.  </p><p>Laying next to her to catch a nice sleep was tempting. Unfortunately, I had a great deal of things to do tonight to start searching for the clues about the mysterious third party that was playing with the Empire. </p><p>The ward itself was interesting enough, and I had no doubt that, if someone had intervened with the Empire like that, they intervened with it in many other ways as well. </p><p>I just needed to find them… </p>
