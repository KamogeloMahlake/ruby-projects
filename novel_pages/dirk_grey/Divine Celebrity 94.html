        <p>“That’s enough, take ten,” I finally called, calling for a break for the training. “Now, the fun part, anyone that wants to test as the backup quarterback, who’s also likely to play this week.”</p><p>A great number of players, mostly the newcomers,, stepped forward with enthusiasm, very enthusiastic to experience the glory, even if it was only for a game. A quick count showed fourteen players wanted to try out for the quarterback position. </p><p>I glanced at the remaining players, which included every single defensive player that stayed on the team. </p><p>It seemed that their distaste for the offense was yet to disappear. Still, I didn’t prompt them to act, not when I needed every single of them. Almost half of the linemen had to be transferred to the offensive side of the ball, which meant the gap left by them had to be filled with backups and some of the stronger linemen. </p><p>Which, in turn, depleted the cornerbacks and safeties to reinforce these holes. And, that was while ignoring a few like Marcus I would have to play as receivers or running backs. </p><p>Therefore, I had no intention of demanding them to move. </p><p>Though, it didn’t take long for me to realize I might have misunderstood their lack of intention, as they had matched smirks while watching the new players, walking enthusiastically toward the pile of balls. </p><p>They might have some accurate expectations about what awaited the quarterback. </p><p>“Where are you going?” I asked flatly toward the new players. </p><p>“To get the balls,” answered one of the braver ones, though the expression of the others showed agreement. </p><p>“Who told you that the first test would be throwing the balls, follow me,” I said as I walked to the sideline, which had a pile of books, papers, and other stuff. It was not a full playbook but a simplified one, one that had been used for the acclimatization of the defensive players. </p><p>Technically, using that would have created an advantage for defensive players if one of them joined, but that wasn’t exactly the height of my worries. And, since they hadn’t joined, there was no problem. “Your first task is to memorize as much as possible in an hour, and answer the questions I have afterward.” </p><p>“B-but, that’s nerd stuff —“ started one of them, before his friend helpfully poked him to the side, his panicked expression showing he didn’t forget my other identity. </p><p>I just chuckled. “Oh, sweet summer child, you’re in a great misunderstanding if you think a quarterback has to study any less than a valedictorian,” I said. “Unless they played for that idiot Spencer, of course, but as you can see, that’s not the case anymore.” </p><p>“Still…” he started, encouraged by my lack of aggressive response, only to wilt away as my gaze turned angry. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I kept my gaze on the unlucky guy who volunteered. “Now, it’s particularly important this week, as none of you would have the experience to actually call plays in the field. And, if my concussion report doesn’t clear, one of you has to play. Can you tell me what’s the most important thing?” </p><p>“F… for us to know the playbook,” he stammered, hesitant despite the obvious answer.</p><p>I had a feeling he wouldn’t be the one that memorized the most formations. </p><p>“Exactly. I’ll be calling every play from the side, to the progression you have to follow, but even that wouldn’t help if you don’t know the playbook.” </p><p>That earned a doubtful look from more than one candidate, realizing that it didn’t sound smart. The reason the quarterback position was so hard to play was that they — or we — had to process every little change in the field perfectly, to the last second, and even after the game started. </p><p>Orders from the side would only make it more confusing when the same formation could either trigger a blitz that forced the quarterback to target the hot route — the emergency — or deliver a stable three-man rush that would require him to call a last-second adjustment, turning the play into a run. </p><p>Either way, trying to call the plays from the side was madness. </p><p>… or, it would have been, if it wasn’t for the unfair advantage of my traits. Though, even with those, I wasn’t confident that it would work perfectly. Luckily, winning was not an option.  </p><p>As long as I kept the game close, it would be enough to keep Spencer away from the team. </p><p>“Are you sure it would work?” one of them asked.</p><p>Before saying anything, I grabbed another, much thicker book, containing the strategy of the last game. I threw it on the ground, and it made a satisfactory thump. “Anyone is free to memorize this if they want to  run the game as a proper quarterback.” </p><p>Predictably, no one dared to even reach it, and they all obediently opened their books and started reading desperately. </p><p>While they were busy with that, I returned to the rest of the team. “It’s time for the assignments,” I said. “First, the linebacker core,” I said, calling a group of names that was a mixture of cornerbacks and new players, with only one starter and two from the old backups.</p><p>Inevitable, with some of them inevitably moving to linemen, and some moving to offensive tight ends. </p><p>Marcus looked at me, asking whether I was sure silently, but I shrugged.  Our options were too limited not to deplete the linebacker core, no matter how critical they were. </p><p>The cornerbacks and safeties had experienced a similar depletion, part of them moving to the other defensive roles, while a considerable number moved to receiver positions and running backs. </p><p>“Why are we playing offense,” asked one of them. </p><p>“Because I trust you not to fumble the ball at the first tackle,” I said, my gaze dancing on the new players, most of them had dropped the ball at the slightest contact. “This Sunday, we don’t have the luxury of constant turnovers, not if you want the cheerleaders to be in a good mood  when we have an amazing party afterward.”  </p><p>That image earned enough chuckles to disperse the poignant aura of depression that surrounded them, replenishing their fighting spirit. After all, those legendary parties were the only reason most of the players joined the practice squad in the first place, and the idea that they could get the attention the starters got was even more fascinating. </p><p>With that, I started calling the offensive skill positions, namely, tight ends, receivers, and running backs, a mixture of new arrivals, practice squad players, and old defensive players, though with several gaps, pending the quarterback hopefuls to finish their selection. </p><p>“And the ones that remain will be the linemen, both offensive and defensive,” I called. “They can rest for ten more minutes while rest follows me,” I said. </p><p>“Why do they get to rest more?” asked Marcus, though clearly voicing the concerns of the new players, allowing me to answer. </p><p>Such a reliable second in command, I noted even as I nodded at him. “Oh, believe me, they need it,” I said. And, since my reputation was long set in the short time I was on the team,  it was enough to make every single prospective lineman blanch in fear, even if I didn’t use any of my traits. </p><p>I didn’t bother correcting their assumption. After all, their fear was not entirely unjustified with what I had planned for them. </p><p>“Now, the skill core,” I gestured, first separating the offensive and defensive players, then splitting each group into the three; linebacker, cornerback, and safety for the defense; tight end, receiver, and running back for the offense. </p><p>I first identified six experienced players to temporarily lead each group — a factor I had been attentive to while I had been setting those groups — then turned to my effective second-in-command. “Marcus, you’ll be in charge of the overall training while I deal with the linemen,” I said. </p><p>“Sure, what do we have planned.” </p><p>“For the receivers and safeties, let’s start with basic routes. Linebackers will work with tight ends to test their basic blocking, while corners will pair with running backs for tackling practice,” I said. The running backs had started smiling, as theirs was the softest assignment considering the physical limitations of the new cornerbacks. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, their peace was only temporary. “We need to make sure they know how to hold the ball before we replace the corners with the new linemen,” I added, which was enough to erase those smiles, replaced with fearful anticipation as they looked at the hulking group, waiting for their turn. </p><p>“And, add some suicide runs for every ten minutes,” I added, preventing the others to enjoy the upcoming misery of the new running backs, replaced by apprehension and commiserating looks. </p><p>Misery truly loved company. And, speaking of misery…</p><p>“Follow me,” I shouted at the linemen squad as I walked toward the gym, toward one of the studios I wanted to use for assessment. Due to concussion protocols, I was not allowed to do any contact practice. </p><p>But in a room with no windows and no cameras… </p>
