        <title>Dominating the Boss 9</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>There was a certain pleasure in watching Brenda turn towards me once again after discreetly locking the door, her eyes wide with shock, her eyes stuck on the movement of my arms as I forced my shaft deeper into Natalie’s throat. I gestured Brenda to walk towards the shelf before turning my gaze downward, only to met with Natalie’s panicked gaze, begging for a reprieve. I just forced even deeper, enjoying her rising panic as she struggled to keep silent. </p><p>“Where should I place those files,” Brenda asked without prompting. </p><p>Smart girl, I thought, creating an excuse to stay in the room without my prompting. Though, if I was reading the excited glances she threw towards the table correctly, it was less about helping me, and more about enjoyment at seeing the woman who previously dominated sharing the same submissive position. It suggested that my unofficial assistant would be much more helpful than I had first thought, especially with her obvious thrill in seeing Natalie being dominated. “The top shelf would be the best,” I said before stalling for a second. “Actually, would it be a bother if you rearrange the shelf completely,” I added, ignoring the panicked tap on my leg. </p><p>“Sure,” Brenda said, but instead of doing that, she placed the files on her hand on the top shelf haphazardly, then turned towards me. I dragged my finger vertically through the center of my chest. She smiled sultry in understanding, her hands rising to her chest to fix the issue of her being overdressed. Her fingers danced over her buttons, her shirt parting to reveal a lacy white bra, deficient in the area it covered, just tight enough to push her breasts up in a perfect presentation. </p><p>Not that they needed much help in that front, as shown when she reached to her back without a prompt, loosening the hold of her bra. It slid off enough to reveal her nipples, erect in arousal. I could see a smirk widening on her face as I managed to bring my gaze back to her face from the momentary distraction. “How about this way, Nathan,” she asked, her words stretching in a barely hidden amusement. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I answered even as I put additional pressure over Natalie’s head, pushing my shaft even deeper into her throat. She looked up, her eyes burning with fury, but she had no recourse other than tapping my leg helplessly, struggling to keep silent. “But the filing needs better presentation.” </p><p>“You think my presentation is not enough?” Brenda drawled with a smirk, cupping her breasts, pushing them upwards. </p><p>“I wouldn’t say no to some improvement,” I answered, my hands still on Natalie’s head. </p><p>Her smile widened on the challenge. I was surprised when her feet slipped out of her shoes, but understood the reason a moment later. She started walking across the room, making little noise without her heels clicking on the ground. Free from the noise, she was free to walk around freely. Her bra loosened further with her movement, giving me a glimpse of her nipples. “Better?” she asked. </p><p>“Better,” I approved, then glanced down to confirm Natalie was still sufficiently distracted with her task to notice the subtext. I turned my attention back to Brenda. She loosened her skirt, but she chose to pull it up even higher rather than to push it down. Still, it wasn’t exactly hardship from my end, the skirt was barely long enough to cover her panties under the normal condition. Pulled up like that, it barely hid anything. </p><p>Then, she tried to take a long step, only for a painful gasp to escape her mouth, her hand sliding towards her backside. Walking around with an anal plug wasn’t a simple task, after all. “Are you okay,” I asked her in mock concern. </p><p>“Yeah,” she gasped, but this time, her tone was intentionally overdone. “It hurts. Maybe you should kiss it and make it better.” </p><p>“Don’t tempt me,” I said, ignoring the increase of Natalie’s struggle. She seemed unhappy with the sudden flirting, but she lacked the leverage to make her dissatisfaction matter. Her lips continued to dance up and down over my shaft, more mechanical than I would have preferred under more regular conditions, but with her under my absolute control, it just made it more enjoyable. The beautiful, half-naked figure of Brenda, trying to twirl around the room erotically, but stalling with occasional pain, was the sprinkles on top.</p><p>I was driving closer to the cliff. “It looks good, you can leave them like that,” I said to Brenda. </p><p>“Really?” she asked, looking as disappointed as I was. But I just nodded. While it was fun to play with Brenda present, I couldn’t push her to the next level while Natalie was still in the room. I had pushed my chances enough as it was. Brenda pulled her skirt back its place and fixed her bra while I forced my shaft even deeper to Natalie’s throat, straining her ability to keep her gagging constrained. </p><p>Curious about what I was going to find, I looked downward, catching Natalie’s face. Anger was flaring her eyes as she struggled to keep her voice down. Her rage was burning bright, defying her attempts to keep it hidden. But even with her flaring anger, she had managed to keep her voice down until she heard Brenda slamming the door close. “Bastard,” she managed to mumble rather loudly despite the presence in her mouth. She put her hands on my knees, trying to use that as leverage to push away. But, my earlier treatment had exhausted her. She lacked the power to push, leaving her under the domination of my hands, helpless as I impaled her face repetitively. </p><p>Toying with Natalie while receiving a show from her impudent secretary had gone a long way to bring me to the land of happiness. I could feel an ocean begging to be let out, and I had no reason to deny it. Still, it didn’t mean I couldn’t have one last laugh. I loosened my grip over Natalie’s head, who pulled back almost instantly. </p><p>Only for her face to be painted with my thick spray. She tried to pull back, but my table didn’t allow it. Her expression of shocked outrage was delicious as my liquid covered her string by string while she had no option but to receive. </p><p>I pulled my chair back only after her face was covered completely with my mark, allowing her to rise up. She took a deep breath as she dragged a finger on her face, like she was having trouble believing what had just happened. Frankly, it wasn’t hard to emphasize with her. She had been defiled and humiliated at the center of her power while she could do nothing other than taking it with a smile. And to make things even worse, it was solely due to her mistakes, at least to her knowledge. All told, it was worse for her than the encounter in the casino. </p><p>Still, she managed to keep herself from shouting, or even uttering a snide word, as slowly stood up. The only obvious indicator she had was the frown in her face, defying her attempts to fake a smile. She was burning with a desire to say something harsh, or maybe to move straight to stabbing, but in the end, she chose to stay passive. She was too smart to do otherwise.  </p><p>I passed her a napkin, not bothering to hide my smug smile. She slowly dragged it over her face, getting rid of the most obvious parts of my gift. There was still no hiding what had just happened, but it was better than keeping her face covered completely. She lowered the napkin, preparing to say something, but I cut her off before she could begin. “You were a real sweetheart, boss,” I said with an exaggerated cheer. “But now I need to go back to work. These documents aren’t going to audit themselves.” </p><p>My comment caught her flatfooted, giving me enough time to fix my pants. I gestured her to pull to the side, and she took a drunken step, freeing my path to my desk. I pulled my chair closer, my pen on my hand, dancing over the documents, directly from the point we had just left. </p><p>During that show, I continued to watch her from the corner of my eye. At first, the anger flared on her face, thinking that I couldn’t see her. It was replaced with a panicked realization soon after, as she realized that her earlier efforts about to become a complete waste. She had two choices in front of her. She could either escalate it to point that would ‘ensure’ my distraction, or write-off as a bad investment and get away. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel disappointed as she started walking towards the door after picking up another napkin. Truthfully, I was expecting more than a quiet surrender from her. Maybe it was my own overestimation, I tried to reason as I kept my eyes on the papers, my pen dancing over them. Maybe it would be easier to just expose and get rid of her if she was going to be that boring to play…</p><p>I had been distracted from my musings by an audible click of the door. I raised my eyes with surprise, only to met with a reinvigorated figure. a daring smile coloring her face. It was an artificial smile, clearly forced and completely insincere, of course, but for me, that made it even better. She was trying to fight back, “Wouldn’t it be a pity to spend such a beautiful afternoon working on unnecessary paperwork,” she drawled even as her fingers found the top button on her blouse. </p><p>I leaned back, shifting my full attention to her as she closed in with slow, measured steps, every single one causing her body to dance attractively. “Maybe, but I’m having trouble thinking a better alternative. I feel like you have one in mind, boss,” I answered, not bothering to underline the last word. The circumstances were enough for that task.  </p><p>“I don’t think you’ll have too much trouble guessing,” she answered as her shirt was unbuttoned with a lingering slowness, each button revealing more of her creamy and delicious skin. “If not, maybe we should discuss your position again,” she said. I nodded, trying to look impressed. An expression that was getting increasingly easier with each passing second as the amount of skin on display increased. </p><p>Soon, her blouse went away flying, leaving the task of covering her perky tits to her bra, a task that it was too flimsy to complete successfully. Their lacy delicacy barely supported her breasts, not that her breasts needed any. I acted like my attention was fixed on her breasts, suggesting to her that she was being successful on her task. “I feel like I have an idea,” I said. “But why don’t you show it to me in detail, just to make sure there is no misunderstanding.” </p><p>“Of course,” she said with a gasp, the best way to conceal the bitterness in her tone. But I would have let it go even if I wasn’t trying to trick her, due to her fingers finally finding the zipper of her skirt. I watched with anticipation as she pulled the zipper down with torturous slowness. She turned her side to me, giving me a view of her expanding show. I licked my lips as she let the skirt to fall to the ground, revealing her panties, even skimpier than her bra. </p><p>Even better, I could see a very distinctive wet patch directly above her core, showing me that she was enjoying the moment despite all. The fact that her body was enjoying her total loss of control must have been killing her. I could see her face contorting with anger, likely assuming that her display was enough to distract me from her expression. I let her continue to think so. </p><p>I pushed my chair away from my desk, providing her a decent space to work her magic. She closed in slowly, trying to maximize the allure of each step, her heeled shoes hitting the ground with a distinct click, underlining her lingering, confident walk. Altogether, it was an amazing way to hide her real feeling. Too bad for her that I already knew what I was looking for.  </p><p>Interestingly, my situation had its own challenges as well. As she walked towards me, wearing nothing but a set sexy underwear, its black color harmonizing with her hair perfectly, complemented by her heeled shoes and tan-colored, knee-length socks, I was tempted to take the lead. A voice inside me was begging me to bend her over the table, taking her mercilessly like I had taken her secretary barely an hour ago, violating both of her holes. But I persevered. </p><p>Then, Natalie was in front of me with all her glory. She leaned forward, showing an expression of arousal, which was a credit to her acting ability. I looked into her eyes as she pressed her hands over my shoulders, looking for a clue that would prove her arousal was fake. A search that turned out to be fruitless, suggesting that I wasn’t the only one that was enjoying the situation; a small miracle considering her penchant for the dominant position, both in life and in bed.  </p><p>Soon, she leaned forward, breaking the eye contact as her lips hovered over mine, close enough for her hot breath to dance over my skin. “How’s that for a start?” she gasped erotically, making my pants tight enough to hurt. My face must have reflected my discomfort, as her face lit up in an expression reminiscent of the times that she humiliated me in front of the other employees. Just a sliver of power, but in her mind, a way to recover her lost control. </p><p>I couldn’t wait to disabuse her of that particular notion. </p><p>“Promising,” I whispered, letting my voice to hitch in a way that would suggest a sudden rush. I wasn’t the best when it came to acting, especially with my pride thumping on my ears, begging me to teach her another lesson. Luckily, she missed any clue that might have appeared on my face in the rush of victory. I leaned back in an enchanted manner. While it was tempting to explain her the situation immediately, it was going to be much better when I pulled the rug under her just before she thought she was victorious. </p><p>“Promising?” she repeated dismissively as she sat on my lap, but without pushing her full weight on it, just teasing softly. “Is it just it, promising? I would have expected something more inspiring from you, Nathan.” As she spoke, her hips started to rock, caressing my erection softly in an insistent manner. </p><p>“Lovely, inspiring, reminding me of a goddess who deigned to visit the mortal world for a moment,” I listed rapidly, trying to convince her that she had the control. I was afraid that I laid it a bit thick when her expression flickered into a frown for a moment, instantly lowering my eyes on her breasts to avoid suspicion. Thankfully, when I raised my gaze, the confidence ruled her expression once more. </p><p>“Much better,” she said smugly. “But this goddess expects worship if she was going to deign giving more than just a glimpse.” </p><p>“My pleasure,” I answered as I leaned forward, pressing my lips on her collarbone in a short, fleeting contact. It was a short one, but she shivered nonetheless. The angle of my head was preventing her from seeing my face, so I was free to smirk smugly. If she had thought the effects of our night in the casino had stayed in the past, she was wrong. That night allowed me to learn the secrets of her body, where I need to caress, lick, press, and smack to drive her into the depths of ecstasy. I could have her trembling and begging in a few moments if I wished so, but stretching the moment was more fun. I dragged my finger along her spine, extracting another shiver from her tight body. “How is this, my goddess?”</p><p>“Passable,” she answered, but the rebuke she tried to deliver was not very effective when her voice was trembling with the signs of her rising desire. She slid forward, dragging her tongue over my ear, suggesting that I wasn’t the only one that used the night as a learning opportunity. But it was a challenge I was yearned to meet. I let my other hand join the struggle, caressing her stomach while the other was busy testing the small of her back. But she reacted when my fingers moved downward, trying to slide inside her panties, she grabbed my wrist, preventing me from succeeding. “What’s the hurry,” she murmured, but I could sense her urgent panic, doubtlessly remembering what happened the last time I had unrestricted access to her most sensitive spot. “Good things come to those who wait.” </p><p>That statement was patently false, of course, nothing other than a painful mediocracy waited the idiots who decided passive acceptance was a good way to get what they wanted. Only in movies people got nice things despite their passivity. The real world belonged to ones that dared to reach forward and grab the opportunities with both hands. Still, I let her drag my hand away, not wanting to disrupt the little game that was going on between us. After all, there was a difference between the passivity of a deer and the patience of a tiger. </p><p>I kept my hands on safer locations as she pressed herself tighter on my lap, her weight firm on my shaft. She started rocking softly, enough pleasure to placate me without tempting me to push forward. Once again, I let her do so, but used the time to focus on the most sensitive spots of her body, my fingers scouring with the occasional assistance from my lips. Watching the way her expression was transforming was almost as good as her hips dancing on my lap, her confidence eroding slowly by the torrent of pleasure. </p><p>   It was enough teasing, I decided, reaching for the hook of her bra. It clicked open with a familiar twist from my fingers, and my other hand jumped to pull it off her body before she could reach. “Hey,” she exclaimed as she tried to catch her bra, but she was slow to react, and her bra was lying on the ground before she could even react. She tried to jump onto her feet with outrage, but her legs chose that second to tremble, causing her to stumble. </p><p>I was quick to grab her arm, protecting her from a painful fall. I quickly unzipped my pants to pull my shaft out as I pulled her onto my lap once more, something that she failed to notice until it was too late. Her eyes grew in shock when my length pressed against her entrance, but once again, my fingers proved faster than her reaction. The delicacy of her underwear worked to my benefit, the fragile fabric giving me no trouble as I ripped it off, leaving her without its protection, however weak. </p><p>I didn’t bother to start soft, knowing just how aroused she already was. I pushed my full length inside her, one hand wrapped around her wrist to force her down while the other reached for her lips. It proved a sensible decision as my fingers were barely on her lips before her mouth opened and she let out a loud cry, loud enough to bring rest of the office to us if it wasn’t for my fingers. </p><p>I pressed my fingers tighter as I suddenly stood up, her legs wrapping around my waist, looking for support, while another yelp escaped her lips only to be stopped by my hand. “Quiet!” I ordered sharply as I looked into her eyes, her wild panic tastier than honey. I could see the warning was working as intended, so I pulled my hand away from her mouth, both of them landing on her hips instead. </p><p>I started walking with her still on my lap, each step driving my shaft into her once again, but she was alert enough to control her moans. I walked around the room, her panic growing deeper as I closed on the window. It wasn’t a big window, and with no tall building near ours, so there was no risk of being seen unless one walked close enough to be seen from the parking lot. The idea of pushing her against the window, slamming repeatedly as she begged for mercy on fear of getting caught by one of her employees was tempting, but ultimately impossible. Walking that close to the window would be caught by the security cameras, creating a dangerous piece of evidence that I couldn't control. </p><p>And it wasn’t the like the situation that was in hand was too horrible to contemplate. With my boss on my lap, doing her best to play the obedient slave as I wandered around the room was fun enough. I sank my fingers deeper into her firm hips, forcing them to rise just a bit, enough to give me the perfect angle. Then, I slammed without mercy, forcing her mouth to open in preparation of a cry. My hands were occupied, barring them from preventing her cry, not that they were needed when a more convenient method was available. </p><p>I captured her lips in a hard kiss, my tongue roaming in her mouth. It was amusing to see her eyes popping open in shock while I invaded the soft crevices of her mouth, enjoying her taste. She tried to pull her head back, but the situation afforded no leverage for her, leaving her under my mercy. With the situation demanded, I could feel the sensation rising inside. “I’m almost there,” I whispered amusedly, making panic blossom on her face. </p><p>She managed to push herself off my lap at the last second, my seed covering her naked belly as her feet hit the floor. She just stood there, breathing hard. “Nice distraction,” I said casually as I took a napkin from the table. “I’m exhausted, and you look so too, maybe we should call it an early day,” I added. </p><p>“Sure,” she managed to say between her breaths, making no movement to get her clothes, which were lying around haphazardly. “Just sign the rest of the accounts, then we can leave.” I nodded, giving her a reason to smile in satisfaction. Too bad for her, I had already taken required notes and exceptions on the files, freeing me from the consequences. I sat on my desk, signing the rest of the documents while she made a show of dressing, in one last attempt to distract me, unaware of the uselessness of her action…</p>
