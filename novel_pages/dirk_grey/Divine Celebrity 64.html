        <p>Even with the noise of the party, Megan’s gasp of shock was unmistakable as I grabbed Kim’s hips and lifted her trembling body against the bathroom wall. </p><p>“The audience is getting impatient,” I said with a chuckle, confident that that little interplay wouldn’t be heard by Megan. </p><p>“Don’t worry about that, she can act entitled from time to time,” Kim said, trying to sound confident, doing her best to hide the tremble in her tone, showing Megan wasn’t the only one that might be too occupied by the way she looked. </p><p>Kim did her best to look like a dominatrix without being gauche, and from everything I could see, it was not an unfounded desire. She certainly enjoyed that aspect. </p><p>But, our earlier moment showed that she clearly enjoyed being submissive as well, showing some switch traits, more than willing to take the submissive role under a sure hand. Yet, despite her enjoyment, she clearly did her best to hide that, showing she was rather invested in not reflecting that trait outwardly. </p><p>Not too unsuccessfully, I might add, and it would have been much more difficult to detect that little trick without all the assistance the traits provided. </p><p>Yet, the difficulty of cutting through her outer layer didn’t make her comment any less amusing. </p><p>“Oh, really, I didn’t notice,” I answered, earning a chuckle, even as I shifted my grip a bit for better access, and Kim opened her legs, showing just how enthusiastic she was about the upcoming beautiful moment. </p><p>I let my smirk widen at the moment, enjoying her implicit surrender that cut through all of her attempts to play the dominant party. </p><p>“Let’s give her a show, to teach her a lesson about peeking,” Kim suggested even as she raised her hips, making the entrance even easier. </p><p>I moved forward, pressing against her entrance, but didn’t immediately move for completion. Instead, I caught her beautiful green eyes and enjoyed her gaze for a fleeting moment. “A good idea, but do you think you can handle the full brunt of my action?” I asked. </p><p>“Oh, big boy, believe it. I can take anything you dish,” she whispered even as she pushed her hips forward as far as she could manage — which wasn’t much considering she was pinned against the wall, with my forearms supporting her thighs. Yet, even with that little amount, I didn’t let her succeed. </p><p>Instead, I pulled back the exact amount to maintain the same connection, not giving her even that little hint of success. The frustrated moan that resulted was a thing of beauty. “Let me ask. Are you sure you want me to put on a real show?” </p><p>“Of course I do,” she growled. “Don’t worry, I’m not a weak little girl,” she answered. </p><p>“If that’s what you wish,” I said as I put the slightest pressure against her entrance. “Then, let’s find a safe word.” </p><p>“I don’t need one,” she growled as she repeated her earlier attempt, only to be foiled again. </p><p>Agility was not just useful on the football field. </p><p>“No, that would not do. Just yell that I’m a little weak girl if you want me to stop,” I said, letting my smirk widen even as I said so, doing my best to poke her pride. </p><p>She growled once again, but this time, rather than trying the same trick with her hips, she chose to grab my shoulders and dug her fingers deep. Not enough to draw blood, but it wasn’t too far away from that point either. </p><p>It hurt, of course, but I was not unfamiliar with pain even before the benefits of the Divine System started to enhance my abilities. </p><p>“Oh, the kitten has claws,” I said, doing my best not to show any sign of pain, or even slight discomfort — which was rather easy thanks to the relative dimness of the bathroom.</p><p>Her growl of frustration was just as beautiful as her naked body, pressing against mine. “And how long are you going to wait, until I fall asleep from—“ she started, her frustrated statement cut halfway by an explosive moan. </p><p>Because I pushed my hips forward. </p><p>“Damn, girl, you’re wet,” I said even as I pushed my hips, skewering her halfway with the first move, enjoying the way her walls loosened to allow my invasion. “Just how horny you got as you watched me receiving that show from the strippers.” </p><p>“Shut up,” she answered as her grip on my shoulder tightened even more. </p><p>“Oh, little Kimberly can’t handle talking at the same time?” I said as I pulled back, but moved forward again just as she opened her mouth, destroying her response in a beautiful cry. Yet, as beautiful as her cry was, it wasn’t as beautiful as the beautiful expression in her eyes, two aspects of her nature battling, a primal pleasure mixing into her intellectual frustration. </p><p>A nicer man would have slowed down for a minute or two for her to get used to my presence, as it was hardly in a size that could be classified as comfortable. Unfortunately for her, while people described me in many ways, nice was rarely an adjective they used. </p><p>Not that anyone could argue that such a situation was unearned. </p><p>Not with her earlier challenge. </p><p>So, I continued, punishing her for her arrogance with the rhythmic, merciless beat of my hips, making her moan loud enough to actually impair her attempts at breathing. </p><p>And, the way the little shadow I could see under the door was any indicator, Kim wasn’t the only one that was overwhelmed by the nature of my reckless charge. Megan was shuffling repeatedly — and I doubted that the reason for her shuffles was her desire to come and save her friend from my hands. </p><p>However, rather than occupying myself with the movement of a shadow, I turned my attention to the sexy redhead that was doing her best to get a breath. </p><p>After all, no matter how suggestive, the movement of a shadow was nothing compared to the beauty that was currently in my grip. I let my hips quicken, even more, testing her resistance. She dipped her head down to hide her expression from me, showing she was not entirely lost in pleasure, and still showed enough presence of mind to attempt to hide her expression from me. </p><p>Too bad for her replicating the same for her moans was much more difficult. The frequency and intensity of her moans showed just how much she was losing control, making her attempt to hide her expression rather useless. </p><p>At least, from a functionality perspective. From the perspective of enhancing my pleasure, it worked excellently. </p><p>I let my smirk widen slowly as I slowed down the aggressive assault of my hips, enough for her to recover a modicum of control. </p><p>She waited a few seconds before she raised her gaze to understand the reason for the sudden change of pace, only for her eyes to be widened as she caught my playful smirk, realizing it was just bait. </p><p>“Pity we don’t have your camera with us, I would have loved to immortalize this moment,” I whispered, enjoying her shocked expression. “Why? Can’t you handle being on the other side of the camera? Don’t tell me you’re that weak, Kimberly.” </p><p>“Don’t call me —“ she started, only to be interrupted by an explosive moan as I chose that moment to push my hips forward, interrupting her angry correction. “Kimberly,” she still added after her moan subsided, showing that she was true about her distaste for the diminutive versions of her name. </p><p>How entertaining. </p><p>“And, what would you do if I do, Kimberly,” I said, making sure to pace my movement so that our hips collided with each word, creating a beautiful combination. </p><p>She didn’t answer, but the anger that infected her beautiful green gaze showed that it was not about her lack of complaint. The sudden anger worked wonders to destroy — or at least, temporarily arrest — her growing submissiveness. </p><p>She didn’t complain, because her mouth had better things to do, such as letting out an incredible chain of moans that showed the depths of her pleasure. So, she tried to use her earlier tactic and dig her fingers into my shoulder. </p><p>Even that wasn’t as effective, because, with growing pleasure, her lips weren’t the only part of her body that she was struggling to control. Despite her best effort, her fingers lacked the strength to make her touch painful, reducing it to an overly enthusiastic caress. </p><p>The perfect time to give her the first reward of the evening. I let my hips forward, letting both the Strength and Agility traits enhance my movements, enough to bring what was happening from amazing to spectacular. </p><p>I wondered if Megan gasped as she watched, but it was not something I would learn. Not with the incredible cries that exploded off Kim inches away from my ear. </p><p>Those cries soon turned desperate as Kim started trembling with the telltale signs of an orgasm — far more intense than I expected. Yet, as I felt her tremble on my lap, I kept my shaft inside her, enjoying the way she repeatedly tightened around me. </p><p>It wasn’t enough to make me climax, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t fun. </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me that great Kimberly couldn’t handle an itsy-bitsy orgasm,” I whispered, expecting the anger to flare in her gaze once more, only to find a much more mellow and accepting gaze. </p><p>It seemed that her name wasn’t as big as a taboo after a spectacular orgasm. </p><p>“So, are you ready for a second round,” I said. </p><p>“O-of course,” she managed to say. “I’m not a — weak little girl,” she stammered. </p><p>“Sure, sweetie,” I said as I chuckled, enjoying the exhaustion in her tone as she tried to say that, and started walking toward the door. </p><p>She needed some rest, and what better place to get that than the bed, where her best friend could assist.</p>
