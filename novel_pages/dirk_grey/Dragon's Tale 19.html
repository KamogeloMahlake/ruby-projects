        <p>When I pressed my shaft against Lillian’s entrance, I wasn’t expecting her to raise her head and start begging. “No, not my virginity, please,” she said, telling me that I might have misread the situation. </p><p>“As you wish, honey,” I answered as I prepared to pull back, but I decided to test my luck nonetheless. I raised the crown of my shaft just a bit, until it was pressing against her puckered hole. “How about this?” I asked, chuckling. </p><p>I was expecting either a hesitant rejection, or an emphatic, panicked pull. Her sudden silence was surprising, though not as much as when she caught my eye and whispered. “Will it hurt?” she asked, but she wasn’t frightened. A bit hesitant, maybe, but definitely very excited nonetheless. </p><p>“It’s supposed to hurt a bit, but it’s nothing compared to the pleasure I’ll bring you,” I promised, happy with the sudden turn of events. Not getting her virginity was nothing compared to the permission to take her tight hole. And since I finally had control of my magic once again, I had access to my shortcuts. </p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment of concentration, then cast my spell, preparing and lubricating Lillian for the fun that was about to start. “What was that-” she started, only to be interrupted by a gasp of shock when I slipped a finger inside, forcing a moan out of her. </p><p>“Just a little magical aid to ensure you’re prepped and ready to go,” I answered even as I pushed my finger deeper, forcing her to moan rather than replying. </p><p>“That’s enough talking, you still have a lot to do here,” Astrid said suddenly, pushing herself into the conversation in a fun way as she grabbed Lillian’s head and pulled her down, forcing her to continue her service. </p><p>“Hey-” Lillian tried to exclaim, only to be silenced as Astrid pulled her down, Astrid’s superior strength coming in handy. My finger moved back and forth as I watched the amazing scene, enjoying the way the girls chose to bridge their differences. It still left the question of what had happened when I was unconscious to make them closer despite their rivalry, but the way Lillian moaned as I added a second finger was enough to demote the importance of that question. </p><p>I watched as Lillian’s tongue danced around Astrid’s entrance with practiced ease, suggesting that some of the guesses the boys had about the hobbies the female half of the student body had had were rather accurate, at least where Lillian was concerned. From the way her back arched, putting her spectacular breasts on display, Astrid seemed to share the idea. </p><p>“God, your tongue is amazing,” Astrid moaned. “It’s the second-best thing I’ve ever had there,” she complimented. I couldn’t help but smirk pridefully. Lillian just hummed in appreciation for a while, not breaking her stride. “Work it out, you whore,” Astrid added, and that managed to raise Lillian’s ire. </p><p>She pulled back despite Astrid’s moan, and turned to me. I didn’t say anything, because I recognized the expression on her face, it was the same one she had when she decided to humiliate Astrid by sabotaging her clothes —mischievous yet sexy. Since the previous one had ended in such a spectacular manner, I decided to give her the chance for a repeat. </p><p>“Cast the spell on her as well,” Lillian ordered sharply. I might have normally taken offense at such a tone, but under the circumstances, and with what was about to follow, I decided not to react badly. I still added a third finger prematurely just as I cast the spell, making her moan loudly. </p><p>Lillian’s way of dealing with the pain turned out to be rather inventive. Without a warning, she jammed three of her fingers inside Astrid, making her gasp in shock and pain. Lillian’s tongue was already on her knob, continuing to lick her, which turned Astrid’s pain into confusion. </p><p>“How dare-” Astrid started, but I gestured for her to stay silent. She followed it immediately, not knowing I did that for her benefit. Lillian was not the best person to provoke when her fingers were jammed into such a sensitive place. Instead, Astrid limited herself to moaning loudly, her voice strained by a delicious combination of pain and pleasure, making my shaft throb in anticipation. </p><p>It was time. I pulled out my fingers and pressed the crown of my shaft against her puckered hole, only for Lillian to gasp. “Isn’t it a bit early?” she rapidly asked. </p><p>“I’m just following your lead, honey,” I answered even as I slowly pushed my shaft inside, enjoying the way her tightness wrapped around me, gifting me with an amazing sensation. She moaned in a tone that was eerily similar to Astrid’s, one I might have mixed if Astrid hadn’t been crying simultaneously. </p><p>“Fuck, you’re tight,” I gasped even as I slowly invaded her virgin tightness, but before I could continue, I felt the repeat of the weird connection I felt while I was cumming in Astrid, our magic mingling. But with one great difference, the resonance was even stronger with Lillian, like she was the epicenter and Astrid was the support. </p><p>I decided that a particular question couldn’t be delayed too much, though stopping what I was doing was definitely not an option either. “So, Lillian, tell me what happened after I collapsed.” </p><p>“A lot,” she said, trying to sound stern, which was rather difficult with my presence lodged in her behind, pushing deeper and deeper. “What in the world made you decide that in the middle of the wilderness with absolutely no preparation whatever was a good place to ascend to Sorcerer level?” she asked, sounding angry and concerned at the same time. She once again raised her head from between Astrid’s toned thighs, but her fingers were still in her puckered hole, pumping repeatedly. </p><p>“You know that I went through the Ascension,” I asked. </p><p>“Of course I do,” Lillian answered. “I’m the heiress of the house. Do you think you’re the only one with access to secret documents, or do you think yours is the only family with a past more glorious than the present.” </p><p>I didn’t want to admit that I had never read anything about the transformation until I could milk her a bit more, so I decided to play along. If she thought I knew what I was talking about, she would be more open with her family secrets —not to mention I had the environmental distractions aligned to confuse her even more, though once again accidentally. </p><p>I had already learned that what had happened to me was a natural reaction to the Sorcerer ascension, though the way I handled it was certainly unorthodox. “I guess not,” I said.</p><p>“What was the method you used? A family secret?” she asked, fascinated, though followed by a moan as I slammed inside her, pushing the full length inside her for the first time. Also, she switched to Greek as we talked, making sure that Astrid didn’t understand a word of it. Considering the way Astrid was moaning, I didn’t think was a likely possibility, but I was happy to follow her lead if it made her more willing to share her secrets. For a while, she lost her track of thought, the sound of flesh hitting flesh filling the room. </p><p>“Something like that,” I said, still in Greek instead of Latin, doing my best to sound boastful and smug. Luckily, with the beautiful sight in front of me, it wasn’t hard to feel smug. “Why, impressed?” I added like I was mocking her.  </p><p>“Of course,” she answered. “I have never even read a story about someone trying to break the barrier without first thoroughly hiding themselves from the Earth. The backlash of the elements is impossible to resist,” she said, then added. “Well, supposed to be impossible, but they probably didn’t consider your crazy family,” she said. She must have been affected a lot, because she launched into an explanation about why doing Ascending without isolation was supposed to be impossible, with several very graphic examples.</p><p>“I don’t know what method you used,” she continued, her heated explanation broken by repeated moans as I continued to slam into her ass, still feeling our magic mingle as well. “But whatever it was, it wasn’t enough to completely stabilize you. You’re lucky that I was there to use a secret family technique to stabilize you.”  </p><p>Only then did I realize the extent of my luck. I didn’t know why, but I knew that the repeated lightning strikes were responsible for my survival. Well, them and Lillian if she was telling the truth. Considering my own magic seemed to agree with her, I had no reason to disbelieve her.</p><p>“Interesting,” I said. “But I’m going to put a limb on the line and guess that you weren’t the only one that used that technique,” I asked. </p><p>“I was,” she answered, surprising me enough that I stopped for a moment. “Hey, don’t stop!” she warned. “After everything I’ve done for you for the last few days, the least you can do is to fuck me properly,” she added. I decided her complaint had merit, and started impaling her even harder. </p><p>“So, you’re the only one that used it,” I asked. </p><p>“Yeah,” she said, but her tone suggested that there might be other relevant details. “I was the only one that used it, but then you had to be weird and unpredictable,” she added. </p><p>“How so?” I asked even as I slapped her ass, more for the sheer joy of leaving a mark on her alabaster skin than anything else. </p><p>“I had just triggered the ritual, and was on the first of seven steps, when your magic lashed out and wrapped around me. It was supposed to do something similar, but only after I coaxed it through several actions then…” she said, then suddenly falling silent. </p><p>“Then what?” I asked. </p><p>“Then we needed to connect carnally at the seventh step to mingle our magic, and through mine, your magic would stabilize and strengthen,” she admitted. I couldn’t help but feel touched, as I knew the implications of her sacrificing her virginity considering her position as an heiress. And with extra knowledge about their secret art, the value her family would put on her purity would be incomprehensible. </p><p>It also raised some new questions about her kidnapping, but I decided to leave them to a later date. “So, what happened instead?” </p><p>“Your magic jumped out and coaxed my magic instead, then jumped to Astrid as well.” She stopped for a moment to man to her heart’s content, then continued. “It should be impossible to establish such a bond with three people, but I’m beginning to understand that you’re too stupid to understand what’s impossible.” </p><p>Her last statement managed to earn a moan from me. “Maybe, “ I said, switching to Latin. “But we have bored Astrid enough with our discussion. </p><p>“She doesn’t seem bored,” Lillian answered, gesturing at Astrid, who was moaning happily as Lillian continued to finger her asshole, using all five fingers. </p><p>“Maybe, but it doesn’t mean that we can’t make the situation even more fun,” I said even as I pulled out for a moment, and threw Lillian on top of Astrid, their breasts pressed tight, their lips just inches apart. Then, the next time I pushed forward, it was Astrid’s puckered hole I found myself in rather than Lillian’s. </p><p>Astrid cried in surprise. “We need to keep you silent,” Lillian said before she started kissing Astrid, their tongues swirling together. Blonde and crimson mixed, they created a beautiful sight that I wanted to immortalize, but since I wasn’t a painter, I decided to enjoy the moment fully, and pushed deep inside Astrid, enjoying her plump ass. </p><p>A minute later, I switched, then it was Astrid’s turn to silence Lillian. She chose to go a slightly different direction, and pulled her against her chest instead, silencing Lillian with her spectacularly large tits. </p><p>It was a beautiful view, but I was once again distracted by the reaction of my own magic. It started sizzling under my skin, warm but not painful. Then I felt a magical echo from both Lillian and Astrid, separately but throbbing with a rhythm. I felt connected with my instincts in a way I had never experienced before. Unlike the call of the Dragon’s Heart, it didn’t feel foreign, but it was overwhelming nonetheless. </p><p>I had a feeling that I could have rejected the call, but doing so would somehow cause me to miss a monumental opportunity. I wouldn’t have followed it, but the feeling was the exact copy of the moment that lightning started to rain during my Ascension, saving my life. </p><p>I decided to take the risk, and flared my magic under the guidance of my instincts. I barely had enough time to draw several runes in the air, hiding the magical signature of the room. I dumped enough power into those runes to kill a Cohort of Legionaries, but I had a feeling that it would be barely enough…</p><p>Lightning flared around me, covering my skin, but since the girls just moaned louder rather than crying out in deadly pain, I decided to continue. Though, with my magic flowing unrestricted, throbbing as if trying to tell me that stopping was not an option. </p><p>The girls cried, their eyes shining with the small flares of lightning, copying the transformation of my own magic. They moaned and gasped while I recklessly invaded their puckered holes, and Lillian started trembling with the most explosive orgasm I had ever seen when I finally filled her puckered hole, and she collapsed, unconscious, but I could feel that she was healthy. Maybe even healthier. </p><p>“I want it too,” Astrid growled, wild and primal even for her. She pulled herself from under Lillian like she wanted to wrestle me down, but I was quicker. I pinned her down and slid inside her puckered hole, slamming with the aggression she deserved and welcomed at the same time. </p><p>When I finally came inside her ass, she repeated Lillian’s reaction. She trembled and gasped as her climax pushed her into unconsciousness, but her magic continued to flow strong, suggesting that I somehow managed to do something impossible again. </p><p>Well, that could be left for tomorrow, I decided. Whatever that was, it drained me almost completely, and strained my magic-isolating runes to the point of collapse as well. I dispelled them —and added several protective runes around the room just in case— before I slid back into the bed, between the two exhausted beauties. </p><p>However, as I slowly lost consciousness, I couldn’t help but think that what I did was just the first step of a very complicated journey… </p>
