        <p>As I lay on the cold stone floor, every single bone in my body aching in pain, the only emotion I felt was elation. </p><p>How could I feel anything else when I finally feel my magic after a month of imprisonment. Yes, it was a sliver smaller than I could use when I was five years old, barely enough to light a candle, but I didn’t care. I finally had leverage. </p><p>Magic-blocking was a very complicated piece of magic, especially the robust ones like the chains around my limbs. I doubted that there was more than a dozen artifact that could block magic long term without constant supervision, most schemes required maintenance from at least three mages simultaneously, and even then, they weren’t perfect. </p><p>But that ignorant pathfinder gave me the opportunity to put a crack on them, and I finally had the leverage, one I could use to destroy the chains, probably in less than a day. But the question of what was next held my hand. I was in the middle of the capital, and even if I managed to escape, I would be still in the center of their territory, with no hopes of escaping. And if by some miracle I managed to escape back to dark lands, an assassin's dagger —or more likely, many of them— awaited me. </p><p>I needed to be patient and find an opportunity, and if I could manage, some allies. </p><p>The gods must have decided to have pity on me, because it was that exact moment the door opened, and Princess Aria stepped inside before closing the door. </p><p>Alone. </p><p>I was curious about her sudden appearance, so I decided to keep my eyes closed. “Sweet gods of light,” she exclaimed in shock as she dashed forward me, her hands already glowing with pure healing magic. She pressed her hands on my body and warmth flooded in my body, destroying the majority of the pain I was feeling. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my inhibitor chains, she would have cured me in less than a second —none of my wounds are magical, which made healing efforts much easier, especially to one of the strongest healer in the land like her— but the inhibitors devoured her magic gluttonously, preventing her from effectively curing me. With the mana she was spending, she could have pulled a regiment from the edge of death.</p><p>There was an impressive number of tricks I could have used on her if I had more of my magic, but unfortunately, the sliver I had wouldn’t push through her resistance. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean I couldn’t mess with her with the tricks I had access to. She was still distracted with her healing efforts, and the wild flow of her magic was blanketing the room, so it was easy to cast a spell without detection. </p><p>Deciding on my target was almost trivial. She had probably come right after —or during— the meeting, because she was still wearing her long and conservative dress, covering her body to the limit of what was fashionable, once again showing her lack of confidence. However, her tailors had put a rather complicated knot on the center of the dress, making her avoidance of a cleavage a fashion choice. </p><p>A knot that was easily undone with a simple magical pull. </p><p>It took even less magic than I had expected, as the knot was already tightened to the limit with the pressure from her breasts, strained further as she bent down to press her hands on my body. Without the knot to hold on, the neckline of her dress dipped quite a bit lower, gifting me with the most beautiful thing I had seen since my capture, tempting me to raise my hands and dig into their beautiful expanse. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was impossible, so instead, I continued my task of loosening the strings that held her top together. Without the knot, it was even easier, though it was a bit ridiculous to see myself acting like a teenager who just discovered his magic rather than the dark lord I was. Admittedly, considering I was locked with chains too short to actually allow me to masturbate while enduring daily visits from several sexy —and dangerous, which only added to their sexiness in my view— women, my actions should be excusable. </p><p>Still distracted, she barely noticed as I continued to get a better view of her cleavage until it was deep enough to reveal her corset. My eyes widened further upon the sight, as her already large breasts were looking wondrous at the point they contacted with the hard edge of her white corset, spilling out temptingly, making me wish that I could just lick them. </p><p>It was a pity that before I could start working on the corset, the magic flow slowed. Since I was yet to recover from most of my wounds, it was probably just a pause. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to exile her exhaustion, but her deep breaths created an even more spectacular view of her chests. I kept my eyes closed, only peeking through a slight crack, acting like I was asleep, not wanting to get caught looking. I didn’t want to spook her. </p><p>She took several breaths before her eyes opened, realizing that her chest was feeling colder than it was supposed to feel. The gasp that left her mouth was spectacularly beautiful, as beautiful as the cute panic that danced in her eyes as she turned her back immediately, her fingers dancing on her top to cover her chest. I used the opportunity to twist my legs enough to conceal my erection, hard enough to imitate steel. </p><p>It took a couple of minutes for her to recover from her panic and turn back, carefully examining me to see whether or not I was sleeping. Luckily, acting unconscious or sleeping was a trick I was competent at. Previously, it saved me from several assassination attempts, and now, it allowed me to feast my eyes with the beautiful sight of Aria’s cleavage without any cost. </p><p>She was still reticent as she crouched next to me, softly touching at my shoulder to make sure I was still unconscious. I didn’t react. She tried to use magic to make sure, but luckily, the interference from the chains was too much for her to get a clear reading, so even with my sliver of magic, it was easy to manipulate her reading. “Thank the light,” she murmured as she let out a big sigh, which strained her haphazardly-tied top once more, enough that one of the critical strings that held it together was fraying. I decided to take a mad risk and let out a flicker of magic, and it snapped. </p><p>“Again,” she murmured in the complaint as her cleavage appeared once again, but this time, she didn’t turn back in panic, not after she had just made sure I was sleeping. She still blushed, of course, her attention fully on the strings. This time, a raging boner wasn’t my only challenge. I was also struggling not to laugh, because an issue that would take a simple mending spell had stumped her. Probably because she was a princess, she had never learned household spells. </p><p>At that point, I had resigned the fact that she would just turn and leave, though a night of pain was worth the amazing sight I had experienced. So, I was rather surprised when she leaned down with an exasperated expression —her blush everpresent— and started another session of healing. She was banking on the fact that I was still asleep. </p><p>A kind person would have let her finish healing and leave. But while I was rather kind, it was only by the standards of my occupation. The mark the previous dark lords had left wasn’t hard to surpass in that area. </p><p>I acted just as she was about to finish her second session of healing. “Wow, I must be dead, because there’s no way I could enjoy such a beautiful sight otherwise,” I murmured. The cry she let out echoed in the room as she jumped up to her feet, her hands trying to cover her chest —with limited success, with her big breasts and small hands, a comprehensive one was impossible. </p><p>“You’re awake!” she exclaimed as she staggered back to the wall, her eyes widened in shock. Which, even for a shy girl like her, was an overreaction. It wasn’t like I saw her naked, the most I got was a glimpse of her beautiful pink areolas when she had leaned excessively in a moment of distraction. </p><p>“Yes, I am,” I answered, as casual as I could manage. “And thanks for healing me. That bitch hits really hard.” </p><p>“N-no problem,” she stammered, even under the circumstances, unable to skip the pleasantries completely. “You s-saw?” she stammered. </p><p>“Come on, princess, it was just a bit of cleavage,” I answered casually. “And considering I’m still seeing blurry, it doesn’t even count.” </p><p>“You’re seeing blurry?” she asked immediately as she took a step forward, her healer instincts able to suppress her panic for a moment as she dashed forward. She put one hand on my head while the other tried to keep her cleavage contained, and once again I felt the rush of healing energies filling my body, even thicker than the previous times. </p><p>It was a mistake on her part, because unlike the last time, she was fully aware of her cleavage, and continued tugging it, trying to avoid my gaze. It was a mistake, because it meant that she wasn’t really focusing on the flow of her magic. Even with my limited power, guiding a portion of that healing rush toward the crack on my chains was trivial. Healing magic wasn’t exactly destructive, so its impact was minimal, but minimal was a very different thing than nothing. When she pulled back once again, exhausted even more, my access to my powers almost doubled. Of course, it meant that I had two grains of sand instead of one, but still, it was an improvement. </p><p>“Thanks, now I can see much better,” I said as she pulled back. “Would you mind giving me another glimpse?” </p><p>“You pervert,” she gasped in exclaim as she once again pulled back, her hands on her cleavage. </p><p>I smiled at her, though I doubted it was exactly comforting with dried blood and dirt on my face. “Come on, it’s literally nothing, how are you going to handle your wedding night if you’re reacting a little glimpse like that,” I said, and she blushed even further. </p><p>“T-that’s none of your bu-business,” she stammered. “Stop messing with me.” </p><p>I shrugged. “You’re right, it’s not my business, but I’m not messing with you.”</p><p>“You’re not?” she asked, unable to keep herself from answering, which was a horrible mistake under almost all circumstances. No matter what, she was one of my interrogators, and unlike the others, she didn’t have the slightest idea about how to handle that —not that the others were masters on it. She was already shy, and letting me dictate the discussion was a dangerous mistake. </p><p>She was lucky that between my jailers, I liked her the best, as otherwise, I could have easily ruined her life. I still intended to mess with her, of course, but nothing even close to what I had in mind for others, especially her mother. “Of course not, you’re the only one that actually cares for me in this hellhole,” I said, sad and vulnerable. Artificial, of course, but her expression softened, showing she swallowed it immediately. Unbelievable, I thought. It was a miracle that she managed to survive politically if she was gullible enough to believe that I would be weakened enough to act vulnerable just because I was imprisoned for a month. </p><p>I was a fucking Dark Lord, a detail that she somehow managed to forget!</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she murmured, her arms helplessly on the side, her head lowered, the sudden sadness overwhelming enough to make her forget the state of her dress. “I don’t think the treatment you’re receiving is fair, but the Empire really needs the Eternal Core.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I have my pride, sweetie,” I answered, neglecting to mention that the leverage was the only thing that was protecting me from her mother, who was the scariest opponent in the Empire now that I was captured. “But enough about that. I was serious about your shyness and its impact on your upcoming marriage,” I explained, and she blushed once more. “Do you really think that the girl that was always around him would leave your marriage alone if they see the slightest opportunity?” </p><p>“N-no, Emma is just childhood friend,” she answered rapidly, waving her hands. Of course, her panicked movements jiggled her breasts deliciously, making my mouth water. </p><p>“If you say so,” I said, but when she nodded, I continued with a smirk. “However, you were rather quick deducing that I was walking about Emma.” She stammered a messy response that was supposed to be negative, but lacking conviction. “It’s not your fault that you’re feeling jealous,” I said.</p><p>Her eyes turned toward me, hopeful. “It’s not?” </p><p>“Of course not, she definitely knows what she is doing hanging around. And believe me, she is opportunistic enough to swoop in at the slightest opportunity.” </p><p>“Lancelot would never do something like that!” she shouted suddenly, more to convince herself than me. </p><p>“If you’re absolutely sure,” I said with a shrug, conveying my lack of conviction. </p><p>“I am,” she said as she pointedly turned her back and started trying to fix her top. Her fingers weren’t used to it in the first place, but the discussion about the inevitable affair of her fiancee rattled her enough that her fingers were trembling, making her snap the laces that were supposed to hold her top together. When she turned to face me once more, her eyes were shining with unshed tears, though the delicious view of her cleavage was more important. </p><p>“I’ll help you,” I said. </p><p>“I won’t open your chains,” she answered immediately, her sadness replaced by panic. She was clearly warned repeatedly about the probability. </p><p>“You don’t need to, just listen to my directions,” I said. Grab the first string, and pull just a bit…” I started, and she followed my orders, assuming that it was better than walking out of my cell with a ruined top. Not entirely illogical. I was tempted to ruin her top even more, but that would ruin the point of the earlier discussion. I needed her to trust me. </p><p>“Thanks,” she smiled brightly as she managed to recover her top after ten minutes of careful knotting. </p><p>“No problem, it’s rare for me to have such a pleasant break,” I said. “So, is there anything else I can help you with, like teaching you how to seduce your fiancee?” </p><p>She blushed so hard that I feared that she would faint. “No, no, no, no…” she murmured, stringing a long line of the word, each repeat of the word weakening her own conviction. </p><p>“Of course, if you have someone else that could answer your questions about a male perspective, be my guest,” I said. Her silence was enough to answer. “Think of it this way. You can ask me anything, and I’ll answer to the best of my ability. You don’t need to feel self-conscious, as even if I were to tell anyone, no one would believe me.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured, trying to make a decision. The silence stretched for a minute. “Will you really help me?”</p><p>“Yes,” I answered simply. “As I said before, I actually like you.” I smiled softly, suppressing my desire to smirk. “But I recommend keeping the tricks you learned until the wedding, as by shocking him, you can ensure his loyalty.” I had no intention of letting that asshole Lancelot actually benefit from my teachings, after all. </p><p>“O-okay, let’s try it,” she said. </p><p>“The first thing is how you stand suggestively. Turn your foot a bit, lean forward…” I started, explaining to her several techniques to be more aggressive in getting male attention. She didn’t need any help with that, of course, but it was a good way to generate trust. She followed my directions for the next five minutes, until I uttered a very distracting statement. “Now, it’s time for kissing practice.” </p><p>“WHAT!” she shouted, shocked. </p><p>“Relax, you will use the back of your hand,” I said with a chuckle, making her relax. She blushed but nodded, raising the back of her hand to her lips, delivering a soft, lingering kiss on the back of her hand, which was strangely erotic, making me glad that my prison clothes were rather loose. “Was it your first kiss?” I asked. </p><p>“Is it that obvious,” she said, exhausted. </p><p>“Hey, don’t worry, practice makes it perfect, though I can advise you much better if you kiss the back of my hand instead.” </p><p>A deep blush covered her face and neck, no doubt also covering her body but unfortunately, her cleavage was hidden behind her dress. She froze, making me hopeful that she would actually follow the recommendation, which had several interesting possibilities. </p><p>But my luck decided to throw a curveball, because the door suddenly opened and Isolde walked in. “You’re finished with healing him, good,” she said as she grabbed Aria’s arm. “We need to go, they are calling for another meeting,” she added, and pulled Aria away before she could answer, leaving me alone. </p><p>I chuckled as I called my magic and started working on expanding the breach on the magic-inhibiting chains. It was a show, mindnumbing work, but much better than counting bricks once again. </p><p>But a part of my mind was focused on the most important question. What should be my next action?</p>
