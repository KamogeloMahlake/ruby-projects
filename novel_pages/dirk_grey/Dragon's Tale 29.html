        <p>“So, this is our new home. I can’t believe it,” Lillian asked curiously even as I led them inside the house, which was in surprisingly good condition considering its age. The furnishing hadn’t survived of course, nor did the windows and the doors. However, creating workable alternatives was ridiculously easy for my skill level, so I was happy. </p><p>“This place is so big,” Astrid said from another room as she moved around. </p><p>“Of course it is big, it’s a proper Roman Villa,” Lillian answered, surprisingly, with no hint of derision or dismissal in her tone. Just days ago, every little interaction she had with Astrid was tinged with a hint of superiority, but it had disappeared somewhere between my surprising Ascension, and their relationship seemed to deepen even more after the escape from the trading post. </p><p>What Lillian said was true. This place was a proper Roman villa, one that any Equites would be proud to have, especially considering it was constructed by magical white marble, one of the most precious building materials. It was on the smaller size for the Patrician families, but considering those households hold tens of members —hundreds if one counted the servants and slaves as well— being found lacking on that particular area wasn’t a problem. Like any proper Roman Villa, the building was like a hallowed square, creating a connected web of rooms, while also creating a private inner garden away from any prying eyes. </p><p>A perfect location to have some private time in the heat of the summer. </p><p>Frankly, it wasn’t the best choice of architecture for a mountaintop villa, but considering the reason for construction, I wasn’t surprised. They wanted to stay stylistically connected to Rome, just to underline their own legitimacy. </p><p>I walked through the rooms, just checking them for any possible traps or signs of decay that might create a danger above the capabilities of the girls. The town was an interesting find, but that didn’t suddenly mean that I was safe. As a Sorcerer, I was able to find myself in the chaotic field of the mountain, so I wasn’t unreachable. And facing against two Sorcerers, I was certainly not untouchable. Even just one Sorcerer experienced in combat —something a Centurion would definitely have— was an unknown challenge. I had limited combat experience even against other peak mages. </p><p>So, I aimed to leave the ruins after getting a bit of a rest. </p><p>Of course, no one said I couldn’t rest in style, I thought with a wide smirk, enthusiastically examining the last room I had entered, which was a bathhouse. </p><p>It was a proper one that was fit to be used by multiple people, and since it was built mostly from marble, it was close to prime condition. A controlled wind spell funneled all the dust out of the bath, and creating a runic scheme to conjure water and warm it appropriately took minutes, easily achievable thanks to the thick background magic, calmed by the presence of the wards. </p><p>“Fucking finally,” I murmured as I slipped into the warm embrace of the water, enjoying both the exhaustion and the dirt flowing away from my body, but bubbling water kept clear thanks to another simple runic scheme. It was especially relaxing after spending the last two days wading through mud and rain, trying to avoid a full cohort of professional soldiers, supported by some very skilled mages. </p><p>A bath was a true luxury. </p><p>I was so relaxed that I didn’t bother to open my eyes, not even when the footsteps neared, easily recognizing Lillian’s particular walk. I put that out of my mind when she walked away just like that, glad that she left me to rest. Even the temptation of her beautiful body was not enough to break my rest. I kept my eyes closed, trying to drift into the warm embrace of a nap… </p><p>That aim was disrupted several minutes later, when I heard footsteps closing in once more, this time two pairs of them. But my dissatisfaction was dispelled in an instant when I heard a playful giggle from Lillian as Astrid whispered something, suddenly realizing that they weren’t there to ask my help about the house. While the temptation of Lillian’s beautiful body was not enough to change my mind, the same wasn’t true for Lillian and Astrid together. </p><p>I cracked my eyes open just as I felt them sliding into the bath. The first thing I noticed was Astrid’s beautiful bosom, bobbing on the surface of the water, hidden behind a very interesting approximation of underwear, made from white fabric, which immediately turned half-transparent as it sank into the water, her crimson hair spilling freely on her shoulders. Lillian was next to her, wearing equally small underclothes, its impact only second to Astrid’s delicious show. </p><p>“It’s a very nice bath,” Lillian drawled lazily. “I can see why you prioritized repairing it.” Her words would have felt like a passive-aggressive assault, but her tone was the complete opposite, clearly enjoying the water jets even more than me. Her back arched lazily, or more accurately, would have been termed as lazily if she was wearing anything other than a wet piece of cloth barely wider than my hand, stretching dangerously. </p><p>“Yes, a very good idea,” Astrid answered as she followed Lillian’s direction, stretching as well. Unlike Lillian, her motion was a bit more mechanical, checking Lillian to see if she had done it correctly, revealing that they had actually coordinated in that. I acted unawares, enjoying the way her white top stretched even further, threatening to be ripped in half under the heavyweight of her bosom. I was far too curious about their sudden plan to seduce me to interrupt them. </p><p>“Even with the water, my back is still stiff,” Lillian murmured before looking at Astrid. “Do you mind rubbing my shoulders?” </p><p>“Of course not,” Astrid answered and Lillian moved to press her back against Astrid’s chest while Astrid put her hands on Lillian’s shoulders, and started squeezing softly. Lillian moaned in relief, far more than what should have been required from such a light touch. I expected Astrid to move down immediately to further their ploy of seduction, but surprisingly, her hands stayed firmly on Lillian’s shoulders, while Lillian’s moans got louder and louder, not bothering to hide their sensual nature. I kept watching, partly because I was curious about their ultimate aim, partly because I was enjoying the show immensely. </p><p>Though, my determination to stay observer was challenged when Astrid’s hands finally left their post, first trailing down Lillian’s back, making her back arc once more, accentuating her delicious breasts. My heartbeat climbed as Astrid ‘carelessly’ touched Lillian’s underwear, making it slid down to enhance Lillian’s cleavage further, deliciously framed with water droplets. </p><p>However, just as I was starting to hope that the show was about to pick up speed, Lillian spoke. “Now, it’s your turn,” she said to Astrid as she pulled back, fixing her top. They both turned, so that Astrid’s back was resting against Lillian’s chest, but it caused a major problem! I could only see their backs, especially horrible since their lower half was buried under the bubbles, hiding the only good aspect of such a pose. </p><p>It seemed to be Lillian’s intention as well, if her playful smirk was any indicator. She rubbed Astrid’s shoulders, while the voluptuous redhead took the task of moaning enticingly. It would be a lie to say that I wasn’t tempted to rush forward and educate them on the risks of teasing me like this, but I kept myself back, not wanting to surrender easily to their attempts of teasing.</p><p>Also, watching them slowly caress each other with the sole purpose of arousing me was a unique show, and it would be a pity to miss it. </p><p>Lillian hadn’t lost much time before removing her top and giving me a view of her naked back, supported by the glimpse of the side view of her breasts whenever she moved, but that was just the start of her plan. After throwing her water-logged top to the side, her hands found Astrid’s transparent top, and slowly slid it off her body as Astrid raised her arms. Unlike Lillian’s more modest —but still large— bosom, Astrid’s amazing tits didn’t require her to turn to give a glimpse of its curves, especially when she was pressing her chest against the marble walls of the bath. </p><p>Still, no matter how amazing the show, I was determined to watch passively. But like she was reading my mind, Lillian was quick to challenge that particular detail. “You are so tense,” Lillian murmured into Astrid’s ear before pressing her lips to her neck, leaving a trail of kisses that made her moans more intense, and my shaft harder. She was playing dirty. </p><p>“Maybe you can move lower,” Astrid managed to say between moans, which were starting to lose their artificial quality further as the time passed. </p><p>“Like this,” Lillian said as she started kissing her shoulders, but the more interesting shift was her hands, moving to Astrid’s front, sliding her palms on her chest. Astrid moaned as Lillian squeezed, the last bits of acting finally melting down as she squirmed under Lillian’s touch. </p><p>“You girls seem to be getting along very well,” I quipped, trying to keep my voice even, but unable to prevent it from hitching a bit. </p><p>Lillian twisted her neck to look at me, her tits still pressing Astrid’s back to hide her frontal nakedness the sexiest way possible, her fingers comfortably sinking into her bosom. A naughty grin blossomed on her face as she spoke. “During the escape, we finally managed to find a common ground. Huddled in a small cave just two of us, wet and trembling, and without the presence of our protector, not knowing whether we’ll be able to see the morning… It’s hard to go through such a dangerous ordeal without getting close.” </p><p>“And you two are definitely close,” I answered, unable to keep my laugh in as Lillian pressed even tighter as she molested Astrid’s chest, far too enthusiastically to be just a ploy to seduce me. Apparently, the suspicions of the male students back when we were in the school were more accurate than we had initially presumed in terms of how the girls spent their time back in their private section.</p><p>It was one of the biggest dilemmas I had ever faced in my life, whether to keep watching their amazing show or move forward, using the perfect angle to take Lillian from behind, turning their playful game into a threesome. In the end, however, no matter how hard my shaft throbbed in anticipation, the former won, and not just because I wanted to watch the show —and I did, very much. I also wanted to have a better understanding of their new dynamic so that I could feel confident leaving them alone as I went exploring. </p><p>I could feel that the lost city wasn’t the only secret of the Mount Pyrenaean, if that was the case, Julius Caesar wouldn’t have chosen it as the location for its secret base. I have no illusion of the risks I would face exploring it, making it unfeasible to bring the girls with me. Knowing that they wouldn’t draw their knives the moment I turn my back was comforting. </p><p>Lillian turned several times to share a naughty smile as she massaged Astrid’s amazing bosom and delivered layers of kisses on her sensitive neck, making her moans louder and louder. Said moans suddenly gained a deeper quality when one of Lillian’s hands disappeared underwater, her shoulder twisting repeatedly. </p><p>I had expected that to be the end of their little game, but after one last teasing smile, Lillian suddenly sank underwater, and Astrid cried desperately, her hands clamping on the edge of the bath to keep herself upright. It didn’t take a genius to understand what Lillian was doing underwater, but her initiative surprised me greatly. Though, from her frantic reaction, it was likely that I wasn’t the only one that was surprised, not that either of us had any problem with that particular surprise. </p><p>Lillian stayed underwater for a full minute as Astrid moaned and grunted, climbing steadily toward a climax of her own, only to gasp disappointingly when Lillian pulled up to breathe, gasping greatly. “Try to sit on the edge of the bath, it’ll make it easier,” I recommended to Astrid with a smirk, betting on the fact that she was far too gone to remember that it was a ploy to tease me. </p><p>Astrid said nothing as she pulled herself out of the water, finally giving me a beautiful glimpse of her thick bottom, adorned with a rain of droplets. Lillian sighed exaggeratedly as we shared a look, though her own arousal was impossible to hide, so much that, when Astrid finally sat on the edge of the bed and parted her legs to give us a perfect view of her full-frontal nudity, Lillian didn’t bother to tease me as she moved, her head firmly positioned between her legs. </p><p>My eyes stayed glued on the amazing show, Lillian eating Astrid with great fervor, while Astrid’s wet breasts heaved greatly, pointing upward as she arched her back, her arms pressing on the cold floor in a desperate attempt to keep herself upright. Watching Lillian as she mauled and teased Astrid with a surprising familiarity was always nice, pushing Astrid closer and closer to a climax. Soon, Astrid grabbed Lillian’s hair, pulling her tighter even as her legs started to clench, signaling Lillian’s great success. </p><p>Trying to stay upright with her orgasm, Astrid was not in a position to resist as Lillian pulled her back into the water, or when she smashed her lips —still stained with her arousal— in a searing kiss. I watched with growing arousal as they shared the kiss that started tender, but quickly climbed to a level of deep arousal, their chest pressing against each other. </p><p>As much as I wanted to join, watching two naked girls sharing an enthusiastic yet tender kiss while their delicious bodies were on display was something special, especially when considering one of them was an impeccable noble heiress and the other was a barbarian priestess, like it was a poorly imagined story told in a bar… Except it was entirely real, and entirely delicious… </p><p>Things got even more heated when two hands disappeared under the water, one of each, their shoulders twisting furiously, immediately followed by an increase of passion in their kiss, turning into an irresistible temptation… As the seconds ticked, their kiss getting more and more heated, surrendering started to sound more and more tempting. </p><p>Then, before I could make a move, Astrid suddenly pulled out of the kiss, and whispered something to Lillian’s ear, who let out a delicious mixture of moan and giggle in response, and then, they swam next to me. “It seems that you need a massage as well,” Astrid whispered into my ear even as my shoulder buried under the soft weight of her bosom. </p><p>“Without a doubt,” Lillian completed even as she repeated the maneuver, and suddenly, I felt a pair of hands on my chest, and they started traveling down. I leaned back in the anticipation of an amazing massage service…</p>
