        <p>“So, w-what’s next,” a stammering whisper asked Naomi’s beautiful lips.  </p><p>“Whatever you want it to be,” I answered back. I could have pushed her to whatever I wanted, of course, but I wanted her to feel comfortable in what might be her first time if she wished, or waiting for the next time. </p><p>Admittedly, it wasn’t as big a sacrifice as it sounded when I had another sexy nerd in my bathroom, even hornier, probably more than happy to make me ‘pay’ for the extended delay. </p><p>“What if I’m not ready for anything,” she whispered. </p><p>“Then we stop,” I said seriously, only to follow with a chuckle as I looked down to my crotch, where her fingers were still wrapped around my girth, pumping up and down. “Though, if I were to guess from where your fingers currently are, you don’t seem particularly enthusiastic about stopping.” </p><p>Naomi gasped as she pulled her hand back in surprise, like she just registered where her hand was busy. “It’s an accident,” she gasped, but she continued to sit on my lap, making no attempt to pull away. </p><p>“I’m sure it is,” I said, accepting her unconvincing explanation even as I leaned forward once more, this time kissing her neck, making her squirm on my lap again, which didn’t help my erection in any way possible. </p><p>Her moans echoed on the walls even as I grabbed her ass once more, this time squeezing and mauling to my heart’s content, enjoying the perfect firmness that could only be attained with endless exercise and very careful dieting. She found herself unable to move when she tried to squirm once more, though, considering she continued to moan, it clearly wasn’t a big problem for her. Her arousal was burning even thicker. </p><p>However, when I glanced toward the bathroom, I noticed the mirror was moving even more erratically, making me afraid of an accident. If that mirror slipped off her fingers, it might ruin several very possible fun events. Yet, football taught me that trying to avoid every possible risk only ended in defeat. Only by bravely risking things, we could achieve perfect victory. </p><p>And, that fear wasn’t enough for me to stop and ask Naomi to leave, not after I had reached such a naughty point. </p><p>I decided to ask a very dangerous question, one that could ruin a lot of stuff, but with an incredible potential upside. Yet, I kept my tone barely above a whisper, preventing Sarah from hearing it. “You know that you’re not the only one in your friend group that’s trying to seduce me, don’t you?” I whispered even as I continued to squeeze her ass. </p><p>Her eyes popped beautifully as she tried to pull herself off my lap, but I didn’t allow it. Luckily, instead of anger, I found shock and shame, no doubt thinking of it as an accusation rather than permission. </p><p>I decided to let that impression persist. </p><p>“I … do,” she admitted slowly, though she didn’t try to pull herself from my lap, seeing that I had no intention of pushing her away. </p><p>“And you have no problems with that, even if things had gone, or might go, further with said friends?” I asked, deliberately avoiding mentioning Carrie’s name. </p><p>“N-no,” she said. “Actually, I have—“ she tried to add, but before she could finish her sentence, I silenced her with a searing kiss. I had all the ammunition I needed, and I didn’t need her explaining how she asked for Carrie’s permission beforehand. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly the nicest thing to do, but considering she had ‘borrowed’ me from Carrie like a toy, it wasn’t exactly something she could be outraged about either. </p><p>“That’s enough for me,” I said after pulling back from the kiss, only to realize that during the kiss, her crossed legs had finally unfolded. My fingers slipped down, dancing over her wetness.</p><p>The moan of pleasure she let out at the sudden touch after such an extended foreplay session was simply beautiful, her legs widening even further in invitation. Her hands dropped her sides helplessly as she did her best to process the unfamiliar wave of pleasure, my massive erection grinding against the side of her leg not making it any easier for her to gather her wits. </p><p>Though, things didn’t exactly change immensely once her hands started working, not when one of them landed on my abs, caressing my muscles while the other landed even lower, grabbing my shaft once more, stroking it lightly. </p><p>I would have loved a more aggressive approach, but her moans were sufficiently delicious to compensate for the lackluster hand service. </p><p>I kept palming her beautiful ass, the other hand busy with her wet entrance, increasing the intensity of her moans even further, even mixing in an occasional squeal. </p><p>“Maybe we should stop?” she offered, her voice soft, lacking conviction. </p><p>“If you wish,” I suggested. “Why don’t you start by pulling her hand away.” She dipped her head down shyly, but her hand stayed in place, giving her a perfect answer. “Excellent,” I whispered as my fingers continued to dance around her knob. </p><p>But the real surprise was my other hand. I swung my hand, my palm slamming to her toned ass with a loud clap, though her tight ass not jiggling even for a moment. “Ouch,” she gasped. </p><p>“I wanted to do that the moment I had seen your beautiful ass,” I whispered. “After you had worked so hard to perfect it, it needs some worship.” </p><p>“Be gentler,” she gasped. </p><p>I spanked again, though this time softer, my hand lingering for a long. “How about this?” I asked. “Is this gentle enough?” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she whispered, unable to hide her arousal spiking even further, especially after I had rewarded her admission with another spank, making her squeal with pain and pleasure. </p><p>“Excellent,” I whispered as I leaned down to capture her lips once more, but this time, it wasn’t a soft, gentle kiss. No, it was a searing one, with all the momentum of a merciless invasion, my tongue dominating her mouth in seconds. </p><p>She let out a muffled moan, still helpless against my hands slapping her tight ass, again and again, suggesting that Carrie and Sarah weren’t the only ones with a submissive streak in their little — yet surprisingly sexy — nerd group. </p><p>Under assault from three different directions, she didn’t prevent me from changing our position — if she noticed our movement in the first place. Since she was under the assault of a wave of pleasure she had never felt before, it was not an unlikely outcome. </p><p>Between spanks, I grabbed her waist and raised her, making her move her legs, so that she was facing me properly, her legs at either side. It allowed me to kiss her even more aggressively, but it was only a fringe benefit. </p><p>The real benefit was the positioning of the treasure between her legs, rubbing against the side of my shaft, leaving her wet mark in arousal. “Damn, girl,” I whispered even as I spanked her beautiful ass once more. “You’re so sexy. Your endless hours of exercising certainly didn’t go to waste.” </p><p>“T-thanks,” she managed to murmur, not knowing how to handle such a compliment under the circumstances, but that didn’t prevent the relentless rocking of her hips, trying to push her into arousal. </p><p>She was reacting to pleasure even better than I hoped, and that was with the delicious benchmarks provided by Carrie and Sarah, though maybe it was the safety of my house that was giving her courage, compared to my first time with Carrie, in her car pulled to the side, risking a voyeur. </p><p>Of course, unlike then, we actually had a voyeur, but Naomi was unaware of that particular fact. But maybe I should tell her that, to prevent a future crisis…</p><p>And more importantly, push the situation to an even sexier end. </p><p>“So,” I whispered into her ear even as I slapped her ass once more. “You remember I mentioned your friends choosing a similar path, and might or might not be as enthusiastic as you…” I started, letting it linger deliberately. </p><p>“Yeah,” she said, but this time, her tone measured, unable to prevent jealousy from creeping in. Very understandable, considering our position. Though, her hips, quickening even further, implied that she was more than willing to handle that jealousy very directly. </p><p>“Well,” I whispered before leaning forward and giving her a short yet explosive kiss, leaving her breathless. “But what if the said girl was already here, maybe even watching us?” </p><p>“Oh, really?” she said, a hot emotion I was not able to identify infecting her voice. It might be anger, it might be jealousy… </p><p>Or it might be something even more interesting.  </p><p>“Glance toward the bathroom door, but only for a second,” I suggested, and she followed my instructions, only for her eyes to widen as she finally noticed the mirror that was being used to get a prime view of our sexy show. </p><p>Her eyes stayed stuck, so I leaned forward once again, distracting her with another searing kiss, one that lasted for more than a minute to make sure she was appropriately distracted. Since our lips were busy, I couldn’t ask her whether it worked, but luckily, her hips were kind enough to provide the answer I was seeking… </p><p>By rubbing against me even more recklessly. </p><p>I finally pulled back from the kiss, leaving her panting desperately, on the edge of a climax. The perfect time to suggest a naughty prank. “Do you want to mess with your cheeky friend?” I asked. </p><p>Her naughty smile was the perfect answer. </p>
