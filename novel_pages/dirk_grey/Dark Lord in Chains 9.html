        <p>It took quite a bit of willpower not to explode an amused cackle as I watched Aria trying to heal me with intense concentration, required to infuse my body through the chains. Her blush was ever-present, not that it was surprising after what we had gone through. </p><p>While she was distracted with healing me, I was trying to come to a decision on just how far I should be pushing her. The safest thing to do was to let it be the end of the day, but seeing her amazing body, clad only in a corset —one that was stained with my cum, even— made it very difficult to resist that siren’s call. </p><p>I was going to test her limits, I decided. </p><p>Luckily, the healing spell was both going to take a lot of time, and distract her appropriately, giving me enough time to arouse her, to the point that she needed to solve it. The most obvious thing to focus on was her amazing bosom, the sight that I was dying to experience. Another simple telekinesis spell loosened her top, this time even more than the previous time, making her corset slid down, finally passing the line created by her erect nipples as it slid down. </p><p>I paid momentary attention to her face to make sure she was still fully committed to the spell before I turned my attention to her curves, which was perfection itself. Her breasts were a miracle, managing to maintain a perfect shape that signaled their perkiness despite their amazing size, filling me with a desire to taste it completely. Pity that I couldn’t count on her distracted state enough to free my hands from the chains. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean that I was without options. Telekinesis spell once again came to my aid, and I started caressing her breasts with my magic. My touch was soft, just enough to register through her senses, but faint enough to slip her distracted attention. Her body started to react under my touch. Nothing extreme at first, just a bit of blush, a subtle shuffle as she looked for a more comfortable position, a sigh that lasted a touch longer than normal… </p><p>She was spectacular. </p><p>However, she wasn’t the only one that was feeling restless, I realized with a sudden shock. My body was absorbing the healing energies she was producing, but unlike the previous times, I had no injuries for that healing energy to cure, therefore exhaust herself. My body did the next best thing, and started restoring my stamina and temporarily strengthen my body in all aspects. </p><p>Including my sex drive. </p><p>That was a miscalculation, I realized as my boner turned rock hard, throbbing painfully, begging for a release. It wasn’t to a point that I couldn’t ignore, but the sight of Aria’s amazing tits wasn’t making it any easier. Not to mention her weak personality, which made pushing for more possible, if a bit risky. A risk I decided to take. I decided to use shock as a tool to imbalance her. “You have amazing tits,” I told her even as I stopped magically caressing her tits. </p><p>“Thanks-” she said absentmindedly before she came to a sudden stop, stopping her magic even as her head dipped down. “What! How!” she cried in shock even as she pulled her corset up, both of her arms around her chest as additional protection while she stumbled back. </p><p>“Its lacing was probably strained when you leaned forward, making it loose,” I explained calmly, not bothering to hide my smirk as I watched her blush bloomed once more. </p><p>“Why didn’t you warn me,” she whispered accusingly, though her words once again lacked any weight behind them. </p><p>“Should I have?” I answered, deciding to double-down. “After all, not only you have seen me naked, but also molested me while I was chained to a wall. I don’t think the small glimpse I had in return was unfair, was it?” </p><p>A more composed person would have easily pointed out that I was the one that volunteered to be her test dummy, therefore she was under no obligation to even consider paying back, but Aria lacked the confidence to point out that issue, probably even failing to think that. “But-” she started, making a half-hearted attempt to defend her position, only to wilt under a determined glare. “I …  I guess not…” she added in a murmur. </p><p>“Exactly. Now, why don’t you sit down and continue healing me,” I said. When she tried to reach back to fix the lacing, all it took was a shake of my head to dissuade her from that particular activity. She once again sat down in front of me, her hand still on her corset as she tried to keep it in place. “Just so you know, you have nothing to feel ashamed of. Your body is simply spectacular. Lancelot is going to love it when he finally sees you naked.” </p><p>“You think so,” she murmured guiltily at the reminder that she had a fiancee, making her push her corset even tighter to her body, just as I wanted. Mentioning her fiancee and crush at this point might have sounded like a bad idea, but it was a part of my plan. She was already feeling aroused and ashamed and shocked at the same time, adding guilt to the mix made her even more confused, which made her even more vulnerable to my suggestions. </p><p>“Of course, look at my cock, it’s already rock hard again after getting a glimpse of your beautiful bosom,” I explained while she pointedly avoided my gaze as well as my body. I chuckled. “You can look. It’s not like you haven’t seen it before,” I explained. </p><p>After my permission, her reluctance lasted only a moment before her eyes fell down, locked to my shaft, which was still glistening with the after-effects of her latest treatment, which had ended just minutes ago. “It’s ready again? This quickly?” she asked, curious. </p><p>“Honey, your beauty is enough to resurrect the dead,” I answered, earning a shy smile as a reward. I was ready to pounce on her weakness. “Why don’t you let that corset drop so that I can enjoy your beauty a bit more,” I reminded her. “You wouldn’t be cruel enough to deny a poor prisoner such a small wish, would you?” </p><p>If I were a weaker man, I would have exploded the moment a weak whimper escaped her mouth that signaled her acceptance. Her surrender was beautiful, especially when she didn’t lower a flag but her own corset to signal her surrender, giving me an excellent glimpse of her bosom, which was heaving as she breathed deep. “Are you happy?” she countered, a small bite in her tone, once again signaling a token resistance. </p><p>“Words can’t describe my happiness,” I said smugly. “But that doesn’t mean my lips can’t. Lean in!” I said, the last two words delivered with an aura of leadership —enhanced by a touch of magic— one that I perfected during my reign as a Dark Lord, signaling my expectations for absolute obedience, promising darkness for anyone that dared to reject the order. </p><p>Even under the best of conditions, Aria would have struggled to resist such a pure demand for obedience. Confused, half-naked, shivering, aroused, and stained with my cum, she was far from her best condition. It would take a miracle for Aria to actually reject that call to action. </p><p>And that miracle rejected to descend. </p><p>She leaned forward, her lips trembling, shock dancing in her beautiful blue eyes. I was happy to note that fear wasn’t the only thing I could see in her eyes. Along with fear, there was arousal, begging to be roared further, something I was more than happy to do. Our lips met once more, but this time, it wasn’t a tender kiss. No, this time my tongue darted out, invading her mouth mercilessly, while her own gently wrapped around mine, surrendering to my aggression immediately. </p><p>Her submissiveness made me even more aroused. I cursed the fact that my hands were still chained, preventing me from running my fingers through her hair before grabbing them painfully. Instead, I delivered a gentle bite to her lower lip to compensate, making her moan beautifully, delivering an exquisite mixture of arousal and pain. “Grab my cock, and start pumping,” I ordered, something she followed immediately even though her touch was still hesitant. </p><p>The next few minutes passed in that kiss, but whenever we pulled back for a breather, her reticence was smaller, and her arousal was thicker. It was the time to take yet another step. When she leaned forward for another kiss, I stopped her. “Bring your tits to my face,” I ordered her. She looked hesitant, but followed my order nonetheless, and I found myself facing one of the most spectacular bosoms —maybe even the most spectacular one— I had seen in my life. They were perky, pale, and pristine, like a pair of holy mountains covered with pristine snow, beautiful enough to worship. </p><p>However, I was a Dark Lord, and my instincts worked differently. I didn’t want to worship them. I wanted to make them mine. And what better way to do that than leave my mark, I decided even as I gently bit those peaks, despoiling her soft skin for the first time in her life. The bite wasn’t strong, just enough to leave a faint mark, but she responded with a loud moan, one that surprised both of us. </p><p>Her sensitivity surprised me, but it was a pleasant surprise. Immediately, I attacked her breasts with a mixture of kisses, licks, and occasional bites, filling her tits with bite marks and hickeys, evidencing my invasion. Oh, how I wished my hands were free. Pity that she wasn’t far along enough to handle my freedom. </p><p>As seconds merged and created minutes, she started responding to my assault in a more visceral way. Her moans rose at first, filling the cell with the most beautiful sound it ever witnessed, while her hands around my shaft quickened, dancing up and down in a perfect rhythm that proved her proficiency as a student. </p><p>Just as I was getting into the mood while she started to show signs of an impending climax. I didn’t stop, and she lacked the presence of mind to actually pull back, though maybe it was a conscious decision on her part. After all, her loud moans weren’t exactly conveying pain and desperation. </p><p>When she collapsed to her back, shuddering helplessly, I had a smug smile on my face. After all, bringing a woman into completion while chained to a wall was not a simple achievement. However, I was surprised when she opened her eyes, only to look at me, shocked. “You - you can use magic!” she said in shock. </p><p>A hint of panic appeared in my heart, but I suppressed it. I hadn’t used any magic during the last several minutes, so she either misunderstood something, or something finally clicked about my previous activities. If it was the latter, it would have been rather inconvenient, but it didn’t seem likely. I decided to probe her first before committing to a position. “What do you mean, sweetie?” I asked lazily. </p><p>“You … magic…” she gasped as she tried to control her breathing. “I’m feeling different. It must be magic.” </p><p>I chuckled when I realized what she was talking about. “Thanks for the compliment, sweetie,” I said with a large smile, only for her to look even more confused. “Have you never had an orgasm before?” I asked. </p><p>“I…” she murmured. “No…” she said, letting her words linger, while my smile widened even more. </p><p>“You’re welcome,” I said smugly, even though I couldn’t help but feel astonished about just how sheltered she was. I know she had no experience with a boy —or a night of mutual assistance with a girl— but the fact that she hadn’t masturbated before was a surprise. I took a note to bring that up later. Watching her fumble as she tried to pleasure herself would no doubt be a spectacular show. “What you experienced is the reason why people are obsessed with sex.”</p><p>“So, that’s how people feel every time they…” she said, unable to say sex, which was rather funny considering her tits were out, covered with hickeys.  </p><p>“Well, not every time,” I answered. “At the risk of blowing my own horn, not every male is capable of helping a woman experiencing this peak. Certainly not every time.” She was unable to reply to that, still trying to process what had happened. “Honey, why don’t you continue working while you rest. I certainly don’t want to be interrupted halfway again. I don’t think I can handle waiting for a whole night this time.” Especially since there was no guarantee that Emma would pay another visit to my poor abode. </p><p>“Okay,” she said as she leaned forward, her tits dangling forward beautifully while she reached for my shaft. “Not like that,” I warned her, and she looked confused. “I want you to use your tits,” I said. There was no chance that I would miss a titjob opportunity from her spectacular breasts. </p><p>It was proof of the progress we made —and possibly the still-present haze from the orgasm that she barely said anything when she leaned forward obediently and wrapped my shaft in the soft embrace of her breasts, immediately starting to move up and down. I said nothing as I leaned against the cold wall, enjoying the delicious massage of her tits, simultaneously amused by her firmly-shut eyes while her hands pressed against her breasts from both sides, tightening her grip. </p><p>“We need some lubrication,” I reminded her, which was enough for her to open her mouth. She loosened her grip, but I interjected. “Keep your hands still,” I ordered, not bothering to modulate my orders. She looked at me questioningly. “Spit on it directly,” I reminded her. “It’s not far away from your lips, after all,” I added, reminding her that the crown of my shaft was just inches away from her beautiful lips. I was tempted to ask for a small kiss, but I managed to hold myself back. It might be too much for her even now. </p><p>She stilled as she tried to process my request, once again amusing me with her selective shyness. Apparently, spitting on my cock was something more scandalous than giving me a titjob. She looked at me pitifully, but it found no purchase, only seeing a demand for obedience. She closed her eyes even as she dipped her head, trying to hide her lips with the angle before spitting on my shaft a couple of times, lubricating it generously. “Is this okay?” she asked even as she moved once more. </p><p>“Good enough,” I said with a chuckle. “If you don’t want to do that, don’t forget to bring some massage oil the next time,” I reminded her. She nodded, taking the mention of a next time with stride, something I was very happy with. </p><p>Since she was being such a good sport, I decided to give her another small gift. Once again I started massaging her breasts with my magic, this time the effect even more pronounced. I was willing to bet that between the sensation she was getting from my shaft and her own squeezing, she wouldn’t be able to distinguish the external influence, especially with her jumble of emotions taking a big toll on her. </p><p>Regardless, I started slow, letting my magical touch caress her breasts softly, focusing on her rock-hard nipples. She bit her lips desperately, but she was helpless against the reflection of the moans on her eyes even if she managed to control her mouth. Even the latter didn’t survive for long, breaching her hurried attempts to barricade, echoing against the walls once more, focusing more and more on the moment. Her own growing arousal ruined her attention even more, which got even worse once another orgasm hit her, leaving her shuddering. </p><p>Trying to ride the euphoria of her own climax was a good reason why she once again missed the signs of my explosion, this time directly against her face, corrupting her beauty with my spunk, which somehow made her even sexier. She was too shocked to move, frozen, unable to process the rush of emotions mixing with the aftermath of an orgasm while I continued to cover her face with my seed. </p><p>As I looked at her, there was only one question in my mind. What should I do next? </p>
