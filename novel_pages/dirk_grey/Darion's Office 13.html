        <p>“Good, now you should be ready,” he said, and Lily found herself trembling in fear … and anticipation. She didn’t know how much time had passed … just seconds, or maybe hours. </p><p>Either way, she was too wet to argue against his point. She was ready… Though, that readiness didn’t help against his nonchalance, or the fact that he once again flipped her like a toy. “Wait, we should in —“ she started, only to be interrupted by a moan.</p><p>“No, I should be inside, and that’s enough,” he said. A horrible pun, Lily thought. Unfortunately, her lips were busy with other things, like moaning desperately as he slid inside mercilessly, pulling her hair. And, unlike her past boyfriends, he wasn’t very careful avoiding hurting her as he pulled her hair. They did so, because they watched a porn movie. </p><p>Darion did it, because he owned her… </p><p>She said nothing, so he continued to push further, disappearing deep inside her, each push making her tits dangle freely. </p><p>“Too … much,” she gasped, which was the extent of that. </p><p>“Could you repeat that, please,” he said even as he sank deeper into her. “I didn’t think I heard you correctly. </p><p>“I said-” Lily started, but her words cut halfway once more as he pushed in hard, testing her limits. </p><p>“Good, nothing important, then,” he flipped her and she found herself sideways. He held her hands, harder than the handcuffs she once wore as a prank, telling her that she had no chance of getting away. It was a good thing that she had no intention of doing so in the first place… “For a moment, I thought that you were unhappy with our arrangement. If that’s the case, I can always walk away…” </p><p>“Yes, arrangement,” Lily muttered, trying to remember what exactly that arrangement was. Unfortunately, she was having significant trouble as she tried to remember what exactly was that arrangement. The monster that was buried in her was enough to steal her thoughts about that subject. “All for it.” </p><p>“Good,” he answered. “For a moment, I thought that you were actually enjoying it. It would be against our deal.” </p><p>“Of — course — not,” Lily managed to answer, each hit interrupted by a loud moan that gave her true feelings about the issue. </p><p>“Good, then you’re going to hate this a lot,” he said before he flipped her once more, this time her leg ended up on his shoulder, helpless and immobile. She shivered helplessly. </p><p>But she didn’t answer, not that she needed to. Her moans were all he needed as he drilled into her with the attitude of a jackhammer, giving her a new taste of dominance and desire, her insides wet enough to be magical. </p><p>A yelp escaped her mouth as he pushed her leg up, but even that only last for a moment, showing she was more flexible than she had first thought. She felt herself relaxing as they changed position, and was about to bring her leg down, when he spoke. “Keep it like that,” he ordered before she could lower her leg, unwilling. </p><p>She just followed his command, even though his fingers around her ankle were barely helping, each push making her tremble wildly… </p><p>“Good girl,” he whispered even as he slid in and out mercilessly, another minute that was enough to drive her crazy. Only when he flipped her once more and pulled down, she was able to remember what was going on. </p><p>“Mary—“ she gasped, which was all she was able to say before he leaned and captured her lips…</p><p>He kissed like he fucked, hard and mercilessly like he was conducting war, but everywhere he invaded filling with desire and pleasure. </p><p>“Well, you must work hard if you want to finish before she comes,” he said as he changed his position once more, this time laying on his back, and for once, he didn’t drag her with her. </p><p>But the inviting nature of his shining shaft was impossible to reject, so she didn’t lose a moment before climbing on his lap, for once, taking control. </p><p>She would show him how that was done… She climbed on his lap, her hips dancing even as her moans rapidly climbed to an overwhelming level…</p><p>Then, a voice interrupted her. “Holy hell, what’s going on.”  </p><p>It was Mary.</p><p>***</p><p>Mary was rather concerned as she took a turn, as she had never heard her friend shouting that loudly. She didn’t run, as it was clear those were pained cries, but she didn’t know what was… The only thing they sounded like. </p><p>No, that’s unbelievable, Mary convinced herself even as she took that turn — only to freeze as she came to the sight of her friend being desperately fucked. Not for a moment, Mary doubted her eyes. For once, they were just a yard away from her. Also, with her friend’s body bent backward and her hands on the floor like she was trying to complete a particularly difficult yoga pose, it was hardly the most difficult position to understand what was going on. </p><p>“Holy hell, what’s going on,” she found herself gasping after watching a moment…</p><p>“You’re a clever girl, why don’t you take a guess,” Lily’s bodyguard answered, his voice calm like he wasn’t just drilling her bestie like a jackhammer. “I’m sure you can guess if I give you three chances…” </p><p>Initially, Mary had been planning to leave once she truly processed what was going on — and maybe, made sure to capture enough of the event to keep her warm during difficult winter nights — but his mocking voice made her decide her mind. </p><p>It was a challenge, and Mary didn’t back away from challenges. </p><p>Even if the challenge looked impossible, if Lily could handle it, so could she.</p><p>“Let me guess, you’re helping her do yoga,” Mary answered with a chuckle. </p><p>“Wrong,” he answered, even cheekier. “One chance lost. Another attempt?” </p><p>“I don’t know, don’t I have a joker,” she said. </p><p>“Hey—“ Lily shouted, but Mary ignored her, fascinated by the way his lips curled in a smirk as he looked at her, somehow fascinating even with … what he was doing. </p><p>“Hmm, you have a good point,” he said as he stood up. Which might have helped, if he didn’t lift Lily with him as he did so, buried deep in her. “How about that, red, do you think it’s enough as a joker?” </p><p>“S-shut up,” Lily gasped before turning to look at Mary. “Leave — now,” she gasped. Mary just smirked. As she would listen to anything Lily said at this moment.  </p><p>“Oh, really, you’re kicking me from my own garden,” Mary chuckled as she took a step forward. Well, technically it wasn’t her garden as she was just an exchange student, but it was close enough… She took a step forward. “Still, I’m having trouble identifying it. Maybe another joker?” </p><p>“Unfortunately we’re fresh out. Unless you can pay, of course?” </p><p>“Well, how about this as payment?” Mary said as she got rid of her top, displaying as well as she could manage as she closed in. “Do you think this is enough?” </p><p>“Good, come and get a better view,” he said. </p><p>“Mary, go away or I—“ Lily started, which only lasted until she put her arm on Lily’s shoulder and pushed down, forcing her bestie to take even more of his monster. Her moans showed that it worked just as it was intended. </p><p>“Still, maybe another joker,” he said as he flipped Lily down, forcing her to bend over, not stopping his merciless assault even for a  moment. Lily definitely appreciated that if her moans were any indicator… </p><p> Mary walked behind him, wrapping her hands around his waist, enjoying the way his hips moved, each push mercilessly and explosive. He felt like a cannon, attacking again and again.</p><p>“Oh, almost,” she whispered throatily, in a way that could be impossible to be understood as anything but an invitation. “But, just to make sure, maybe you should show it directly…”</p>
