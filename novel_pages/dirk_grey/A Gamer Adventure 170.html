        <p>I put my finger on one of the emerald horns that appeared on her head, enjoying their texture. “Hmm, they are surprisingly smooth,” I said, only for her to blush even more than I had been fingering her earlier, though it lacked the carnal aura her earlier blush carried. </p><p>I had a sudden inspiration. “How shameful, losing control of your transformation just because of a little massage,” I murmured. Her intensifying blush suggested that I hit the nail on the head. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I realized I had managed to identify the specific source of her shame due to the intensity of her blush. I was getting really, really good on the subject. </p><p>“Such a shame,” I murmured as I caressed her horns. “They are such beautiful accessories of you, why would you feel ashamed of them?” </p><p>“I’m not … ashamed of them,” she managed to murmur, her breathing still quick, showing that she was having trouble handling the invasion of pleasure. “It’s about maintaining my transformation. Partial transformation shows … weakness.” </p><p>I chuckled. “You don’t need to worry about showing weakness while you’re with me, mistress,” I said with a chuckle even as I grabbed both of them. “I’m just a lowly servant, after all. I can’t even imagine commenting on your power and performance.” Even in her state, still lying on top of the table, that earned an angry gaze, and she opened her mouth to answer. </p><p>Too bad that I had no intention of allowing her to succeed. </p><p>I pushed my hips forward, filling her mouth with my shaft even as I grabbed her horns. “And why would you hate them. Look just how convenient they are,” I said as I used them as leverage. And just in case she was dissatisfied, I used our carnal connection to deliver even more mana to her. </p><p>[-1290 Mana]</p><p>Facing a flood she hadn’t experienced, at least from me, the moan she let out was simply spectacular. Coupled with the pleasure she was feeling it immediately pushed her to the next stage, her angry gasps once again underlined with moans. </p><p>And as my shaft started to invade deeper into her throat, her gasps interrupted by her beautiful gagging, I couldn’t help but smirk. While her attempts to make me pay back had been amusing, it would be a lie to say they hadn’t been annoying at any point. Especially the last time, when she interrupted my fun just as the things with Oeyne were starting to warm up. </p><p>Luckily, she was nice enough to compensate for it, I thought even as I pushed my hips forward. </p><p>“Try to wrap your lips around it tighter,” I suggested, and much to my joy, as I continued to pump, her lips tightened around my girth, making it more entertaining as I continued to push forward. </p><p>Her blush started to get more and more intense, a testament to the impact of pleasure on her hedonistic nature. Amusingly, however, her shock also suggested it was an area of pleasure she seldom indulged — if any. Otherwise, she would have reacted to my advances more smoothly. </p><p>I pulled back after an extended merciless pumping, allowing her to catch her breath, but when I took a step to the side, she surprised me with a moan of disappointment. “It’s … finished?” she asked, ready to protest despite the roughness of the treatment she had been receiving, though it was followed by shock as she realized the nature of her own reaction.  </p><p>How very delicious. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said even as I put my hand on her shoulder. “Sweetie, you have a lot of work to do,” I said as I pulled her off the table, her short stature making it very easy to lift her. Although, with my strength, I could probably try to lift it. </p><p>A trial for a later time, I decided even as I grabbed her shoulder and forced her to her knees, not trying particularly hard to limit the impact. I trusted a dragon to handle her knees hitting the floor easily. </p><p>It turned out that I was wrong. “Ouch,” she exclaimed, her pain clear. “Be careful!” </p><p>“Sorry, your dragoness,” I said even as I grabbed her horns once more, the somewhat taboo nature of that act enough to silence her until I could invade her mouth once more. Though, her lack of resistance to pain was surprising. I had watched her fighting against several people without the slightest hint of discomfort even when she was on the edge of death. </p><p>Though, on second thought, maybe her forms differed not only in looks but also in terms of physical resistance. Such a detail certainly needed to be used more, I decided as I roused my mana once more, some of it for her to be delivered through my shaft, the rest of it creating a nice, magical chain to wrap around her arms, pinning them in place. </p><p>[-1645 Mana]</p><p>The moment the chains wrapped around her arms, her eyes widened in protest. Unfortunately, her mouth was adequately filled, preventing her from speaking about it. </p><p>Her magic stirred, trying to dispel her bindings, but our bodies were too close, and with my mana inside her, breaking her attempts was trivial. </p><p>Or, it was supposed to be trivial, I thought even as I realized I had been forced to use more mana than necessary to establish the task, essentially bullying her spell with my excessive mana. </p><p>I continued pumping into her beautiful mouth even as I let my mind wander about the reason for the impact difference. Luckily, she tried to flare her magic several more times until she was discouraged by the repeated failures, allowing me to get a better understanding of the nature of her spell. </p><p>It was the complexity of her mana patterns, I decided. Just like the dress she had conjured earlier, her spell had been based on a much more complicated structure. Even less stable considering it was supposed to be an instant spell. </p><p>But once again, it lacked the instinctual understanding I had been enjoying with any other spell, making it significantly harder to truly understand. I needed a comprehensive lesson from her. </p><p>Naturally, it was a task for a different time. </p><p>Instead, I suppressed her magic as I tightened my grip around her horns once more, pulling her forward harshly. Her beautiful tits pressed against my thighs as my shaft invaded her throat, her emerald hair dangling freely. </p><p>Her head bobbed beautifully under my rough treatment, her moans getting more and more intense even with the obstruction in her throat. Yet, she didn’t lose anything from her enthusiasm as she swallowed more of my shaft, even with her arms tied behind her back. </p><p>Pity, I thought. I liked when she was getting angrier, so I stopped grabbing one of her horns and slapped her breast, only to flare angrily. </p><p>“Hey,” she gasped when I pulled back. “What are you doing?” </p><p>“Sorry, mistress,” I said with a chuckle. “But they are too tempting. Maybe you should make them smaller.” </p><p>“I can’t,” she said in a matter-of-fact tone, confirming my guesses about whether her human form was fixed, or it was something she had created based on her mind. </p><p>“Then you’re going to suffer through it,” I said even as I slapped her breasts once more even as I filled her mouth once more. Then, I grabbed her tits, squeezing her nipple, which made her moans even more intense. </p><p>Another flood of mana was her reward. </p><p>[-480 Mana]</p><p>It proved to be a good decision, as the reward she received, along with the additional mana I used to wrap around my fingers, worked wonders to calm her down even with my disrespectful actions. </p><p>Though, as the treatment lengthened, she started tapping my head, asking for me to pull back. “You didn’t earn it yet,” I said to her as I quickened my assault, enjoying the tightness of her throat. “But don’t worry, you will soon,” I added. </p><p>A cute moan and an angry glare was my answer. </p><p>It was as good as a sign as any to ask me to move faster. I grabbed her beautiful horns, invading her throat, again and again, smirking in satisfaction at the effectiveness of my strategy while the pleasure slowly invaded her hedonistic being. </p><p>And when she started moving in response, pushing forward along with me to make my pushes even more impactful in her own volition. Even her hips started to shake reflexively,  tempting me to escalate my services to a point I hadn’t been planning to bring. Not this quickly, at least. </p><p>Her throat tightened around my shaft, making me focus on the present rather than trying to plan the next steps. Soon, the pleasure become unbearable, and I exploded into her throat, filling it with my seed. </p><p>And, since I was such a kind, helpful servant, my explosion was laced with a lot of mana. </p><p>[-1840 Mana]</p><p>Her moans as she tried to swallow every single bit of my seed, licking her lips to make sure nothing had gone to waste, was simply beautiful. “Such a hungry mistress,” I said with a chuckle as I lifted her in a bridal hold, walking toward the bed in the corner. </p><p>Yet, trembling with pleasure, the only thing she was able to do was to send an angry glare. </p><p>It was a good time to interrogate her. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 4820 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
