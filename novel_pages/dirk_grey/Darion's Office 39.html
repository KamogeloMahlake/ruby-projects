        <title>Darion's Office 39</title>

        <p>Janet was far happier than she expected herself to be when she responded to Darion’s summons earlier. When he bent her over Mia’s desk, Janet was afraid of the consequences. Unlike the last time they used Mia’s office for illicit purposes, Mia could have arrived any moment. </p><p>Darion had dismissed the risk as nothing, leading her to believe that he knew Mia would be late or something. She might have questioned him further, but two things stopped her. First, she assumed that the situation was just as risky for Darion, making her accept his judgment call.</p><p>The second reason was simpler. It was right then he pushed his considerable length into her throat, preventing her from speaking. As far as distractions went, that had been a very effective one. </p><p>Then, right before she climaxed, the door opened, and Mia darted in, angrier than Janet had ever seen her. At that point, Janet was absolutely sure that her career was over, and she would end up blacklisted … Mia wasn’t famous for her mercy. </p><p>Ten minutes after that, Janet realized that Mia was supposed to be famous for something else. “Damn, boss. Your tongue is amazing. I would have done my best to actually seduce you if I knew that,” she said, though she had to pause a few times. </p><p>It was hard to deliver long sentences as Darion invaded her from behind. </p><p>Underneath, she could feel Mia shiver in anger. “I’ll make you pay,” she growled. </p><p>Janet chuckled. “Only if Darion lets you, boss.” She knew that it was risky to tease her like that. Whatever reason that was making her follow Darion’s order, it wasn’t exactly a golden bullet that would protect her forever. </p><p>Yet, as she got licked while she got penetrated from behind, it was significantly more difficult to actually care about the risks. </p><p>“You’re talking too much,” Darion said as he flipped her, allowing Mia to crawl away. Janet was sure that Mia would use the opportunity to retreat, but to her shock, Mia just adjusted her position before starting to lick again, this time aiming his balls. </p><p>And, Darion didn’t even need to order. It looked like his control over their boss was even stronger than she had first assumed. A fascinating detail. “You’re doing amazing, boss—“ she mocked again, unable to resist the temptation, only to receive another spank. </p><p>“You pushed your luck too much, let’s change the pose,” he said, and Janet once again found herself being lifted while her boss changed her position. This time, she ended up on all fours, right in front of her boss. </p><p>“Lick,” he ordered. Helpless, Janet followed, the taste of her boss filling her mouth. Not exactly a great hardship, considering he continued to drill from behind. “Now, apologize.” </p><p>Janet whimpered. </p><p>“I … I’m sorry, boss. I was just … I lost myself,“ she whispered. </p><p>“Not bad,” Darion said as they changed position once again. “Now, start working.” </p><p>“Yes, Janet, start working,” Mia teased as she adjusted his shaft under her. “Not that you like to do very much…” Janet couldn’t help but blush at the snide voice. She had never seen Mia being subtly snide, as she was usually far more aggressive. It seemed that she was equally effective in that as well. “You like this, don’t you?” she followed. </p><p>Janet shivered. “I …” she started, which was all she was able to say before Darion interrupted her with another flip, and she landed on her side, her head leaning against Mia’s naked tits … which was perfect enough to be annoying. It was certainly not the way she expected the day to go, but as Darion invaded her wetness again and again, she didn’t feel like complaining. </p><p>“Very good, Janet. It’s good that you can do at least one job properly,” Mia said, her voice domineering once more. </p><p>Janet whimpered as she looked at Darion, hoping that, at least, he would try to teach Mia a lesson. “Well, I would intervene, but from the way you tightened around me, it’s clear you are loving it when she mocks you,” he said. </p><p>“No I don’t,” Janet said, but unfortunately, she didn’t sound convincing even to herself. </p><p>“Sure you don’t,” Mia mocked her, and Janet tightened even more. “Now, put your lying mouth to a better use.” </p><p>Janet followed her order, lost in pleasure. It had been fun to be superior to Mia even for a fleeting moment. </p><p>She abandoned herself to pleasure.</p>
