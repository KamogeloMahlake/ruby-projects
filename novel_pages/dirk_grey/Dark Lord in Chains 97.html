        <p>I let the kiss extend, and it wasn’t only the great pleasure it had given me that made me keep my lips in place. </p><p>No, I used our closeness to let my magic slip into hers, getting a comprehensive diagnostic on her body — a process that had gone much better than I expected thanks to the nature of our connection, allowing my mana to slip into her body with the same ease her own mana did. </p><p>Giving me a perfect view of her current state. </p><p>And the diagnostic was … she was well. Better than well, even, as I expected some kind of damage left by the mana that went feral on her. However, on the contrary, there was not even the slightest damage in her body left as an after-effect. </p><p>Which was hard to believe, as if I experienced a similar loss of control with a spell, the consequences would range from temporary loss of my casting ability … to permanent loss of … well, my life. </p><p>On the contrary, not only she didn’t have even the slightest hint of damage, but she was actually showing signs of powering up. </p><p>Just another sign of the extraordinary, logic-defying nature of the living fire. </p><p>What an interesting phenomenon, I decided as I stopped diagnosing, confirming there was no magical reason for her not to repeat. </p><p>However, I didn’t pull back from the kiss, instead letting my hands dance over her body. I was horny — as there was a limit for how long I could resist her shimmering naked body while she spent the better part of the last half an hour sitting on my lap — but it wasn’t the reason for that. </p><p>No, my thoughts were simpler. Since our ‘closeness’ was the reason she was able to break the block she was suffering in the first place, there was no harm in a repeat before another attempt. </p><p>She wrapped her legs around my waist as I pushed her toward the nearest tree. Though whether she was in the same mind for the benefits of ‘exercising’ before another transformation attempt, or she just wanted some pleasure was doubtful. </p><p>I extended a kiss for a long time, and when I pulled back, she was gasping for air, her skin glistening with fire once more.</p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but glimpse at the tree behind us, expecting it to already smolder. Yet, the tree was growing, at a noticeable speed, its leaves getting greener. While, flowers were appearing under her feet.</p><p>Showing that, I was misunderstanding the capabilities of the living fire even now. </p><p>Yet, even a part of my mind was busy with the theoretical implications of it, I let my hand slide down, running down her breasts and onto her thighs before delving inside her wetness. </p><p>Her moan was spectacular even as her hand landed on my body, quickly working on my remaining items of clothing to make me match her in nudity. </p><p>As a reward, I pushed my hips forward, replacing my fingers with a different part of my anatomy, earning a beautiful moan as a reward in the process. It was a quick, reckless shove, but the noises rising from her showed she had no problem with the rapid invasion. </p><p>Her wetness was quick to accommodate my girth as I let my hips move recklessly, my hands on her shoulders, pinning her against the tree. Her wings started to flicker as the pleasure invaded her body, growing larger to touch the nearby trees, the forest gaining a new lease of life. </p><p>I was glad for our connection, as, without it, I would have retreated, fearing a sudden transformation. Instead, I enjoyed her supernatural warmth as I slammed inside her again and again, with no pause between beats.</p><p>“Harder,” she moaned, showing her lack of dissatisfaction with my roughness. Her tits jiggled under my reckless assault, which worked wonders to raise my desire to match hers. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I made a gesture, and two chains rose from the ground and wrapped around her arms, pinning her against the tree. My hips continued their reckless assault while I leaned down, biting her breasts hard enough to leave a mark. </p><p>Interestingly, her great healing factor didn’t immediately cure the mark I left on her skin, leaving it to contrast against her perfectly pale skin, even as the flame dancing on her skin touched my tongue, tickling gently.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!” she moaned, her eyes firmly shut as she enjoyed the assault, even as I pushed myself to the limit, thrusting so fast that she failed to catch her breath between her cries. </p><p>"I'm cumming," she managed to mutter, wasting the precious air she managed to steal between her moans, but I didn’t take that as a sign to slow down. Instead, I brought my teeth around her nipple, the sudden jolt of pain enough to push her over the edge. </p><p>She tightened around me even as her flames intensified, but I didn’t stop the assault even for a moment, wanting to push her to a delirium hard enough for her to forget herself. </p><p>I had a feeling that, she would have better success in that unique place between pleasure and unconsciousness, and if not, I could always block her mana again. </p><p>When she opened her eyes, her gaze was blank with pleasure as she looked at the sky, her moans endless. </p><p>The rapid invasion of her body continued as her pleasure grew to a new stage, each second teaching her a new meaning of ecstasy. Her wings of flame grew bigger, even more, majestic than her transformation attempt like she was using pleasure as fuel. </p><p>Her skin was long covered with flames, but they were getting more and more intense as well. Not to the point, it created the silhouette of a bird, but still majestic, almost like she was halfway in transforming.</p><p>It confirmed that my strategy was the correct one, especially since her face lacked the panic and alarm that she had during her last attempt that forced me to abort it. </p><p>I kept my focus on her face to catch any signs of alarm, afraid that I might push her too much for my own great pleasure. </p><p>Especially since she wasn’t the only one benefiting from it. As we continued, the connection between us started to get stronger, with a corresponding increase in my reserves. Just another few percent, but in my situation, it was still a miracle. </p><p>The concrete sense of getting stronger pushed my own pleasure even further, dangerously close to an explosion. I squeezed my teeth to suppress the sensation, doing my best to last until Cinder could reach a second climax.</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I noticed Isolde getting closer once more, but this time, her tenseness was more about the intense jealousy she was feeling rather than fear about unknown magic. A point to be addressed, but not right at the moment, not when Cinder was occupying my full attention.  </p><p>I pushed in even more aggressively, her moans and her blank expression showing she wasn’t too far away from a second climax, allowing me to relax in terms of my own limits. Soon, I exploded inside her, her moans growing beautifully in the process.  </p><p>“Now, transform,” I ordered even as I exploded into her, triggering another climax. She looked at me blankly, right at the edge of unconsciousness, but that didn’t prevent a ghost of a huge bird from coalescing around her as I injected the last drop inside her.</p><p>I pulled — several steps, just in case — and started to create a ward just like the last time to block the explosion in case she lost control again, and I needed to intervene. </p><p>Isolde didn’t trust magic, but between standing behind it and trusting Cinder’s wild transformation, there was no question about which one was more reliable. </p><p>“Beautiful, right,” I said as I watched the flames gather around Cinder, but I grabbed Isolde’s waist and pulled her in front of me, my hand slipping into her pants. “Not as beautiful as your wetness, of course, beautiful,” I whispered into her ear, chuckling. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she whispered, but that didn’t help her to contain her moan.</p><p>I chuckled, amused by her prickly exterior, but even as I teased her, my attention was on Cinder, the flames around her getting more and more … real, even though it was not the best term. </p><p>Then suddenly, at one point, she stopped being a beautiful woman surrounded by flames, and actually become a bird of flame, the power and heat radiating, even though that flame only made the surrounding plants grow more and more. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I murmured even as I started casting more and more wards while she took flight, but my target was the wards surrounding the meadow. They were not geared to suppress such a spectacular view, forcing me to reinforce them. </p><p>Yet, even as I did so, I focused on Cinder, radiating a power of majesty that made a mockery of her name. </p><p>Fascinating…</p>
