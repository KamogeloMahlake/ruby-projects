        <p>Hi everyone, </p><p>I have a big question about the fate of A Gamer Adventure, and how it should be continued. </p><p>Essentially, we have two options. </p><p>1- I'll slowly start to wrap things up, and do my best to finish the story (which will still probably take somewhere <strong>like 50-100 chapters</strong>, so it's not exactly an immediate final) </p><p>2- I'll move the story to a whole new arc, which will go much deeper on the story aspects such as Gods and their nature. In this case, we would be probably talking about at least another 200 chapters, maybe even more. </p><p>To quote the Grail Knight, <em>choose wisely. </em></p><p>(If the first option wins, which story would replace A Gamer Adventure is another question that we will answer as that date draws closer.) </p>
