        <p>As I left the recreational room behind, I was in a weird mood, one that was a mixture of anger, desire, and frustration.</p><p>Anger was rather understandable, as their appearance had ruined a ploy I was struggling to put together for almost a year, and what had just happened was certainly not enough to compensate for that great crime.</p><p>Even a woman ass amazing as Carly.</p><p>The desire and frustration, on the other hand, were easier to understand, especially considering I had to cut that amazing experience short halfway, leaving me an uncomfortable hard-on, enough to strain even my loose exercise shorts to the limit.</p><p>I wanted nothing more than to go back to my room and finish the job. I might lack any porn after that idiotic joke, but after what happened during the last several minutes, that was not something I was in particular need.</p><p>Yet, I hit a little snag before I could arrive at my room. I came across Maria, who just finished her shower, and walking to her room. “Someone is happy to see me,” she said with a beautiful, crystal chuckle as she glanced down, a teasing smirk appearing on her face, one that conveyed that she was more than happy with seeing that. “Should I assume you were using the broken door to your benefit? How naughty,”</p><p>It was clear that her tone of seduction was completely artificial, filled with a smug superiority more than anything. Which was why it annoyed me immensely to realize it still worked on me, pushing the stirring inside me.</p><p>I looked at her, doing my best to look uncaring. I didn’t say anything, because I was absolutely sure that, if I did something like that, I would have fallen apart, stammering.</p><p>Moreover, I certainly didn’t want to show her just how effective her subtle teasing was, especially when she was just wearing a bathrobe after her lengthy shower — one that was significantly looser than the time she was going to the bath, her glistening caramel cleavage a thing of wonders.</p><p>Luckily, before she could realize just how amazingly effective her seduction trick was on me, the door to the recreational room opened and Carly stepped out, only to freeze as our gazes turned to her then dashed back.</p><p>“Well, let’s just say your friends like to leave things halfway,” I said, glad that her naked body, along with the clear bruises on her breasts and her ass was more than enough to make further explanation unnecessary. “She’s such a tease,” I said.</p><p>“Oh, she certainly is,” Maria answered, though I didn’t miss the sudden shift in her tone. Earlier, her tone was soft and seductive, yet ultimately fake enough that even I could notice. The sudden flare of anger that followed my dismissive words — supported by Carly’s unintentional show — invading her beautiful chocolate gaze, on the other hand, was certainly not fake.</p><p>Especially since it soon turned into a smoldering gaze as she glanced at my arms and shoulders, taking a measure of the muscles — muscles that I only cultivated due to sheer boredom of living in the middle of nowhere, lacking even a proper Internet connection.</p><p>Apparently, the situation Carly’s nudity suggested made her revisit her impression.</p><p>“Yes, teasing is certainly a bad habit,” she whispered as she took a step forward, passing me. The corridor was not particularly large, but still, there was more than enough space for her to pass unimpeded. Yet, as she turned her back and passed, she was unnecessarily close to me, her amazing, world-famous booty rubbed against my shaft.</p><p>Rather slowly as well, which didn’t help the frustration I was feeling in the slightest. Luckily, to pull that trick, she needed to turn her back, meaning she missed the way I was biting my lips to restrain my reaction.</p><p>Or my desire to push her against the wall and teach her the risks of teasing a man who was already on the edge.</p><p>It was a close call, but not only I was able to suppress that desire, but also I managed to hide the amazing feeling of dry-humping against arguably the most famous ass of the twenty-first century.</p><p>“Sorry about that, the corridor is a bit small,” she started as she turned to look at me, only to be greeted by a casual nod and shake. It took all I had not to peek at her cleavage, one that was significantly enhanced due to her earlier trick — though it was doubtful whether it was intentional or accidental.</p><p>Either way, she made no move to fix it, showing she had a little problem with it. To make things worse, her closeness and our height difference enhanced the impact of her cleavage even more, filling me with an amazing temptation.</p><p>Luckily, after being tempted by an even more beautiful one moment ago, I managed to find the strength to keep my gaze locked on her eyes.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said, trying to hide just how hard it was to hide my reaction. Luckily, she was too busy with the anger that awakened by being dismissed to care whether my dismissal was genuine or barely held together fiction. “But try to use less water during showers. There’s a chance that the storm might last longer than two weeks, and we don’t want to be restricted in terms of resources.”</p><p>“R-really,” she said, though, the speed of her earlier anger disappeared, replaced by pure terror, thick enough to devour anything else. “T-they told me that it’ll only last a week. And it doesn’t sound particularly loud.”</p><p>I chuckled, more than happy with the change in attitude, as, despite the great visual interest their appearance brought to lighten up the solitude I was suffering, it was still not a good trade-off for ruining the opportunity I was gunning for the last year.</p><p>She was clearly afraid of the storm, and I had no problems stroking that fear. “Oh, yeah, this is just a start,” I said as I pointed at the walls, getting her attention to the subtle yet constant noise of the wind. “And it’s only this light because of the isolation, but it’s at capacity. It’ll get louder once the storm really starts.”</p><p>Which was not entirely true. The storm might get a touch stronger, but it was already at full power. However, her fear gave me a chance to make her pay, and I had no intention to miss that opportunity.</p><p>There were ways to compromise the sound insulation of the outpost — something I knew due to the horrible sense of humor the old German professor, deliberately removed one of the noise-canceling tiles in one of the storage units, creating a horrible noise without actually placing cold.</p><p>Who knew his annoying tricks would come useful one day.</p><p>“Oh, really,” she said. “Do you have any sleeping pills here, then?” she asked, her voice trembling with sheer terror at the thought of a stronger storm. To her credit, she managed to keep it subtle enough that I would have missed it if I hadn’t been looking for it deliberately.</p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I answered. “This is a scientific outpost, and the number and types of medicine they allow here are strictly limited. And pills with addiction risks are definitely now allowed.”</p><p>Amusingly, that was even true.</p><p>“Good, good, good,” she said, though the constant repetition showed just how badly she was reacting to the possibility. With fear infecting her tone, she dashed away, leaving me to watch her beautiful disappearance.</p><p>She slammed her door, and I leaned against the wall, breathing hard, finally letting the impact of her little show display. Discounting her panicked reaction to the storm, Maria was much harder to handle than Carly, whose submissiveness gave me a chance to modulate my actions whenever I felt overwhelmed.</p><p>On the contrary, Maria wielded her sexiness like a sword, elegant and deadly at the same time, a few seconds of discussion already working wonders to break my defenses.</p><p>As I leaned against the wall, breathing hard, the door of the recreational room opened once more, revealing Carly once more. Though this time, she was not naked, holding a pillow in front of her, one helped her to cover her breasts.</p><p>It wasn’t enough to prevent her blush when she saw me, of course, but it was still enough to prevent her retreat. Yet, she was even more hesitant than before, her accidental reveal weakening her already weakened will once more.</p><p>“S-she’s gone,” she stammered.</p><p>“Yes, you can use the shower,” I answered as I gestured for her to walk closer. “And drop the pillow, you look ridiculous,” I answered, once again channeling a careless dismissal, one that worked wonders on her.</p><p>Her eyes widened at the order, but that didn’t prevent the flick of her wrist as she threw the pillow away, leaving her beautiful chest naked. And this time, she didn’t cover them as she walked toward me, every step creating a beautiful ripple, one that tempted me for much more.</p><p>Her hesitancy didn’t prevent her hips from shaking attractively at each step, her habits as a model show, elevating her already amazing beauty to the next level. And the existence of pink marks on her body, evidencing my earlier touch, pushed the sexiness she was reflecting even more, watering my mouth even more.</p><p>I said nothing as she walked past me, and I pulled to the side, leaving her enough space to walk without touching me if she wanted to.</p><p>Yet, she surprised me, by not only taking that opportunity, but also choosing to stumble just as she passed me, letting her touch linger on my raging arousal for more than necessary, her eyes widening as she got acquainted with the size more accurately than our earlier position.</p><p>Which was certainly nothing to be ashamed of, even though it did make a kind of stereotype of my complexion — one that I had no problems enjoying the benefits of. After all, the subtle discrimination of my heritage hurt my scientific career sufficiency, and a bit of compensation in terms of female fascination was always a nice trade-off.</p><p>She gasped for a moment as her fingers lingered on it, but that lasted only for a second. Then, as if she was trying to compensate for her delay, she dashed to the bathroom, and slammed the door behind her.</p><p>The door didn’t close, which, amusingly, was her own fault.</p><p>Just the way the throbbing of my shaft was.</p><p>One that I decided to make her pay after her latest adventure. I would have let her go if it wasn’t for that trick.</p><p>But with that, she earned another punishment.</p>
