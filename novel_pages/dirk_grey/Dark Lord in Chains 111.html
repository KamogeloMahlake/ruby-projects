        <p>Rewarding Sapphire was an easy decision to make. She played along with my whims for the whole encounter, did her best to take initiative and surrender it as necessary, and most importantly, allowed me to finally teach Valkyrie the true meaning of obedience. </p><p>She certainly earned her reward. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked as I leaned forward. </p><p>“Wait,” Sapphire answered, which surprised me. I watched her as she changed position, which replaced my expression with a smile. Rather than laying next to Valkyrie, Sapphire chose to climb on top of her — who was laying prone — so that her tits pressed against Valkyrie’s back. “In case I need a break,” she explained. </p><p>“T-this is ridiculous,” came a stammer, which didn’t surprise me slightest. Valkyrie seemed to have woken up from her small daze.  </p><p>“Oh, good, you’re still awake,” I answered even as I slipped inside her Queen, earning a frustrated growl from Valkyrie despite her voice telling me she was at the edge of collapse, mixing with Sapphire’s moan of pleasure. </p><p>It was hard to blame her for her frustration considering everything that happened, but not blaming was not the same as showing mercy. </p><p>I impaled Sapphire, earning a beautiful moan. Her condition wasn’t much better compared to Valkyrie, especially after two bets, but she was just determined enough to enjoy her reward. Her mouth parted open, but the only thing that escaped was an endless procession of moans. </p><p>It didn’t help her to control herself when I put my hand on her back, rubbing back and forth along her spine to add a nice contrast to my reckless rush — a little trick she enjoyed immensely — while her breasts, rubbed furiously against Valkyrie’s back with each repeat. </p><p>“What — this is absurd,” Valkyrie managed to stammer. “I’m not a bed!”</p><p>“You’re a knight, sweetie, which means to serve your Queen in whatever capacity she needed. She needs a warrior, you’re a warrior. She needs an assassin, you’re an assassin. And since she seems to be wanting a bed…” I said, barely able to hold back my chuckles. </p><p>Sapphire just continued moaning, showing no intention to interject. Though, even if she did, it would have been difficult to do so with constant pleasure. I knew exactly how to silence her with her own cries. My fingers danced over her spine aggressively, triggering every single sensitive spot I had discovered during long ‘courting’. </p><p>“Too loud,” Valkyrie complained as Sapphire’s moans turned overwhelming, especially since her lips were right above Valkyrie’s ears. She tried to shuffle away, but Sapphire’s arms pinned her from both sides, preventing her from escaping. And, while Valkyrie was normally strong enough to get away, she was too exhausted to push. </p><p>Not to mention, the treason thing, again… </p><p>Sapphire’s moans turned overwhelming as her body started to betray her. “A — second,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>“Good—“ Valkyrie started, but she was interrupted quickly when Sapphire didn’t stand up, but just changed her position, so that their backs were pressing against each other. When I slid inside Sapphire once more, her legs clamped around my waist tight, losing herself in pleasure, this time her face visible, contorted with pleasure. </p><p>Valkyrie tried to move from underneath her, but she found herself unable to move away, pinned uncomfortably. Though, not too uncomfortably, as Sapphire’s beautiful curves were soft enough to make it a comfortable experience. </p><p>And, I doubted her conviction to get away was particularly strong. </p><p>“It’s unfair,” she murmured. “Don’t you agree?” </p><p>“I do, but you have to admit, as the loser of the bets, you deserve some challenge,” I chuckled readily, making her blush. Her face might not be visible, but her neck — at least what I could see from Sapphire’s glorious mane — was enough to catch that.  </p><p>“I don’t—” she stammered before I silenced her with a spank.  </p><p>“It’s Sapphire’s reward, so don’t distract her,” I warned her, doing my best to sound stern, even as I wanted nothing more but to chuckle at her attitude. Before tonight, trying to do something like this would have ended in a spectacular disaster. Yet, she just accepted and fell silent. </p><p>She said nothing else, distracted, especially with Sapphire’s moans running constant interference, her usual stern attitude nowhere to be seen. </p><p>A beautiful change, as it would have been tragic if she tried to exert herself while being teased under her naked Queen. She just buried her face in the pillow, trusting Sapphire’s wild blonde hair to hide her from the view. </p><p>Sapphire opened her mouth, like she wanted to contribute, but a strategic push inside her, even deeper than my usual pattern, was enough to temporarily silence her with moans once more. I kept my gaze on Sapphire, ignoring Valkyrie for a moment. </p><p>Sapphire’s beautiful tits, dangling wildly with each push, made that particularly preferable to maintain my attention. I caressed her satin skin, enjoying the way her heart drummed furiously, her being surrendered under my control. </p><p>A beautiful fate for a Queen. Pity, she would stop being the Queen soon … </p><p>And lucky that her replacement was just equally lovely. </p><p>She kept her eyes closed, but that did nothing to contain her seductive smirk. Her legs tightened around my waist telling me even more, showing that she wasn’t too far away from collapse, and it was only the euphoria of the success that was keeping her going. </p><p>“Amazing as always,” I said, enjoying the sudden blush that covered her face as I teased her, one that was entertaining to see, especially in our current position. It gave a certain sense of cuteness to our little dance. Not to mention, it was impressive for her to look cute while being impaled repeatedly while resting on the back of her loyal knight. </p><p>It made her soft skin glow, turning her beauty into an irresistible aura, so irresistible that, I actually decided to check her aura using the Tether, but no mana shenanigans were there. </p><p>Just beauty.  </p><p>“So, any idea about what to do tomorrow. Start the assassination, or continue breaking down your loyal knight?” I asked. </p><p>Sapphire chuckled while Valkyrie groaned, the pillow not enough to bury her voice. </p><p>“I don’t — know,” Sapphire murmured, her voice interrupted by frequent moans. “Despite her near-treason, she worked hard enough to earn a rest day, so maybe we should focus on working. What’s the idea.” </p><p>“Well, assassination is one thing, but since we decided to send that blond moron away to check the North, we should wait until he couldn’t get back to trigger it.” </p><p>“Why? Isn’t it be more convincing if he can return quickly,” Valkyrie asked, interested in the topic despite the situation. </p><p>“No, on the contrary,” I said. “We want to unsettle elves by the assassination. If he was present, elves would use him to poke around. I want them to start fiddling and target the temporary council that makes the decision while Aria stays hidden.” </p><p>“Isn’t setting a council dangerous. They might like power and don’t give back once things calm down.” </p><p>That earned a laugh, and not the erotic kind, but the full-belied, amused kind. I even pulled out of Sapphire as I tried to calm down. “Sweetie, just how long you’re away from the capital that you had forgotten their habits despite your distaste. Of course they’ll like the power and try to keep it. But I have a couple pawns in the council to keep things manageable.”</p><p>“But what if they still don’t.” </p><p>That time, I chuckled. “Sweetie, did you forget what my previous job was or how I climbed the hierarchy. Worst, I pay them a personal visit, and the problem is gone…” </p><p>“Enough,” Sapphire ordered, which was fascinating. As the Queen, she was stopping us from discussing the possible assassination of her nobles, but the only reason she did so was that she was feeling neglected, rather than having any real concerns about the possibility. </p><p>Fascinating indeed. </p><p>But since it was her reward session, I said nothing, and just slipped inside her. The next time she opened her mouth, it was filled with a delicious moan.</p><p>I leaned down to capture her lips in a searing kiss and pressed her down, assisting her journey to the top, even though Valkyrie groaned at the added weight. The way I silenced her pushed her even deeper into the land of pleasure, her cries trying to bypass my lips. </p><p>Normally, at this point, I might have slowed down, keeping her on the edge for some torture, until she begged for a release. However, once again, reward. Instead, I put my hands on her tits, squeezing them mercilessly even as I pulled back from the kiss. </p><p>Her moans exploded, showing she was close to destabilization as an unstable trap ward, moments separated from a spectacular explosion. </p><p> I grabbed her legs and parted them wide, using the angle to invade her depths even more aggressively, drilling her down … well, drilling Valkyrie down the bed, indirectly. Sapphire just moaned, too busy moaning to care about such details, her swollen lips wrapping tightly around my girth. </p><p>I leaned down once more, burying my face between her spectacular breasts, enjoying its expanse with aggressive kisses as the climax hit. </p><p>I loved the way she reacted. She tightened, inviting me inside. And who was I to miss the chance to fill the Queen with my seed yet again… She let out a loud string of satisfied cries that faded toward unconsciousness, and I plopped them between them. </p><p>I earned my rest before another day filled with work arrived. </p>
