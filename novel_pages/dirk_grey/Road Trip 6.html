        <p> I had hoped that distracted by her new gifts, Anna would be distracted enough to fully close the curtain. Unfortunately, that proved to be the exact opposite of the reality, and Anna pulled the curtains extremely tight, making sure they were closed. </p><p>A pity. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean that all was lost. I started walking around the store once again, this time with a hungrier gaze. I picked four skirts, starting from knee-length and getting progressively shorter, the shortest one right in the qualification line between a mini skirt and micro skirt. I didn’t expect her to wear it off, but I wanted to act like I picked it accidentally, wanting to see her face. </p><p>But after a brief consideration, I put the more conservative two back on the shelves, and threw the more revealing ones to my own bag, betting on the fact that I would be able to convince her to wear them later on. Luckily, they were in deep discount, so they didn’t cost me much. I even picked a pair of knee-length black boots, also at a deep discount. Neither their material nor the brand was the best, but considering I was buying them blind, it was definitely beneficial. </p><p>Since I decided to build her a secret wardrobe, I tested several dresses, but unlike the skirts, they weren’t conservative in the slightest. They did look relatively normal at the first glance, but I dated with a number of girls with generous assets and knew from experience that dresses didn’t look half innocent on them, with their generous curves stretching those dresses in unexpected places, both enhancing the cleavage and shortening the skirt, which gave me plausible deniability about why I picked such a revealing dress. In the end, I picked two dresses. One light green sundress that looked innocent but actually a ticking time bomb, waiting for a wrong move to create the most delicious wardrobe accident, but it couldn’t rival the second one. </p><p>A little black dress that would turn Anna into a delicious toy on my arm, fit to be presented for even the most trendy club. </p><p>I put everything I had picked into my own personal bag, and dropped it by the checkout counter. “Your girlfriend is a lucky girl,” said the cashier girl with a flirtatious smile, and I matched with one. Pity that I wouldn’t spend a few days in the region, as she looked like a fun brunette. </p><p>When I returned from my shopping, I found Anna in front of a mirror, trying to look at her bottom, which was tight enough to look like it was painted on. “It looks nice, you should definitely buy it,” I commented, and she flinched in shock. </p><p>“Really?” she asked, but she avoided my gaze. </p><p>“Well, if you want to be sure, you need to try it with that tank-top. This t-shirt doesn’t bring its benefits.” </p><p>“Really?” she murmured. “But it’s too revealing.” </p><p>“Come on, you shouldn’t feel self-conscious about it,” I said, then chuckled as I gave her a playful glare. “Especially after watching me while I exercised topless. It’s nothing compared to that.” </p><p>“You saw that!” she gasped in shock, which was understandable, considering what she had been doing as she watched me, absolutely sure that she had been seen. </p><p>I decided to give her an exit. “Well, actually I didn’t, but you just admitted to it, so…” I said with a widening grin. </p><p>“You … jerk,” she murmured as she slapped my shoulder, but despite her words, she was smiling widely, relaxed that she hadn’t been caught. Or at least, that was what she had thought. I let her think that, otherwise, how could I enjoy her unintentional shows as she perved on me. </p><p>“Still, since you admitted it, put on that black tank top. I want to see if it’ll look as beautiful as I think,” I said, maintaining eye contact as I did so. I wasn’t surprised when she nodded obediently. After all, people were easier to convince when they were feeling relieved, and the supposed close-call she had experienced had definitely put her in such a state. </p><p>She disappeared behind the curtain once more, but this time, she was much more hurried, failing to close the curtain all the way in, allowing me to get a glimpse of her beautiful body through reflection. It was a fleeting moment, but still, it showed just how well the baby blue bra I had picked for her fit, hugging her large breasts perfectly, presenting them in the best light. I felt a stirring in my pants as I imagined myself ripping them off her body, my mouth watering as I did so. </p><p>When she came out, her eyes were firmly on the ground, her shoulders slouched once more, her arms around her chest. “Are you a bad student? Maybe with really poor grades?” I asked in a cold tone. </p><p>“W-what?” she stammered, raising her gaze, anger flickering, though she kept her arms folded. “No!”</p><p>“Then why are you ignoring my lessons?” I asked. “Head raised, arms relaxed, shoulders straight. It should be simple to remember.” </p><p>“S-sorry,” she stammered, as she followed my direction, but it took a while for arms to get down. “How do I look?” </p><p>“Let me get a better view,” I said even as I grabbed her hand, and twirled her, much to her shock. “Hmm, not bad,” I said after giving her a long look that left her with a blush that threatened to knock her unconscious. “Calm down,” I said consolingly, though if my hand landed on the small of her back as I said so, pulling her close, I was sure that it was completely accidental. “You look beautiful, it’s nothing to be ashamed of.” </p><p>“You think so,” she murmured. “But everyone said that-” she continued, but I cut her off. </p><p>“I don’t care what a bunch of snot-nosed high school boys or jealous cheerleaders who lost their ability to think due to excessive dieting thinks,” I said. “I’m a professional when it comes to beauty, and believe me, you look exquisite,” I whispered. “Believe me. If I had the funds, I would have hired you to be my full-time model, letting all my competitors die of jealousy.” </p><p>The compliment was a bit excessive, but not mistaken, I noted as I felt her melting against my arm as her eyelashes fluttered. “Really?” she murmured excitedly. </p><p>I leaned down like I was about to steal a kiss, and she froze immediately. More importantly, she made no move to escape, her rosy lips parting invitingly, her breathing picking up speed. I could easily steal a kiss at that moment. Too bad that if I did so, she would soon implode in panic, and call our trip off, ruining my plans along. I knew those excessive-thinker types quite well. So, instead of kissing, I whispered before pulling back. “Yes, you’re simply exquisite.” </p><p>I stood next to her, trying to hide my amusement as her emotions battled on her face, relief against disappointment… Still, to her credit, she managed to recover quite fast. “Thanks.” </p><p>“So, are you going to buy the tank top, or should we continue looking.” </p><p>She gave a lingering look at the mirror, her eyes dancing between her figure and my arm, which was still around her waist with my hand resting on the small of her back. “I think I’ll pick this,” she said in a rare burst of courage. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, even though I felt quite a pity. If she stayed undecided, I could easily imagine convincing her to wear a revealing spaghetti strap. “Let’s go.” Just like that, we walked away, and she carefully not made a mention of my hand resting on the small of her back, clearly enjoying the closeness. </p><p>That didn’t mean our shopping came to an end, of course. As we walked, I noticed a special corner, feeling a sudden inspiration. “Do you have any swimwear?” I asked her. </p><p>Just like that, her newfound confidence was destroyed. “N-no,” she stammered. “Why?” </p><p>“We have several lakes on the way, and I’m not planning to miss them. We even have one on our destination tonight, so I’ll be swimming quite a bit tomorrow before we hit on the road. You would be bored without a swimsuit,” I said, then hit her with the deadly final touch. “Unless you prefer skinny-dipping, of course.”</p><p>“No, definitely not!” she exclaimed panickedly as she dashed toward the swimsuit area, once again too panicked to notice the simple decision trap I had set up. It was a common fallacy, that when panicked, people tended to pick the more palatable of the two options, not stopping to think whether there was a third one, such as just stating she would skip swimming. </p><p>“One-piece or two-piece,” I asked her, once again relying on the same trap, though this time a bit trickier. </p><p>Before she could even say one piece, I had already picked a red one from the front. Like the dress I had picked, it looked decently conservative at the first glance. It had a zipper going down on the front rather than the back, though the wearer could keep it closed. Or at least, that was what I hoped Anna would think, because there was no way in hell Anna’s bust would fit in there when closed. She would inevitably have to unzip it down quite a bit for it to fit. “One piece,” she said, though she looked slightly disappointed at my selection, no doubt hoping that I would force her to something slightly more revealing. I hid my smile, wanting that surprise to be revealed later. </p><p>“We can also pick a two-piece along with it,” I offered, but she shook her head. </p><p>“No need, let me try this first,” she said. </p><p>I made a show of checking my time. “Actually, we’re a bit behind the schedule. Do you mind just buying it without checking? It’s just five bucks, not exactly a deal-breaker even if it doesn’t fit.” </p><p>She nodded, quite a bit calmer, and just a dash disappointed. “No worries.” </p><p>When we arrived at the register, the cashier girl smiled once more, but this time, her smile had a glassy quality to it, clearly not enjoying the transformation Anna experienced now that she was wearing a pair of tight jeans and a tank top —a normal one, but on Anna, it turned into a master example of innocent sexiness— looking several times better than her look when she came inside. Luckily, she did nothing more than grumbling under her breath as she rang our purchases, and we left. </p><p>“What was her problem?” Anna asked as she snuggled closer, still pointedly not making any mention of my hand resting on her back, earning glares from both genders as we walked through the mall. </p><p>“She was clearly jealous,” I said. </p><p>“Of you?” she asked, but on her tone, it was clear that she assumed that to be a done deal. </p><p>“Partially,” I said, and she looked at me questioningly. “She clearly hoped to seduce me, and when we walked in, she thought she had a hope to do so,” I said. </p><p>“And while we left? What changed. Did she try to get your number and struck out?” </p><p>I chuckled. “You need to be more confident. She was like that, because after you changed clothes, she realized that she had no chance of peeling me off your side,” I said with a chuckle. “You’re simply beautiful.” </p><p>“Y-you’re just saying that,” she stammered in shock, but underneath, I could see the beginnings of the smug smile that always adorned the cheerleader and other women who thought themselves to be the top dog, confident in their sexuality. It was just a seed, trying to take root, but still, it was good progress. </p><p>“Whatever you say,” I answered, but my smile was soft and seductive, something Anna didn’t miss if her fluttering eyelashes, followed by a panicked step back trying to hide her blush was any indicator. </p><p>We walked separate the rest of the way, with Anna carefully examining her feet. Distracted, she didn’t even ask what I had bought, maybe assuming it was some men’s clothes, maybe not even noticing. Regardless, it carried several cheaply-picked treasures that would enhance her beauty significantly. </p><p>The moment we were back at the RV, Anna dashed back to the bathroom, quickly changing into her sweatpants and t-shirt combo, hiding her delicious body behind layers of clothing once more. I was tempted to tease her, but I held myself back. I had challenged her way of life enough for one day. </p><p>The afternoon drive passed in silence, with Anna keeping her nose buried in her book and me watching the surroundings carefully, my mind on how I could use the lake for my benefit. Still, I continued to watch her without letting her know, only to see her shuffling uncomfortably, like there was something she wanted to do, but she kept herself back. I could barely hold back my laughter as I recognized the tell-tale signs of arousal, of which she was too inexperienced to hide from my gaze. </p><p>I expected her to disappear to the bathroom for a while to ‘handle’ it, but her hesitancy proved to be stronger. She maintained her act of reading as I drove, even as I parked the RV to a concealed spot that nonetheless had an amazing view of the lake, or when I picked my drawing equipment and left, starting to sketch the way the sunlight danced on the surface of the lake water. I knew, because I could still see her reflection from the side-view mirror, and she was still sitting in her seat. </p><p>However, she didn’t maintain the same act when the sun finally set and I got rid of my shirt, and started exercising once more. She once again hid behind the curtain, her hand disappearing under her sweatpants as she watched me sweat. I bit my lips in excitement, wondering whether she was still wearing the baby-blue underwear I had picked for her. </p><p>I exercised for about half an hour, and she watched me uninterrupted, almost dazed. When I stopped and returned to RV, she once again buried herself under the blanket, trying to hide her blush by dipping her head low, unaware that her neck and ears were glowing as well. I said nothing, choosing to take a quick shower. Unfortunately, this time, she wasn’t courageous enough to peek at me. However, from the small gap I left on the door, I watched her, only to notice her walking toward the burner with a hesitant expression, like a small child about to raid the cookie jar. </p><p>I watched curiously, only to see her prepare two glasses of warm milk. For a moment, I thought that she had added something in it, but I watched her almost uninterrupted through her reflection, and she added nothing. She still looked guilty and anticipatory, though. Only after a while, it clicked. She was hoping that after a relaxing glass of warm milk, I would sleep deeper. So devious, yet so innocent…  </p><p>Her gaze trailed me carefully when I left the shower with a loose towel around my waist. “Do you want some warm milk,” she offered, stammering, tempting me to squeeze her cheeks. </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I grabbed the glass, aware of her gaze, trying not to focus on my muscles, glistening after the shower, but failing spectacularly. “It’s delicious. You’re very thoughtful,” I said after I quickly drained it, then went back to the bathroom and brushed my teeth, letting the small towel around my waist to rise up ‘carelessly’. Then, I went back to my section.</p><p>“Have a nice sleep,” I said as I pulled the separator curtain halfway, then smirked. “Don’t forget, don’t come to this side unless you want to face a big surprise,” I warned her with a smirk before pulling the curtain down, curious whether she would pay another nighttime visit, and if she did so, how far she would go… </p>
