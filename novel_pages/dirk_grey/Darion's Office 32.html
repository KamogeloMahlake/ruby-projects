        <p>Darion was late to the event that his boss — and pretend girlfriend — had invited him, which was a bit annoying. Of course, ordinarily, he wouldn’t have cared much about it, but Mia was rather fun as far as bosses went…</p><p>Not to mention, Paisley was the reason for the meeting, and considering how amazing the previous meeting had been, Darion was rather positive about the possibility of another meeting. </p><p>“I just hope she doesn’t bitch for long,” he murmured as he pushed the door open. If there was one problem with Mia, it was her misguided impression that she was still the one who was giving the orders. </p><p>Often long, wordy orders. He had many ways to silence her if they were alone, but it was more difficult in a club. Not impossible, just more difficult. </p><p>However, after he opened the door, he paused. There was an unfamiliar face in the meeting … one that was not invited by Mia if her posture was any indicator. Still, it was a nice club, the kind that was paid for by someone who wanted a place to show their prestige rather than to make money. </p><p>As he walked, he noticed the bartender. A sexy piece of ass, but the way she was dressed confirmed that the place was more about making a statement. </p><p>Especially combined with the empty state. Clearly reserved for them. </p><p>“Hey, my love, you’re late,” Mia gasped the moment she noticed his approach, jumping up to her feet as she approached him, doing her best to look like she was a loving girlfriend who missed her man … but Darion could read the entitled annoyance on her face very easily. </p><p>“Where were you … honey,” she said, managing to sound threatening even as she used a loving nickname. </p><p>“Your sister needed my help,” Darion answered with a shrug. It was true … from a certain point of view, though he doubted Mia would appreciate it. </p><p>“Next time, just ignore her. She can just take a taxi,” Mia said. </p><p>Before Darion could answer, the unknown woman intervened. “So, Mia. Is this the hunk Madam Paisley was talking about,” she said, her voice just entitled and snotty enough to grate Darion’s nerves. </p><p>“Yes, he is. Good evening to you, Darion,” Paisley said, giving a put-together attitude, even more prissier. Though, Darion liked hers, as he could clearly see that Paisley was putting that expression on her face to cover up her panic. </p><p>After all, she was not as well put together when he was leaving their previous meeting. She was frazzled, and very much satisfied. </p><p>“And to you, honey,” Darion said, which earned a suspicious glare from the unknown woman. She was clearly sharp enough to catch there was something wrong with their little ploy. </p><p>Meanwhile, Mia took a step closer, and sent a warning glare at him. “What are you doing?” she whispered. “Are you trying to ruin the deal? She’s already annoyed.” </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry, honey,” he said, using the same nickname even as he used the opportunity to cup a feel. “You have your expertise, and I have mine.” </p><p>“But…” she tried to say, but Darion silenced her with a squeeze. </p><p>“Think of your own fun experience, honey,” he said, enjoying the way her expression danced between indignation and obedience. “Now, who’s this other woman.” </p><p>“The bane of my existence, Gina,” Mia said. “She’s a friend back from the school, and we’re in the same line of business.” </p><p>“And, why did you invite her?” Darion asked. </p><p>“I didn’t. It turns out she owns the place. I learned that too late.” </p><p>Before Darion could answer, Gina intervened. “Hey, lovebirds. It’s rude to spend all your time together. Save some to the bedroom.” </p><p>Mia looked angry, but Darion shook his head slightly. He would rather handle that uppity bitch himself. “Oh, you’re a rude little thing, are you?” Darion said as he stepped closer, taking a better look at her. </p><p>She might be annoying … but she was certainly sexy. </p><p>“Not as rude as you,” she said, then smirked as she slowly dragged her gaze up. “Though, I had to admit, I’m rather little when compared to you. I can see why Mia keeps you around … at least until she gets bored and dumps you to focus on her work.” </p><p>Darion smiled. “Oh, not exactly a problem. There’s a lot of me to get bored easily.” </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me that it was an innuendo about your little dick. How juvenile.” </p><p>Darion leaned forward. “Oh, I can promise you that little is not how you can describe my dick. Not that it was a surprise for you, as you have been watching it since I entered. Don’t tell me that you’re jealous of my girlfriend.” </p><p>Calling her jealous worked much better than he expected. “M-me, jealous of that little uppity bitch that thinks herself as my rival. No way,” she said, unsettled by his declaration. </p><p>“Well, it doesn’t look that way to me,” he said, then smirked. She failed to say anything. “Feel free to think of an answer. I need to visit the bathroom. I can hear your answer once I return.” </p><p>With that, he walked. Though, noticing just how satisfied Mia looked, he took a mental note to ask for a favor.</p><p>But, that was for later. For now, he had a more important mission. </p><p>Finding Paisley for a fun repeat.</p>
