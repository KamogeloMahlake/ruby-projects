        <p>I watched with great interest as Sapphire collapsed on the bed the moment I allowed her to do so, not putting the slightest resistance as I freed her body completely from the remaining pieces of her maid costume. It wasn’t that her costume was hiding a lot of stuff, but I wanted to see her have unobstructed access to her body as we played around. </p><p> I lay next to her, equally naked, while she focused on catching her breath. I thought about what to say as I caressed her hair with uncharacteristic gentleness, enjoying the incredible contrast as she shivered with pleasure under my touch. I even pulled her against my chest as she breathed hard, trying to get rid of the aftereffects of her orgasm, made particularly hard by the side effects of the magic she had used. </p><p>As I let my hand caress her body, exploring some of the lesser sensitive spots on her arms and her stomach, she slowly gathered her wits. Her expression turned unfamiliar, tenderness mixing into her usual sharpness. That wasn’t to say that she wasn’t angry, but in the mix of emotions, anger was only a small part. From the corner of my eye, I watched as her expression slowly solidified, ready to launch a discussion. </p><p>“We need to talk,” she said, her voice echoing with determination. It was sharp and solid, but easy to ignore for that exact reason. Her voice was sharp, because she was trying to convince herself that she was able to think unobstructed once more. And since she was having trouble believing it herself, it was clearly not true. </p><p>No, mentally, she was already mine. Not just for the night, but forever. All that required was for her to understand that. </p><p>“Really? Go ahead?” I said, my tone soft enough to imply that I was actually a kind person, which was the farthest thing from reality. However, she was just vulnerable enough to be affected by that. It was amusing to watch her expression, which she had established with great care, flicker just after a simple statement. Her self-confidence turned soft immediately when our eyes met, making her determination flail. </p><p>“It’s about our deal…” she started, only to stop when I let my hand climb upward, caressing the bottom of her breasts. “Do you mind stopping?” </p><p>“I do mind, actually,” I answered. “But a gentle caress shouldn’t affect you.” </p><p>She sent a disapproving glare, but realizing my fingers were dancing on the underside of her breast, ignoring her silent disapproval, she folded quickly. After all, touch wasn’t exactly something to care about after everything we had done together. “I need the location of the Eternal Core,” she said stiffly. </p><p>“And I want angels to come down from heaven and kiss my cock, but we can’t have everything we want,” I said, slapping her tit to underline my statement. “You’re smart enough to realize that it’s the only leverage to ensure I can keep my head. So, unless you can make me an offer good enough to risk my neck, I’m going to delay that particular item. But you’re still interested in the other items I offer, right?” </p><p>At this point, her disapproving silence was adorable. “Isn’t the survival of the continent enough reason?” she asked. </p><p>“Honestly, no,” I said with a dismissive laugh, while my hands climbed up to her amazing breasts, and start playing with her nipples alternatingly, squeezing and twisting, treating them as a toy. She gasped. “I’m far from being a saint, and possible survival of the continent is not one of my responsibilities. And that’s assuming I believe you.” </p><p>“What do you mean? You think I would lie something as important!” she said, trying to rise, but my hand was enough to keep her laying. She squirmed, trying to stand up, making me hug to keep her in place. </p><p>“Calm down, sweetie,” I said, amused by her sudden shocked expression. Though, admittedly, her reaction was less about my words, and more about the fact that I used the opportunity to slide inside her, making her let out a surprised moan. I continued speaking even as I started pumping my hips. “I can’t comment whether your need is about a critical defense issue, but I’m sure it’s not bad enough to threaten the whole continent. If it was so, you wouldn’t have used your forces to attack my other client, but instead used it to collaborate with the dark faction. It would have cost you a pretty penny, but it would be enough to handle the threat.” </p><p>“I can’t bet the survival of the continent on a Dark Lord,” she countered, trying to ignore my gentle pumping. “What if they ally with the threat instead.” </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, you’re forgetting that he was another client, and I had a decent understanding of his personality. He might have extracted some nasty benefits for himself, but he wasn’t idiotic enough to risk his lands against a fundamental threat. The fact that you didn’t ally with him implies that it’s a threat either for your Empire, or more likely, for your power structure.” The way she flinched at the last part was more than enough for me to understand the issue. </p><p>“It’s not like that, but I see that I can’t convince you,” she said, trying to distract me from the truth, realizing her attempt to reach my nonexistent mercy had failed spectacularly. </p><p>“Exactly, sweetie,” I said, stopping to steal a small kiss from her lips as I gently explored her insides, contrasting greatly with my earlier invasion. “I’m just a small-time merchant, trying to survive in this complicated world. You just need to throw a few morsels to my side, and I’ll help you to the best of my ability.” I chuckled. “I take customer satisfaction very seriously, as you learned in a very personal manner.” </p><p>“Asshole,” she murmured, but my reminder about her chain orgasms worked wonderfully to change the issue. </p><p>“So, sweetie, would you like to talk about what you want to offer me for the next map, or would you like to talk about it in the morning?” I asked. </p><p>“In the morning? Why, do you need to leave again?” </p><p>“Nope,” I answered with a smirk. “I don’t have anything to do for the rest of the night, but that doesn’t mean that we need to ruin the night talking business. Not when we can use it in a much more productive way.” </p><p>“Never,” she reacted angrily, though her reaction might have been more convincing if she wasn’t already in my arms, moaning obediently as I pumped inside her repeatedly. I doubted it would take much effort to convince her to stay until the morning, but when she once again started to talk about the bargain, I let talk uninterrupted —other than the occasional moan. </p><p>“As you wish, then, please tell me what are you willing to offer, your majesty,” I said, reminding her about her position, which contrasted greatly with her current location and our gentle lovemaking. She started offering several items </p><p>“I can give you two of the artifacts you asked for, the blade of shadows, and the tether of the underworld,” she answered. </p><p>“Hmm, it’s not exactly a spectacular offer, but I might accept it on one condition,” I said lazily, hiding my reaction. Actually, I was quite satisfied with her offer. The blade of shadows was not an extremely famous blade, lacking the explosive might of some of the more famous magical weapons, but considering my current constraints, that kind of flashy effect was not something I could rely on in the first place. No, the blade of shadows was perfect because, essentially, it was a magical staff in form of a short sword, significantly amplifying the strength of any magical spell, especially if it was related to darkness and shadows, like my favorite concealment spells. </p><p>The tether, on the other hand, was not about necromancy despite its name. It was owned by a famous lich, but ultimately, it was a useful support item to break and construct wards, making it a very useful tool for defensive-minded dark lords. Or in my circumstances, for a particularly naughty thief. </p><p>“What’s your condition?” she asked. </p><p>“I want to make the trade in a different location.” </p><p>“Out of the question,” she answered. “This place is already dangerous enough for me. Don’t forget that I’m the Queen. I will not come to your base to be imprisoned.” </p><p>Considering our current circumstances, her statement was rather ridiculous. She might trust the club after using the place for years, but despite her misconception, arranging to steal her from the place was almost trivial. Luckily for her, she was almost completely worthless as a prisoner. I liked Aria a lot, but if I actually took Sapphire hostage, the other councilors would turn her into a puppet in less than a week, and would take the crown in a month. Still, the image of the queen, chained to a dark room was very exciting. </p><p>“Don’t tempt me,” I whispered into her ear, making her shiver. I let the silence stretch for a while as I slowly picked up the pace. “Don’t worry about the danger of the location. Actually, what I have in mind is much safer.” </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” she asked. </p><p>“The throne room,” I said. The way her eyes widened was simply beautiful. It was a risky location, but after the obvious signs of her growing obedience, I was willing to take the risk. Making her mine in the center of her power was too tempting to deny. </p><p>“Impossible,” she answered after a momentary freeze, scandalized. However, the way she tightened around my girth betrayed her arousal. Clearly, I wasn’t the only one imagining such a thrilling moment. </p><p>“Why not,” I said with a smirk. “All you need to do is to use magical defenses and send the guards away for the night. You’re smart enough to find a valid reason,” I said. She opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, my lips were on hers, stealing her words. I put one of my hands to the small of her back, a gentle caress making her back arch as the arousal invaded her body. </p><p>The kiss lasted for a couple of minutes while her resistance melted quickly. “It’s too risky,” she managed to mutter after pulling back for a breather, but lacking conviction behind her words. </p><p>“Even better,” I said. “There’s nothing like a little danger to make it more fun, or are you going to say that you can’t handle a little adrenaline?” </p><p>She didn’t manage to answer before I leaned for another kiss. Interestingly, this time, she met my lips midway instead of waiting passively, proving that she was getting rather used to my touch. I probed her lips with my tongue, and her lips parted open, allowing my tongue to access her mouth. She started moaning, the tenderness of my touch mixing wonderfully with her body, aching for another climax. </p><p>When I pulled out of her and gave her a little push, she lay on her back readily, her legs parted open invitingly, anticipation rapidly dominating her face as I positioned her at the entrance. However, rather than sliding in, I asked, “So, how about my request about the location.” </p><p>She froze for a moment, and I waited for her answer despite her expression giving me a pretty accurate clue about it. “You win,” she murmured in defeat after a minute, closing her eyes. </p><p>“No, your majesty,” I said as I slid in, her walls once again clamping around my girth. “We win.” With that, my lips pressed on hers once more, leveraging our physical closeness for maximum benefit. The way her legs wrapped around my waist suggested that I wasn’t the only one enjoying the changing nature of our physical closeness. </p><p>Her cry vibrated in my mouth as I pulled deeper inside her, tempting me to impale her even harder, which in turn made her moan even louder in a divine example of reinforcing structure. The tender nature of our lovemaking was being particularly effective due to the after-effects of her climaxes along with the aftermath of her tantric attempts of dominance. I continued to slide in a leisure manner as she helplessly tightened around me, her trembles intensifying, telling me that she had just experienced another climax. Her eyes were closed as she was dominated under a rush of unfamiliar sensations, allowing me to see an unfamiliar softness glowing on her face. </p><p>Her growing obedience and my success in terms of the artifacts we were about to trade… My time with Sapphire was going much better than I could have hoped for… </p>
