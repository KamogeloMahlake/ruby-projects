        <p>“H-how can you forget to mention that after seeing her identity!” Titania growled, her eyes wide with shock. </p><p>“Calm down, she’s just an angel,” I said with a considerably less amazed tone, which Titania clearly didn’t appreciate if her angry glare was any indicator. Though, it was important to note that her anger certainly wasn’t enough to make her leave my lap despite our nakedness, or stopping the gentle yet beautiful movement of her hips. </p><p>I didn’t find her anger at my dismissal surprising. After all, she had lived under the emotional suppression as a Divine-Touched of the Light for at least a couple of years, maybe more. While that suppressed her emotions, since the headmistress was a being of light, it might even work as an amplifier. And, even without that, the headmistress provided an amazing sight, with her golden armor and her impassive wings.</p><p>My case was different, especially after my first real glance was on her naked body.  </p><p>“She’s an angel!” Titania repeated, even angrier, and I just chuckled, pulling her tighter on my lap. Since it wasn’t a direction I wanted to waste a lot of time, I decided to distract her with a shinier approach. I raised my finger, conjuring a small globe of light. At first glance, it didn’t look too different from a simple arcana trick, but with her own expertise in light magic, it was trivial for Titania to understand its true source.</p><p>“You can already cast it! It’s an amazing achievement considering you received it just hours ago,” she gasped in shock as she raised her finger, touching at the small globe. Light magic, despite its simple look, was extremely destructive. If someone else tried what she was trying, the smallest thing they would receive was a nasty burn, maybe even lose their finger completely if their level wasn’t particularly high. </p><p>With her own spectacular expertise, however, Titania had no such risk. Her smile brightened as her fingertip disappeared into the ball, before I felt her mana flooding, stealing control of the globe from me, changing shapes repeatedly.</p><p>“Show off,” I said with a chuckle, spanking her ass playfully as I said so, making her flinch cutely as she moved forward, a movement that left her entrance perfectly aligned with my shaft. And since I was already trying to distract her from the earlier topic, I didn’t miss the opportunity and plunged into her wetness. </p><p>The moan she let out in response was a thing of beauty. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 70%]</p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>Ideally, considering my interest in understanding the assistance of my newly-acquired sliver of Divine spark, I shouldn’t have been trying to enhance Titania’s companion process, but the immediate benefits of such a thing were more critical than possible drawbacks. The experience burst was always welcome after each stage completion, but now, about to face a legendary lich that earned the nickname of eternal, skill share was a much better benefit. </p><p>Not to mention the stat boost Titania would receive, which would increase her power significantly. Two points increase for every mental stat was certainly nothing to scoff at, both in terms of extra mana it would give her, and the extra potency it would add to her skills. </p><p>“Since you’re willing to show off, why don’t you teach me a few of your skills,” I suggested even as I grabbed her hips, pulling her even deeper. </p><p>“Caesar, not now,” she gasped as the pleasure hit her. </p><p>“Not now, what?” I asked. “The teaching, or the fun?” </p><p>Despite everything, she was far too shy to actually answer such a question instantly. She dipped her head down, her raven hair hiding her blushing face, but the way her hips moved repeatedly was a better answer, so I didn’t force her to speak. Instead, I leaned forward, capturing her lips in a lingering kiss. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 71%]</p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>I let her determine the pace, her head dipped down but her hips picking up speed. That didn’t prevent me from leaning down to petter her neck with kisses, of course, which assisted greatly to destroy her hesitancy. I knew just how naughty she would get once her initial shyness was broken.  </p><p>So, I continued to caress her body steadily as she danced on my lap, her movements getting sharper and sharper while I was once again felt shocked by the potential hidden in her tiny body, enough to destroy the town we were in bare minutes if she chose so. </p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” I whispered into her ear, making her tremble in excitement under the softness of my tone. She looked up, and I captured her lips in a searing kiss that made her moan helplessly, which helped quite a bit for her to get rid of her hesitancy. When I finally pulled back, her expression was firmly on the territory of desire, destroying the hint of shyness. </p><p>“You’re an evil man,” she stated even as she put her hands on my shoulder, her hips moving even more furiously thanks to the additional leverage. I moaned, enjoying the way she clenched tighter around my girth. Happy with the way she was taking control, I had no problem temporarily taking a passive position, especially since, unlike Oeyne, I knew she wouldn’t try to push her newfound opportunity to the limits. </p><p>I wrapped my arm around her waist, pulling her tight to enjoy the feeling of her hard nipples against my chest, my hands occasionally slipping down to cup her deliciously tight lithe hips. She buried her face to my neck. A minute passed, then two, then five, while she steadily closed toward a climax, her hips getting more and more furious. </p><p>Then, she finally tightened around my girth, signaling that she had passed through the finish line. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 73%]</p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>“It’s my turn,” I whispered into her ear even as she trembled in my lap, adding a layer of anticipation to her rush of pleasure. </p><p>Before she could recover, I had already grabbed her and pushed her against the wall, her breasts pressing against the smooth stone. With me skewering her, she was just short enough to barely tiptoe. But if the beautiful moan she let out as I used the advantages of the angle to push even deeper into her was any indicator, she wasn’t particularly caring of her helpless position. </p><p>She closed her eyes to enjoy the merciless assault I launched, her thin frame shaking with joy with every push. Her beautiful lips pursed, leaving me in a dangerous dilemma. Should I lean down and kiss, enjoying their warmth, or stay away, listening to her moans without interruption, getting louder and louder and louder. </p><p>After a torturous decision process, I decided to choose the latter, enjoying the way she clamped around me as I pushed deeper and deeper, her moans cheering for my success. Her silky smoothness enveloped me fully, renewing my decision to steal her completely from the headmistress’ sphere of influence, and not just because she was the only one that could currently allow me to get some mana. </p><p>It was so tempting to steal her away and escape to a mountain, staying in a cave for the next week, away from everything else as I tested just how passionately I could make her moan under my control. Pity that, with everything that was going on, a week of holiday was not something we could afford. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 74%]</p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>She managed to distract me from my thoughts rather effectively. She pressed her hands against the wall for leverage before she started rocking her hips wildly, managing to add her own movement to the pushes despite the limited angle. “Someone is feeling enthusiastic,” I whispered into her ear, a sentence that would have sent her stammering away any other time. But now, in the throes of passion, she just moaned in agreement. </p><p>Happy with her ever-growing enthusiasm, I sank deeper into heaven, the pace of my hips best described as a merciless drilling, her silky wetness more than happy to envelop my presence deeper and deeper. </p><p>"You’re a masterpiece,” I whispered sincerely even as I grabbed her hips once more, moving even faster. She was far too gone to use her words to answer, but the change of tone in her moans worked just as well. Though this time, the temptation to feel the tremble of her voice on my lips felt more tempting than hearing them, so I closed her mouth with my lips, muffling her moans the best way possible. </p><p>Then, she started to tighten in a final manner, suggesting that she was experiencing another delicious climax. This time, I was sufficiently gone that her extra tightening put every single nerve ending in my body to high alert, signaling an eruption. </p><p>I exploded into her, which matched perfectly for the third stage of the companion process, along with a flood of other notifications. </p><p>[+2000 Experience] </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 75% - Third Stage Completed +15000 Exp]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Relationship not sufficient for the fourth stage]</p><p>I had to admit, while the completion notification of another stage of the Companion Process was always welcome, the same didn’t apply for the following one. Even though, I wasn’t really surprised. Not with the reverence, she was feeling toward the headmistress. </p><p>I didn’t expect to progress into the fourth stage unless I replaced the importance of the headmistress in her mind, becoming the most important person in her life. That was what I learned from Cornelia and Helga. </p><p>Luckily, the notifications I had received were not limited to that. I had also received a nice batch of perk-related notifications. </p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 3. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>[New Perk: Skill Share]</p><p>[Skill Share perk activated. Target Skill: Grandmaster Light Magic. Copied: Duration, 24 hours]</p><p>[Temporary Skill: Master Light Magic (100/100)]</p><p>I was happy to see skill share was working as intended, and even happier to see that just like fire magic, it was actually based on elemental magic, allowing me to start from such a high location. As long as I spent the rest of the day with Titania, being taught how to use the light magic offensively, I could get a qualitative improvement. </p><p>Or at least, that was what I thought until I heard a knock on the door, and a furious shout from the other end. “There’s an incoming undead army!” an unknown voice shouted, destroying my plans of a day filled with leisure learning and leveling up… </p><p>Well, I thought spitefully as I gathered my mana. Teaching the undead army a lesson they couldn’t forget through the light magic wasn’t exactly a terrible alternative. </p><p>And maybe this time, I could teach them to stay away… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 488593 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324	Mana: 7595  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>
