        <p>“What the hell was that!?” Lillian exclaimed as she turned toward me, anger apparent on her face. “Who just goes and decides that it has been a few hours since I have been in a life-and-death battle, and currently on a boat that might explode with one wrong move, so I’ll  use an extremely dangerous refinement technique to kill time!'” she continued, but despite her outward display of anger, her concern was apparent.  </p><p>Despite noticing that, a sharp order escaped my mouth. “Silence!” I called, my voice much sharper than I had ever used in my life, which shocked me even more than it shocked Lillian. The statement was instinctual, and I never remembered actually using a statement like that. “I’m sorry,” I immediately followed, even though saying the words grated on me a lot more than they should have. </p><p>“I understand,” Lillian answered, my immediate apology going a long way to take the wind out of her sails, leaving her confused. It was something I welcomed, because it gave me the excuse to focus on my emotions, only to realize their presence was much stronger in my mind, something I only realized thanks to the iron discipline of a superior magician. I couldn’t help but shudder what would have happened if I hadn’t noticed it, reacting to situations much stronger than normal. </p><p>But even realizing the change was only a partial solution, because the desire to make her pay still throbbed in my mind. It was surprising, though not because I desired revenge. I had always been a vindictive person, more than willing to make people pay when the opportunity arose. However, I was always a meticulous planner, preferring the taste of cold revenge attained in a way my rival wouldn’t even realize my involvement in it. The sudden burning desire to make her pay caught me with surprise. </p><p>However, during the lull of the conversation while I considered the possibilities, I made the mistake of looking up, once again meeting with the naked sight of her body, her pale skin shining ethereally under the gentle rays of the moon, putting her nakedness on the best probable display. It was always a nice sight, one that triggered my desire easily even before, but the sudden roaring inferno of lust caught me flatfooted, my emotions were now pushing me to do unspeakable things to the almost-naked beauty in front of me. </p><p>Rejecting the call of the lust proved to be much more troublesome than rage, especially with the memory of her soft lips still clear on my mind. My hand was already around her wrist and an invite was on my lips when I realized it was the time. “The anger was uncalled for. Let me apologize,” I said while I pulled her onto my naked lap, my body reacting by itself. She gasped in shock, but her attempts to say something was prevented by my lips smashing against hers, which were still rebelling under the impact of my burning desire. </p><p>It took several seconds to get rudimentary control over my lust, in which my hands danced over her body hungrily, leaving several red marks in their uncalled aggression. However, at that point, I had a nice surprise, because rather than trying to pull back, Lillian was responding to my domineering kiss with one of her own, her hands wandering over my body. Not as greedy as mine, but enough for me to decide to abandon my attempts to pull back. That didn’t mean that the weird challenge I was feeling from my emotions had receded, because soon another instinct grabbed my heart, forcing me to push her down, rip her panties, and take her in the most intimate way possible, as soon as possible. </p><p>I decided to reject that instinct. </p><p>My rationale was simple. The sudden desire was clearly related to the changes my body had gone through during the meditation, and I was afraid of them getting even stronger if I didn’t act to control them, just like it would have been if I didn’t decide to take control of my magic. I had no intention of turning into a wild animal. </p><p>No magical transformation had the right to ruin the control I had developed over the years, no matter how strong. </p><p>I let the kiss continue, a decision that may seem counterintuitive at first. After all, pulling away from her tempting body and maybe jumping into the sea for a quick swim to calm myself with the help of the icy waters was the easiest way of avoiding the sudden onset of desire. However, I didn’t just want to avoid the desire, I wanted it under my control, turning into a celibate monk just to maintain control wasn’t an attractive proposition. </p><p>Decision made, I turned my complete attention to Lillian. Her lithe beauty deserved nothing less, especially when she was enthusiastically continuing the hopeless battle for dominance, hoping for a reversal just because she had avoided an overwhelming defeat, unaware of the part my instincts played on the stalemate. My fingers trailed down until my hand was resting on the small of her back, just above where her panties ended, and gently pulled her closer until our chests pressed together, trapping my shaft between our bodies as well. The sudden presence stilled her for a moment, but only for a moment, proving that I wasn’t the only one having trouble controlling my desire. </p><p>It was soon revealed that I wasn’t the only one struggling against the insistent push of the lust. Even after several minutes, Lillian maintained the kiss with the same passion she showed after the initial shock, and the insistent way her lips were dancing mine wasn’t making my situation any easier. “Are all noblewomen as repressed as you?” I murmured during one of the small pauses where we caught our breath. </p><p>The shocked realization on her face was just too beautiful. My words reminded her about the reality of her situation in life, which rarely included trying to devour the lips of a bastard scion of another noble family, especially when said bastard was on the escape. “We need to - stop!” she stuttered, but her statement mattered little when her hips continued to grind against my shaft. </p><p>“Really?” I said even as I pushed my hand through her shining golden hair, enjoying their soft silky texture between my fingers for a moment before yanking her head back. A pained yelp escaped her mouth, especially with my other hand still resting on the small of her back, preventing her from pulling back. Her breath hitched as I leaned forward in torturous slowness, and pressed my lips on her neck. Her pulse flared out of control as I continued to trace her neck with kisses, moving downward. </p><p>I only pulled back when I reached her collarbone, nibbling it gently until she failed to contain a moan. “It doesn’t look like you want to stop,” I asked before turning my attention back to her neck, and she gasped once more. </p><p>“I can’t — “ she murmured, but the rest of her sentence was cut when my instincts flared and took control for a fleeting moment. In that moment, I pulled her head back once more to reveal her neck, and pressed my mouth on the soft spot where her neck connects to her shoulder, this time leaving a not-so-subtle bite mark on her alabaster skin. Looking at that mark filled me with a primal sense of satisfaction, and I had to close my eyes for a moment, once again wrestling down my new instincts, to prevent myself from pushing her down and violently taking her. </p><p>Luckily, she was distracted with the bite itself, and the surprising presence of pleasure that followed, to pay attention to me. “You can’t, what, princess?” I murmured, unlike my internal fight, in a smooth and confident tone. </p><p>She took a deep breath before replying, and I let her succeed. “I can’t … lose my virginity…” she murmured, her whisper would have been impossible to hear if it wasn’t for the body enhancements I had recently received. Her concern was understandable. As the oldest daughter of a prestigious family, her virginity was a precious commodity. Losing it under the normal circumstances would have been devastating enough, but losing it right after she was kidnapped by pirates… </p><p>I decided to soothe her worries, but not before messing with her a bit. Suddenly, I pushed her back, but with my other hand still around her waist to prevent a painful fall. As she moved, my other hand flashed and grabbed her panties. She moved, but her panties kept their position for a moment, giving in with a distinctive ripple, so when she found herself lying on her back on the cold surface of the glass boat, she was, for the first time, completely naked. </p><p>She tried to cross her legs to hide her core, but I pushed my legs forward, preventing her legs from connecting, using the opportunity to slowly examine her untouched folds, surprisingly bare. “Someone is prepared,” I said with a mocking grin, and she just blushed. Since she had been a prisoner for a while with no access to her magic until very recently, it meant that she had spent quite a bit of time in her personal grooming after her magic returned without me noticing, likely when I collapsed after the battle against the dragon serpent. </p><p>“It’s not what you think!” she exclaimed as she hid her face behind her hands, a move that left the rest of her body free for my gaze. </p><p>“Really,” I answered even as I crouched down, my hands on her inner thighs. </p><p>My presence between her legs was enough to push her out of her shame-induced stupor. “What are you — doingg!” she exclaimed in shock, clearly fearing for her virginity, but her words turned into a shocked cry as my tongue darted out and traced her pussy. I raised my head after a few brushes to see her expression, only to find delicious shock. I was willing to bet everything that her shock was about the submissiveness the position was implying rather than the act itself. After all, maids assisting their ladies for relief was a routine part of the noble life. </p><p>For Lillian, seeing me taking me a supposedly-submissive position was surprising, but I had my own reasons for it. I didn’t subscribe to the general idea of oral sex equaling to submissiveness. For me, watching a sexy woman writhing in pleasure under my control was another form of domination, just as she was about to learn soon. Also, my newly-acquired instincts flared against the idea, trying to force me into something more traditionally dominant, making the situation a good opportunity to suppress those instincts even further. </p><p>I turned my full attention to her pleasure, giving a few teasing brushes to her knob to create a memory of pleasure before turning my head to the side, and softly bit her inner thigh, followed by several kisses. I raised my head momentarily when I heard her make a confused growl, my lips curled in amusement to convey the shape of things to come, subtly warning her about the likely divergence from her expectations. Then, I buried my head between her legs once more. </p><p>At first, she stayed motionless while my tongue slowly explored her pleasure, occasionally drifting toward her inner thighs to stretch the situation even further, but from the way she stiffened pointedly whenever I discovered another sensitive spot, she was trying to suppress the outward signs of pleasure. Not a bad counter-strategy for my insidious tactics. </p><p>Too bad that she was destined to lose. </p><p>It took a couple of minutes for the first moan to escape her mouth. I chose to raise my head at that moment, catching the embarrassed expression on her face. “Shut up,” she murmured, and more surprisingly, her hands found my head and pushed it back down. I had to take a deep breath to suppress the foreign rage at her action, once again driven by my new set of instincts, and followed it with a chuckle. After all, Lillian’s transformation was nothing if not amusing. Even a day ago, she would have never tried to make me continue licking her just to avoid a momentary amusement. </p><p>Still, my amusement didn’t mean that there would be no punishment for her presumption. I increased the intensity of my intimate assault, my fingers drifting around her knob to support my tongue, and soon, her moans became commonplace, escaping the prison of her mouth despite her best efforts to keep them suppressed. “More!” she shouted after another few minutes, a statement that was accompanied by another blush, I discovered when I raised my head once more. She was getting close. </p><p>“Really?” I said, trying to make eye contact, but she avoided it by turning her head, and closing her eyes for good measure, this time earning a good-natured scoff from me. It was entertaining just how easily she lost control in a situation of supposed superiority. But that avoidance didn’t last for long, because the closer she got to the edge, the slower my treatment became. She noticed the trend after a while, and her hands reached to the top of my head once more as she tried to push my head down harder. </p><p>I ignored her push and the slight pain resulting from her tight grip around my hair, and started to move upward instead, creating a trail of kisses on her belly. “Please,” she moaned, her grip still tight around my head, but I ignored it in favor of tracing her cute little belly button, each breath  landed on her skin. </p><p>“Please what, princess?” I said mockingly, continuing to climb upward without waiting for her response. </p><p>“I’m almost there,” she begged, her tone far from her usual state and poise. “Just a bit more.” </p><p>“I know,” I answered with all the smugness I could muster. And my happiness wasn’t limited to her amusing state. The annoying tickle of my instincts that was trying to force me to act like an animal finally weakened a bit. It had some dangerous implications, but I ignored those for the moment and focused my attention on caressing the edges of Lillian’s breasts, doing my best to keep her on the edge. </p><p>Teased with a climax that I rejected to deliver, it wasn’t shocking for her hand to sneak down. Unfortunately for her, I grabbed her wrist the moment I noticed it, preventing her plan from succeeding. “No cheating, honey,” I said. </p><p>“Please,” she begged once more. “I want to…” she continued, but trailed off into silence. </p><p>Her sudden shyness was entertaining, especially when she chose not to mention her climax even when she was lying on her back, completely naked, receiving an extended oral treatment after a lengthy makeout session. “You want what?” I asked even as I raised my head from the valley between her breasts, hovering above her instead. “You need to be clearer.”</p><p> She was smart enough to realize without my explicit mention that I would find an entertaining punishment if she dared to pull her head away, but that didn’t change her beautiful eyes from darting to the sides reflexively. I leaned down, my stained lips just an inch away from hers. “Tell me what you want, princess,” I whispered before leaning even closer, her lips parting in preparation, but chose to stop just before making contact, adding another layer to her torturous pleasure. </p><p>“I want to…” she whispered, her breath dancing on my lips. She took a deep breath, and closed her eyes. “I want to … cum.”  </p><p>“Good,” I said, brushing her lips for a moment. “But I want you to say it while looking at my eyes,” I added, this time with a sharper tone. </p><p>She opened her eyes a few seconds later, dispelling my doubts about whether I pushed her too hard. Acceptance shone in them. “I want to cum,” she repeated, and much to my surprise, raised her head and initiated a heated kiss. I decided to reward her spectacularly, and pinned her down with my body while responding to her kiss. My fingers found her core and started dancing around her knob recklessly, helping her to travel the remaining distance to her rapture. </p><p>Soon, she started to moan. Moans that I did my best to suppress with my lips while her kiss lost the power behind it. Her body lost its tension as she lay on her back, trembling repeatedly, her juices staining the glass surface. I pulled back from the kiss, but had no intention of stopping the treatment. Instead, I moved down until my head was between her beautiful thighs once more. My tongue started its task once more, but this time, it was a merciless assault that didn’t give her a second to adapt, mercilessly driving her toward another orgasm. She tried to beg for a breather, but I ignored her passionate cries to push her for another climax. </p><p>Only when she started to writhe in the throes of another dash of pleasure did I pull back and sit in the corner of the boat, enjoying the amazing sight in front of me. I waited until she regained a semblance of awareness, and then spoke in a matter of fact tone that demanded obedience. “It’s time for you to return the favor, princess. Crawl to me!” I ordered, my legs parted to display my erection, leaving no ambiguity about what I was asking her to do. To my greatest pleasure, she followed my order without the slightest hesitation. Soon, she was on her knees in front of me, her delicate fingers wrapped around my shaft, ready to start her task… </p><p>However, the fates apparently decided that after that much entertainment, I needed some misfortune, because it was at that moment I noticed a bright flare cutting through the darkness, rapidly closing in on our boat. I raised my hand, a flare of magic gathering around my fingers, a curse on my lips…</p><p>Whatever the source was, they were going to regret cockblocking me… </p>
