        <p>The sight of Theodora licking her lips as she looked down was simply delicious, especially even her enthusiasm failed to hide the hint of hesitation. </p><p>I wasn’t sure about the source of that hesitation, maybe a lack of experience, maybe my displayed identity as a barbarian. Or maybe, I corrected as she looked up, worship shining in her eyes, it was just the desire she was feeling toward her savior. </p><p>And while she looked up,  I enjoyed admiring the unobstructed view of her fit, lithe body, the treasure that she decided to give to me freely, a moan following up as my hand landed on her shoulder, adding some pressure to pull her closer. </p><p>“You have spent a small treasure arranging this meeting. It would be a pity to waste it. Let’s give you your money’s worth,” I whispered throatily, rubbing my shaft against her lips.</p><p>A flash of shame passed through her gaze, but the speed her lips parted suggested the hold the shame wasn’t strong enough to keep her back. Not when she made a concerted effort to cover the head of my shaft with lengthy worship, like savoring a valuable dessert. </p><p>Her movements were hesitant, but her strategy was solid, making me think that it was the first time she was doing it, but it wasn’t the first time watching — not that it was shocking considering what went in the noble parties behind the closed doors. </p><p>However, her lack of practical experience didn’t mean she was lacking in motivation. She moved forward, swallowing half of my shaft at once before hitting her limits. </p><p>Well, what she considered as her limits. </p><p>She pulled back after a couple of attempts, a growl that was the mixture of pleasure and frustration as she looked down. “Not a bad first attempt,” I said with a chuckle, which was all needed to replace her frustration with determination. </p><p>She leaned down once again, pushing herself forward, devouring more of my shaft, accompanied by her gasps. </p><p>“Great enthusiasm, but little success,” I whispered with a chuckle, which earned a frustrated glare off her, though with half of my shaft in her mouth, it hardly conveyed the intimidating impact she was looking for. “Luckily, I’m willing to give you some accelerated training,” I whispered. </p><p>She mumbled an answer, which was not really audible with my shaft still in her mouth, but her expression was enough to convey her acceptance. </p><p>“Excellent. It might be a bit rough at first, and requires a lot from you, but I’m sure a little hardship is nothing for you,” I explained even as I tightened my hands behind her back. “Open wide.” </p><p>Theodora was quick to follow my order, opening her mouth more than I expected her to be capable, allowing me an excellent path. </p><p>And I pushed forward mercilessly, a beautiful gag escaping her mouth even as she realized just how far  I was planning to push. But rather than trying to push back, she accepted the invasion obediently while my shaft forcibly reshaped her throat. </p><p>She trembled in shock, but my firm grip held her in place. Her gags followed by moans, her hands clamping around my legs to reflect her growing interest, even stroking them affectionately, while I controlled the pace of the moment. </p><p>The way her throat clamped around my shaft was nice, while her breaths pushed her chest out, displaying her breasts beautifully, tempting me to pull one of my hands away from the back of her head to fondle her breasts instead. </p><p>She just shuffled, giving me better access, even as she took my shaft in repeatedly. Then, just as she was getting in the mood, I pulled back. “So, sweetie, how was your first attempt?” </p><p>“I don’t…” Theodora murmured, daze mixed with arousal, a slight slurring coloring her tone. “I don’t know what came over me." </p><p>I dragged my finger over her nipples, making her shiver. “That was not an  answer, sweetie.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured. “Maybe?” </p><p>“I need more than just a maybe, princess,” I said, amused that this time, she didn’t flinch being referred to as a princess. She stayed silent. “Honey, there’s no shame listening to the song of your body. There’s no one around trying to fit you into a little box to sell just how appropriate you are. You can be honest.” </p><p>“I … I did,” she murmured, somehow having more struggle admitting that than she had deep-throating my shaft. “I enjoyed it.” </p><p>“Excellent news,” I said even as I sat on the bed once more. “And since not only you have enjoyed it but also received a crash course in applied pleasure, why don’t you show me just how much you appreciate me.” </p><p>  “As you wish,” she said, though, I was shocked by the sudden smirk appearing on her face, like a ward had been triggered. She stood up, her body already swaying to an imaginary song. </p><p>The way her body moved was perfect, mixing ability with desire, telling me that there had been a lot of dance classes in her more comfortable days, probably a part of the traditional education she had received, or a hobby she followed on her own. </p><p>Regardless, with the way her sweaty olive skin caught the light, her core getting wetter and wetter, the sway of her naked body was simply glorious, seduction incarnate. Whatever compunction against dancing nude in front of me she might have had been destroyed by her aggressive training, she moved her body entrancingly, her hands traveling all over her body to sell her curves.</p><p>“Damn, you’re a wonder of magic,” I murmured even as I let my hand caress her skin, amazed at just how hot and seductive she looked. </p><p>Her body swayed, her hips swinging to an imaginary beat, tempting me with her call. I leaned forward and put my hand on the outside of her thigh. “It’s not allowed to touch the dancer,” she said, but she said that smugly, making no attempt to pull back. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said even as I dragged my hand up even as I pulled her closer, so that when my hand landed on her tight ass, she was dancing between my spread legs. I was tempted to actually push her back and tease her for that comment, but after everything she had achieved in such quick order, she deserved a proper reward. </p><p>She must be happy with the pace, because she made no alteration to her pace as I pulled her dangerously close to my shaft, even occasionally rubbing it against her inner thigh. Her moans were her only reaction. </p><p>Lost in a haze, her earlier commitment to no touching was abandoned completely when she grabbed my wrists, giving them to her breasts, bending her body to caress my body with her hair while I massaged them. </p><p>She must be enjoying the treatment, because she put her elbows to my knees to lean forward, giving me an even easier time massaging her breasts while her hips swayed hypnotically, so beautifully that I actually conjured a full-body mirror behind her, enjoying the glistening view of her pussy, covered with desire.</p><p>I bit my lips, trying to suppress my desire to just pull her to my lap. </p><p>She noticed my gaze going to somewhere else, and started speaking with a frown. “What could be more important than—“ she started as she turned, only to fall silent as she realized I was looking at the mirror behind her. </p><p>A mirror that gave her the perfect glimpse of her face, contorted with desire, almost like a pleasure slave. </p><p>“Isn’t this a wonderful view,” I said even as grabbed her hips and pulled her on my lap, though making sure that I didn’t slip inside her. I grabbed her legs and parted them open, revealing her sopping wet core, before dragging a finger over it. “Do you think it was wrong for me to look at your reflection, when it gave me such a beautiful view of treasure?”</p><p>Theodora said nothing, nor that she needed to with the way her hips already rocking against my shaft. I slipped a finger inside, and a delicious moan escaped her mouth while she leaned into my chest, giving me an even better angle to finger-fuck her. </p><p>Her hips rocked, but her earlier seductive rhythm was forgotten, replaced by a desperate pace, showing her increasing arousal as she rode both my hand and my shaft. Her growing arousal around my fingers was unmistakable.</p><p>A while later, I pulled my hand away, leaving her pussy spread wide, and drenched with desire. “Do you want me to fuck you?” I whispered. </p><p>“Yes,” she murmured deliriously, showing she was already on the edge of the pleasure, and very much enthusiastic about pushing forward. “Fuck me.” </p><p>“I will,” I whispered, deciding it was a good time to interrogate her a bit more about her identity. My initial aim was to keep her at arm's length, but considering I was going to trust her a sea voyage that might as well be deadly if she tried to sabotage it, a little more information about her wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>Just in case. </p><p>“Okay,” I whispered into her ear. “Just one condition,” I said, flaring my magic to make her daze even stronger as I positioned her above my shaft. She tried to slam herself down, but my hands prevented her from succeeding. “Tell me who you are, who you really are.” </p><p>“I’m…” she stammered, waiting for a second despite her daze, which was enough to show that the secret was even more important than I first gave credit for. Unfortunately, before I could take an action about that, her reluctance broke under the combined assault of her hero worship and her pleasure. </p><p>“I’m Princess Theodora, the oldest daughter of Emperor Zeno,” she gasped. My fingers lost their strength in shock for a moment, an opportunity she had leveraged excellently to sink herself onto my shaft… </p><p>The previous Emperor, actually. The one that had been killed in a palace coup by one of his generals, Basiliscus, who was the current Emperor. </p><p>I just had to ask! </p>
