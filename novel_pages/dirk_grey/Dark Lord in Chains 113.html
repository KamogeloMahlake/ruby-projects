        <p>“You need to be more careful about your surroundings," I said as I enjoyed her bosom, repeating the words I had used when she first noticed my presence. Or, at least, that was what I tried to say. Suffocated in her very special hug, it mostly escaped as a soft murmur. </p><p>“Sorry, I can’t hear you,” she said, but I could hear the mischievous edge in her voice. She was feeling naughty. It was a rare change, and if someone else tried to push back like that, I would have done my best to squash that early — I spent last night doing exactly that for Valkyrie, even. </p><p>Aria was different, however. With her position and my … significant feelings toward her, it was good for her to learn a bit more outspoken. Though, I had to admit, the fact that I could hear the punishment already on the move, getting closer with soft yet steady steps, was enough to confirm that. </p><p>I stayed down in her bosom until I heard the sound of a crash. Only then, I raised my head, and looked at the two shocked beauties. Aria was to be expected, her expression similar to the time she had been almost caught by Emma, long before our relationship had evolved into its current form, her pretty mouth open, her body frozen. </p><p>The maid was not too different, frozen and unable to move, with a large tray upturned, shattering porcelain pieces and hot tea around. While she looked at her princess in shock, not expecting to catch a royal — especially one with Aria’s saintly reputation and famed shyness —  in such a compromising position. </p><p>I turned my attention to the maid, with her jet black hair, lovely face, and beautiful body — as anyone that was serving royals directly could be nothing but perfect. </p><p>Even as she looked, I cast a spell on her, a complicated, almost useless one that required the target to be completely novice, and could be only cast by someone with my mental competency or better. It did nothing to her mind, just gave me a trigger, one that would convince me that anything that happened for the last few hours was a dream. </p><p>Just because I wanted to tease Aria didn’t mean I intended to ruin her reputation. And I certainly didn’t trust the current palace to properly vet anyone. </p><p>Yet, for some reason, the spell just failed to find a purchase. It didn’t get rebuffed, which would have been the case if she was just magically-aware, or countered. It just failed to find a purchase. </p><p>It was not normal. Not even close… </p><p>Until I understood what was going on, I decided to act like I was dealing with an ordinary maid — even if she clearly wasn’t. I doubted the non-maid was faking her shock, and even if she was, it showed she wanted to play along. </p><p>It was a good way to see what was going on. </p><p>I cast another spell, one that was even weaker, but trickier, the kind that I would never dare to cast without the assistance of the Tether to allow me to design complicated structures, creating a few layers to test the mana in the room. </p><p>Many sources of magic jumped toward me — the royal quarters were rather expensively furnished — but my focus was on the maid. It confirmed that she had suspiciously little magic on her, but I managed to detect a layer of illusion — one that centered around her head. </p><p>It was enough to confirm that she was actually a woman, and not a man acting as a woman. It shouldn’t be a concern, and strategically it wasn’t, but personally, I had a different view. And, I was not in the habit of sacrificing personal for strategic. </p><p>What was the point of power if you had to compromise on the things you liked? </p><p>Aria was one of the things I liked, very much, even, and I would never tease her like that in front of another man — especially the way I was planning for the next half an hour. Another woman … that was a different issue.</p><p>While I was considering the immediate findings, Aria slowly recovered. She looked at me. “Yes, your majesty,” I said, pushing an obedient, sullen expression on my face, one that Aria had never seen before. She didn’t need to see my wink to understand I was teasing her, but that hadn’t kept me from giving her one. </p><p>I wanted to tease her, because I certainly couldn’t trust her to keep her calm if I revealed her maid was not a maid. </p><p>“I … see,” she whispered, trembling as she said so as she turned to the non-maid. “Sweetie, why don’t you clean the mess?” she said as she looked at her, this time louder, her voice smooth enough to convince a six-year-old. </p><p>Maybe, in a good day … if the child was already distracted by a colorful toy. </p><p>Luckily for her, the poor spy was not in a better situation. The scandalous nature of the situation, the fear of the circumstances and the possible punishment — it was not her fault, of course, but the reality of the situation is that guilt didn’t matter, not when one party was a noble and the other a commoner. </p><p>Of course, her identity as a possible spy complicated the issue, but for now, she was playing the role of the shy maid perfectly. She freaked out, but only the appropriate amount and started fixing stuff. “Would you be requiring another tray, my princess?” she asked. </p><p>I nodded as I caught Aria’s gaze. </p><p>“Y-yes, we’ll need it,” she whispered, but the blush that followed my clue showed that she didn’t think before saying that. Yet, she was too self-conscious to correct that, or even fix the current state of her clothing, which revealed her amazing bosom far more than it was appropriate. </p><p>She didn’t ask why I wanted the maid to linger — she had an answer in her mind. Not a correct one, as I wouldn’t bother teasing a maid too much, at least not under the circumstances, while she was being overwhelmed by the identity of the princess. </p><p>A spy, on the other hand … that was a different story.</p><p>The spy started cleaning while I tugged Aria’s hand, and dragged her to the desk, but rather than walking around, I sat on the desk itself, not caring that it displayed my erection very visibly. Then, I pulled her onto my lap. </p><p>Teasing her was fun, but I had no intention of a potentially deadly danger taking over my fun — not now, not ever. If I was such a person, the first thing after I earned my freedom would be escaping and sliding into obscurity — if I ever attained the position of Dark Lord in the first place.  </p><p>“Is this acceptable for you, my princess?” I stage-whispered. </p><p>She trembled, while the spy sent a glance toward us, biting her lip in confusion, and a bit of arousal. That made me think that her feelings, awkwardness, and clumsiness, were not just an act, and she was a spy not due to her incredible acting, but due to her magical talents. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the first one — as I remembered Cinder using this exact trick to slide in. But, she was certainly not Cinder, of that I was sure. Even if she felt shy, she was the kind that would reflect it as pure anger outwardly. </p><p>Maybe I should try breaking her.  </p><p>There was no doubt about Aria’s sexiness. Her dress, with the front half open, was amazing enough before she started trembling in excitement. I touched the ties of her dress, opening the front even further, turning it into a positively scandalous thing — the kind that the Queen wore during her other job. </p><p>As I teased Aria, a delicious moan escaped her mouth, her body trembling. Her legs parted open involuntarily. It wasn’t a scandalous pose giving her dress, but it still revealed more of her beautiful legs. </p><p>While the spy continued to clean, Aria decided to take initiative, feeling naughty. She leaned down and captured my lips, her tongue attacking with an unusual intensity of passion, showing that our unlucky spy wasn’t the only one that was affected. </p><p>Her hips were another source of excitement, moving up and down to tease my erection. She did nothing to stop my fingers as they continued dealing with the dress … even when the dress pooled around her waist, revealing her amazing tits. </p><p>It was treason to reveal her like that to a spy, I decided as I helped her to cover. Pity, I had only my own two hands. I grabbed her tits and started squeezing, enjoying the mewling sounds that escaped her mouth despite the kiss… </p><p>I just needed to decide how to handle our spy…</p>
