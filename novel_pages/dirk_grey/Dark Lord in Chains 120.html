        <p>Filling the unfortunate elven spy with my seed was fun. Pity that I couldn’t focus on the beautiful sensation, not when I was already trying to come up with the best plan to integrate myself into the elven spy’s confidence; in mind as well as in body.</p><p>My initial, reflexive decision was to call Valkyrie so that they would trigger the fake assassination before the elven spy could take a move to stop it. But then, I stopped. Why should she bother to stop, when she had much better access to Aria, who was next in line? </p><p>I was sure I could convince her to allow assassination to happen and use it to hit back at Phoenixes … a good way to get rid of Cinder’s rivals. One spell, two birds. </p><p>Excellent ploy. </p><p>“Why don’t you fix your illusion and tend to the princess, while I go and pick the evidence,” I whispered. “Make sure you maintain your maid disguise, however. It’ll be very critical.” </p><p>“You think so,” she answered, still gasping as her body trembled after her most recent orgasm. Not that I blamed her, as our embrace had been rather challenging — for all her holes. </p><p>“Yes, I think so, miss elven spy,” I said as I slapped her ass, hard enough to explode. She managed to hide her gasp, but only for a moment. Soon, I slipped two fingers into her ass, and she gasped. “Try to play along. Your secret identity will help us a lot,” I added, using her distracted state to implement her simple suggestion, that we were a team. </p><p>Normally, it wouldn’t have been very effective … but things were different after the rough fucking she had just experienced. She was in a very suggestive state, and my fingers pushing into her ass were not helping. </p><p>“W-what do you want me to do?” she asked. </p><p>I looked at Aria, thinking of something that she would like without making the spy suspicious. “Bind her arms and legs, but lick her a bit, keep her from I’m not here,” I suggested, knowing Aria would enjoy it, and bondage should be enough to give the spy an illusion of control. </p><p>Leaving that beautiful sight was a disappointment, but I could have tried to do more, but once again, work interfered with my fun. I left them behind, and my next target was Sapphire’s study, picking all the supplies I could gather, without even making them aware of my presence. </p><p>I didn’t want to distract them from my plan, not before I could come up with a refreshed plan. In the secret tunnel, I sat down, and once again started to use some of my lesser-known skills. Two in particular. </p><p>Forgery, and knowledge of paperwork. Two underrated abilities when it came to spying. </p><p>When it came to spying, most people were more obsessed with digging the hidden information or converting enemy spies. Boring tasks like creating the necessary paperwork were trusted to commoner underlings with the necessary skills. Too bad for them that it usually allowed me to catch their attempts of misdirection. </p><p>Because, those commoners were never trusted with the true function of the forged paperwork, which meant they never came out truly right. For example, I was trying to forge some orders coming from the darklands, about setting up a new safe house. The details, such as using the correct cipher, were rather basic, and my opponents didn’t miss it as well. </p><p>The other details, like using the correct paper type, not so much. For example, darklands and Empire didn’t use the same type of trees to make paper, nor they used the exact same process. As a result, the paper had a different feeling. If I had the time, I would have imported the correct type of paper … but since I didn’t have the time, I needed to use some magic. </p><p>The kind that was used by the craftsman and other workers, carefully changed the nature of the paper to make it convincing. The ink, even the feather I used to write was used the same treatment…</p><p>Then, I started the difficult part. A pile of paperwork, some from the darklands, directly about the orders, some observation reports from the rival houses, even some innocent reports from the Empire, the kind that was created by city guards for incidents, unaware of the depths of the issue they had stumbled upon. </p><p>The strategic design of the paperwork didn’t take long. I was too used to creating misdirections. The trick was, never to spell out the full direction that the enemy needed to believe, as that only made it more suspicious. The trick was to create an outline that could have several explanations … then let the suggestions fill the rest.  </p><p>It was an art. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I murmured as I finished creating the necessary documentation, before started casting several more spells. Without the tether to assist me to cast several necessary spells in parallel, that step alone would have taken hours to get right, but the control helped me immensely. </p><p>Altogether, it created a beautiful, convincing story… </p><p>I packed the documents before returning, only to see our little spy was not idling. She had bound Aria as I had suggested, but unlike my suggestion, she hadn’t been licking. Instead, she was fingering her, and fingering furiously. She didn’t look like a maid, or even like a spy that was trying to look like a maid. She clearly wanted to make her payback for her earlier treatment. </p><p>Holding back my chuckle took everything I had even as I sneaked toward them, and she was distracted enough to miss my presence. Only when I slipped two fingers into her ass, she noticed my presence with a beautiful hiss. </p><p>“The documents are on the table,” I said as she turned to catch my gaze. </p><p>“Is this the best way to tell me?” she whispered back. </p><p>“Maybe not, but certainly the most fun way,” I answered as I added a third finger. “Just making sure our ploy is realistic before you walk away. You need an excuse to look exhausted. Now, play along,” I ordered, and I pulled Aria’s blindfold off. </p><p>It was enough for our spy to freeze, and I used the opportunity to replace my fingers with a different limb. Her gasp of shock was beautiful. “I’m trying to convince her to make you her permanent, special maid,” I whispered, reminding her of her role. </p><p>She grunted as she tried to contain a cry, while I turned my attention to Aria. “She’s a very enthusiastic maid, isn’t she, my princess. Very discrete,” I said, pausing as I pulled back, and slammed even deeper. “And very discrete.” </p><p>“You think so?” Aria stammered between moans, clever enough to keep her statement vogue to allow me to play. </p><p>“Yes, my princess. I’ll make sure she keeps her mouth and attends to you more often. You can trust me, in everything.” </p><p>“I — know,” she said, interrupted by a gasp in between. “She’s very cooperative.” </p><p>“Yes, my princess. She clearly loves this," I crooned, pushing deep. I pumped hard and fast, causing her resolve to crack, as her breath burst through her lips in a loud moan.</p><p>Keeping my pumping, he reached over and grabbed her tits, twisting her nipples for additional arousal. Once again, my insistent pumping was not just about the pleasure, but I had an ulterior motive. This time, I wanted her to leave extremely exhausted, which would make following her to her base even easier. </p><p>I needed to understand her path and her other assets to manipulate her correctly. </p><p>A plan that worked when I pulled out, only for her to collapse immediately. “I think the princess had enough of your services, sweetie, why don’t you fix yourself and leave,” I ordered as I spanked her ass… </p><p>As she stumbled away for her ruined clothing, I leaned to steal a kiss from Aria … my mind was already on the plan once more.</p>
