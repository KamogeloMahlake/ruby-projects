        <p>Mia couldn’t help but feel frustrated as she stood at the entrance of the private club she had been invited by Madam Presley, ready to earn the goodwill she needed to make the deal.</p><p>Or, more accurately, asking her employee to make that sacrifice. She might have felt bad for asking an employee to do such a thing, but two things prevented her from feeling that. First, from the way Darion looked at Madam Presley, he clearly had no concerns about making that ‘sacrifice’.</p><p>Second, he had already extracted the price from her … in a very memorable encounter at her office. </p><p>If only that didn’t make her suddenly feel a sense of loss. After all, the only reason she agreed to that deal was that Darion was not her boyfriend, and she wouldn’t have felt anything once Madam Presley took him … no sense of loss. </p><p>But, after the office encounter, she was feeling differently. </p><p>“So, any last-minute thoughts?” Darion asked, his tone mocking. </p><p>“Of course not, why?” she answered rapidly. </p><p>“Well, maybe you changed your mind and decided to keep me for yourself?” </p><p>“Of course not. As I would ever want you?” she answered, doing her best to sound convincing. Though, from the mocking laughter he responded, it seemed that she wasn’t as successful as she wished. </p><p>“Let’s go before she gets suspicious,” he said, which was a nice sentiment. His hand, however, wasn’t as nice — or too nice — as it suddenly landed on her ass, mauling as he owned her. </p><p>“Keep your hand away —“ she started, interrupted by a squeeze and a moan, the latter coming from her. </p><p>“And make her suspicious. Don’t forget that we’re supposed to be lovers. Otherwise, she won’t be enjoying stealing me.” </p><p>Mia growled in anger, but as he pulled her, she started walking with him. “I’ll make you pay,” she warned. </p><p>He squeezed her ass again. “Oh, honey. I would love to see you try.”</p><p>Mia didn’t say anything else until they stood in front of Madam Presley. “Wow, this place is amazing,” Mia said, excited. “I can’t believe you have this place for private parties.” </p><p>“Benefits of success, sweetie,” Madam Presley answered. “I’m sure a smart girl like you would have a similar place one day.” Her smile turned mocking. “Actually, why don’t you go and enjoy the sea. The water is perfect at this hour…” </p><p>She felt a sense of humiliation, one that she hid by removing her transparent dress and revealing her beautiful body. “A good idea,” she whispered, doing her best to hold back the humiliation of sacrificing her boyfriend …</p><p>Even though Darion was certainly not her boyfriend. </p><p>***</p><p>“She’s beautiful, isn’t she?” the woman said as she looked at Mia. “You’re lucky to have such a beautiful girlfriend.” </p><p>Darion just smirked as he turned his attention to her, doing his best to look obedient, even though even a temporary action was enough to get on his nerves. Luckily, he would soon teach the rich woman that controlling him wasn’t as easy as she thought. </p><p>However, the beautiful body she displayed was enough to eschew the value of patience. He wanted to see just how far she would push. </p><p>“Oh, I’m certainly lucky,” he said as he let his gaze linger. </p><p>She smirked. “Did she talk about our little deal before we sealed the deal?” </p><p>“She mentioned that we have to seal the deal,” Darion answered, though he didn’t work particularly hard to look subservient. She was smug enough to write off his attitude as pointless. </p><p>“Good, I just hope you’re a giving lover,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry, Madam Presley. I have always been a fair lover, exactly as you deserve,” he said, enjoying alternating between the extremely crude and extremely respectful, letting her pick what she wished, knowing she would get the wrong message. </p><p>“Now, kiss,” she said as she raised her leg. </p><p>Darion decided to lean and place a soft kiss on her foot, even though it annoyed him intensely. He wanted to see just how far she would push … so he would know exactly how much punishment she deserved. </p><p>He thought that she would avoid punishment when she changed her position and gave him the view of her tight ass, but her next words changed his mind. “Lick my soles,” she ordered. </p><p>And he was certainly not willing to do that. </p><p>“The soles,” he said as he grabbed her ankle, and flipped her, enjoying her surprised expression. “How about if we move up on the line a bit.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, which was all she was able to say as he took a step and hovered above her, his fingers finding her wetness over her swimsuit. “That’s too quick—“ she started, only for a gasp to stop her. </p><p>“Come on, Madam, you wanted me. It’s only fair you get the full experience rather than watering it down. Don’t tell me you didn’t dream of me fucking you when you saw me and Mia at the office.” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she answered, which was all she was able to say before her moans got louder and louder. He continued teasing her core repeatedly, her moans getting more and more intense. </p><p>“Now, let’s get rid of this boring stuff and have some real fun,” he said, and got rid of her swimsuit. </p><p>Her naked body was tempting, but not as tempting as her panicked expression as she realized she lost control completely.</p>
