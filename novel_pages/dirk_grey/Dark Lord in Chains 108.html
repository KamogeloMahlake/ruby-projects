        <p>“Yes, not bad …” Sapphire muttered, but her gaze was already on my face, trying to get the correct answer. Maybe it would be more appropriate for me to take it over, I considered. </p><p>It certainly would be more entertaining. </p><p>“ … but it would be much better if you can take over. It’s unseemly for a Queen to handle the punishment herself,” she continued, a gaze all she needed to understand my intention and pass the baton to me. </p><p>She deserved a reward, but that was for the future. First, I had something else to focus on. </p><p>“Did you hear the royal decree,” I asked with a chuckle even as I grabbed her hair, but neither pushed nor pulled, giving her the chance to pull back if she so wished — just at the expense of rejecting her Queen’s order and admit she couldn’t handle it at the same time. </p><p>I knew her well enough to remove that from the range of possibilities. </p><p>Her gaze turned upward, her beautiful eyes filled with frustration and anger, intense, but not intense enough to hide the arousal dancing in its depths. Punishment was a complicated issue for her, but delivered by the Queen she had declared her loyalty somehow made it less complicated. </p><p>She pushed her head down, capturing my shaft enough to show she had no intention of surrendering to the punishment. </p><p>“Excellent, right?” I asked Sapphire while I pushed Valkyrie’s head down, assisting her now that she had clearly declared her intention toward the new aspect. </p><p>“Yeah, for a beginner,” Sapphire answered, dismissive on the surface, but I was familiar enough to recognize the hint of jealousy in her tone. She was clearly not too happy with the sudden attention Valkyrie was getting as the focus turned away from her punishment to punishment itself, but her obedience was intense enough to keep her lips shut. </p><p>I wondered which was affecting her mood more, the Queen, or the Dancer… </p><p>Either case, I didn’t want it to suddenly turn into a problem, so I gestured as an invitation, calling her next to me. </p><p>She rose to her feet, swaying to the imaginary music of a dance that had been never heard before, which made her body sway magically, enough to inspire a thousand poets — too bad they would never see that. </p><p>I could even sense several threads of sensuous mana wrapping around her, enhancing the move. I didn’t comment and just focused on enjoying, as they were not there to affect me magically, but just to enhance the beauty of her dance. </p><p>Fascinating and inspiring. </p><p>“Continue, my Queen,” I ordered, the dance beautiful enough to change my mind. </p><p>Valkyrie swayed under my fingers restlessly, feeling my lack of attention — and, predictably, it annoyed her even more than the punishment itself. </p><p>She was a loyal and proud knight, but I had always suspected her pride was stronger than her loyalty — especially toward her Queen and not people. Her current restlessness felt like a confirmation of that little detail.</p><p>To her credit, Sapphire was making it really hard for her to focus on her oaths of loyalty right now. </p><p>I pressed her head down further, her lips reaching further and further along my lip, continuously touching areas that were previously dry.</p><p>Until my full length was hidden in her beautiful throat, filling the room with her gasping and gagging. Sapphire started to dance even more intensely, treating it as a part of her performance. </p><p>A good call. It fit perfectly to her naked dance, each move filled with not just a distant eroticism, but also an intense, burning desire, enough to make my mouth dry. </p><p>Maybe it was good that we were about to arrange her assassination and free her from her Queenly duties. Dancing was clearly her true calling, one she would be much happier to continue — as my exclusive dancer, of course, but some sacrifice was inevitable. </p><p>Or maybe, not completely private. Some needed to share that, and what better person than her loyal knight Valkyrie. </p><p>“Let’s start the real punishment,” I murmured as flared my mana, and two more chains appeared around her, wrapping around her legs, while the one around her arms, forcing her hands to her back, tightened further. </p><p>The chains levitated, pulling her along with them, making her float and make her turn, allowing her to look at her Queen; while giving me an excellent view of her hips and sopping wet core. </p><p>“What a beautiful dance, isn’t it,” I commented. She had let out a pained gasp, but that might be less about the show, and more about the sudden tightening of her chains even as she was lowered. I only cast a spell to clean her puckered entrance, one that carried only trace amounts of lubrication — enough to prevent any kind of injury, but not limit the sense of discomfort the slightest. </p><p>After all, it was still a punishment. </p><p>Valkyrie failed to answer my question, too busy trying to contain her cries as she tried to deal with my sudden … ambush. </p><p>Sapphire continued her amazing dance, but her lips curled in mocking, teasing Valkyrie for her failure. </p><p>“Look, even your Queen doesn’t think that you can handle the punishment. Maybe we should just forgive you,” I whispered. </p><p>“Never,” Valkyrie growled, her body tightening with anger as she used the floating chains to push herself down, taking more of my shaft despite the pain. It was amusing just how quickly her respect and loyalty toward her Queen could turn into pure competitiveness. </p><p>To her credit, the sight of said Queen, naked and dancing erotically rather than sitting on a throne impassively, contributed to that greatly. </p><p>Framing mattered. It was why I had built my castle dark and forbidding, and even had a spiky throne during my stint as the Dark Lord. Conveying the message like that was much more efficient than constantly killing annoying subordinates who thought that not enjoying the pointlessly edgy aesthetics would mean I would be more forgiving for treason as well. </p><p>“You still didn’t share your opinion on your Queen’s dance show,” I commented as her hips continued to rock over my length, getting looser and looser. “Don’t tell me that you find it ugly. It would count as treason as well.” </p><p>The frustrated expression she wore as she twisted her neck to look at me was simply marvelous. I chuckled as I observed her expression, giving myself a chance to focus on the moment even more. </p><p>“It’s alright if she can’t handle it, after all, I’m a merciful Queen,” Sapphire commented as she took a step forward, her smile beautifully vindictive; all Dancer, no Queen. </p><p>Valkyrie opened her mouth, but her words faded into a moan as I chose that moment to twist her nipples, the combination of pain and pleasure enough to steal her breath for a long moment. </p><p>A moment Sapphire used very efficiently as she took a step forward to cover the distance, her lips curled in victory.  </p><p>I spent a moment enjoying that smile before turning my focus back to Valkyrie — as the fact that she could get such a pure sense of victory from pulling one over one of her loyal knights showed just how intensely she craved my hold over her. </p><p>What else one could ask from a Queen? </p><p>“You need a better angle to view that show,” I said as I pulled back, the chains already moving to position her in her new location. </p><p>Laying on the bed, prone, her ass pointing upward with the assistance of a pillow under her. I positioned myself behind her, and summoned a crop — one made of fire, one that was imbued with the healing aspect of it. </p><p>“Ahh--“ she started as that crop of fire hit her, but she cut it halfway. “W-what was that?” she asked. “There was pain, but also … there was not…” </p><p>“That was your new punishment,” I said as I pushed forward, once again sliding into her gaping hole as I used the crop on her back, getting another confused moan. Her confusion was understandable, as while a crop made of pure flames sounded scary and painful, the presence of living fire complicated the impact very much. </p><p>Especially since it was focused on the healing aspect. And, with the intensity of the flames reasonably soft, any damage that it created disappeared before the body could even register and was replaced by the comfortable feeling of healing. </p><p>I had chosen that trick for two reasons. First, I didn’t want to actually hurt Valkyrie, and the trick was just at the level of candle-play, impressive looking, but ultimately harmless. Second, it was a good way for me to multitask and expand my abilities over my newly acquired power. </p><p>Each second was precious, and while I was hedonistic enough to never turn away from a beautiful threesome with the Queen and her loyal knight, there was no harm to mix some magic practice. </p><p>Especially since it didn’t stop my reckless drive down to her beautiful core, ending up in a spectacular explosion that filled her bowels with my mark, and filled the room with her passionate yet confused cries. </p><p>Distracted by the changing position, I had forgotten to follow up on my earlier point. Sapphire didn’t. “Now, you have got a better view of my dance, what’s your opinion,” she said as she stood in front of Valkyrie, her hand passing through her hair, pulling her head up hard enough to be uncomfortable…  </p>
