        <p>As expected, the bar didn’t have many customers after the attack. The small fry avoided the place completely, afraid of what might happen. </p><p>We still had several twitchy visitors, each low-ranking member from organizations big enough to care about the attack, but personally disposable enough that </p><p>It had been a nice test run. With Emily’s help, I was able to dig deeper into their backgrounds, giving me a chance to actually identify their actual operations and some other convenient details. I had yet to use any aggressively, as it was just a test run, but it was still helpful enough. </p><p>It was barely eleven when we had no other customers, so I decided to close the bar early. “Can you sand off the paint from the laser cannon before starting to clean,” I asked Tara, which was far easier with her power. </p><p>While she was busy with that, I went upstairs and changed once more. This time, my disguise included a large suitcase with a roller, enough to fit the laser cannon while making it easy to carry. Not the ideal method to carry something, but the best I had. </p><p>“Keep your phone on and charged, in case I call to alert you,” I said to Tara before I left through the tunnel. The cameras also had an alarm system, but I didn’t trust it to keep even a half-decent infiltrator out. </p><p>While I was passing through my office, I decided to take a million dollars from the safe — and wasn’t that a shocking amount — and put it in my luggage. After the attack, it was safer to shift some money away. Most, I planned to bury into several random hidden spots, trusting my powers to identify spots that would stay untouched, though a small portion was there to bribe and awe Emily, so that she would actually modify the laser cannon. </p><p>I needed some encouragement considering the source. </p><p>Technically, I could have hidden its origin since there was no news about Chrome Defender’s defeat, but that would be a stupid risk. She was the receptionist of the guild. Not to mention, her power made it very likely for her to discover something more suspicious.  </p><p>No, being honest — for a very stretched definition of it — was the better choice. </p><p>Even after setting several emergency points with cash and other valuables, I arrived at my destination before midnight. Emily opened the door, still wearing the bathrobe she shared photos of earlier, only for her eyes to widen when she noticed my large luggage. “That’s rather oversized for an overnight bag, isn’t it?” she said. </p><p>“Well, that’s something we need to talk about, actually. There’s a little … issue.” </p><p>“Come in,” she gasped as she took a step to the side. She was quick to panic, which, under different circumstances, would have been problematic. But, considering my aim was to manipulate her, it was a godsend. “What happened,” she asked. </p><p>“Let’s talk in your room,” I said as I brought the luggage inside. She walked next to me, her beautiful expression twisted. I used the opportunity to enjoy her beauty. The bathrobe looked good on her, especially since it was on the shorter side. </p><p>She clearly wore it after her selfies wearing it earned a lot of compliments from me. </p><p>Now, as she walked hurriedly in panic, it pulled even higher, giving a glimpse of her hips, high enough to show that she wasn’t wearing any underwear. I had to admit. She made a good choice not changing it. She had better clothes … but there was a certain charm in her short bathrobe when combined with her curvy body and her blonde hair. </p><p>She looked fascinating. </p><p>I wanted to push her against the wall and have my way with her, especially when she forgot to pay attention to her robe — which had been already strategically loosened when she opened the door to get my attention, but getting more revealing than she planned thanks to her distraction — but I decided against it. </p><p>It would be harder to convince her about the importance of my sudden distress if I spent an hour enjoying her soft tits. </p><p>“Tell me what’s going on,” she said as she took a deep breath. </p><p>“You remember how I accidentally got recruited by a villain,” I said. She nodded. “Well, apparently, while I was with you, our bar had been attacked by a hero.” She gasped. “A hero … from the New Giant Force,” I finished. </p><p>“Impossible, it would have been on the news,” she said in shock. </p><p>I put my finger on her lips, happy to see she still took direction well. “Not if they lost,” I said. </p><p>“Who was it?” </p><p>“Chrome Defender,” I said. “I have seen the video. He has lost handily.” </p><p>The moment I gave the name, Emily’s expression of incredulousness fell off. “Not a surprise,” she growled. I quirked my eyebrow. “Well, I don’t know his identity, but more than one support staff was complaining about how much of a diva he was being during the armor fitting and training.” </p><p>“An interesting situation,” I said. </p><p>“He’s a legacy,” she said with a dismissive wave. I looked at her questioningly, and she continued. “It means he’s likely has other family members that’s either hero, or backing the guild financially. So, they get to join as a hero.” </p><p>“Even if they are totally unqualified to be trusted with an expensive power armor.” </p><p>“Exactly,” she said with a jealous sigh. Understandable, considering she actually had a power that could be useful in a variety of ways, yet they merely used her as a receptionist. </p><p>I was happy with her reaction. It meant my job would be even easier. I didn’t say anything else, just opened the luggage and revealed the content. “Wow, he really lost, huh,” she said, immediately recognizing the laser cannon. “Why do you have it?” </p><p>“It’s the reason why I’m here,” I said. “The attack scared me, so I managed to convince them to give me the arm.” </p><p>“How?” she said. </p><p>“I might have implied that I knew a hacker that could turn this into a useful weapon,” I said, and her eyes widened. “Please, try it for me. With it, I can defend myself when the next attack comes. I don’t want to be killed by the villains.” </p><p>“Why the villains?” she asked. </p><p>“Watch this,” I said as I pulled my burner phone and passed it to her, which only had things that fitted my story in case she decided to poke. I pressed the play. “Watch where he’s aiming,” I said, slowing down and deliberately avoiding shouting at the warehouse. “That’s a hidden Syndicate base, but he deliberately avoided it. I’m afraid that they planned that together.” </p><p>“But …” she started, only to freeze. “Him being useless is one thing, but actually working together with the villains.” </p><p>“Well, you suspected he’s a rich kid, right. What if they got rich with the help of the Syndicate,” I said, followed by a long argument that I basically repeated the same argument again and again in slightly different words. </p><p>“Alright. I will try,” she said with a sigh, convinced, and I didn’t even offer her money. She put her hand on the laser cannon, only for her eyes to widen. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“Nothing … well, nothing except whoever wrote this software is a moron,” she added. </p><p>“Do you know how to code?” I said. </p><p>“Not particularly. I just started learning,” she said. “But, I can understand how this device is supposed to work, and how software interacts with it. It works as well as a car with square tires. The code itself is not bad … just bland. The real problem is they have no idea about the capabilities of the device.” </p><p>I had a stray thought about why it might be the case, but I ignored it for the moment as I focused on the moment. </p><p>“Can you fix it so that I could use it?” I said, hiding my excitement when she nodded absentmindedly. The shopping trip earlier already showed that her powers were better than her guild had thought, but her quick nod suggested that it was even better than I had thought. </p><p>Especially since, I had no doubt that they had already taken some measures to protect their weapon to be used by the others. But, whatever those methods were, they were helpless against her direct touch. </p><p>What a dangerous application. Though, with both of us as examples, I couldn’t help but wonder how many people had ignored their potentially very dangerous power. </p><p>A shuddering thought. </p><p>“Well, I think I can set up a new controller and install it on your phone,” she started. “Luckily, the laser cannon has its own temporary power source, so you don’t have to plug it, but once it’s shot once, you have to keep it plugged for at least a day for it to recover, unless you have some kind of exotic reactor,” she explained. </p><p>“Can you add some limiter, so that I can take multiple weaker shots with it if needed,” I said. </p><p>“It’ll be harder,” she said.</p><p>I smiled even as I moved next to her, and put my hands on her shoulders, which pushed her bathrobe slightly to enhance her incredible cleavage even more. “Do that, and I’ll do anything you want,” I whispered. </p><p>“Anything?” she asked, the hitch in her tone as arousing as her erotic look. </p>
