        <p>It was hard to believe, but there were drawbacks to spending the night with two spectacularly beautiful women who were willing to do a lot to win their self-appointed competition, followed by a little video adventure featuring a sexy blonde, enthusiastic to get a blow-by-blow summary of the events. </p><p>Though, saying that sentence out loud would have been enough to kick me out of the manhood club permanently. </p><p>The biggest drawback was the challenge of waking up the next day as my alarm blared, forcing me out of bed for my morning training. It might be Sunday, but as an aspirant athlete, I didn’t have the luxury of skipping morning training. </p><p>No matter how exhausting it had been dealing with Sarah and Naomi the night before. Ultimately, Naomi hadn’t been too challenging, as, overwhelmed by the threesome that represented her first time, it didn’t take long for her to surrender to pleasure. And it took a while for her to wake up once she collapsed. </p><p>Unfortunately — though, that word was only accurate from the perspective of the exhaustion and not the great pleasure that I felt in the process of accumulating said pleasure — Naomi’s challenge elevated Sarah’s competitiveness to the next level, challenging me for another exhausting session while Naomi took her well-deserved nap, challenging me to take her down.</p><p>And she was ready to push hard when Naomi finally woke up from her nap and dragged her away. I would have expected Naomi to join us for another session, but after her nap, the shy aspects of her personality reestablished herself and decided to leave, dragging Sarah away as well.  </p><p>It was the reason I was waking up to an empty bed after that spectacular threesome. </p><p>With a sigh, I reached for my phone to silence my alarm, only to see the notification of one last message from Carrie. ‘Your reward for being a good boy,’ the message read, and accompanying it was a photo of her, wearing a cheerleader skirt — and nothing else. And just to make things better, the skirt was positioned in a way that covered absolutely nothing. </p><p>“Good girl,” I murmured even as I looked at the photo, its erotic beauty enough to dispel my desire to go back to sleep. Not that my reward was undeserved, because she kept me up for almost another half an hour despite my exhaustion while she received a blow-by-blow report of her friends’ adventures, her voice getting suspiciously gaspy toward the end of my story.</p><p>After a brief pause in the kitchen where I made myself a large protein shake to jumpstart my metabolism, I went to the garden and started a long, grueling set of exercises, both more exhausting and not as fun as the ones I had completed the night before. </p><p>Three hours later, I had finished my full schedule, leaving my muscles burning, completely spent. </p><p>After that, I still needed to study, but I was unable to resist the call of exhaustion. After a quick shower, I threw myself into the bed… </p><p>Only to be woken up by the sound of my phone again. The first thing I checked was the time, which told me that I had been sleeping for two hours, though my exhausted body certainly didn’t agree with that fact. </p><p>I prepared to shout at the idiot who decided that annoying someone on a Sunday morning was a good idea. Then, I noticed the caller. </p><p>Carrie. </p><p>“Is there anything I could help you with, sweetie,” I asked, my plans to admonish the caller immediately abandoned. After all, there were perks to being a sexy and enthusiastic curvy blonde in the process of discovering a hobby of seducing her friends indirectly.  </p><p>Not to mention I genuinely enjoyed her company. </p><p>“I wanted to check if you have finished all the studying you promised that you’ll finish,” she said. I couldn’t help but smirk as I listened to her voice, her usual soft tone replaced by a sharp authority, the subject of studying enough to show her strong side. </p><p>“Well…” I murmured. </p><p>“You didn’t, then,” she commented, quick to cut me off. “Are you being lazy?” </p><p>“Hey, whose fault is that,” I said, unable to keep myself back. “We were supposed to finish them Friday, but then you decided to change that plan.” </p><p>“Hey, that part is Sarah’s fault,” Carrie said, quick to defend herself. </p><p>I disagreed of course, as after the initial push, she was far too enthusiastic to actually push that to the completion, but I let that slide. “How about Saturday, then? It wasn’t Sarah who brought Naomi along.” </p><p>That earned a beautiful silence. “Anyway,” she said after a cute cough. “You need to finish your homework.” </p><p>“I promise I’ll finish them,” I added, unable to hold my chuckle. “Just let me sleep for ten more minutes.” </p><p>“No, you can’t be trusted,” she answered, which was a rather unearned dig, but I let that slide because I recognized the shift in her tone. “I’ll come for a visit and make sure you finish it.” </p><p>“As you wish, madam teacher,” I said, earning a beautiful giggle. “Did you have any breakfast, or should we eat together.” </p><p>“I already had my lunch,” she corrected, her tone once again echoing a disappointed tutor. “Be ready in twenty minutes.” </p><p>“As you wish, madam teacher,” I repeated. </p><p>“Don’t be sassy,” she answered, though I could hear the momentary flare of confidence already shattering. “And, if you can finish it on time, I have another surprise reward for you.” </p><p>“I’m not sure I can survive another of your surprise rewards,” I said, though even as I said that, I felt a stirring in my loins, the idea enough to awaken my exhaustion. </p><p>“Does this mean that you don’t want my surprise,” she murmured, though with a soft, seductive tremble rather than panicked stammer, showing just how far her confidence had come in the last few days. </p><p>“Hey, I didn’t say that,” I said, unable to keep my chuckle down. “There are things that are worth dying for.”</p><p>“Good,” she whispered throatily. “Because I have an excellent surprise for you if we can finish everything on time.” With that, she ended the call. </p><p>I wanted to continue sleeping, but Carrie’s surprise was more than enough to pull me back to my feet — especially since she was showing an impressive performance when it came to surprises. </p><p>Instead, I changed and dashed to the kitchen for a quick — though not small — breakfast, then went back upstairs, collecting all the assignments I needed to complete. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk at the additional benefit of hanging around with Carrie. Not only did I have far more action than I would have seen if I was dealing with the cheerleaders but also I wasn’t dealing with any kind of drama. </p><p>Technically, I was dealing with a lot of drama, but I liked the method they had chosen to handle it. </p><p>More importantly, rather than making me abandon my responsibilities, it actually helped me focus on them more. Carrie’s presence meant that I not only finished my assignments better, but also I learned more, which prepared me better for my upcoming college life. </p><p>What a great decision it was to deal with her. </p><p>Then, just as I prepared everything on the desk, the doorbell rang. I went down to open the door, not even bothering to check who was the visitor. </p><p>It was Carrie, of course, but that didn’t mean she failed to surprise me. My eyes widened as I took a note of her clothing… </p><p>She was dressed as a strict teacher. </p><p>Or more accurately, an erotic movie’s version of a strict teacher. The first thing I noticed was the pencil skirt, long, but not long enough to completely cover the thigh-high stocking she was wearing, as well as giving hints of a garter belt. </p><p>Below, she wore red stilettos, bright enough to give her a fiery aura that made my mouth water.  </p><p>Yet, as impressive as her skirt and accessory choices looked impressive, it was nothing compared to what was going on upstairs. </p><p>She had chosen a serious-looking white blouse. Or more accurately, it would have looked serious if it wasn’t for the fact that more than half of the buttons were open, creating a cleavage that was far too deep to be safe. </p><p>Deep enough to reveal she wore no bra, enough to give a hint of her erect nipples. </p><p> She said nothing, but as she shifted her weight, her lovely breasts swung freely within her loose blouse, which had a beautiful impact on my hormones, stirring them into action. </p><p>The study session certainly promised to be fun… </p>
