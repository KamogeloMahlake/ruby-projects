        <p>Watching Tiffany and Umi walk away was a unique treat, the confidence of the redhead contrasting greatly with the shyness of the brunette as they slowly disappeared into the restaurant, while I seared the sight of their swaying lips into my mind. </p><p>I was resigned to boredom until their return, assessing the relative merits of flirting with the waitress versus playing with my phone, when my phone rang from a call from Tiffany. Curious, I answered, only to hear Umi speaking from a distance. </p><p>“Wasn’t that a bit … much,” she murmured. Even without seeing her face, I could imagine her expression, her black eyes wide, and her pouty lips trembling. </p><p>“Oh, honey, don’t be naive,” Tiffany answered, her voice similarly distant. Her ploy was clear. She had called me so that I could get a sneak peek of their discussion. Such a thoughtful little kitten, maybe even to a point of deserving a second pair of shoes in our promised shopping trip.</p><p>“But weren’t we just going to flirt with him slightly, nothing more,” Umi pushed, well what counted pushing in her land of minimal assertiveness. Coming from anyone else, that tone could only be classified as a kind remark. </p><p>“Sweetheart, don’t be naive,” Tiffany said. “He’s a rich and powerful businessman, not a teenager at high school. Do you really think that you could make him sign tens of thousand dollars in bonus just by fluttering your pretty eyelashes? We need to impress him. Really impress him.” </p><p>“But your husband said-” Umi countered, her voice getting higher. It was a pity that I wasn’t with them, seeing her expression blossoming into doubt and shock. I had no doubt that it would have been an amazing expression. </p><p>“My husband said what he thinks as the truth,” Tiffany cut her off. </p><p>“But, that’s…” Umi tried to answer, only to fail halfway. I was willing to bet that she was about to accuse Tiffany of cheating on her husband but lacked the courage to do so. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie. Being a housewife is more complicated than you think. You need to make some sacrifices occasionally, unless you want your husband to work late every single night while others get the credit. But you need to keep your husband away from the more gritter aspect. It’s what being a good housewife means in this century.” </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed as I listened to the pure drivel Tiffany was spewing, only to sound halfway believable coming from her beautiful lips. </p><p>The silence stretched for a while Umi considered her words. With her decision-making impaired by the fancy hotel that she was clearly not too used to combined with the natural trust she had toward Tiffany —a natural consequence of her mentality of them against me, unaware that the game was rigged from the start— Umi was finding hard to put an effective defense. “How far?” she finally asked after a minute of silence. </p><p>“How far, what, sweetheart?” Tiffany said, not hiding her small but mocking giggle. </p><p>“How far we need to go?” she asked. “I don’t want to betray my soon-to-be husband. I can’t,” she repeated. </p><p>“Decisive, I like it,” Tiffany said before pausing for a moment. “It depends on you, sweetie. The more you give, the more your husband benefits. There’s a lot of things we could do without betraying your husband. Do you have a swimsuit with you, for example?” </p><p>“I do,” she said. </p><p>“No you don’t, not if they are anything like your other horrible clothing,” Tiffany said sharply. Umi gasped. “Don’t be offended, honey, I’m just trying to help you. You have two options. Either get physical or impress him from a distance. And since you don’t want to do the first one, you need to do the second.” </p><p>Umi spoke only after another lengthy pause. “I don’t know, maybe I should just abort it. It’s not for me.” </p><p>I wasn’t worried at her words, trusting Tiffany to handle her flickering panic efficiently. “It’s your call, as long as you think he wouldn’t take it personally, feel free to do it,” Tiffany countered. </p><p>“Personal!” Umi gasped, shocked. “But we just had a dinner.” </p><p>“A dinner that you didn’t even bother to put something decent, before abandoning him halfway,” Tiffany corrected. “If you don’t give him at least something to remember you nicely, he might think you’re teasing him. And a powerful man like that doesn’t react being jerked around well.” </p><p>“But…” Umi whispered, her tone trembling. “It wasn’t what I thought…” </p><p>“I know, sweetheart. I know,” Tiffany repeated, acting like she was consoling her. “But it’s just for a night if you don’t want a repeat. I’ll do everything. You just need to stay until the end, and look pretty. Can you do that for me?” </p><p>Umi said nothing, but it wasn’t hard to imagine her nodding obediently, her resistance easily broken down, especially at the whispers of someone she marked as a friend, her trusting nature pushing her toward a different path. </p><p>“So, let’s make you more presentable, so that you can at least salvage the rest of the dinner before we go to the hot tub.” </p><p>“Hot tub, at this hour?” </p><p>“Of course, honey. Why else do you think I asked whether you have a swimsuit?” </p><p>“I thought it was for tomorrow,” Umi commented, earning yet another condescending giggle from Tiffany, who was clearly enjoying the role she was playing. But rather than Tiffany saying something, Umi gasped again. “W-what are you doing!” </p><p>“Making you more presentable, of course,” Tiffany said in a matter-of-fact tone. “But if you’re unsatisfied with impressing him from the distance and want to get closer, be my guest,” she said, before adding another giggle. “He’s certainly not bad on the eyes. I would understand it.” </p><p>“It’s not that,” Umi cried. “But do you really go as far as to remove-” she started, but I was unable to hear the rest of her sentence. This time, not because Tiffany cut her off, but because she turned off the call, no doubt not wanting me to listen to the details of their fashion choices. </p><p>It was a good call, as my mind was already churning possible adjustments she could make on Umi’s clothing. Unfortunately, there weren’t a lot of options since she was wearing jeans, which, unlike a skirt, couldn’t be adjusted conveniently. </p><p>When they appeared in my sight again, however, I was very happy with the results. Since her jean was not something Tiffany could resolve in a few minutes, she decided to focus on Umi’s white blouse. Since it was an already tight fit, even a little change had the potential to look amazing, especially with Umi’s sizable bosom. </p><p>However, what Tiffany had managed to apply was far more than a little change. I had no idea how, but after closing the phone, she had managed to convince Umi to take off her bra, which created a spectacular view as her hard nipples pushed against the tight fabric. </p><p>Her lack of a bra was already obvious, but Tiffany went all the way to make sure it was noticed, strategically unlocking three buttons from the top, turning Umi’s basic shirt into a delicious accessory fit for a nighttime club visit. </p><p>I shared a smirk with Tiffany while Umi kept her gaze on the floor, her shame preventing her from actually doing something. She looked at me, gesturing toward Umi, followed by a rather suggestive sign, and I just nodded, giving her permission to push forward. </p><p>Umi wasn’t the first submissive woman that found herself in my tender mercies, and wouldn’t be the last. Ultimately, seducing her was nothing too interesting. </p><p>Watching Tiffany as she seduced her, however, promised to be much more interesting. Umi was too distracted to notice the slight shuffle I had conveyed, making sure when Tiffany sat next to me, Umi would sit on the most concealed spot on the booth, giving Tiffany a full range to pull her tricks. </p><p>“So, where did you girls disappear, leaving me alone for such a long time,” I said, intentionally not commenting on Umi’s enhanced cleavage, though I made sure to throw an extended glance, enjoying the way she shivered under my gaze. </p><p>“Hey, you’re lucky enough to get the attention of two sexy ladies, waiting a few minutes is the least you can do,” Tiffany said as she slapped my arm playfully, never one to miss the opportunity for some casual physical contact. After the slap, her hand stayed around my arm, squeezing gently. </p><p>I just grinned, trying to maintain a friendly and welcoming attitude, though not bothering to hide the undertones of arousal. At this point, it was not about hiding my intentions, but not scaring off Umi while Tiffany worked her supposed magic that would teach Umi about the benefits of deviancy. </p><p>“You’re right. I’m lucky enough to get the company of two unbelievably beautiful women. I shouldn’t be complaining," I said, putting my hand on her thigh even as I said so, directly under her short dress. </p><p>Umi threw a shocked glance down where my hand disappeared, shocked by the sudden intensity of our closeness. And as Tiffany skid closer, her thigh touching mine, there was no doubt about her enjoyment of the situation. </p><p>“So, what else you have planned for the evening,” Tiffany asked even as her legs parted open, allowing my fingers to tease her wetness over her panties, which was small enough not to exist from a practical perspective. </p><p>“I was thinking of a comfortable soak, maybe some champagne even if you ladies are interested to get some fresh air,” I said, following Tiffany’s direction. It was an interesting move on Tiffany’s part, pulling Umi’s focus on the rest of the evening right after their discussion. I would have avoided that, focusing on the moment instead. </p><p>Though, it didn’t take long for me to understand Tiffany’s strategy. As I continued to molest her even more obviously —following her directions— she started sharing glances with Umi, ones that were designed to elicit sympathy. </p><p>Smart, I thought, trying to jerk Umi’s emotions through letting her friend suffer, especially after her declaration of making a sacrifice to protect Umi’s purity. As my touches intensified, she was slowly developing the image of a good friend that was throwing herself to indignity to protect her bestie. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly a strong narrative considering both of them were here at my table to get some illegal kickback for their husbands under their husbands’ request —though the poor bastards were definitely not aware of the true nature of the sacrifice. </p><p>However, Umi wasn’t the most discerning audience either. </p><p>At first, I continued speaking, sharing anecdotes and jokes in a suave tone that wouldn’t be remiss in a formal dinner, completely opposite of what was going on with my fingers, getting more and more aggressive, even as I was starting to get curious about what Tiffany was planning to do. Because, Tiffany’s climax wasn’t too distant, which would twist the nature of the evening completely. </p><p>Then, Tiffany slid away just as she was about to climax. “Do you mind if I catch my breath a bit,” Tiffany said, trying to sound distressed, but as she danced on the edge, her labored breaths radiated a desire for sex. </p><p>Luckily for her, Umi’s panicked expression reflected that she believed the role Tiffany was trying to sell, missing the significance of her bodily reaction. </p><p>Tiffany’s plan was not complex, and I decided to help her a bit. “I don’t know,” I said with sudden sternness. “The night is already half as fun as I expected,” I added as I glanced toward Umi, blaming her for my poor mood, intensifying the guilt she was feeling. “So, unless she helps you to put a show while you recover…” I murmured before letting it fade. At my position, I didn’t actually need to use a threat to pressure them. </p><p>“You would help me, would you, Umi?” Tiffany asked as she turned toward her, catching her gaze. The poor little girl was far too inexperienced and trusting to do anything else but not obediently, unaware of what she had just signed up for. </p>
