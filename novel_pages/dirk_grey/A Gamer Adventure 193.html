        <p>Watching the poor Janelor trying to look impervious and dignified even as she impatiently swallowed every little piece of food I brought to her was fun. She utterly failed in her task, not that it was too surprising. </p><p>It was very difficult to look impervious when one was completely naked, her petite yet curvy body even more appetizing than the buffet that was spread in front of me. </p><p>After getting rid of her nightie, I did nothing more than occasional caresses for the next few bites, just enough to arouse her memories of our last time, starting from a massage and ending up in an amazing, lengthy hug… </p><p>She said nothing, intent on enjoying the food, though a part of it was clearly about her lack of experience. Everything about her showed a lack of experience on the fun side of things. When it was time to act once more, I reached for a much more fun condiment. </p><p>Whipped cream. </p><p>I didn’t miss the gazes she had sent toward its way, though I wasn’t sure whether it was about her sweet tooth, or the incredible amount of mana I managed to trap in its gentle, fluffy structure. Yet, just as I put a generous touch on a sweet toast, to give her the first taste of it…</p><p>Another stroke of clumsiness hit me, and my hand trembled helplessly, letting the blob of fluffy cream fall. “How unluckily,” I said as I smirked at her. “Luckily, I didn’t ruin your bed, mistress,” I added, as the white cream was firmly lodged between her glorious peaks. </p><p>What a fortunate coincidence. </p><p>“Not a problem,” she answered quickly as she raised her hand, but I grabbed her wrist, preventing her from touching it. </p><p>“No, mistress. As a servant, I couldn’t wait while you do the cleaning. It wouldn’t be honorable.” I raised my empty hand, and brought it to her chest. Unfortunately, my episode of clumsiness was yet to fade, and my attempts to clean it only spread it further. Soon, her breasts were completely covered with whipped cream. </p><p>Such an unfortunate disaster. </p><p>“I’m sorry, mistress, I’ll fix my mistake immediately,” I gasped even as I pushed her down, enjoying the shocked gasp that left her mouth, one that turned into a moan as I leaned forward to lick her beautiful peaks. </p><p>Naturally, I didn’t neglect to coat my tongue with mana. </p><p>[-258 Mana]</p><p>“W-what are you doing?” she stammered between moans. </p><p>“I’m just cleaning you, mistress. Completely innocent, I swear,” I added, my smirk wide enough to make me a liar if she had any inclination of believing that in the first place. </p><p>“Nonsense —“ she tried to say, only to be interrupted when I dig my finger into the whipped cream and slipped in between her lips, letting her suck the dessert off, which proved convincing enough to silence her. Meanwhile, I continued working on the great expanse of her chest slowly, sensuously. </p><p>Yet, under my hungry lips, even with the hunger burning in my gaze, it didn’t take long for them for her breasts to turn completely clean. I pulled back, leaving her beautiful tits, glistening after my effort. “All clean, mistress,” I whispered as I pulled back. “I’m sorry about my clumsiness.” </p><p>“T-thanks,” she murmured, though that didn’t prevent her from looking dazed as she continued to lay, unable to process what had just happened, trying to process the invasion of pleasure. She pushed herself upright soon, which had a rather beautiful impact on her chest, making it jiggle erotically. </p><p>“Not a problem, mistress,” I said, and without a warning, started leaning forward once more. “There’s some left on your lips,” I whispered, before capturing her lips in a searing kiss. Despite her initial shock and reluctance, her lips quick to respond against the kiss, her tongue joining the battle soon, wrapping tight enough to allow me to steal the taste. </p><p>“Delicious,” I murmured in appreciation as I pulled back, not bothering to hide my great smirk as she panted obediently. </p><p>Her naked sight as she struggled to breathe, trying to throw off her daze was simply marvelous. Not enough to enter the list of the sexiest scenes I had ever seen, though, considering my experience midway, it was hard to gain a spot there without the assistance of at least another very sexy lady — the peak still occupied by our victory celebration following our battle against the undead. </p><p>Yet, while it might not play for the top of the list, the sight of a sexy dragoness out of breath, biting her lips idly like she was struggling to believe the feeling she had just experienced. “Open wide,” I whispered as I grabbed a mulberry, coating it with some liquid chocolate before bringing it back to her lips, giving her mouth something else to be occupied. </p><p>She slowly bit the mulberry absentmindedly, clearly unaware of the sexiness she was displaying as she slowly chewed it. I carefully fed her a few more bites before another accident happened, and her beautiful breasts were stained once more. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I watched her move, laying back without the slightest prompting from my end, ready for my cleanup, her eyes closed in preparation. Yet, I didn’t lean down immediately, instead grabbed more cream and chocolate, creating a beautiful edible bra for her. </p><p>“T-that’s too much,” she gasped, but that was the extent of her complaints as I leaned forward, licking the edge of her beautiful new clothing item, one with an expected survival time even lower than her usual stuff. I had to admit, made by the full application of my Craft skill, the mixture tasted better than anything else I had the pleasure of eating. </p><p>Though the presentation certainly helped. </p><p>As I worked on her breasts, our closeness allowed me to see the way her beautiful skin gained a beautiful blush, the aura of cuteness not exactly damaged by the soft moans that she started to let out while her hands fisted around the bed covers. “Hmm, maybe I should use you as my plate for every breakfast,” I whispered. “You certainly taste nice.” </p><p>“I-impudent,” she gasped. “I’m a dragon, how dare you disrespect me like that!” she shouted. Her shout was loud, though if she was able to push herself up to a sitting position without her trembling arms surrendered, it might have been more intimidating. Under the circumstances, it only made her breasts ripple, increasing my enjoyment of her beautiful body. </p><p>“I’m not disrespecting,” I whispered. “On the contrary, I’m finding an excellent use for your petite body. Isn’t it something you want, to prove your little stature is not an object of shame?” </p><p>“O-of course n—“ she started but her argument suffered a premature death when my fingers slipped inside her wetness, silencing her beautifully, her words leaving their place to endless moans as I coated my fingers with mana. </p><p>[-690 Mana]</p><p>She just moaned while I continued to devour her temporary bra, once again turning her cleavage into something more obscene as her nipples peeked through its white clouds. Though, just because I had finished the cream was no reason for me to stop. “Delicious,” I murmured as I continued to lick and kiss her breasts, the occasional bite breaking the monotony as it left a lingering mark behind. “You’re certainly the best plate imaginable,” I whispered. </p><p>She was likely annoyed by my comment, but that didn’t matter as she struggled to process the waves of pleasure that resulted from my invasion, each flicker pushing her closer to the edge of a climax. </p><p>Yet, I had no intention of making her climax. Not before she earned it. I raised my head, though I kept my fingers inside her wetness, the pleasure it provided critical to making her keep her gaze closed. Meanwhile, I prepared another breakfast surprise for her, one that fit the theme of our little game much more accurately. </p><p>She stayed unaware as I shuffled, taking my new place, only realizing something was different once I pulled my fingers back. “What are you—“ she started, only to freeze as she opened her mouth, only to find me above her, my shaft already out, covered with chocolate and cream. </p><p>“I realized I was being unfair, treating you like a kitchen item. So, I decided to allow you to take revenge for this huge disrespect,” I whispered as my lips formed a smirk, my hips pushing forward. “Open wide!” </p><p>She did so, though I didn’t know whether it was to obey my order or to raise complaints. Either way, she opened her mouth, allowing my shaft to invade her beautiful throat. </p><p>And our breakfast took a small yet important step forward.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
