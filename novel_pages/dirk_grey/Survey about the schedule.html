    <body>
        <p>Hi, all. </p><p>I have received multiple comments and general comments about the general update frequency of the stories, particularly the longer ones. They are certainly justified. </p><p>Since we finally finished with A Gamer Adventure, it's a good time to make some changes. </p><p>I decided on a new plan, which will essentially make two of my stories the main ones, which will receive weekly updates (at least 2, more based on the popularity on the poll, while the others continue to be kept in the poll, with essentially working as a side benefit. </p><p>Immortal Freeloader is going to stay as one of the mains. </p><p>This survey is to get a general idea about the second story. I'm not promising to pick the winner, but I'll strongly consider it. </p><p><strong>Please note that, if Divine Celebrity or Dragon's Tale wins, they'll go through a major rewrite first before uploading them to give them a more coherent and compelling arc.  </strong></p>
