        <p>“Well, that was an interesting day,” I murmured even as I walked in the crisp cold of the winter night, leaving the convention center behind, walking alone if one discounted the angel that was invisible to anyone else. </p><p>I didn’t feel much joy, not because the runner-up in a chess tournament, even a small one like that wasn’t an achievement to be happy about, but a ceremony stretching for hours worked wonders to sap any joy I felt, only to bury in a sea of boredom. </p><p>Though, I could hardly complain, as their incessant desire to brag was the only reason I actually had a scholarship in the first place. </p><p>Luckily, I was excused from today’s football training. With the sudden extension of my tournament run, and the grueling practice — and even more grueling party — would have stolen a lot of time dedicated to my homework. </p><p>After all, I was still a student, and engineering was a grueling major to go through. I planned to go directly to my room, and study, no matter how tempting the idea of a party was.  </p><p>However, when I noticed my guide came to a sudden stop, her wings and her eyes glowing in with a soft blue light. It was an impressive sight. I imagined that if she had been wearing something more appropriate, a golden armor or an elegant robe, it might have even looked like a holy painting. </p><p>Dressed in sexy leather, it looked like a very successful stripper, wearing a costume with excellent props, about to start her show. </p><p>  A voice on the back of my head told me that going back to my room was not going to be an option. </p><p>“We need to move,” she exclaimed in excitement the moment she opened her eyes. </p><p>“What’s going on?” I asked, trying to stay calm, but her enthusiasm was clearly not good news. </p><p>“I can sense another Divine System activating nearby. We need to meet them!” </p><p>“How near?” I asked, even though a chill hit me, one that had little do with the cold wind. </p><p>“Not too far. Barely an hour with those carriages,” she said. </p><p>Something between fifty and a hundred miles, I corrected in my mind, assuming she was able to measure the distance correctly — which wasn’t a certainty considering she didn’t even remember her name. </p><p>“Are you sure that’s what you’re feeling?” I asked. Enthusiastic was hardly the word I would use to define my mood. </p><p>“Of course I’m sure, I can feel the stirrings of a proper Ritual. Someone is conducting a sacrificial ceremony, trying to empower a Divine System holder. We need to go there.” </p><p>Her selection of words hardly helped me to gain the enthusiasm I was lacking. Sacrifice was hardly the most positive word one could imagine. “Are you sure?” I said, even as I tried to hide my attitude. </p><p>Luckily, she wasn’t particularly perceptive of my mood. </p><p>“Of course, any System holder is an ally against the endless battle against Darkness,” she said with a matter-of-fact tone, but it was the rare hint of sharpness in her tone that prevented me from complaining. </p><p>I wasn’t feeling comfortable enough to push her, not when every second I delayed, the pressure she was radiating increased. </p><p>With that attitude on the surface, even with her erotic leather outfit, she was one scary lady. </p><p>It wasn’t that I didn’t want to explore the mystery of her presence. However, every single reference she had made was not only historical, but also magical. And whatever mystery was behind the existence — and the eventual disappearance — of the mythological gods was not something I could deal with directly. </p><p>I wanted to research it at my own pace, away from any risk, but from her attitude, it was clear that it was not an option. </p><p>“My car is not working. Let me check with a friend to borrow a car,” I said. “We can’t just walk there.”  </p><p>“Okay, but hurry up,” she said, excitedly floating around. </p><p>With that, I raised my phone, but I didn’t know who to call. With my complicated schedule, I didn’t have many friends, at least not the kind I could casually ask to borrow their cars. And my poor car — already on its way to a crusher — didn’t have insurance that would give me a replacement. </p><p>Which meant I had to take the bus to leave the campus before I could rent a car, before she actually forced me to walk. Of course, taking the bus was not an option, because, firstly, I had no idea whether there was a bus route to the destination. </p><p>Second, even if it did, I would prefer to have wheels under me, just in case I needed to escape. </p><p>With that in mind, I walked to the bus stop, waiting for a shuttle so that I could rent a car. As I waited, I tried to think of a way to trick her, but looking at her enthusiastic face, I wasn’t very hopeful. I had a feeling that, if I couldn’t procure a vehicle, she might force me to walk. </p><p>And walking a hundred miles was not on my Sunday night to-do list. </p><p>However, before I could make a decision, I was distracted by the sharp cry of a sudden brake. </p><p>Perfect, I thought darkly even as I raised my head, ready to deal with either Kevin or one of his annoying friends, when I met a smiling face of a blond giant instead. “Teddy,” he exclaimed happily. </p><p>“Hey, Thad,” I said, pushing a perfunctory smile on my face. “What’s up?”</p><p>“The training is just finished, and I wanted to stop by my place before going to the Den,” he said. “What are you doing at a bus stop? Weren’t you supposed to be playing with your dolls?” </p><p>I smiled. Despite the insulting nature of the words, Thad managed to deliver it with an undertone of humor that somehow maintained their good nature. I couldn’t help but smirk “No, that just finished playing with my little wooden soldiers until I got knocked onto my ass by another nerd.” </p><p>“Damn, you lost.” </p><p>I shrugged. “Hey, at least I was able to win a few games at first. It’s certainly better than what we can do in the field with whatever our pathetic offense would give us for the game next Sunday.” </p><p>“Touche,” he said with a chuckle. “You’re lucky that you’re still a backup, and won’t be forced to field early after another stupid interception.” Then, he gazed at the bus stop behind me with slight confusion. “I thought you have a car. What are you doing here?” </p><p>“I had a little accident,” I said with a shrug, not really wanting to discuss it. </p><p>“Kevin,” Thad growled suddenly, surprising me with his perceptiveness once more. His amused tone disappeared, replaced with something darker. “Maybe I should have a talk with him.” </p><p>“I appreciate the sentiment,” I said, and much to my surprise, I was actually sincere. “But leave him alone, I like to handle things in my own way.” </p><p>“Damn boy, that’s a scary expression,” Thad answered, staying silent for a moment. Then, he surprised me when stepped out of his car, and threw the keys to me. </p><p>“You’re lending your car to me,” I said, surprised. </p><p>“No,” he said, and I nodded. Just because I helped him with a bet didn’t mean he should give me a car. “I’m giving you the car.” </p><p>I stared at him in shock even as he walked toward me. “What are you talking about? This car should cost at least twenty thousand.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, it’s nothing,” Thad answered. “You saved my precious classic, and a car I use for errands is nothing compared to that,” he said with a smirk. “Not to mention I’ll get another nice classical car thanks to you.”</p><p>“How?” I asked curiously. “I thought Kevin didn’t have a car.” </p><p>That earned an explosive laugh. “He didn’t, but not because he couldn’t afford it. His family is loaded.” Interesting, I thought. Kevin must be really rich if a guy who treated a car like a disposable item defined him as loaded. </p><p>“Then why was he freeloading to use his girlfriend’s car,” I said, before smiling widely. “Sorry, his ex-girlfriend.” </p><p>“Oh, believe me. It’s a detail hard to forget with all the gossip that’s going around on the campus. You three are the hottest topic,” he said as he exploded into another boisterous laughter. “Apparently, after a drunken accident, his mother decided to ground him and forbid him from driving for a few months.” </p><p>“How tragic,” I said. “So, does it mean you have to wait for months before you get your car?” </p><p>“Not necessarily. He will find a way to solve it unless he wants his reputation to go to gutters. My guess is that he’s going to go and have a talk with his sister.” </p><p>“His sister?” I asked, as it was never a bad idea to learn about the enemies one made on the way. </p><p>“I don’t know much, but apparently, she’s an executive or something in their family business,” Thad said with a shrug. “So, do you want to take your new car for a spin?” </p><p>I responded by throwing the keys back. “It’s a nice gesture, but I won’t accept such a big gift,” I said. As much as I appreciated the offer, if I was willing to owe people favors of that magnitude, I wouldn’t be struggling this badly. Thad looked at me seriously, like he was about to force me to accept. </p><p>That wouldn’t have worked, of course, but unknown to my giant friend, he wasn’t the only one looking at me seriously. My guide was looking at me seriously. “Excessive pride is a sin for a warrior. Accept it, we are in a hurry,” she said, her gaze serious once again. </p><p>I decided to relent. “But I wouldn’t say no borrow it for a few days. Until I can arrange an alternative.” </p><p>“As you wish,” Thad said as the keys flew on the air once more. savy enough to realize that I had no intention of compromising. Then, he smirked. “I seem to be having car trouble. Do you mind giving me a ride?” </p>
