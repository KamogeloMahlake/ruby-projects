        <p>“Please come in,” Sabrina said excitedly as she took half a step to the side, giving me enough space to pass, but not enough to put a lot of distance between us. A trick to force intimacy, a well-known trick out of seduction handbook, even though she hadn’t executed it perfectly. Combined with the signs of her extensive firearm training, things were getting more and more interesting. </p><p>“Thank you,” I said even as I stepped inside, letting one of my best seductive smirks appear on my face, happy to notice her irises widening just for a moment, especially since the rest of her face stayed the same. Score, I thought. There were a lot of ways of faking attraction, but diluted irises were one that was impossible to fake without a very determined preparation. </p><p>I let my eyes wander around the room as I walked inside, ignoring her unnecessarily close footsteps. In a different location, I would have been afraid, but here, in the middle of the VIP section, I felt quite secure. The hotel took its security seriously. </p><p>The foyer I was in was larger than my own room, sparsely decorated but still elegant. “May I take your jacket,” she whispered even as her fingers touched my neck for a fleeting moment like she was trying to underline our intimacy. I said nothing, but lifted my arms, allowing her to remove it. If she was going to play the intimate hostess, who was I to argue. Though, I noted the practiced way she caressed my arm after like she was trying to smooth it. A move, unlike her irises, was very much practiced. </p><p>After she hung my jacket, she gestured me to follow her before walking toward the door to the right, her hips swaying hypnotically, enough to make my mouth feel dry. She might be targeting me as a mark for her seduction game, but it didn’t make it any less effective. </p><p>We stepped into a larger room, with a large dining table and a comfortable looking couch directly facing a huge screen, white and cream, underlining opulence and richness. Especially with the dinner table filled with a number of delicate dishes, and a bottle of wine resting in an ice bucket, their smells suggesting that each prepared to perfection. It was really driving the difference between VIP and normal customers. Comparing it with the tiny box they called a room, I couldn’t help but feel like I had another reason to get a VIP position. </p><p>And who knows, maybe I could get an extended holiday after my mission was complete. </p><p>I cut my musings short when Sabrina turned to face me, a cute expression on her face almost managing to obscure the dance of calculation that was going behind her eyes. “I wanted to thank you for saving me earlier today,” she gasped as she pushed her chest forward, just enough to accentuate the curves of her spectacular breasts without being too forward, the red of her dress contrasting perfectly with her caramel skin. </p><p>“Nonsense, we’re more than even,” I said with a chuckle, waving my hand. “Saving a damsel like you from a bunch of useless drags like them has been a pleasure,” I smirked. “Not to mention I had managed to earn quite a bit thanks to your assistance.” </p><p>“Then, maybe we can share a dinner like two new friends,” she said, fluttering her eyelids cutely. I nodded, not wanting to resist too much, just to give the impression that her little seduction game was working. I was feeling curious about her endgame. I made a gesture to fill our wine glasses, but she stopped me, instead choosing to serve me herself, not neglecting to dip down to give just enough cleavage. Then, she raised her glass. “To new friendships,” she called. </p><p>“To new friendships,” I agreed with a grin, couldn’t help but feel excited at the smile on her face. Her seduction might be artificial, but her beauty, and a part of her attraction, was real, which was making me rather interested in the later parts of the night. </p><p>After a brief small talk, she came with her first question. “So, what exactly do you do?” she asked. </p><p>“Currently nothing,” I explained with a shrug. “I had a small software company which I sold just a couple of months ago, and decided to take a holiday to relax.” </p><p>“Couldn’t be that small,” she said playfully. “Not with the money you’re throwing around on the table.” </p><p>“Eh, boring stuff,” I said with a shrug, which was intentional. She had seen the amount of money I had, which meant underplaying was to my benefit. “You?” </p><p>“Nothing much,” she answered. “I have a very traditional family with strict opinions about what I can and can’t do,” she explained, her sudden sadness not all fake. “While my brothers are raised to take the family business, I’m expected to be the good little daughter and marry to expand the dynasty,” she said. “And as you have seen in the game, the candidates they have in mind is not exactly spectacular.” </p><p>“Yeah, I met tree stumps with more attractive personalities,” I countered with a smirk, earning a genuine laugh. Still, her laugh didn’t distract me from one important fact. One of her husband candidates was a high ranking member of Dominion Cartel, and the fact that they were trying to impress her rather than forcing the family to comply had very dangerous implications. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my mission which had dangerous implications on thousands -maybe even millions- of innocent lives, I would have never dared to interject into such a volatile situation. Unfortunately, I was alone in the middle of the ocean, in one of the most dangerous locations in the world, completely bereft of support. Like earlier in the poker game, I had to take risks. “I’m sure that their fathers would love the fact that they lost all that money,” I said mockingly. “I wonder if they would cry.” </p><p>“Oh, I’m sure about that. Though their fathers would be more annoyed about the fact that they lost in such a public setting rather than the money itself,” she added even as she lazily reached across the table and caressed my hand in a gesture of intimacy, still doing her best to play the seduction game. I avoided her gaze shyly as I changed the subject to a more casual area, until the dinner was finished. </p><p>“Do you want to join me on the couch,” she asked after the dinner was finished, but before she joined, she filled us two glasses of scotch from a decanter, the smell alone telling that it was an amazing vintage, above anything else I had tasted, even during the training. I nodded before following her direction, and sat on the one side of the couch, giving her enough space to choose the distance, curious about what she was going to do. </p><p>She was silent as she passed the glass. I took a sip, a perfect combination of sharpness and smoky flavor filling my mouth. She sat down close to me, close enough to make it extremely inappropriate considering our lack of relationship. I let her stay silent while I enjoyed my drink. </p><p>One of her hands landed on my knee even as she took a deep breath. “I need to ask a favor,” she murmured helplessly, once again acting to reflect the intended emotion, though I could tell that it wasn’t completely fabricated. She needed my assistance, and considering her hesitancy, it was going to be a big one, easily overwhelming the favor she earned through her assistance in me earning a hundred million dollars. </p><p>Still, I nodded. “What exactly do you need?” </p><p>She smiled hesitantly even as she grabbed my hand, sliding close enough that her beautiful breasts were pressing on my arm. “I need you to act like my fiancee for the next month,” she said, like she didn’t know I would be signing my death certificate if I was as normal as I was presenting myself to be. For all her beauty, she was a dangerous woman. A true femme-fatale.  </p><p>It was a dangerous request, even for a junior spy like me. After all, curiosity was seldom worth angering three dangerous entities. Dominion Cartel was a known quantity, and whichever organization was behind Thomas, I didn’t expect it to be considerably weaker. </p><p>The real clincher, however, was Sabrina’s family, which I suspected to be significantly stronger either organization, something not easy to disregard, maybe enough to track me down even after I left the island for ruining the reputation of their daughter. If they were willing to marry her to a member of the mafia, they were either in the illegal business, or they were strong enough that it was just a blip on the radar. To my best guess, Sabrina was making a play for freedom, and I was her smokescreen. </p><p>However, there were advantages as well. As her fiancee, I would be a part of the spectacle in a way that was completely unconnected to my Agency affiliations, making me a known commodity, giving me an actual chance to achieve my mission. In exchange, however, the moment I left the island, I would meet with a torrent of assassinations. </p><p>Even worse, asking her about her family was not an option without spooking her. I was supposed to be a software developer, unaware of the darker parts of the world. It was a huge gamble. </p><p>Just as I liked. </p><p>“As I said before,” I said, letting my smirk widen as I leaned forward, just an inch between our lips, happy to see her irises widen in excitement once more. “Saving damsels in distress is its own reward, my dear fiancee.” </p><p>“Thank you,” she gasped in excitement, with just a dash of guilt mixed in. She wrapped me in a fleeting hug before jumping up to her feet disappeared in another room before I could get a word in. When she came back, she had a ring box with her, but I was more interested in the slightly disheveled state of her clothing, enhancing her cleavage enough to give a hint of areola on her caramel-colored skin, filling me a desire to taste it. </p><p>The cleavage got even deeper when she fell on her knees in a mocking display of a proposal, her smile wide. “Will you be my fake fiancee,” she muttered as she flipped open the box, showing a very elegant platinum band. </p><p>“As you wish, my damsel in distress,” I answered, smiling equally wide. The situation was amusing, even with the looming danger. She put the ring on my finger before pulling a similar one from the other box, and was about to put it to her finger. I grabbed it before she could. “Let me,” I said with a throaty tone, one that worked well to trigger arousal. </p><p>If I was going to suffer being a fake fiancee, I was going to get some benefits. </p><p>I slid the ring on her delicate finger. She smirked with the satisfaction of her ploy being successful. She raised her phone, about to take a photo, when I grabbed her wrist to stop her. “We need to share a photo for them to see,” she explained, looking stern. “That’s the whole point.”</p><p>“I know,” I said with a shrug. “However, we need to look the part just to make sure your family buys the engagement. And considering we’re trying to play the part of the love of first sight, and we’re alone in a room…” I dragged. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured, in a sudden onset of shyness that was completely genuine. “You think that if we look a bit more … disheveled, it would be more believable.” </p><p>I smirked, but rather than saying anything, I grabbed her wrist gently and pulled her onto my lap. I didn’t put a lot of strength, barely more than a tug, but that proved to be enough, she collapsed into my lap easily, her eyes bright with excitement as her hands dragged lazily on my chest. “Well, you’re right,” she murmured, almost a whisper. “And if we’re going to fake a relationship, we need to be comfortable in each other’s touches.” </p><p>I wasn’t an idiot, so I refrained from mentioning that she was already comfortable enough with our proximity, enough to trick any bystander. Why would I, when it finally gave me the excuse to taste her delicious lips? </p><p>When I pressed my lips against hers, I was planning to take it slow, but that plan was foiled when I felt her tongue probing against my lips, asking for entrance, something I was more than happy to grant. She slipped inside smoothly, exploring my mouth enthusiastically, far more enthusiastically than what was required for a seduction play. I couldn’t help but feel proud at turning the tables without breaking the cover, but that was a fleeting thought. </p><p>I focused on enjoying the way the kiss was slowly unraveling me. For that moment, I let myself go, no mission, no spy business, no dangerous mafia. At that moment, we were nothing more than a pair of attractive young people, and our biggest problem was being overdressed. </p><p>Sabrina proved that she was in the same track of mind, as she grabbed my shirt without even breaking the kiss, trying to unbutton my shirt, but for all her finesse, her fingers failed to complete the task immediately. She pulled back with a frustrated growl, and before I could say anything, she pulled hard, my buttons flying around in the room. Her Latino fever was burning thick, begging me to push down, to take her hard. </p><p>But I showed patience, not wanting to scare her. In a sense, seduction was like fishing, you didn’t want to pull hard before the hook was in place. That was why my hands stayed relatively tame, just caressing her back, determinedly avoiding her zipper even when her hands explored my naked torso aggressively and she tried to devour my lips. </p><p>A frustrated growl escaped her mouth just a minute later and she changed her position, ending up straddling on my lap, rubbing her entrance aggressively against my shaft despite the layers of cloth in the way. When her hips started to dance, I decided to help her a bit by pumping my hips, enough to extract a moan of her. </p><p>Interestingly, there was no hint of prepared seduction tricks in her, just pure, animal, desire, a complete twist, the kind that begged me to push her down and take her mercilessly. Pity that I could still sense a layer of hesitancy underneath, showing itself from the way she stiffened whenever I let my fingers caress over her zipper. </p><p>I wondered if I could break down that hesitancy to taste her caramel beauty… </p>
