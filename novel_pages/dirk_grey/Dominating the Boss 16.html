        <p>Natalie said nothing in response to my assertion of victory. And she didn’t like she could, her face twisted between a mixture of shock and anger, a view that made me only harder — a considerable achievement considering I had a magnificent redheaded pilates instructor on my lap, riding me with the same desperation of a traveler lost in the desert, drinking water. Her nether lips were tight around my shaft, signaling it was a while since she had tasted the unique touch of a male. </p><p>Luckily for them, I was there to help selflessly. </p><p>Oh, how I wished that I could hear Natalie’s thoughts, though luckily, reading her face was a good tradeoff, watching her shock dancing against her desperation. I could see that she wanted nothing more than pull Jenny away from me, but she kept herself back. And our position made things even better, with Jenny on my lap, jumping enthusiastically, there was no doubt about her voluntary participation. </p><p>Distracted by her enjoyment, Jenny hadn’t noticed as Natalie stumbled closer without bothering to keep silent, her heels clanking on the floor. From Natalie’s confusion, it was clear she was yet to decide how to react. Luckily, before she could make a decision, she had collided with the table, making Jenny aware that there was a third person in the room. </p><p>“My love,” Jenny moaned the joy, which added confusion to Natalie’s expression. “Thank you, this is the best present ever!” Then, she had registered that Natalie’s expression was a bit weird, but she was too distracted to decipher its reason. “You don’t mind that I started before you arrived, right? It was just supposed to be warm-up, but I got greedy.” </p><p>Natalie looked at us empty, still trying to process what was just happening. It was a familiar expression, the same that she had in the night at the casino, failing to process the fact that she had lost, and lost badly. She opened her mouth to say something, but I didn’t know what. I doubted that even she knew. </p><p>Naturally, I interjected. I had won already, but looking at the possibility of enjoying Jenny’s tight body all night long, I didn’t want Natalie to ruin it with a careless word. “It was an excellent idea, Nat, to invite me for the surprise threesome you have planned for your girlfriend,” I said. “I’m honored to be a part of the love between such an impressive couple.” I was laying thick, but I wanted Natalie to understand the situation correctly without making Jenny suspicious, and take the clue and prevent her from ruining her relationship. Not because of any sudden struck of mercy, of course, but having both of them together would doubtlessly be even more enjoyable. </p><p>Not to mention the possibility of a threesome… Natalie might be a vile bitch, but she was utterly delicious.</p><p>Jenny tried to keep her gaze on her girlfriend, but I didn’t want her to suspect from anything, so my hand slid through the silky strains of her auburn hair and pulled her for a sudden heated kiss, one that shocked her with its suddenness, enough to make her try to pull back, but I didn’t let her retreat. Why should I when I could feel her resistance crumbling after just a few seconds. </p><p>I could see that she missed the variety in her diet. She responded to my aggressive kiss in kind, trying to devour my lips with desperation. My tongue joined the fray soon after, trying to push through my lips to invade my mouth. I let her have a fleeting victory before my counterattack turned the tables, allowing me to enjoy her unique taste mixed with wine. As our tongues twirled together, her hips started to gyrate even more, bringing my pleasure to the next level. </p><p>The kiss lasted a while, and when I finally let her pull away, Jenny had already forgotten the presence of her girlfriend behind her to turn her full focus on riding me until I was bone-dry. Her lips clamped on my neck, leaving a trail of bite marks. Meanwhile, I looked at Natalie, who was still watching us with daggers in her eyes, but her shock was mostly gone. I gestured her to undress. </p><p>Indignation flared in her eyes, and her mouth opened to deliver what was no doubt a poisonous angry exclamation. But I raised my finger warningly while mouthing silently, telling her that it was an order, and reminding her about the bet itself. I didn’t say anything else, but Natalie was smart enough to get the implied choice between the order or the consequences of rejecting said order. </p><p>Of course, technically, this situation didn’t count, as the exact wording of the bet only covered my office, but Natalie wasn’t in a state to remember that particular detail. Even if she did, it wasn’t the best place to argue about the details, she could turn back and leave, but that would mean leaving her girlfriend in my arms for the rest of the night. Talking with Jenny about the truth of the situation was even worse for her, which would require revealing the bet itself. I doubted Jenny would be understanding at that particular point. </p><p>The conflict on her face was obvious, but it only made the situation more arousing. The clock ticked while she struggled to decide, but I didn’t bother to make her hurry. Her anguish made pleasure from Jenny’s treatments even more delicious. A while later, an expression of resignation passed through her face — a welcome detail but ultimately unsurprising, considering the number of times she had surrendered to me, trying to clean up yet another mess of hers. </p><p>She reached to her back with a mechanical movement, only to be stopped by another gesture, asking her to slow down. She stopped for a second, her anger sparking once more, but that only enhanced her striking sexiness as she started swaying with an imaginary rhythm, anger mixing to her sensuality, slowly getting rid of her dress. The way her obedience increased was getting more and more delicious. </p><p>I watched silently as her dress slowly slid down, revealing her tight breasts, once again filling me with a desire to paint them with teeth marks. And luckily, unlike the other times, I was free to do so without making her girlfriend suspicious, a natural consequence of having said girlfriend on my lap, moaning with enjoyment as I explored her depths. </p><p>Natalie’s show deserved more than just one spectator, I suddenly decided, as I suddenly grabbed Jenny and pushed her onto her feet, only to pull her down once more before she could stammer a question, but with one great difference. She was facing towards the entrance of the room rather than my face, meaning, she had a prime view for the strip-show her girlfriend was providing. </p><p>“Sweetie, you’re so sexy!” Jenny exclaimed, though I was willing to bet her loudness was less about the half-dressed state of Natalie, and more about the orgasm that was steadily coming closer. Natalie’s resentment was clear for me, but Jenny was far too gone to notice it, her moans getting closer and closer. </p><p>Meanwhile, Natalie’s dress finally slid down her hips, revealing the absence of a certain piece of underwear. “You naughty girl,” I murmured in enjoyment. She had prepared for a naughty evening, though whether it was like that from the beginning, or it was a gift from Elena to me, I didn’t know. “Now, why don’t you crawl towards us and give your girlfriend a special kiss.” </p><p>That was enough to make Jenny’s eyes open in shock, especially when Natalie had actually followed my order and fell on all fours without much delay, slowly crawling towards us. Her surprise was understandable. Natalie thought herself as a dominatrix, meaning she would be rather stiff and uncompromising for poor Jenny. Luckily for her, I was here to right the wrongs. </p><p>“You’re being rather flexible today,” Jenny managed to get out between her moans as she watched Natalie crawling ever closer. Her hands were already caressing her body, adding yet another layer to her pleasure. “Maybe we should have guests more often,” she added with the best approximation of a teasing tone that she could manage under the circumstances. </p><p>Natalie didn’t appreciate the comment, but her situation didn’t allow for a truthful answer. “Why not?” she murmured without committing, trying to cut the discussion short. I was all for cutting talking short, so I grabbed her hair, not bothering to moderate my strength, and pulled her closer until her lips were pressed against the bottom of my shaft. A pained yelp escaped from her lips. “Lick!” I ordered. </p><p>Her eyes were burning in anger at the treatment, but still, she followed the order without losing too much time, and she started licking. </p><p>Lost in the pleasure, Jenny’s shock at my rough treatment didn’t last long. “Yes, work that shaft,” she ordered with glee while she continued jumping up and down, somehow managing to get even tighter. But soon, she decided to have a more active role, so she pushed my hand away and grabbed Natalie’s hair with a visible glee, enjoying the sudden turn of the situation, pulling her up just a bit, so that Natalie ended up licking her. I wouldn’t say I was perfectly happy with losing Natalie’s lips, but Jenny deserved that much. “Lick it, and lick it good!” she ordered. </p><p>It was a pity that I lost my opportunity for enjoyment, so I started looking for alternatives. My hands were free, so there was nothing to prevent me from slowly caressing her stomach while moving up, until I came to a sudden stop at her perky breasts, stopping there to enjoy their firmness, occasionally squeezing her nipples painfully. All the while, my lips reached to her cheek, leaving a trail of kisses with a gentleness that contrasted my otherwise rough treatment. </p><p>Under the assault from both sides, it didn’t take long for Jenny to reach a climax. A sudden cry escaped her mouth, bouncing at the walls rapidly until it turned into a beautiful echo while she shuddered helplessly on my shaft. She got even tighter, squeezing as she tried to milk me, but I kept myself back. As much as I wanted to fill her, I was afraid that it would make Natalie flip. I was definitely going to do that tonight, but I wanted her to get used to the situation before. </p><p>“Why don’t you sit here, boss,” I said to Natalie once Jenny let go of her hair, too busy trying to contain the invasion of the pleasure. I received a glare in return, but that glare only resulted in a slight delay before she followed my order, disguised as a courtesy call. She stood up, and a little drop of arousal trailed down her leg, telling me that, despite her distaste, she was still enjoying the moment at a primal level. For a while, we sat there in an awkward assemble. I was drowning in accomplishment, Jenny was drowning in pleasure, and Natalie was drowning in helplessness. It was a perfect moment.</p><p>Natalie tried to slide away, but I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her closer until our shoulders touched, and then my finger slid between her legs, teasing her wetness. She didn’t appreciate the attempt, but after all the times we have been together, I knew exactly which buttons to push. My fingers slid into her tunnel, teasing her in soft, long slides with an alternating rhythm. And since my other hand was idle, my fingers found Jenny’s knob, gently teasing her while she tried to recover. </p><p>Soon, Jenny started to recover from the monumental explosion of pleasure she had experienced moments ago, and turned to Natalie. “You’re the best girlfriend,” she exclaimed as she reached for Natalie, and started kissing her. Natalie didn’t look satisfied despite the approval of her girlfriend, though the reason wasn’t a mystery. After all, my shaft was still inside her, and her hips were grinding softly, already trying to start a second session. And my hands, caressing their gentlest place, didn’t help. </p><p>“I’m sure she’s trying her very best, but you’re being rather selfish,” I quipped a few seconds later, underlined by a gentle slap to her bottom. In response to my slap, her grinding quickened immediately, probably a sign of Natalie’s subtle training. Too bad that she was weak on the most important part, ensuring the loyalty of her pets. </p><p>“What are you talking about?” Jenny asked, but blushed when I pointed downward, to the exact location our bodies melded together. “But I don’t think Natalie wants a turn, she’s not exactly a fan of that part.” </p><p>“Really?” I said with a mocking grin, though only Natalie was looking my way to enjoy that particular view. “Still, seeing your obvious enjoyment, maybe she would enjoy a try. Why don’t you ask her?” I said, once again underlining my comment with a gentle slap to her bottom.</p><p>“If you insist,” Jenny said with a playful giggle, something Natalie didn’t enjoy, but her lack of enjoyment was nothing compared to her distaste for the question that was about to come, especially when I gestured her to accept. “Sweetie, do you want to take a test drive in this stick car?” Jenny asked after turning to Natalie. </p><p>“Why not?” Natalie answered with a grin that she tried to make it look nonchalant, but came across as stony. Luckily, Jenny was too busy being shocked by her words to pay attention to her expression. </p><p>“Really?” Jenny asked in shock. “But you never wanted to, even after I asked you so many times,” Jenny asked in fascination. I barely kept myself from facepalming at Jenny’s innocence, though I can see why Natalie wanted to keep her in the hold. Sexy, smart, yet somehow gullible and trusting when it came to the relationship. Pity that she fell into the hands of two deviants like us.  </p><p>“Well…” Natalie murmured, drifting out as she tried to come up with an answer. “You looked like you were enjoying it. So there’s no harm in trying.” </p><p>“Excellent, and if you enjoy, maybe you won’t be so against the occasional spice,” Jenny exclaimed as she lifted herself from my lap. She might be trusting and innocent in terms of relationship awareness, but she was turning out to be real minx when it came to sexual appetite. Then, she turned to me, her red hair sticking to her sweaty shoulders, giving her a slightly used look, but it only made her sexier. “You better make sure she enjoys it, mister!” she said with a playful finger-wagging. </p><p>“I’ll do my best, mistress,” I gestured before turning to Natalie. “So, let’s see whether I have what it takes to make you go back on solids.” Natalie didn’t answer while Jenny fell into a giggling-fit. I ignored the redheaded beauty, no matter how much her cute giggles wanted me to push her on the floor and take her until she was moaning my name. </p><p>Natalie stood up and took a step towards me, trying to hide her reluctance, but before she could sit, I stood up as well. She looked at me questioningly. “Jenny, why don’t you sit on the couch, and Natalie, you can take all fours. I’m sure some familiarity will make the situation even more enjoyable.”</p><p>Jenny enthusiastically jumped on the couch, her legs already parted, revealing her neatly trimmed lips. Her enthusiasm wasn’t a surprise since I knew about her desires. Natalie took a doggy position, her head already between Jenny’s legs. “Nat, if it gets too rough, just say please, and I’ll make sure to stop. Alright?” I said, amused by the stinking gaze I received in response. After all, it was my intention to give her one thing to stick to prove her pride. Natalie was predictable enough that I knew she would keep silent unless I actually started to torture her. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked as I took my position behind her, slowly sinking into her wet snatch, proving that despite her distaste, she was still enjoying the moment. </p>
