        <p>“So, you have a mission for me,” Sapphire commented, her voice surprisingly even. Under normal circumstances, a comment like that, delivered by the Queen of the Empire, would have been a huge cause of concern. </p><p>With her current position, perched on top of me, naked, her hips rocking steadily as she did her best to search for another climax, the circumstances were rather extraordinary.</p><p>“Exactly, I have a mission for you,” I said, grabbing her hips to drive the message — along with another very important thing — even deeper. </p><p>“Am I going to be alone in this mission?” she asked, though, this time, I could detect fear despite her attempts to conceal it. </p><p>“Good question,” I answered even as tightened my grip on her hips, their hypnotic movement under my touch giving me a rather spectacular distraction, especially with the way she impaled herself fully under her weight, each second enough to consist of eternity under her beautiful rhythm. </p><p>Letting that rhythm hypnotize me to avoid the complicated question of arranging her protection team was certainly tempting. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was too tempting. If I made that decision, there was no guarantee that I would be helped up by the ruthless dance of her hips while I delayed important decisions. </p><p>That didn’t mean intended to ask her to stop, of course. I put my hands on my breasts, ruthlessly squeezing as I thought of a way to save time. “It’s time to go back to your room, Your Majesty,” I said, still enjoying her title despite everything. </p><p>The irony of using it was too delicious to miss, especially since once our ploy had gone into effect, it would lose that ironic value. </p><p>“W-we’re stopping?” she stammered, her expression of disappointment too beautiful, especially since, despite its intensity, she didn’t think for a second before making that decision. </p><p>Simply amazing, I thought even as I followed her move and stood up, my glistening shaft dangling. “Yeah, we have wasted enough time playing, and you need to go back to your room to prepare. And I can use the journey to make that final decision.” I smirked. “After all, your sudden appearance had forced me to quicken my plans slightly.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured, blushing slightly even as she made a move toward her dress. Her poor, ripped dress required a lot of magic to be fixed. </p><p>I decided to help her, waving my hand. My magic flared, and a second later, her dress caught fire, turning into cinders. “No need to waste your time with such an ugly dress,” I commented.</p><p>“B-but, how am I going to walk back,” she gasped in shock, the sudden blush cute on her otherwise confident face. </p><p>“Well, that’s the risk we have to take,” I said, my tone somber like I was the one that was committing a huge sacrifice.  </p><p>Not that there was any risk for her. Among the core group, only Lancelot was still under the impression that I was a prisoner and unaware of the liberties I was taking, and in his misguided attempts to play for the bigger prize between the mysterious enemies, he didn’t have the luxury to visit my cell. </p><p>The girls, except Isolde who was currently enjoying a cell of her own in an amusing reversal, were a more mixed bag. After everything we had done, I was willing to bet that Aria would have the presence of mind to stay hidden even if she came across us, though explaining that to her afterward would be challenging. </p><p>Fun, but still challenging. </p><p>Emma had the potential to be harder to control, especially thanks to her rather flexible sense of loyalty. I certainly wouldn’t want elves to know the full extent of my relationship with the Queen — though, ironically, the same didn’t apply to the Phoenix she was serving simultaneously, because I had already told her that I was actually the king, and just faking my death. </p><p>Sapphire looked hesitant at my words, so I decided to encourage her a bit. Not by explaining my thought process to her, but something more direct. </p><p>More primal. </p><p>I put my hand on her plump ass, enjoying its softness, but it was just a momentary stop before my fingers slipped into her wet core. Her eyes widened as she realized that walking naked wasn’t my only plan. </p><p>Yet, the shock didn’t survive more than a few seconds, immediately replaced by fearful anticipation. “Walk,” I ordered as I slipped my fingers deeper into her wetness. </p><p>For a moment, she stood shakily on her legs, took a deep breath, and started to walk. From one perspective, it was absurd for her to react to the risk of being seen that much considering her side job, but I knew the power of embracing identities very well. </p><p>Being an erotic dancer in public was not a problem, nor it was a problem for her to be a slutty queen in private. </p><p>But being a slutty queen in a place where others could stumble, not a stitch of clothing on her body, being fingered by the dark lord that was supposed to be a prisoner… </p><p>It was clearly more than she could casually resist. To her credit, after a deep breath — one that enhanced her already-amazing bosom significantly — she started walking, each trembling step she took a masterful show. </p><p>She walked obediently even as my fingers made it difficult. </p><p>“So,” I commented as we stepped out of the cell, the chilly air of the secret passage achieving the impossible and making her nipples even harder. “Any preferences about your bodyguard during the process?” I asked. </p><p>“How about Emma?” she offered between her shaky breaths. “It’s not like she has anything important to do?” </p><p>“Sure,” I said mockingly. “If you want your every move to be reported to both parties immediately.” </p><p>“That traitor!” Sapphire gasped as her eyes widened, catching the meaning of my words immediately — not that they were particularly hard to decipher. “After everything I had done to that peasant whore. I’ll kill her—“ she continued a while before I interrupted with a nice spank to her ass. </p><p>“It’s not the time, you can always punish her once we finish this debacle, but not before. For the moment, she’s an excellent source to feed them false information, along with Lancelot.” </p><p>“That bastard as well,” she growled, her anger getting thicker despite the dance of my fingers. </p><p>“It’s what happens when you elevate the chosen ones just because they can use a fancy sword. They start to think that they deserve everything,” I commented. </p><p>“How about Isolde?” she asked. </p><p>“Not a bad option, actually,” I said, giving it a bit of thought. Her loyalty was assured, and she was not bad when it came to physical combat, making her a veritable threat to anyone that might target Sapphire. Yes, she was imprisoned at the moment, but it wouldn’t be hard to free her from there after talking with our naughty Phoenix. </p><p>But, after thinking a bit more, I decided against it. “It wouldn’t work, not with her temper,” I decided. “Especially not during an undercover.” </p><p>“But then who?” Sapphire said. “Most of the royal guard is either incompetent, or a part of the other noble families. When it comes to both loyal and competent, Isolde is still the best option.” </p><p>I frowned as I considered her words. She really seemed to be correct, so I started thinking about it. The silence echoed on the secret passage, interrupted by the subtle sound of my fingers invading her core, and the occasional moans that escaped her beautiful lips. </p><p>Then, a flash of realization appeared on my face as a certain blonde knight popped into my mind. “Of course!” I said, celebrating that with another spank to her ass, one that made it jiggle beautifully. </p><p>“Do you want to share that with me?” she murmured, though before she could follow up, my fingers returned to her core, sliding inside her repeatedly, once again blocking her words with her moans. </p><p>“Maybe, if you think you deserve it?” I commented, only to get a sarcastic gaze in response. Coming from someone else, or even under different circumstances, I might have reacted harder, but at that moment, under the circumstances, I found her gaze incredibly endearing. “Alright,” I said with a smirk. “I was thinking of Valkyrie.” </p><p>Just like that, Sapphire stood frozen. “Valkyrie, the legendary hero of the border!” Sapphire gasped, her legs trembling badly enough that she needed to lean against the wall, her surprise even thicker than the time I had revealed my true identity. “Don’t tell me that she’s one of yours as well.” </p><p>I chuckled at her shock, considering whether to tell her that it was too shocking to have a border hero under my control while I had both the Queen and the Crown Princess eating out of my hand, but decided against it. </p><p>I had bullied my poor little queen too much today. Instead, I slapped her plump ass again, gesturing for her to continue walking. “Don’t worry about it,” I said after she started. “She’s not one of mine, and she’s actually loyal to your Empire. We just had some fair dealings.” </p><p>“What kind of dealings?” she asked, clearly unwilling to trust someone that was willing to sell the Empire to me after everything. </p><p>“Don’t worry, she didn’t compromise any of the Empire’s benefits, even a few times I requested her to. I have sold her information about the dark houses that were making an issue on the border, and in exchange, she paid back to me in a way that wouldn’t hurt the Empire.” </p><p>I would have expected Sapphire to focus on the payment, but she was clearly too shocked to properly process it. “And why did you sell that information. You’re the dark lord. Why would you want the dark families to fail.” A rather big oversight for a ruler. </p><p>She was so lucky to have a selfless helper like me to assist her, seeking no benefit of my own!</p><p> “Oh, come on, beautiful. You know it very well that the dark families were my true enemies, or are you forgetting how did you manage to capture me in the first place?” </p><p>“But still, you were the one ruling the land. Expanding the borders would surely help you?” </p><p>I shook my head dismissively. Sapphire was smart, certainly much smarter than many of the morons that held the throne of the Empire, but she still made that fundamental mistake. “What’s the point of that. At best, it’ll increase the amount I could tax, and maybe a few more conscripts for an army. And in exchange, it’ll politically strengthen whatever family that managed to invade those lands, forcing me to spend even more to defend myself. Even worse, it might have earned a much more comprehensive reaction from the Empire.” </p><p>“But, in the end, that reaction still arrived,” Sapphire answered, though the smugness that she might have carried that declaration absent, another evidence that she had bought the fabricated story I had told for her about being captured intentionally.</p><p>“True, even for me, the involvement of our mysterious enemies was difficult to factor in.” </p><p>“R-right,” she murmured as she stopped once more, but this time, not because of the shock,  but because we had arrived at our destination. “I-is this it?” she murmured as she glanced at the entrance of her royal quarters, wordlessly inviting me inside.</p>
