        <p>Taking the Queen from behind as she stretched on her own throne was quite a pleasure, and not only for me if her failed attempts to suppress her moans were any indicator. “Do you want me to go and pick the Shield,” she managed to ask between the moans, her body rocking with a continuous earthquake. </p><p>“A good idea, but not at the moment,” I said, which earned a questioning look. “Being hosted by the Queen herself in her own throne room, how can I give up such a unique experience halfway,” I added even as I pulled out and grabbed her waist, lifting her up to her feet. </p><p>Unprepared, she almost fell down if it wasn’t for the short duration of her new position, only keeping her up enough to slide under her and sit on her throne. Then, I grabbed her waist, forced her to turn, and pulled her on my lap facing me. “Much better,” I murmured as the tightness of her back entrance clamped around once more. </p><p>However, the sudden flash of anger in her eyes, turning their blues into icy diamonds was much more interesting. Even with everything, she clearly didn’t appreciate me occupying her throne. Though, considering everything she had done so far was to continue occupying the throne, it clearly triggered a sensitive spot in her. </p><p>“I’m trying to get a better feel of the ward. I’m trying to see whether the identity of the occupant makes a difference,” I said, not particularly bothering to make it believable. I just needed an excuse to force her to think for a second, to prevent her from acting in anger. </p><p>With my growing power over her, that was all that needed. </p><p>As I expected, her anger about me using her throne symbolically wasn’t as important as the actual threats to her throne. Rather than pumping furiously, I put my hand to the inside of her upper thigh, slowly stroking her bare skin back and forth gently, contrasting the sensation at her backside greatly. Soon, she started moaning once again despite not starting to move.</p><p>I wasn’t an idiot, of course. Even with the side effects of her spells, it would cost me a lot to make her ‘forgive’ me for that transgression, recklessly pushing the borders even in the absurd situation we were in, though it was hard to read that on her demeanor. On the surface, she looked completely convinced. </p><p>Her eyes were closed as if she was trying to hide her shame and her anger at the same time, doing her best to keep quiet even as my shaft danced in her bowels again. Soon, she freed me from the obligation of making her ass move, instead of allowing me to focus on more important topics, such as letting my finger travel upward, caressing her core gently, drawing lazy circles to contrast with her rough anal treatment. </p><p>After learning about the unique traits of her body, it wasn’t surprising that it barely took a few minutes for her to part widely, allowing me even smoother access to her soft core. Her concealed anger didn’t prevent her from enjoying the travel of my fingers wholeheartedly. </p><p>However, compared to a delicious moan the moment my other hand landed on the small of her back, caressing the small of her back gently, her earlier reaction was nothing. Compared to everything else that was going on, it was a fairly innocent touch, but I had targeted a particularly sensitive spot there, and along with everything else, she was shuddering aggressively. </p><p>“Good Queen,” I said mockingly, once again fueling her anger, but this time, chose to suppress her reaction in a more direct way. I grabbed both of her hands before she could react, gathering them on her back, one hand enough to pin both of her wrists. Meanwhile, I sealed her lips with a kiss, while my free hand landed on her breasts, squeezing mercilessly. </p><p>It was an amazing sight, enough to make me conjure a magical mirror to the right of me enjoy the sights. And what a view it was. The naked figure of the Queen was repeatedly jumping up and down on my lap while her arms pinned behind her tight enough to hurt. Moreover, forcing her shoulders back had the added benefit of pushing her chest out, enhancing her already spectacular tits even further. </p><p>Meanwhile, even as I enjoyed the benefits of her body, the mind-manipulating ward was trying to worm itself through my mental defenses, only to fail spectacularly. However, its nature had been completely different, confirming my conjecture about it targeting whoever was sitting on the throne rather than being customized for Sapphire. It was interesting, because such a thing was actually harder than just making an exception for Sapphire directly. </p><p>And since they had gone to such a lengthy effort, it wasn’t hard to guess that their only aim wasn’t to take down Sapphire. They obviously had a long-term plan in mind. </p><p>The challenge was finding their vector of attack before it was too late. And to do that, I needed more information. </p><p>“So, my dear Queen, do you have any interesting information that might help me focus on the right direction. Feel free to be comprehensive. Sudden diplomatic incidents, nobles acting out for no reason, mysterious disappearances in  the capital, anything?” I asked, clearly pushing her to discuss the silent forts of the North. </p><p>I didn’t think they had any relationship with the wards at the throne room, but there was no harm in making the Queen think so. After all, the events at the North initiated a chain of events that ended with my imprisonment, so I was curious about the exact reason. And while Sapphire had explained some of the details to Aria, unaware that I was listening, I couldn’t exactly rely on the accuracy of that information, not with her lack of trust due to Aria’s naivety. Facing such an immediate threat, I was hoping that she would be more honest. </p><p>“It’s c-complicated,” she managed to murmur between her moans, as even as I asked the question, I hadn’t slowed down her treatment the slightest, making it difficult for her to concentrate on her answer. But she didn’t ask me to stop, at this point well aware that I would have turned down such a request. </p><p>“I love complicated stories,” I answered with a hungry smirk. “Feel free to share as much detail as you want, we have all night.” </p><p>Her expression, helpless yet aroused, was beautiful. “The first issue is the faction in the palace trying to take me down, led by that whore Fernhand,” she growled. </p><p>“I know them, of course, they are hardly hidden, but unless we can find a mysterious mastermind playing them to distract you, I don’t think they are the responsible party,” I said, easily ignoring Sapphire’s attempts to make me focus on her immediate enemies again despite removing them from the list of priority suspects, no doubt hoping to use me as a distraction for her immediate political games.  </p><p>Admittedly, she had selected an excellent time to pull such a trick. With her curvy hips dancing furiously, I was tempted to agree with her through sheer pleasure. However, ultimately, I managed to stay focused on the main direction. </p><p>She had talked several more issues, all happening in the capital, for a relatively long while, which I had to listen attentively without mentioning the silent forts at the North not to arouse her suspicion. Even worse, I had to ask several detailed questions, even for the topics I wasn’t interested in, because only that way I could ask questions without raising suspicion once she mentioned the North.  </p><p>The process would have been extremely annoying if I hadn’t been amusing myself with playing her amazing tits at the same time. </p><p>“… then there are some worrying things happening in the border forts,” she finally said. Finally, I thought, though I tried to keep my expression smooth to prevent her from realizing the sharp rise in my interest. “We’re having some communication difficulties with some of the garrisons.” </p><p>“Garrisons. Communication difficulties? As in multiple forts?” I asked, pushing her to elaborate despite her obvious reluctance to share it. </p><p>“Yeah, five of them for the moment,” she said, unable to prevent a tone of worry from appearing in her explanation. It was understandable, because earlier today, while she was explaining it to Aria, that number was lower. So, unless she chose to lie to Aria pointlessly to reduce the number of affected forts by one, another communication was lost in the last twenty-four hours. </p><p>“What happened exactly?” I asked. </p><p>“Not sure,” she said. “None of them was able to send a message before they were silenced, and any patrol the other forts had sent disappeared before they could report anything suspicious. And the latest disappearances failed to send a message before silence, even though the alarm was already raised.” </p><p>It was definitely a worrying trend. Not because border forts were significant locations. Despite their relatively loftier names, they were small locations, built to hold the small passages that littered through the domineering mountain range that drew the border between the wild tundra filled with monsters and the empire. Those garrisons mainly relied on their thick walls and limited size of the passages they needed to guard to be successful, rarely housing more than a hundred soldiers. </p><p>Taking them down wasn’t impossible. Ambushing them wasn’t exactly impossible either. However, doing so during an emergency state quick enough to prevent the garrison from sending a message back was much harder. </p><p>Maybe a trip to the North was in order, I thought even as I exploded into her plump ass, triggering her climax.</p>
