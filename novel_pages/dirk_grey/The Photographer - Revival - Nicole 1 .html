        <p>Hey, everyone. Good news. </p><p>I have finally managed to get myself a decent computer, which had been much harder than I expected because GPU's are near impossible to find - all thanks to a combination of production shortages, and annoying Crypto-mining. </p><p>Ultimately, I succeeded, meaning I finally have the luxury of using my own computer and my own assets for the process. </p><p>Some of the character designs went through changes because I don't own the previous assets I used to take those renders, but my friends did. </p><p>There are certain advantages to the new designs, like better quality models and higher resolutions. </p><p><strong>So, finally, I can add a decent amount of renders to my production cycle, without making my stories suffer. Since it's a recent addition to my workflow, I can't promise the rules will stay as follows, but for the moment, this is the strategy I want to follow. </strong></p><p><em>1- There will be no sacrifice in the writing schedule. That's always my main objective, and the renders are secondary.</em></p><p><em>2- Patron of Arts tier will have the early access for the renders, and any other visually-driven media like comics and games if and when I manage to actually complete them. </em></p><p><em>3- Patron of Arts will have a pool similar to Focus Poll, to decide which stories to focus on visually, and suggest scenes to visualize. I might extend those surveys to other tiers if I can increase my visual output more, but again, no promises. It'll depend on just how streamlined I make the production. </em></p><p><em> 4- I might decide to keep some of the visuals exclusively limited to certain tiers to set up a more balanced reward structure, but again, it'll be something I'll tweak  based on what I can produce. </em></p><p><em>5- I'm going to do my best to produce consistently, but at this point, it's not a consistent reward promise. Depending on my schedule and production challenges, it might be adjusted significantly.  </em></p><p><em><strong>I hope everyone enjoys the renders, and feel free to share your opinions. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Sincerely, </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Dirk</strong></em></p>
