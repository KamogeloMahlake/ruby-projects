        <p>Her gasp turned even more beautiful as I stood up and she took the full view of my nude body. I had worked hard to sculpt it to perfection even before my arrival, and my martial abilities helped me to look even better. Even the other martial artists didn’t have a body as sculpted at me, because my workouts after my injury were more focused on how I looked than actually looking functional. </p><p>“Get on the bed, Master,” I ordered, and she shivered once more. The enjoyment she drove from the title of respect was far more intense than I expected. </p><p>It was probably about the social context. With the rigid social context, it was one of the things that the people in this world simply didn’t do. It was like a deeply religious person cursing in the name of god, forbidden. </p><p>And, just like a lot of forbidden things, it was even more exciting in the bedroom. Her hips sashayed as she walked toward the bed, her ass swaying attractively. Halfway in, her dress slipped, and her attractiveness multiplied. </p><p>A lithe body, not a drop of excess weight, a smooth skin … she looked spectacular as she lay on her back. “Come here, my apprentice,” she whispered throatily, her tone seductive yet desperate. </p><p>I followed her rapidly and climbed onto the bed. Her legs parted open invitingly, ready to forget about the massaging. I was tempted as well, but two things stopped me. First, it was important for me to actually put the things I had learned into practice for both the ordinary technique, and the Mortal Low-Grade technique. </p><p>Also, foreplay was even more fun when my partner was moaning and squirming for more. </p><p>“Let me show you how much I learned, Master,” I said, and she shivered again. I put my hand between her shoulders, starting the massage like she had taught … and my fingers danced smoothly. After all, it wasn’t the first time I was massaging a sexy lady. </p><p>For the first section, I kept myself limited to an ordinary massage, strictly following her suggestions without using any of the Essence Tricks. I wanted to focus on what she could teach me first. </p><p>“Now, Master. Tell me, what am I doing wrong?” I said without stopping my massage. </p><p>“T-there’s not much to tell,” she said, which turned into a moan as my hands slipped to her shoulders. “Are you sure it’s the first time?” </p><p>“I’m a quick learner,” I said, cutting that track quickly. I didn’t need her questioning my learning speed. “Now, tell me.” </p><p>She paused for a moment, took a deep breath, then started talking. “While focusing on the shoulder, stay a little longer, until the blood flow recovers…” </p><p>I caressed her naked body for almost two hours, and she continued giving advice … which got more and more limited as it went, the things she could catch getting fewer and fewer. Ultimately, she was not a true expert, but a waitress with some extra skills. </p><p>“I … I think that’s all I can correct,” she moaned once I pressed her inner thigh, a moan escaping as she parted her legs. “Your Master needs her reward!”   </p><p>[Pampering Bonus - 25 (Capped)]</p><p>[25x Return - Massage Technique Lesson, Minor Familiarity]</p><p>“Very well,” I said, glad that her face was still buried in the pillow, so she missed my shocked expression. I didn’t expect to system to give me a different bonus. </p><p>Pampering. </p><p>A new, mysterious feature, one that I would pay attention to in the future. First, I need to reward my beautiful waitress properly. I was tempted to put my head between her legs and reward her, but after an hour of naked massage, she didn’t look like she had the patience for it. </p><p>I made things a little more fun. “Now, let your apprentice show how glad he is to have such a beautiful master,” I said as I flipped her, finally giving myself a beautiful view of her body. Her legs parted open, with my knees in between to close them. </p><p>I grabbed her hair. She moaned, which died quickly when I pressed my lips against hers, cutting it short. My tongue jumped into her mouth, and she accepted greedily … though I was surprised. She was surprisingly unskilled when it came to kissing. </p><p>I pushed my hips forward, only to realize her lack of experience was not too surprising. “Are you—” I asked, only for her to look at me shyly and nod. Which was a surprise, as I certainly didn’t expect for it to be her first time. </p><p>It probably had a lot of social implications, but I left it for the future, and focused on my pleasure. “Sexy,” I said as I leaned for another kiss, enjoying her enthusiasm. She might not be skilled, but she was sexy and enthusiastic enough for it not to matter. </p><p>Her body trembled, and a breath escaped her mouth explosively as her body parted to accommodate my presence. I pushed slowly even as I brought my hand against her entrance, which enhanced her pleasure even more, adding a little excitement to the monotony of the missionary position. </p><p>There was a reason the classics maintained their popularity. </p><p>I let her get used to my presence as I started kissing her neck slowly and steadily, and once she was used to my presence, I picked up speed. She tried to moan and cry, and it was only my lips that prevented her from alerting the rest of the inn. </p><p>As I moved back and forth at a steady pace, it didn’t take long for her to climax, her body rocking in pleasure. Inevitable, considering our long foreplay and her lack of experience. I would have continued, but I was merciful and pulled out. </p><p>I lay next to her and pulled her to my chest while she gasped, trying to control the shaking of her body. “D-does it supposed to feel this good?” she whispered. “I … I heard it was supposed to be painful.” </p><p>Not the most appropriate question. “It is when it’s with me,” I said smugly. Regardless of the circumstances, I always treated keeping my lovers happy and satisfied as a matter of pride. “Now that you had your break, let’s continue,” I said as I flipped her, pinning her prone under me as I slid in and out repeatedly. “Now, how does this feel, Master?” I whispered, fascinated by the way she tightened the moment I called her Master. </p><p>Even though our current position certainly didn’t feel like she was the one that’s teaching. </p><p>I wondered if the sexy and trained way she could walk could be translated into a proper cowgirl position. She had a lithe, elegant body, but she still had the assets to make it fun. “F-faster,” she whispered a while later, unaware of my plans. </p><p>“As you wish, Master,” I said, enjoying her reactions as she received the benefits of her passive positions to the limit. I lowered my head to nibble her neck, the combination forcing her to pull the pillow close and bury her face to suppress her cries. </p><p>I was already planning to test several more positions, but the ragged nature of her breathing changed my mind. She was already getting overwhelmed, and I didn’t want to exaggerate it too much. </p><p>Instead, I brought my lips higher and nibbled her ear. “Climax for me, Master,” I ordered, and she did, her sudden gushing enough to push me over the hill as well. Unfortunately, as much as filling her was tempting, my situation was complicated enough without adding the complication of a child. </p><p>I pulled out, painting her back with seed … and the moment I did, I felt her back being covered with a generous dose of Essence as well.</p><p>An amount that would have put a sense of urgency at me if my Inventory wasn’t filled with a lot of high-essence food to compensate for it. </p><p>“So, that was fun,” I said as I collapsed next to her, waiting for the other shoe to drop about her virginity, but she said nothing. Couldn’t say anything, I realized, as the climax had proved too much, pushing her to the land of unconsciousness. </p><p>A good idea, I decided, leaving the potential problems to future me. I put on underwear and wrapped a towel around her in case she was one of the girls who felt self-conscious about her nudity. Then, I closed my eyes, pulled her against my chest, and fell asleep. It was almost morning, and I wanted to sleep for a couple of hours before waking up to study. </p><p>I still had a lot of work to do.  </p><p><br></p>
