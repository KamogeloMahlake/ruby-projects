        <p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I watched Carrie from the corner of my eye as she scuttled toward the window without losing even a second, not even bothering to get something to cover herself —not that it was something that was really needed after everything. </p><p>As much as I enjoyed watching the way her plump ass jiggled as she dashed, however, I needed to ignore her for a moment, however, no matter a second round while we watched a naked Sarah swim in the pool in an effort to distract herself. </p><p>I needed to talk to Sarah before she went down into a pointless panicking spiral. </p><p>When I stepped into the foyer, the relative darkness hid me from her view for a while, allowing me to watch her as she cut through the water with surprising grace, revealing that she was even more athletic than her general attitude build suggested. I watched as she moved back and forth gracefully, her naked body looking magical under the wrap of the dark waters. </p><p>Then, I threw myself into the water when she was at her most distant, giving her a chance to process my sudden presence. I chose to swim underwater, and when I broke through the surface, I was barely six feet away from her. “Chad?” she gasped questioningly. “What are you doing here?” </p><p>“Well, I wanted to check to see if everything is alright,” I said even as I closed the distance more. </p><p>My sudden appearance must have made her forget her current mode of dress momentarily, because she didn’t move away as I closed in the distance. </p><p>“I’m okay,” she answered. “Shouldn’t you be with Carrie?” </p><p>“She’s taking a little nap,” I answered, then gave her one of my best roguish smiles, the kind that was particularly effective in the relatively dim lighting conditions of the pool. “She still gets tired too quickly, despite all the practice we have,” I said. </p><p>“She’s been busier than I was expecting,” Sarah murmured, unable to prevent jealousy from infecting her tone. </p><p>“What can I say, she’s an enthusiastic student when it came to the kind of benefits friends could provide for each other,” I said even as I closed in the distance further. She took a step back reflexively, which brought her to the shallow part of the pool, the water only coming to her waist. </p><p>While she tried to come up with an answer to that, I let my gaze fall, examining her alabaster skin, shining beautifully under the moonlight, every single part of her beautiful body revealed to my sight. And I admired the opportunity. She might not have the curves of her blonde friend, but both the perkiness and the shape of her bosom were simply incredible. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one distracted by the presence of a naked torso, however. Sarah was equally distracted as she examined my muscles —and something even more interesting around the waist level. “Shouldn’t you back with her, in case she wakes up,” she finally managed to say, too distracted to come up with a proper answer. </p><p>“I’m sure she wouldn’t mind me entertaining one of her best friends,” I said. </p><p>Which, turned out to be the wrong thing to say, because her arms suddenly gathered around her chest. “She’s my best friend, what are we doing?” she gasped in shock, like she just realized the situation we were in. </p><p>“We’re doing nothing we weren’t doing when we were with her,” I reminded her, doing my best to stay calm, knowing that she was looking for an excuse to stay in her current position despite her words. It was just a part of the rationalization. “If she had a problem with that, she wouldn’t have undressed you for a silly bet.” </p><p>“But,” Sarah murmured, but her voice faded quickly, and she made no move to actually pull back. When Sarah looked down to think, I used the brief window of opportunity to look up, seeing Carrie’s figure looking down. Since the lights were turned off, I was only able to see a silhouette of her, but that was enough to confirm that she was still there, watching us. “We can’t do ‘it,” she murmured, the particular focus on the last word leaving no doubt about what she was talking about. </p><p>“As you wish,” I accepted quickly, before coming up with a counteroffer. “How about if we limit ourselves to the things we had done while we were next to her? That should be still in the confines of the game, especially with the way she decided to finish the game,” I said. </p><p>She stood silent, thinking, needing one last push. I decided to continue with a teasing tone, relying on the same playful sense of competition between them that helped to spiral things to their current level. “If you don’t think you can handle even that much, let alone as much as Carrie, though-” I said, only to be cut off. </p><p>“Of course I can handle it,” she answered immediately, her tone blistering. “I just-” she tried to continue, but this time, she was the one that was getting cut off. </p><p>“Perfect, then,” I said even as I took a large step forward, dwindling the distance between us to nothing. Her arms reached to my shoulders reflexively, leaving her chest naked, her nipples rock hard, showing her arousal, though the nighttime swim was certainly not hurting. </p><p>My chest pressed against hers, replicating our position back on the couch as much as possible. Though, there was a great difference. I was a great deal taller than her, meaning my erection was pressing against her stomach, rather noticeably. “This should be okay, right?” I said with a wide smirk as I looked down. </p><p>With her wet hair sticking on her face, she looked even more vulnerable than the first time she realized the true extent of the activity that was going on under the blanket. Her wide-eyed look certainly helped to sell her vulnerability even more. “Y-yeah,” she stammered as she slowly moved back as I pushed forward, until she was locked against the side of the pool. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I grabbed her hand and pulled it to my sides, allowing her to caress my abs. “How about this?” </p><p>“More than fine,” she answered rapidly, before her mind could catch up to what she had said. </p><p>“Excellent,” I repeated, my smirk widening even further as her hand started moving along my sides without prompting, showing the same fascination Carrie had been showing toward my muscles.</p><p>They were really best friends.  </p><p>I would have been happy to let her caress my body for a long while, until her arousal made her forcibly take the next step, but unexpectedly, that strategy was canceled when I noticed Carrie moving restlessly upstairs, clearly getting bored with the show. </p><p>Her sudden visit was the last thing I needed, so I decided to entertain her properly. I grabbed her waist and raised her up, enough to make her sit on the side of the pool, but a strategic step forward prevented her from closing her legs. “So, that should be okay as well,” I said even as I slipped two fingers inside, continuing the job I had started earlier. </p><p>Carrie’s moving figure stilled, suggesting that I was in the right direction. </p><p>“That’s too - much,” Sarah gasped, but the way her back arched and her utter lack of an attempt to push me back suggested that she was having more fun than she might be willing to admit. Carrie stayed in place, though her figure started moving once more, her arms and shoulders rather than her legs this time, conveying her satisfaction with the show. </p><p>Unaware that the show was just beginning. </p><p>Her legs widened as the pleasure hit. Her core was hidden by my fingers, but as her legs widened, I got an even better view of her tight legs and tight ass. They were really her best parts. She just stayed there, enjoying my fingers as I delivered a delicious assault to her. </p><p>Her arousal was getting to an even higher point as the time passed, her moans echoing deliciously against the walls of the house. Lost in pleasure, she didn’t resist even a bit as I pulled her closer, aligning my shaft against her entrance, but rather than pushing in, I started to rub the length against her, her moans intensifying. </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit too much?” she asked, but the delay between my action and her question was more than a minute. She only asked the question after reacting to a point I should pull back, I suddenly realized as I saw her deep arousal. It was just an excuse for her to show her ‘reluctance’ to reduce her guilt toward her friend. </p><p>“Should I stop?” I asked, unable to resist the temptation of teasing her by calling her bluff.</p><p>Her beautiful face froze almost immediately, but then, she stayed silent, seemingly happy with ignoring the existence of the question. My hips stopped their dance, forcing her to speak. “Maybe not,” she muttered shyly. “It’s not too different from when I sat on your lap. Your…thing…was rubbing against me back then as well.” </p><p>“My…thing?” I said mockingly, amused by her failure to refer to my cock even as the said cock continued to rub against her pussy, making her moan. So much for being the brave one among their nerdy group. </p><p>Despite her blush, she said nothing. As I continued rocking my hips, dragging my length repeatedly against her wetness, I decided to give her a reprieve, and didn’t threaten her by stopping unless she used proper names for our anatomical parts. </p><p>With my shaft dancing between her legs, and my fingers teasing her knob relentlessly, her moans evolved from repeated to uninterrupted. She thrust her hips forward, following my rhythm to enhance her pleasure even further. Lost in her pleasure, she didn’t comment the slightest when my free hand found her breasts, caressing the edge and flicking her nipples alternatively. </p><p>Even as my fingers danced at her bosom and her entrance, making her bend her body back even further, showing off her naked body beautifully on the edge of the pool, I couldn’t help but wonder which girl would stop me first. </p><p>Or if they would stop me at all… </p>
