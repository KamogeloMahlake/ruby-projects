        <p>Xia tensed at the sudden intrusion. I felt her mana preparing to flare, ready to lash out, but I immediately pressed my hand on her mouth as I whispered. “Don’t cast anything, and don’t make a sound,” I ordered her even as I pulled the fabric around her, leaving her naked. </p><p>She was surprised by her sudden nudity. Luckily, her first reaction to shock was freezing, which allowed me to finish my preparations quickly. </p><p>I had already arranged a nice nook to hide by realigning the weapon racks when I first arrived, so by sitting down and throwing the fabric over the little opening between the wall and the rack, we had enough space to hide by lying down. </p><p>Of course, there was not enough space for us to lie without touching, inevitably making us lie together. </p><p>And, since I was a kind man, I lay down first, my back against the rough wood of the deck before pulling her naked body on me, our lips separated by inches. “Don’t make a sound,” I whispered when I noticed her moving. </p><p>She froze, unable to react as the shouts exploded around us. I felt the magic flaring across the deck as the magically sealed hatches opened with a simultaneous bang, followed by the sound of wheels as the crew pushed the ballistas forward. </p><p>“Attack,” came a shout from above, accompanied by a flare of magic as the ship continued to move even faster. It seemed that the sorcerer was pushing himself to the limit, risking total exhaustion. </p><p>“Aree you sure—“ Xia whispered, which was all she was able to let out before I pressed my hand over her lips, silencing her once more.</p><p>“It’s nothing compared to what we did in Rome, don’t worry,” I said, with all the confidence of a gambler that was confident with his victory just because his earlier crazy bet had succeeded. Luckily, Xia was distracted with other things — such as her lack of clothing, or my very apparent presence — to focus on the fallacy of my argument. </p><p>She nodded hesitantly, her attention taken by the constant orders that were exploding around us. I focused on their orders for a moment, hoping that their words would reveal something about their situations. </p><p>In that aspect, their discipline proved annoying. The captain didn’t feel the need to console them about their upcoming victory, preventing me from understanding their situation. Therefore, I didn’t know that they were doing the last stand, or that they still had a hope of escaping. </p><p>I sighed in disappointment, but didn’t let that distract me for too long. Even if I had to escape, it was better to do so once the Roman ships boarded, allowing my escape to work more smoothly. </p><p>Luckily, Xia was there to steal my attention, preventing me from focusing on useless concerns. She stole my attention with the movement of her hips once more, rubbing against me. It seemed that she took my guarantee about our safety at face value, and focused on her own entertainment. </p><p>How amusing…</p><p>“So, anything you want to do while waiting for the battle the end,” I whispered. She froze immediately after realizing she wasn’t the only one distracted by the battle, avoiding my gaze shyly. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she whispered, though this time I didn’t interrupt as she maintained enough presence of mind to keep her voice soft. </p><p>I said nothing, following her command, but my words weren’t the only thing that I could use to tease her. I put my hands on her waist, keeping them in place for a moment before her next warning came. “D-don’t touch,” she ordered, blushing to invade her tone. </p><p>I chuckled as I followed that as well, but this time, I raised my head slightly and looked at her body. With her breasts pressing to my chest, I didn’t see any more than I had been when she was wrapped by the fabric, but our position changed the impact greatly. “And no looking,” she gasped panicked, this time loud enough to get the attention of the sailors if it wasn’t for a lucky explosion. </p><p>I didn’t pull my gaze away, so she immediately brought her hands in front of my eyes, blocking my view directly. Amused by the solution, it took all I had to suppress my laughter. </p><p>She shuffled in her place, missing the implications of her movement as she searched for a more comfortable position, only to settle directly at my midsection. </p><p>Another man might have felt guilty enough to remind her that, but such a silly man would have missed her beautiful freezing as she realized that. Or, more importantly, the way her hips started to move softly, making her attempt to close my eyes rather useless. </p><p> I said nothing as her beautiful legs tightened around my waist, wondering how long it would take for her to start moving in a position where she couldn’t act like it was an accidental side-effect of her attempts to get free. </p><p> The answer, as it turned out, was not too long. </p><p>It took barely seconds for her hips to start moving, making me wonder if it was a decision despite the constant explosion that was going around us, or actually because of them — afraid that our little fun could be interrupted at any moment. </p><p>I said nothing as her petite hands tightened over my eyes while her hips started moving, rubbing against my hardness, my pants providing the only barrier between us. And, considering the fabric wasn’t particularly thick, the barrier did little to hide the great sensation of her wetness. </p><p>My shaft hardened rapidly to match her arousal. My body was already primed thanks to the recent boost of energy, which enhanced my vitality significantly, and it would be a lie if I claimed the battle that was going around me didn’t make the moment even more delicious. </p><p>Maybe, just maybe, the constant danger I had been facing might have warped my own sense of pleasure significantly. </p><p>Her hips continued to pick speed, while I bit my lips, doing my best to suppress my desire to tease her, afraid that it would make her too self-aware to continue. And, her hesitant first steps were simply too entertaining to ruin. </p><p>I was surprised when she used a spell to cut a large piece of fabric out of my shirt — the mana spent too little to get noticed while the battle raged around us — afraid that she had chosen that to fashion herself something quick to wear. </p><p>But, that concern didn’t last long, because it didn’t take long for her hands away, instantly replacing them with the fabric she had cut, though I managed to get a glimpse of her beautiful body in the process, her nipples erect, a full body blush covering her body… </p><p>“Interesting —“ I said, unable to suppress my desire to tease her, but that was all I was able to say before she used her — now freed — hand to press against my lips, silencing me. </p><p>Her attempts to take control triggered my instincts a bit, though the soft, amusing mannerism she did help to keep it down, allowing me to ignore it with ease. Still, the slight flare was a dangerous sigh, showing that I would once again deal with foreign instincts after spending so much time suppressing them. </p><p>However, while it was a big problem, it was not an urgent one, especially when I felt her hips move, and her fingers start to mess with my pants. </p><p>A problem for another time, I decided as I raised my hips, allowing her to easily slide my pants and free my shaft. </p><p>When she lowered herself once more, there was nothing to hide the immensity of her wetness, her hips moving back and forth slowly. Carefully, even, to prevent an accident as she limited herself to some surface contact. </p><p>Her hesitancy made the moment even cuter.  </p><p>I said nothing as her legs tightened further around my hips, her speed getting faster. Hardly noticeable at first, but the build up started to get more and more, the desperate quality of her pleasure slowly showing itself. </p><p>It took all of my willpower to keep myself from moving my hips away, just a shift enough to earn my victory, wondering how long it would take for her to escalate the situation even more, her pleasure overwhelming her shy, hesitant nature… </p><p>However, ultimately, it turned out to be a question destined to stay without an answer, because, just as she was at the apex of her movement, about to return, a spectacular fireball — one that implied the presence of at least one Sorcerer in a nearby ship, with the possibility of more considering the reckless delivery — hit near the ship. </p><p>The ship stayed intact, but the resulting waves still rocked the ship aggressively. </p><p>Not expecting the impact, Xia sank down, a gasp escaping her mouth as the accident forced her to take a significant step forward….</p>
