        <p>“So, we’re celebrating your divine ascension,” I said with a chuckle once she pulled for a breather. </p><p>“Don’t be — a smartass,” she growled back, trying to sound angry, but the arousal she was developing at the courtesy of my touch was enough to erase her anger and replace it with desire. “That’s a terrible idea with everything going on. What if the police…” </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as she tried to argue against me while her hips pushed against mine, dry humping desperately. It reminded me of her first lap dance, delivered as a show to the public and a punishment for me, leaving me aching. </p><p>Also the other encounters, like the photoshoot, where I had left her equally frustrated. </p><p>We had a fun little game, but it was time to finally end it. I captured her lips, enjoying the dance of her tongue intensely while I enjoyed her tight ass dance against my hips while her legs stayed wrapped around me … all the while, we continued to float. </p><p>I could have undressed her with my hands, but I felt like showing off, so I used telekinesis to get rid of her clothes, leaving her in her underwear, a sexy black set that contrasted greatly with her beautiful innocent skin. </p><p>“So, aren’t you risking a lightning bolt using your divine skills like this,” she asked when she pulled back for a breather. </p><p>“I don’t know, but not likely. Apparently, the Greek gods are real, and if even a tenth of the stories about them are accurate, they don’t really have a problem using their divine gifts for sex.” I followed with a bite to her neck, and she moaned, her back arching. </p><p>“An existential crisis to deal with. Just what every girl needs while having sex. Excellent choice,” she responded, doing her best to sound sarcastic. Unfortunately for her, sarcasm didn’t work well with a voice throaty with pleasure. </p><p>“What can I say, I’m doing my best to keep things fun,” I said even as I licked the nape of her neck. Her back arched once more, her words gone, and I let my gaze fall, enjoying her fair skin and impressive curves. She wasn’t exactly stacked, but the curves she had were sculpted to perfection.   </p><p>I wasn’t the only one distracted by the presence of some naked skin, as Megan was equally hungry as she traced my muscles, multitasking her moans. As she shifted, my raging erection was pressing against her stomach, rather noticeable in its presence. “You’re overdressed,” she growled, and pushed my underwear down, leaving me naked. </p><p>“Oh, naughty—“ I started, but this time, it was me that was interrupted by a moan as Megan sank down, taking my length without even bothering to remove her panties, just sliding them to the side. </p><p>“Less talk, more work. Don’t forget that you’re an employee!” she growled as she pushed down. </p><p>I might have been annoyed at her attempts to look dominant, but with her hair sticking on her sweaty face and with her eyes wide with pleasure, she looked even more vulnerable than the first time she realized the true extent of my power over hers. And, I was nice enough to let her maintain that fiction to gain her confidence. </p><p>For a while, at least. </p><p>“Let me worship then, boss,” I said as I tightened my grip around her hips, enjoying her ass, taking a moment to flick my fingers to rip off her panties. They weren’t exactly made of the strongest fabric, but the ease I did was enough to show the extent of my physical strength. </p><p>A detail she didn’t miss if the phenomenal tightness that followed was any indicator. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I tightened my grip, supporting the desperate rocking of her hips. “So, boss, tell me, just how long you have been dreaming of taming your poor employee,” I asked. </p><p>“Jerk,” she murmured, but still answered. “Far too long, but it’s unbearable since that cursed photoshoot. That whore Kimberly didn’t make it any easier by constantly bragging about your cock. I was sure that she had exaggerated. It had to be magical for it to be that amazing…” </p><p>“But it turned out the magic is real,” I chuckled as I pushed hard, earning a beautiful cry that echoed in the emptiness around us. </p><p>“Bastard,” she insulted once more, but her words disappeared once again once I added two fingers to the balance, twisting her nipples alternatingly. </p><p>“S-slow down, you bastard,” she gasped soon. “If you go that hard, I won’t last long, and I don’t want this to be quick.” </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, you’re forgetting something,” I said even as I dragged my fingers along her spine, the sudden gentleness of touch enough to trigger a very explosive climax. She rocked on my hips desperately, her hold weakening…</p><p>Her response came a minute later, which she used to recover from her explosive climax. “What am I forgetting, you magnificent bastard,” she said. </p><p>“That you have supernatural powers as well.” Her eyes widened. “Don’t worry, beautiful, not lasting long is the least of your concerns. Perks of divine lovemaking.” </p><p>“Oh, not bad,” she answered, trying to sound nonchalant, but it died a quick death when an aftershock of tremble hit and it turned into a moan. “I can see the benefits of keeping you on the side…” </p><p>I chuckled, but it was a dark one. “Oh, baby, if you think I’ll let you go after everything, you’re sorely mistaken. The moment you returned to defend my life, you signed yourself to me. I won’t ever let you go!” </p><p>“You think you can tame me—“ she gasped, but I bit her shoulder playfully, making her gasp, but it also left a mark. ”You’re a barbarian,” she added, but her voice was filled with desire. </p><p>It seemed that she wasn’t exactly torn up about the implied permanency of the issue. </p><p>A nice session of sex was always useful … though, admittedly, granting divine powers to her might have played a slight role as well. Certainly a better gift than an emerald ring. </p><p>Certainly far more permanent.  </p><p>“I think that’s enough rest,” I said with a chuckle even as I pushed. </p><p>“That’s too fast,” Megan gasped, her beautiful blonde hair dancing as she threw her head back, but the way her back arched and her utter lack of an attempt to stop me suggested that she wasn’t as against the second round as she wanted to admit. </p><p>I started drilling into her harder and harder, enjoying the pace. “So, to make you stronger, we need to make you famous,” I said. </p><p>“Really—“ she gasped. “That’s the time you want to talk strategy.” </p><p>“Oh, we can always talk later if you don’t think you can handle it,” I said, the challenge enough to awaken her competitive side. I liked Megan best when she was competitive, fighting for verbal domination. </p><p>“Of course, I can handle it,” she answered, managing to deliver her sentence in one block despite my drilling. “But what exactly does it have to do with me being famous.” </p><p>“Oh, here’s a summary of my discoveries…” I started, and delivered her a short and intense summary of how emotions of the public worked wonders to enhance our powers, and how certain intense emotions like elation of victory, jealousy, and anger worked … all the while drilling her into near-stupor. She climaxed once again, and only a jolt of recovery energy kept her conscious. </p><p>“So, we need to make people jealous,” she murmured. “Maybe I should start dating —“ she started. </p><p>“Be careful,” I warned, growling threateningly as I did so. I knew that she was teasing me, but that didn’t mean that I would let her. I was feeling very possessive after linking her with the System. </p><p>“… with a woman,” she added, her smile playful. “I’ll start dating a sexy model publicly, and will come out as bisexual,” she added. “That way, bigots will be scandalized, and a lot of incompetent men would start dreaming about what they couldn’t have, especially coming from a young businesswoman.” </p><p>I thought a bit, and found it far more palatable. “At least the visits will be far more entertaining,” I said, amused to see this time it was her that had a flash of jealousy.</p><p>“No, I have a name in mind, but there will be nothing going on between us. It’ll be a purely business deal for the media. She’s very straight,” Megan explained quickly, showing that she wasn’t ready to go in that direction. But, something in the way she said that gave me an interesting clue. </p><p>“And, who’s this candidate that you came up with very quickly.” </p><p>“Jane Stacy, an old friend,” Megan answered, even though she looked very reluctant to reveal that name. I was not very familiar with the modeling scene, but the name was quick to pop up. An absolutely stacked redhead model, and one of the most popular names in the country. An excellent name to gather a lot of Intent quickly, probably enough to match all the Intent I had been gathering from the football games. </p><p>It was good to see revealing my secret to Megan was not a wrong choice. She was quickly shaping up to be an excellent second-in-command. I couldn’t wait until she applied her enhanced abilities to the business arena. </p><p>But, the implied potential for the future was certainly not enough to prevent me from teasing her. “Oh, poor little Megan failed to seduce her friend. Don’t worry, your faithful employee is here to help you. Don’t worry, I’ll do my best to help you get a taste of that sexy redhead…” </p><p>“I’ll kill you,” Megan gasped, but her anger was impossible to maintain as I exploded inside her, filling her with my seed while triggering another spectacular orgasm… </p>
