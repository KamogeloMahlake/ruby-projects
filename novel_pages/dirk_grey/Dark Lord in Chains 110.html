        <p>Looking at the two beauties in front of me, both collapsed, I was tempted to end the adventure of the evening, even dispelling the little toy that was ramming into Valkyrie, but that didn’t last long.</p><p>It died the moment Valkyrie managed to turn her gaze to me, busy smirking proudly as she looked at me. “You seem exhausted, maybe you shouldn’t have started something you couldn’t have finished,” she said, her lips widening.</p><p>“Oh, daring,” I said, slightly surprised by the mood shift, but didn’t answer. I was busy examining her expression, though the fact that Sapphire was collapsed on top of her, her amazing booty completing the view, was something else.</p><p>She smiled proudly, her confidence flaring, likely thinking that I was feeling self-conscious at the sudden shift.</p><p>Well, if she was thinking that, she was horribly mistaken. I turned my attention to her, enjoying her momentary distraction before I started teaching her the lesson she needed.</p><p>Sapphire was smarter, her head shuffled slightly as she sent a hesitant glare toward me — well, the kind of hesitant that was colored with arousal. Exactly the emotion I wanted to see to make my decision.</p><p>“Sapphire, sweetie, why don’t you move down a bit and reward your loyal knight for her selfless work.”</p><p>It was fun to watch Valkyrie’s expression shift into a beautiful kind of frustrated anger with great speed. “Hey, what do you mean it worked. It was a bet, and I won!” she declared pridefully, momentarily forgetting that she was talking to her Queen.</p><p>Admittedly, I didn’t blame her much for that particular mistake. It was easy to forget the naked buxom blonde was also the Queen, especially when she was crawling down with great speed until, moving to position herself between her legs.</p><p>I could have reminded her that, and her flare of anger would have died in defeat, attacked by her skewed sense of what was acceptable and what was scandalous. But I let that stand. Her frustrated anger worked excellently to blur those already-skewed lines.</p><p>And it would be even more fun.</p><p>“She deserves a better view, doesn’t she?” I said with a sudden passion as I sat next to her. Then, under Sapphire’s enthusiastic gaze, I lifted her … then brought them down.</p><p>Directly onto my shaft.</p><p>Valkyrie looked down, surprised, but her moan was quick to kill her words. She kept her legs together, which hid the true nature of her move even as she once again devoured my length. Not that there was any mystery about what was going on.</p><p>“Not bad,” Sapphire muttered, but even as she said so, she grabbed her legs, parting them. Valkyrie tried to resist, but only survived until my teeth clamped to her neck.</p><p>She shivered as her Queen parted her legs, and started leaning down. “What a nice Royal master she is,, making sure to pay you back,” I said when I felt her stirring.</p><p>“Y-you,” Valkyrie gasped, her confidence shattering completely as she remembered the obvious. That she was still dealing with her Queen.</p><p>I chuckled at her reaction, certainly enjoying the unusual experience she was experiencing. In our previous deals, she was always much more self-possessed and controlled. It was a nice change to see her like this.</p><p>Sapphire’s vindictive smile was beautiful, almost as beautiful as the way Valkyrie tightened around me as her hips started to rock under my command. Yet, that was only the beginning of her point. She leaned forward, letting her tongue dance on her clit. “You wanted to make a competition, right?” she murmured.</p><p>She was appropriately vindictive for a Queen, but the way she applied that was certainly beautiful.</p><p>Valkyrie squeaked wordlessly once Sapphire started, her eyes widening. I didn’t blame her. She might have assumed herself to have a skillful tongue, but it was nothing compared to Sapphire’s dancing tongue. Especially since Sapphire was cheating a bit as flickers of mana danced on top of her tongue, making her moan beautifully…</p><p>“I — I can still win,” Valkyrie moaned. “You just don’t have a toy to make it —“ she added.</p><p>I waved my hand, and an identical toy slipped inside her. “Here, all fair,” I whispered, enjoying Valkyrie’s frantic expression as Sapphire ignored that in favor of focusing on her curves.</p><p>Before she could leave her seat, I stopped her by wrapping my arm around her waist. “Y-yeah, all fair,” she whispered as I leaned toward her, leaving a lingering kiss on her neck, which distracted her from Sapphire’s subtle spell.</p><p>Her arousal started to build up, but she obeyed, grunting in pleasure despite being ambushed, not sure how to handle the presence of her Queen steadily treating her. “She’s really enthusiastic, isn’t she—“ I started as I looked at Sapphire, only to be interrupted by Valkyrie’s grunt of displeasure. I wondered if she was unhappy with the fact that I was still paying attention to Sapphire, or if she didn’t want me to distract Sapphire, which would make the treatment stop.</p><p>Either way, it wasn’t hard to comply with it. I grabbed her hips and pulled her down hard, invading her hard.</p><p>Her protests died on her lips as she found herself impaled on my rod fully, her moan spectacular as my shaft reminded her of her limits once again. Sapphire didn’t skip a beat, continuing to tease her core, her wide legs affording her no protection.</p><p>“She’s taking it pretty well,” Sapphire commented.</p><p>“Well,” I answered even as I slapped her ass, enjoying the echo. “That’s the result of repeated practice for the last … three years,” I said.</p><p>“Four,” Valkyrie corrected rapidly, angry at my mistake as she turned to me, only to find me smirking, realizing my mistake was not accidental.</p><p>“Repeated exercising,” Sapphire murmured vindictively at the mention that it wasn’t the first time. It wasn’t exactly a secret at this point, but mentioning just how long it had been going had a weight of its own. “It’s good to see my knights working hard,” she said, sarcastically.</p><p>Considering she returned to lick her, she was clearly not angry enough to count it as treason, but I had a feeling that Valkyrie was still lucky with the upcoming abdication.</p><p>Valkyrie managed to control herself, for a given value, her expression inscrutable, too busy trying to contain her moans to pay attention to anything else. It was a beautiful dance.</p><p>I tightened my grip on her hips and pulled her even harder, her tight hips squirming around the base of my shaft, and her lips finally lost their resistance, exploding in a moan.</p><p>“She’s such a good Queen, right?” I asked her, enjoying Sapphire’s smirk.</p><p>“What can I say —” Valkyrie answered, trying to sound sarcastic despite her tense tone, her frustration directed at her liege, but before she could deliver that sarcastic remark, a beautiful moan exploded off her, filling the room.</p><p>We were nearing her limits, and unlike her attempt, Sapphire was not dragging along with her. I said nothing, just enjoying the fruits of their little competition.</p><p>For a moment, I let silence — well, not silence considering her moans, but a lack of words — rule the room as I focused on my own pleasure, grabbing her legs and pulling them even farther for Sapphire’s access.</p><p>Valkyrie’s expression was beautiful, especially as I started pushing her down even more aggressively. She closed her eyes, and I tightened my grip. Her defeat was certain.</p><p>Sapphire surprised us by suddenly standing up. Valkyrie opened her mouth to question, but before she could succeed, Sapphire pulled the toy out of her.</p><p>And slid into Valkyrie’s puckered hole.</p><p>Valkyrie exploded in a shocked moan, one that was cut short only because Sapphire leaned forward and captured her lips, her hands handing on Valkyrie’s breasts to twist her nipples, hard.</p><p>Under the sudden and intense assault, Valkyrie exploded with the biggest climax I had ever watched her experience, her eyes wide with shock, not expecting the change.</p><p>I continued pumping, Sapphire continued her own assault, and soon… Valkyrie let out one last desperate moan, and fell unconscious despite her amazing physical abilities.</p><p>“Such a weak little knight,” Sapphire murmured as she pushed her onto the bed, laying away from us, her chest going up and down.</p><p>“What a cruel Queen,” I answered, my smirk getting even wider.</p><p>“Of course,” she answered with a beautiful smirk as she lay next to Valkyrie, her legs wide in invitation. “It’s my turn now,” she said, her smugness apparent even with her quickened breathing.</p><p>“What an insatiable Queen,” I answered as I leaned forward…</p>
