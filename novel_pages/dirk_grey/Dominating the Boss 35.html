        <p>Even as Umi started moving back and forth, rocking over my length, I could feel that her tenseness was yet to disappear completely. </p><p>In a way, it was understandable. Just because she was letting things go too far didn’t mean that she was unaware she was letting things go too far. It was just that, due to out-of-view ‘cheating’ of her fiancee. </p><p>Of course, that was just an illusion, one that was created by Brenda. The blonde secretary might not be good when it came to her job, but she truly knew how to play with a man from a distance, especially a naive one like Charlie. </p><p>The poor guy didn’t even have a chance. </p><p>Under the shadow of Brenda’s lush laughter, I finished putting sunscreen on her breasts, and started to move lower, toward the last untouched destination. </p><p>“I-is it really necessary,” she gasped as she made a motion to stand up, but it was a weak, ineffectual move, easily prevented by the weight of my hand. </p><p>“Of course, we don’t want your beautiful lips to burn if your bikini bottom slips, or you have to remove it for any reason.” </p><p>“I’m sure such a thing wouldn’t happen—“ she stammered, only to be interrupted by a moan as I let my fingers cover the remaining distance aggressively, landing on her knob. </p><p>“Really, do you want to bet?” I said throatily, letting the challenge infect my voice. A challenge that was enough to silence her, no doubt invaded by the memories of the night before, aware of just how far things could devolve in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Or maybe, I was reading her wrongly. Maybe it was just the fact that my fingers were dancing at her entrance, each flick triggering a beautiful moan that she did her best to suppress, but only attained partial success. </p><p>Luckily, her fiancee had other things to focus on, thinking Umi was just lounging on the deck of the ship. “Do you think that Charlie imagines that you’re lounging on my private … deck?” I whispered. </p><p>“D-don’t be crass,” she gasped back, barely able to stammer a response. </p><p>“Well, maybe he just doesn’t care. Or he would at least check what kind of bikini I picked for you,” I whispered, adding a few flickers of doubt about her fiancee’s ultimate aim. Or, more accurately, I fueled already existing ones, as Charlie already achieved the seeding part by sending Umi to entertain me the night before. </p><p>He was unaware of the truth of what was going on, misguided by his overconfident manager, but it certainly looked different from Umi’s perspective. And, Charlie’s reaction to being flirted with by a sexy bombshell like Brenda just further enhanced Umi’s inclination to think of his actions in the worst light. </p><p>Combine her otherwise submissive personality with a shark like me, and it turned into a recipe for disaster. </p><p>A fun one, I thought with a confident grin as she quivered on my lap. With her attention focused on suppressing her moans, she didn’t pay much attention to the trembles of her body, or the great effect it had on my strategically-positioned shaft. </p><p>At this moment, I could have pushed her down and had my way with her, but where was the fun in that. Instead, I pulled my fingers, and without she could react, I helped her to stand up. “Let’s go and see what your fiancee is doing,” I said. </p><p>“R-right now,” she stammered as she looked at me, breathing hard, her legs trembling. </p><p>“Yes, right now,” I replied as I gave her a confident grin that made her legs tremble even more. I was speaking louder than necessary, because I wanted to alert Brenda that we were coming, expecting her to do something interesting. </p><p>“Oh, Charlie, you’re so bad,” Brenda gasped, followed by a crystal laugh, just as we arrived at the side of the ship, leaning against the railings. </p><p>Damn, I thought as I glanced downward, taking a mental note to let Brenda whatever she wanted to buy on our little trip. The scene I glimpsed at the sea deserved nothing less.</p><p>When we arrived, Brenda was fixing her top while she was looking at Charlie, like she was to be blamed for the mishap. From our angle, it looked scandalous. Yet, I didn’t miss the fact that Brenda’s back completely turned to Charlie, not giving him even a glimpse, and the distance between them was too much for him to quickly realign himself. </p><p>Especially since he was already drunk enough to prevent him from moving quick enough. </p><p>I managed to catch those details, but, if Umi’s sudden huff of anger was any indicator, she wasn’t as careful analyzing the situation. </p><p>She said nothing, just walked back disappearing from the view before Charlie could even register her presence. I turned to watch her, standing still to enjoy her movement, her hips shaking at each step. It wasn’t a measured sway to maximize her assets like Brenda might have displayed, but that didn’t make her any less sexy. </p><p>On the contrary, the intensity of her emotions only made them more impactful. </p><p>Halfway to the deck, she stopped and turned. “Are you coming?” she ordered impatiently, her voice lacking even the slightest indecision in a rare display of confidence.</p><p>She must be truly angry. </p><p>Her anger was misguided — at least, partially so, as no one forced Charlie to follow Brenda into the sea and ignore his fiancee — but I had no problems enjoying the benefits of her emotions despite that. </p><p>I didn’t reach where I was by being nice. </p><p>Umi just waited until I arrived next to her. Her hand reached toward me, and for a moment, I was sure that she would grab my wrist and drag me toward the small bedroom of the ship. </p><p>Then, she surprised me by reaching for something different. My swimsuit. She pushed it down with a tug even as she fell to her knees. “It’s all Charlie’s fault,” she murmured petulantly. Normally, it wasn’t the most attractive emotion, but it looked much better on the face of exotic beauty. </p><p>Especially since the exotic beauty in question was kneeling in front of me, her gaze locked on my shaft. </p><p>Her statement was inaccurate, that much was clear. Some were Charlie’s fault, but quite a bit was hers as well, a mixture of trusting the wrong people — like her redheaded bestie — and lacking the ability to say no, unable to gather the necessary courage under the overwhelming combination of her submissiveness and her curiosity. </p><p>“Of course, it’s all his fault. And you need to make him pay,” I whispered rather than informing her about my true thoughts. After all, the devil didn’t go around having fair debates about people, he just whispered temptations… </p><p>Not that Umi seemed to require many temptations at the moment if the speed at her fingers wrapped around the base of the shaft was any indicator — her soft fingers unable to all the way. “I’ll make him pay,” she whispered as she leaned forward more, her lips finally touching my shaft. </p><p>“Yes, make him pay,” I whispered as I slid my finger into her beautiful black hair, enjoying the glorious softness on my fingertips. Of course, the sensation was nothing compared to the hesitant touch of her lips as she devoured the head, but I didn’t want to scare her. </p><p>Instead, I limited myself to playing with her hair as she went back and forth, carefully watching her expression as the hesitation slowly disappeared, replaced by a smoky, lusty look, along with what could be termed as confidence. </p><p>The confidence portion didn’t survive for long. I treated it as a signal, and reached down, hooking my finger around her bikini top, directly into her cleavage, while my other hand tugged the string that was responsible for keeping it in place. </p><p>A tug later, her bikini top was yanked away, leaving her gasping in shock as she pulled back, her hands on her breasts. “Come on, sweetie,” I said. “You wanted to make him pay, right. You need to do it properly.” </p><p>She gaped as a blush spread on her face, but she glanced down, looking at my naked shaft, the glistening head enough to tell her she had already gone sufficiently far, and an absent top could hardly make a difference. </p><p>Then, before she could fully make that commitment, another laughter exploded from the sea, erotic and suggestive, enough to renew Umi’s warped understanding of what was happening. Though, it caused a surprising reaction. Rather than leaning forward, she grabbed the strings of her bottom, and a tug later, freed herself from its confines. </p><p>“See,” I said with a chuckle. “It’s like just I said. All it takes is an accident to leave you bereft of it. Aren’t you happy that I already put sun screen?” </p><p>“S-shut up,” she stammered. And, since she followed that up by leaning forward and wrapping her lips around my shaft, I decided to follow her orders. </p><p>The moment was just too fun to miss the implications… </p>
