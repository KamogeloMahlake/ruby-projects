        <p>“Salutations,” I greeted her even with mock seriousness, but didn’t stop my refining even a second, once again showing off my skills in the process. Most apothecaries wouldn’t dare to refine high-grade medicine in anything but perfect conditions. </p><p>Marana didn’t say anything, taking note of the changes on my face. Realization passed through her face. I expected her not to comment on it, maintaining a polite fiction. She surprised me. “You never needed the techniques of Elsana and Lannayin, did you?” she asked. </p><p>She was even more protective than I had given her credit for. </p><p>“No. I just needed an excuse to keep the Tigers from realizing there’s another player in the game,” I said. </p><p>Her suspicious glare was deserved. “And who do you work—” she started, only to freeze when I threw her the letter, which had been sealed with Aisnam’s seal. “Royals,” she commented, her confusion clear. </p><p>“The Third Queen, in particular,” I said, noting her confusion. Her reaction showed that she wasn’t particularly familiar with the nuances of the capital politics. Not particularly shocking. Until recently, she was a Bone Forging realm artist, and while it had been an important rank in local politics, it was hardly significant in the wider kingdom. “I need to have a meeting with the city lord,” I said. </p><p>“I won’t arrange that,” she said, her tone decisive. She clearly didn’t appreciate my lies even with my help. Understandable. </p><p>“Bring the letter to them, and let them decide,” I responded. Since Aisnam gave me the key to arranging their cooperation, I didn’t want to bother with talking too much. Particularly since Pearyin was still waiting for me at the cave, and I wanted to return to her as soon as possible. </p><p>That actually made her feel better. I certainly emphasized her perspective. She just wanted to live in her little corner, away from the political games, but events forced her to a role she didn’t want to take. </p><p>She turned to depart. “Tell them that I will only stay here for another hour. If they are amenable to the deal, they should hurry up,” I said. A little rushed, but I didn’t want them to delay me a couple hours as a power play. Normally, I wouldn’t have minded too much, but I had too many things to do. </p><p>Marana left in silence, and I returned my pill refining. Barely ten minutes later, she returned, with a familiar armored figure in tow. Falnaher, the daughter of the city lord. </p><p>I took a moment to catalog the differences since our last encounter. She was still a beautiful woman, still with a sharp, decisive gaze, but her attitude gave a more mature impression. A bloody civil war, followed by an unofficial siege from the monsters, had some substantial impact. “Hello,” I said casually, still refining pills, like we weren’t about to have a discussion on a topic of utmost importance. </p><p>“So, you’re the mysterious apothecary,” she said, continuing on that casual tone rather than trying to force a formality. A credit to her flexibility. </p><p>I nodded. “I try.” </p><p> “And, you bring news from Her Highness the Third Queen,” she followed. </p><p>“Just a little trade deal between the small and insignificant organization I’m working for and her exalted self,” I explained. </p><p>“Why are you here, then?” she said, immediately attacking the core of the issue. “You have been helping us for far longer.” </p><p>I shrugged. “We assumed the eventual possibility of her asking for our assistance, and made sure the need continued,” I admitted. </p><p>“Or maybe, you have arranged everything to trick her, and we’re your pawns,” she said. As she delivered that, her hand landed on the hilt of her sword, and her aura flared, trying to oppress me. Her claim was nonsense, and she clearly knew that. She was just using it as an excuse to bring her pressure. </p><p>A little trick I decided to ignore, along with the pressure of her essence. I could sense that she had already reached the Connate Realm, but even without my Qi cultivation, I had the ability to ignore it. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said with a shrug. “But, if that was true, and you actually think that my organization had the ability to play two great cultivation sects at the same time for a mere mortal city, would you have spoken to me like this?” </p><p>The simple, non-confrontational answer was enough to cut the wind in her sails, and she bypassed it. “What can you offer to us?” she asked. </p><p>“An army, enough to fight against the upcoming Tiger Fist crowd,” I answered. “It depends on how much you’re willing to make your Queen pay, of course, but I recommend you to play it safe.” </p><p>“As much as we want?” she asked. “And, what if I ask for fifteen Connate Realm artists,” she said. </p><p>“I would say it’s a risky choice,” I said. “They had brought at least twenty Connate Realm experts, and they might decide to change their plans and bring all of them against Markas,” I said. </p><p>“Are you sure?” she said. “The Queen mentioned only ten of them in her letter. If you’re trying to make the Queen put into your debt by lying.” </p><p>“At least that many,” I said. “It looks like they might have other ideas in Zaim Kingdom.” I paused a moment, making a show of thinking. I wanted to offer them limitless support, but it was hard to do without awakening their suspicion. “I’ll tell you what. I’ll give you a bonus. I’ll not charge for the extra assistance if my intelligence report turns out to be false.” </p><p>That offer managed to cut most of her argument down. “You must really dislike Tiger Fist,” she said. </p><p>“They are not my favorite people,” I answered, letting my essence flare sharply for a moment, like I had lost control of my anger. There was no harm in implying some personal stake. It would be helpful. “Still, be aware that our little organization has its limits, and it might be the last time I could get away with a visit. Being conservative might be dangerous.” </p><p>Falnaher paused, then looked at Marana. “And, is the Queen going to be responsible for paying for Crane school as well?” she asked. </p><p>“No,” I said as I met Marana’s gaze with a kind smile. “We have an alternative deal in place that you don’t need to worry about.” </p><p>Marana didn’t look particularly happy about that declaration. She must have felt like she had made a deal with the devil. Still, she said nothing. </p><p>“Alright. What do you offer apart from the pills and other apothecary products.” </p><p>“I’m not bad when it comes to needles, so I could help people breakthrough. Combined with the pills, having at least thirty Connate Realm artists shouldn’t be impossible,” I said. </p><p>She tensed at my offer. Understandable, as, from the perspective of the mortal kingdoms, Connate Realm martial artists represented the peak of firepower. Having a couple of them would ensure their security. Thirty of them were effectively open rebellion. </p><p>“Of course, you need to remember that we’re helping you because of the request of our dear Queen,” I added before she could come up with it. “Any conflict between you and her, and we might decide to … take our gifts back.” </p><p>It was an open threat, which was not exactly conducive to trust, but I didn’t want her to start causing problems for Aisnam. </p><p>“So, that’s your offer. Thirty Connate Realm experts,” she repeated. </p><p>“Well, not only that,” I said as I reached for my pouch, and unfurled the calligraphy piece, Sword. The intent spread, earning matching gasps. “I’m sure it’ll be helpful,” I said, then I threw the second one to Marana without even unfurling it. </p><p>Marana unfurled it carefully, only to gasp. “And what do I need to pay for it?” she asked. </p><p>“Think of it as an investment for the future,” I replied. Then, I threw them the manuscripts I prepared on how to counter Tiger Fist, amused by their expression. I felt like Santa visiting an orphanage, each gift earning a bigger reaction. “I hope they are acceptable?” I said. </p><p>“Certainly,” Falnaher answered. </p><p>“Good, then go and bring your candidates for Connate Realm. I want them here when I finish refining pills. I’m a busy man.” </p><p>I didn’t bother explaining to them to select trustworthy people who could keep a secret. They would have been long dead if they couldn’t think something as simple as that. </p><p>What followed was half a day of treatment, where I had given almost a hundred people treatment to help them. Some of them were already at the Bone Refinement, so I helped them to breakthrough directly. The others were not as high, so focused on cleansing their acupunctures and smoothing their path for their eventual breakthrough. It helped that their talent was decent. </p><p>I could have helped all of them directly to Connate Realm, but I didn’t, for two reasons. Strategically, I had already shown up enough. What I had done here would eventually trickle up to the sects, and Aisnam’s story about the battlefield showed that sects had some use for a large number of martial artists. Showing off my exaggerated abilities too much might not be to my benefit. </p><p>The other reason was simpler. I didn’t have time. I still needed to visit Pearyin before fate decided to give me another ‘gift’. Not to mention, I still need to return to Aisnam. </p><p>The longer I stayed away, the more worried she would get, and I didn’t want to stress my cute Queen. </p>
