        <p>For a while, I didn’t intervene with Ida’s transparent excuse, letting her do as he wished, content in pushing inside her repeatedly to push her ever closer to her orgasm, though not as recklessly to bring that immediately. </p><p>The moment was too beautiful not to savor. </p><p>As time passed, Ida’s transparent excuse started to get even more see-through, to the point of being invisible, fully revealing the intent behind it. I chuckled even as she stopped paying attention to her pictures, and her free hand started to linger down, landing on Carrie’s breasts. </p><p>She squeezed aggressively, showing that I wasn’t the only one that was fascinated with the great expanse of her bosom. Carrie moaned helplessly, her words destroyed by her makeshift gag. After all, not only her breasts were spectacular, but also extremely sensitive. </p><p>Combined with her helpless state, it was no wonder she was being driven crazy. However, unable to say anything, the best she could do was to squirm as Ida twisted her nipples recklessly, triggering a beautiful mixture of pain and pleasure in her. </p><p>“It’s unfair,” I suddenly whispered. </p><p>“What’s unfair?” Ida asked in a scathing tone. “She’s the one that arranged everything, and sacrificed her friends one by one to your horrible appetite,” Ida commented. Her words were not wrong, technically, but the way she was rocking her hips as I invaded her core repeatedly took a lot of impact from the words that were hidden in her tone. </p><p>So much for my horrible appetite. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, I’m not talking about her, I’m talking about you,” I whispered into her ear, the position allowing it so. Though, I make sure to keep my tone loud enough for Carrie to hear, who stopped her shuffling for a moment. </p><p>No doubt recognize my mischievous tone. </p><p>“And what are you talking about?” </p><p>“Well, I was thinking that it was unfair for you to distract yourself by trying to do two things, rather than just focusing on punishing Carrie. </p><p>Her eyes widened, even bigger than they did when I had invaded her whole being for the first time. “Wait —“ she ordered, sharp, but that was a mistake. Before she could tighten her grip on her camera, I pulled it off her fingers, and unhooked it from her neck. </p><p>“Much better,” I said, smiling at her solitary word, interrupted the moment I had pulled it off her fingers, enjoying the way her words had disappeared into a panicked gasp, her earlier confidence melting faster than an ice cube dipped into lava. </p><p>She pulled her hand away from Carrie’s body, like it was made of the same lava. Carrie chuckled, her gag unable to suppress that particular sound, her body rocking softly. </p><p>Ida opened her lips, but no words were forthcoming. Not that I cared much, as at this point, her mouth had many more important things to do. She shouldn’t exhaust herself by trying to form words. I leaned to capture her lips, one hand around still around her waist to keep her in place. </p><p>“Try to hold onto something, sweetie,” I ordered, making her eyes widen. Yet, at this point, with her shattering confidence and her mind blanked with pleasure, she had no choice but to follow my orders. </p><p>And, the only thing she could hold on to at our current position was Carrie. </p><p>She still managed to do it as safely as she could manage, and put both hands on Carrie’s shoulders. “Good,” I said. “But let’s make sure Carrie could communicate her problems,” I added, and reached. </p><p>“Noo…” Ida whispered softly, but that was all she was able to say before I pulled off Carrie’s makeshift gag and threw it to the side. </p><p>“Finally,” Carrie murmured, her beautiful lips curling into a smile. Ida just trembled. Amusing that Carrie, still blindfolded and her body wrapped in ropes, radiated an aura of control much stronger than Ida, who was currently busy panicking. </p><p>Since Ida showed no intention of answering, I decided to use her pretty mouth for a more useful purpose. I sealed her lips with mine even as I shifted, forcing her to rely on Carrie to maintain balance. “Wow, it sounds like fun,” Carrie commented, interrupting the sound of our hips slamming loudly, filling the house with our sound. </p><p>“Oh, believe me, it is,” I answered as I pulled back for a breather, while Ida just let out a panicked yelp. “Don’t you think, sweetie?” I asked as I slapped her ass. </p><p>“It’s … not fair,” she murmured at the slap. </p><p>“Exactly, it’s not fair to keep her bound and blindfolded, Chad,” Carrie said, somehow managing to sound sarcastic and erotic at the same time, which was not a simple achievement. “Oh, wait…” </p><p>Ida moaned in shame, and I took over, not stopping invading her core even for a moment. “You know that she’s not wrong, right?” I said with a serious tone, like I was negotiating peace rather than banging her naked body ceaselessly. “You were the one that tied her down helplessly to fulfill your own professional objectives. It’s not fair for you to suddenly start talking about fairness.” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she whispered. “But this is too much,” she continued. </p><p>“Really, maybe we should ask Carrie,” I said as I grabbed her blindfold, and tugged it free in a smooth move, giving her her vision back. </p><p>Her gaze was sexy and bright as she pinned Ida down, who failed to say anything as she came face to face with her model. A nicer man might have stopped his movements to give Ida a chance to recover. </p><p>But then, a nicer man wouldn’t have been in my position, invading her whole being in front of one of her best friends, a friend that Ida had been photographing in bondage before — and after — my arrival. </p><p>“Carrie, sweetie, do you mind helping me to silence her,” I whispered as I pushed forward with more strength. One advantage, I finally buried myself fully in her, triggering a spectacular cry that told me her climax wasn’t too far away — and would arrive in a spectacular manner — but that wasn’t the biggest advantage. </p><p>No, the biggest advantage was that it disrupted Ida’s balance, so rather than relying on grabbing Carrie’s shoulders and maintaining as much distance as possible, her arms wrapped around Carrie’s neck. </p><p>With the effect of bringing their lips to close. </p><p>An opportunity that Carrie took instantly, with more passion than I expected her to take, suggesting that her voyeurism kink wasn’t the only surprise she was holding for me. A twist of her neck was enough to close the distance, her tongue invading Ida’s mouth. </p><p>My presence prevented Ida’s retreat, keeping her in place. Not that she had the confidence to pull back from the kiss. </p><p>Or likely, the intent as well. I remembered just how distracted she was while playing with Carrie’s tits, and the sudden tightening in her core was just another clue she wasn’t against Carrie’s choice. </p><p>Such an interesting group of friends, I thought as I continued my beautiful, scandalous task of giving Ida her first explosive climax, her tits dangling freely with each push, the angle working perfectly to enhance the effect. </p><p>“Pity I can’t pay her back,” Carrie murmured as she pulled back, glancing down to her breasts, still carrying a few red welts. </p><p>Remains of Ida’s earlier burst of courage. </p><p>“Too bad you won’t have another chance,” I said mockingly. </p><p>“Right,” Carrie chuckled back at my reminder that there would be many other opportunities to actually push forward and to the more and more fun stuff. </p><p>I tightened my grip around Ida’s waist, invading her core. “This is … not fair,” Ida murmured, the extent of her complaints. </p><p>“Oh, really? Maybe we should stop. I wouldn’t want to put you in a situation you don’t want,” I asked with a beautiful chuckle, giving her a chance to reject the invasion of pleasure without actually creating a comprehensive structure.  </p><p>“No!” she gasped in shock, her voice loud for the first time since I had taken her camera away. </p><p>“Really? Maybe —“ I started, only to be interrupted again. </p><p>“No!” she gasped again, showing how desperate she was not to stop without finding her release. I looked into Carrie’s eyes, and met with a mixture of mirth and amusement. </p><p>“Well, if you feel so strongly,” I whispered even as I picked up speed.  Her legs wrapped around my waist despite the difficult angle, doing her best to assist my assault. </p><p>I impaled her again and again, her moans getting louder with each repeat, soon forcing Carrie to kiss her just to suppress her sound. Though, the speed she leaned suggested that it wasn’t exactly a great difficulty. </p><p>With her arms still tightly around Carrie’s neck, one of my hands was free to explore her body recklessly, without stopping even for a second. “Such a beautiful friendship,” I said with a mocking tone even as I grabbed Ida’s breasts, which might be smaller than Carrie’s, but still amazingly beautiful. </p><p>Ida tightened around my length, the special kind that showed she finally hit her limit. The length she was able to resist had been surprising, but I was willing to guess that it was more about the extended cosplay adventure we shared with Irene. </p><p>I said nothing, just pausing for a moment to feel her tightening, though I had to grab her waist to prevent her from collapsing;  unlike her arms, the grip of her arms had been weakening significantly. </p><p>Accompanied by a delirious, exhausted moan to follow her explosive cries… </p><p>“It seems that our great photographer is finally exhausted,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Yes,” I said as I looked at Carrie, doing nothing to hide my arousal. “It seems that way…” </p>
