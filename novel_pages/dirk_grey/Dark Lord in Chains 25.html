        <p>The awkward silence in the room was rather thick, broken only by the exhausted gasping of Aria.</p><p>I didn’t know who was more shocked. Aria, who had once again caught in the middle of a steamy embrace, but this time even more compromising than the half-naked blowjob she had been doing as a cover for our other activities. Or Emma, who just caught the only princess of the Empire being mounted like a two-copper whore, moaning in endless pleasure as she climaxed freely. It was a tough competition in between.</p><p>While the girls were frozen, watching each other, I pulled out of Aria, my shaft doing its best to return back to life, but struggling to do so after the spectacular explosion I had just experienced. “So,” I said even as I stepped between them and stood in front of Emma, which meant she was looking at my naked body. I wasn’t exactly getting a bad view of her as well, because she managed to surprise me with her choice of dress. Instead of a formal and conservative one she could wear as she walked around the palace, she chose to wear a tighter black dress, with a rather deep cleavage that displayed her breasts perfectly. More impressively, underneath her dress, there was no corset to hide her breasts. It was more fit to a concubine waiting for the visit of his lord. It seemed that she was embracing the sexual aspect of our deal quicker than I expected. </p><p>“Since you’re here, should I assume that you have checked and validated the identity of the double agent?” </p><p>“Y-yeah,” Emma stuttered absentmindedly as her gaze dipped down, catching the sight of my growing shaft, which was glistening with Aria’s juices, like we needed another evidence of our rather spectacular lovemaking while Aria was still behind me, hiding using my figure, in her birthday suit. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said with a smirk, amused by her stutter. For a woman that could erase a small town with just a couple of spells, she was ridiculously shy —though clearly, not as shy as Aria. From what I remembered from our last time, where I had requested a delicious strip show in exchange for information —and payment for putting poor Aria in such a compromising position— she was rather quick to calm herself, but what she had seen was shocking enough to keep her distracted for a moment. </p><p>Which was the best time to push her limits. </p><p>“Tell me, what do you want next?” I asked even as I felt Aria’s naked body pressing against mine from my back, which made me smirk. The fact that Aria was using me as a cover seemed unimportant, but actually, it was extremely critical. It meant that she started to trust me immensely, so much that she was willing to rely on me to protect herself, rather than putting her dress back on. </p><p>“D-do I need to have a request to visit?” Emma stammered. It was a clear attempt of distraction, a common tool from the negotiation toolbox. My words were signaling that she was the one that wanted something, which would give me the leverage. Her words were a basic attempt to push back to it, attacking the central premise of my assumption, trying to make herself some room. She was clearly studying the art of politics. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, like many novices, she completely misapplied the shiny new tool she had acquired, hoping that it would solve a completely different problem. Just by visiting the next day, she had signaled the weakness of her hand —which was probably a result of Isolde’s important crusade, a rather sizable benefit for my situation. I wondered just how panicked Emma would be when Isolde returned with a great success…</p><p>And how much she would be willing to pay to equalize the situation. </p><p>The silence stretched for a long while, extremely uncomfortable for the two-thirds of the occupants of the room, while I enjoyed the sensation of Aria’s voluptuous tits on my back, creating a spectacularly comfortable sensation. Emma said nothing, Aria couldn’t say anything, and I was more than happy to let the silence stretch, the suspense getting thicker as the time progressed. </p><p>Ultimately, it was Emma that surrendered. “Yes, I need something,” she admitted, her usual demeanor trying to flicker back to the surface. I let my silence stretch further, letting her speak. Sometimes, the silence was the strongest negotiation tool when applied by the side with the initiative. This time, it barely took half a minute for her to continue. “I need to find more double agents,” she added. </p><p>“So, the arrest and interrogation have been successful,” I said, curious about the speed Emma had achieved the success. I had strong suspicions that she once again relied on mind magic, as she was still unaware of its danger. And since it was strong enough to work on the Dark Lord —or at least, that was what she had thought— why shouldn’t she use it on others. </p><p>Of course, that was not completely unpredictable, which was the reason for providing her one of the lower-level agents. From the way she subtly nodded to my statement when I mentioned the arrest, I could see that she had actually arrested the double agent, which was clearly a mistake. Not because it was undeserved, but because arresting a spy was always the most amateurish way to go, which meant anyone in the same cell would receive a warning and disappear, limiting the reach significantly. Following them for a couple of weeks to map their connections —and the connections of those connections as well— before busting all of them at the same time was the much better option. </p><p>Not that I wanted to explain that to her, not when I feed the spies and their safe houses one by one, slowly disarming the spies of the other Dark Factions in the capital while earning many benefits for me. </p><p>Best of all, the one that would realize my ploy immediately, the Queen, was distracted by the fear of losing her own secret. </p><p>“Good,” I said after another lengthy silence, which was quite enjoyable, as by hovering above her, I was getting a spectacular view of her cleavage. “But before we move onto that, you need to be punished.” </p><p>“For what?” Emma answered immediately as she looked up, her expression flickering between anger and rebellion. </p><p>“For entering to my room without knocking, of course,” I commented lazily. “It’s my place, after all, and I would like to think my station and achievements in life deserve at least that much respect, doesn’t it?” I said, not bothering to hide the mocking edge in my tone. </p><p>“It’s not your room, it’s your cell,” Emma lashed out quickly before she realized what she was saying, enraged by my shamelessness. I just let my smirk widen while her face reddened, realizing her mistake. “Sorry,” she immediately followed it up, but her expression told me that she was aware that it was already too late. </p><p>“Thanks for apologizing, but your rudeness is becoming a habit. It seems that we’re going to need another punishment just to push that.” </p><p>“But-” Emma tried to cut in, only to stop when I raised my hand in warning. </p><p>“No, it’s not just you have disrespected me, but you also scared poor shy Aria,” I added even as I hooked my arm around her waist, easily pulling her next to me, displaying her naked body to Emma. Lulled into a false sense of security during the standoff, Aria failed to react until she found her body in full display. A cute cry escaped her lips as she tried to use her arms to cover her body, which, considering her amazing curves, was rather unsuccessful. </p><p>“She shouldn’t have too much of a problem after being a whore,” Emma countered immediately, the sight of Aria’s naked body giving her a shot of courage. I wasn’t surprised by the sudden flip in her attitude. Sense of victory always bred overconfidence —a flaw that I wasn’t entirely free considering I had been captured and imprisoned— which led to her careless words. </p><p>“Such a rude girl,” I said, shaking my head in disapproval. Then, I turned to Aria. “Isn’t she?” </p><p>“S-she is,” Aria stammered, immediately answering despite her distracting efforts to cover herself with her arms. </p><p>“What should we do, then?” I asked her, ignoring the anger Emma was starting to develop at being ignored. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Aria murmured, blushing. </p><p>“What did we do the last time?” I asked immediately, before Emma could interject. </p><p>This time, Aria stalled for a moment. “P-punishment,” she finally uttered. </p><p>“Look here-” Emma started, jumping up to her feet when she realized the direction of our discussion, only to be cut short by me. </p><p>“Silence!” I ordered sharply. I didn’t shout, but rather I used the same tone I preferred whenever I ordered my soldiers in a battle. It was a tone that dismissed any possibility of denial. Emma shut up, stumbling back to her chair. I turned to Aria, smiling gently. “Go and stand behind Emma,” I said. </p><p>Aria did so, and for a moment, I enjoyed the sight while both girls stood frozen. Emma, sitting on a chair, wearing a black dress that barely covered her knees, and with an impressive cleavage. Aria, standing behind her, completely naked, her skin still reddened by the rush of being revealed. Interestingly, I could see Emma’s nipples hardening in anticipation, pushing against the thin fabric of her black dress domineeringly. </p><p>“Now, Aria, slip your hands into her cleavage, and grab her nipples,” I ordered. As much as making Aria spank Emma had been surprisingly erotic, it couldn’t rival the beauty of actual sexual touch. She hesitated until I throw her a stiff glare. </p><p>Then, I watched as Aria’s hands slowly pushed into Emma’s cleavage, making her shiver with the touch. She found my eyes, with a hint of rebellion dancing in them, no doubt considering the merits of stopping it, but ultimately, she stayed silent. Maybe it was the importance of the information she was seeking, or maybe, it was the fact that Aria was the one touching her like that, somehow making it less threatening. </p><p>Unfortunately for Emma, while Aria was the one touching, I was the one in command. “Now, twist them,” I ordered, and Aria once again followed my command. </p><p>Emma gasped. “Hey-” she started, making Aria flinch, but once again, I cut her off. </p><p>“Silence,” I ordered, before looking to Aria once more. “Now, squeeze them as hard as you can,” I added, and Emma’s pained grunts increased. Though, it was still on the level of discomfort rather than actual pain, as even with my orders, Aria lacked the determination to push until it stopped being erotic and started being just painful —exactly the reason I felt confident in giving her those orders. “Pull down the dress,” I told her a moment later, and one of Aria’s hands sneaked backward while Emma leaned forward, allowing Aria to access the zipper easily. Their implicit coordination made me glad, showing that they were adapting to their new roles perfectly. </p><p>My shaft was already in full mast, but seeing Emma’s naked tits together with Aria’s even more spectacular ones, it started throbbing painfully. I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for the earlier session with Aria, I would have abandoned the punishment scheme for something more immediately gratifying. Instead, I watched as Aria slowly mauled Emma’s tits, leaving little pink marks behind. </p><p>Slowly, Emma’s expression of indignation melted, leaving its place to a sense of arousal. It wasn’t as apparent as the one on Aria’s face —who had been biting her lips in arousal for the last minute as she squeezed Emma’s tits, showing that despite all her submissive attitude, she enjoyed the opportunity to lash out, just like the previous time— but still, it was an interesting development. </p><p>And, I wanted to push the possibility to the limits. </p><p>“You’re not squeezing hard enough,” I said to Aria suddenly, making her freeze, her expression turning into abject panic, showing the fragility of her self-confidence once again. “You better start biting instead,” I said to her. </p><p>“B-biting,” Aria stammered, and while Emma said nothing, her shock was no less than Aria. “But-” she tried to continue. </p><p>“Yes, biting,” I cut her off, however, I didn’t use the same domineering tone I used against Emma, which would have broken her easily. </p><p>“Hey, that’s too much,” Emma commented while Aria walked in front of her, replacing my view with her shapely ass instead. </p><p>“Why?” I asked Emma while Aria leaned forward, putting her puffy nether lips to a great display as she bent down. “It’s just pain as a part of the punishment. It shouldn’t be any different than her fingers. Or, is there another reason you’re feeling self-conscious?” I questioned. </p><p>“Of course not!” Emma answered immediately, reacting just like I hoped. Her abrasive personality, which had been suppressed since she stepped into the room, finally had a chance to appear. And, true to her character, it exploded in the exactly worst situation, robbing her of her best argument to keep her punishment from straying into very dangerous territory. </p><p>“Then, what’s the problem,” I said, even as I patted Aria’s plump ass in lieu of ordering her to go forward, and her lips finally clasped around Emma’s nipples. Emma gasped in shock, realizing that her nipples were extra-sensitive after the punishing massage she just received. Then, using Emma’s distraction as an opportunity, I whispered to Aria while using a spell to prevent Emma from hearing it. “Use your lips and tongue more. I want to see that my teachings weren’t a waste,” I whispered to her, which made her stiffen for a moment. Meanwhile, I let my fingers trail down to her nether lips, caressing them gently to encourage her further. </p><p>From Emma’s shocked moans, it seemed that Aria was following my orders perfectly… </p><p>I just stood there, enjoying the show as I considered what to do next…</p>
