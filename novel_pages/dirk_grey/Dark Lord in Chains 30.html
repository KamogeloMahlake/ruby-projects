        <p>As I looked at Sapphire, enjoying the great cleavage created by her modified maid costume, but even with that as a distraction, it was impossible for her to hide her growing frustration. She clearly hated her position, worthy of a servant, even if that was only until she could bewitch me and turn me into her slave. It wasn’t hard to guess all the revenge scenarios that were filling her mind. </p><p>It was that frustration, more than anything, changed my mind about the sequence of events. Rather than starting things with the physical aspect and then moving to politics, I decided to start with the reverse —with a decent amount of teasing sprinkled in, of course. The tantric spells she was trying to use on me were already enhancing her arousal. I would be an idiot not to enhance those effects. </p><p>“So, my Queen,” I started, not even bothering to add a mocking tone as I pronounced her rank. Considering the situation, it wasn’t entirely necessary. “Tell me, how can I be of service for our glorious Empire?” </p><p>“We have checked the location you have provided,” she answered, trying to keep her voice steady, even mostly succeeding in her attempt. Too bad her success didn’t translate to her nipples, which were getting harder with each passing second as the backlash of her spell started to hit her. </p><p>“Good for you,” I said after I realized she had no intention of continuing, this time adding a mocking edge as I looked down at her, then let her continue. She was trying to apply one of the most basic conversational tricks, making a statement, hoping that I would continue to fill the silence. Such tricks were often used in negotiations, trying to trick one side to define an opening stance, which was almost inevitably weaker. </p><p> If she was thinking she could get the upper hand with that kind of trick, forcing me to reveal what I wanted, she was mistaken. With Isolde and Lancelot away —and Emma and Aria conquered— she was the only one I needed to hide my recent state of captivity, meaning I could spend as much as time she was willing to spend in this room. The fact that it was much more comfortable than my cell was a big bonus. </p><p>“I’m interested in purchasing the location of the Eternal Core,” she continued. “State your price.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Don’t be too hasty, my little Queen,” I said even as I caressed her cheek, enjoying the hateful look she threw back, the blue of her eyes reminding me of a stormy ocean at its strongest. “There’s no need to make the biggest trade immediately, is it?” I added. “After all, we’re not in a hurry. Maybe I can interest you with the location of another cache of items? This time, containing some rare magical books, one I had helped my previous client to procure from the ruins of Atrema.” </p><p>I didn’t miss —nor I was surprised by— the sudden flicker of interest, disappearing as soon as it appeared. After all, Atrema was an ancient kingdom with little renown, but a serious historian would know that tantric magic was one of their expertise areas. One of, but definitely not the most, which was important because I didn’t want her to know about her usage of tantric magic as much as possible. Atrema was the perfect candidate, as they had several more important magical areas, including how to manage raw magic energy, a branch closely linked to use the Eternal core. </p><p>I had no doubt that the Queen had better sources about that, and that made it an even better bargaining tool to make her think she managed to trick me.</p><p>“Not the most valuable item to trade,” she said, keeping her tone calm, using it as a bargaining tool on the surface, but also probing me about the potential information about her specialty. </p><p>“Well, I think that some extra sources about phase magic would come in handy when you start working with the Eternal Core, but if you don’t want it, we don’t need to trade for it,” I said. “After all, I’m sure I can find something else that would get your interest.” </p><p>Of course, just because I was handling a complicated negotiation didn’t mean that I would refrain from teasing her physically. I could have let my hands drop down and squeeze her spectacular tits, or pull my cock out for another spectacular blowjob session. But both of those options were too aggressive, lacking the impact I was going for. </p><p>In the end, I decided to remove my shoe and sock rapidly, only to push my naked foot between her legs, under her ass, essentially making her ride my foot. Demeaning, dismissive, yet overbearingly sexy at the same time, especially when the target was concerned. </p><p>To her credit, she didn’t react to it other than another momentary flash of anger, no doubt imagining the orders my torturer would receive once she was finished with me. Though, considering what I had seen on that aspect, I wasn’t exactly scared. “What else you have in mind,” she said immediately, seemingly willing to pass the opportunity to get the books of Atrema kingdom. </p><p>“Well, I have a few more interesting prospects, but they are rather more expensive in terms of the political concessions I require. I don’t think we’re that level of trust yet,” I backtracked, giving her the impression that I wasn’t valuing that particular item of exchange very much. Even as I said that, however, I moved my foot, pushing her arousal even higher. </p><p>“And what it would cost me?” she asked. </p><p>“I do have a couple of clients interested in some of the artifacts busy gathering dust in a trophy room somewhere,” I murmured. “Maybe you would be interested in exchanging it with the famed Scythe of Destruction,” I offered, well aware that it would get rejected. </p><p>“Impossible,” she immediately replied, though I was happy to note that her voice was getting a little strained as I continued to caress her slit with my foot steadily, her wetness covering my skin. </p><p>“Hmm, how about one of the daggers of darkness, one that you extracted from digging the ancient ruins. After not discovering its usage for more than a year, it shouldn’t be too big of a loss,” I said, my smile quirking as her eyes widened at the casual display of one of the more important secrets, one I had learned from Valkyrie during our regular information exchange. </p><p>It paid dividends to have an enemies-with-benefit relationship with one of the most important knights of the Empire. </p><p>“I’m afraid that it’s equally impossible,” she answered, her voice stiff. </p><p>“Really,” I said lazily, internally happy with her rejection. I didn’t want to take an untested weapon as payment. I just used that to spook her further while flexing my mysterious power, making her even more hesitant to take action. “Another rejection,” I said even as I let my hand trail her jawline before landing on her lips, caressing tenderly. “Should I assume that you’re actually interested in making the payment physically, and you’re just playing hard to get?” </p><p>“No,” she said stiffly, but no motion to actually push my hand away, once again showing her excellent positional awareness, though I was willing to believe that her physical arousal played an important role as well. Tantric spells were an insidious tool to take down their target, but they were equally dangerous for their caster, as displayed by her. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, letting my hand trail down until it slipped into her costume, her nipples hard enough to push against my palm. “Your body seems to disagree with you,” I added, squeezing her nipple until an erotic gasp escaped her mouth, then pulled back, not only my hand, but also my foot. “But it must be true if you say so. You’re the Queen, after all. It’s not like you’re going to lie, right?” </p><p>The resulting anger and frustration were simply spectacular, the sight enough was enough to almost make me cream in my pants. There was something special in watching her getting more and more aroused, the effect enhanced by her own magic, but helpless to resolve it. </p><p>“So, why don’t you give me a couple of ideas about what you can spare from your arsenal?” I asked. “Maybe I can pick something from your selection.” </p><p>That started a lengthy yet intense bargaining section, where she had offered several obscure items —some of them quite valuable, some even unknown to me— while I tried to push her toward a certain direction without being too obvious about my needs, not wanting to reveal that I was looking for an item useful for my current purposes, trying to sell the idea that I was trying to resell whatever I would get. </p><p>No need to alarm her. </p><p>Of course, my hands were not exactly idle during the bargain. I poked and caressed her body quite often, occasionally helped by my foot, pushing her deeper and deeper into arousal, making her suffer the torturous effects of staying on the edge constantly. She wasn’t as inexperienced as Emma, making her struggle visibly harder, but luckily, her persistence in negotiation gave me the chance I was looking for. Of course, she had her own reasons to extend the session. </p><p>Pity that I had long countered those reasons… </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured. “Since you’re going to be stingy about the special items, I guess I have to accept the payment as you offer, but only because I’m very happy with the ancillary service you provide,” I said mockingly, accepting her latest offer of gold and some rare magical items that would be extremely useful in adding some new wards to the secret tunnels, maybe even adding some modifications to her room. </p><p>Just to underline my point, I spanked her tit loudly, enjoying the sensation it left in my palm and her outraged expression equally, especially since she had no choice but to swallow the insult if she didn’t want to waste everything she had worked for. </p><p>Then, surprisingly, she failed to swallow that particular insult. “You’re pushing your luck,” she said, raising her hand, her fingers glowing with a glimmering spell. </p><p>“Oh, really? Am I pushing my luck?” I said even as I grabbed her wrist, easily dispelling the spell by distracting her. However, I hadn’t used the trick I had used against Emma that would leave her helpless, not wanting to scare her, just distracting her enough to break the spell. </p><p>She wasn’t competent in warfare, and it showed. </p><p>I pulled her on my lap before she could react, but not to make her sit. Instead, her stomach was pressing against my thighs, and her ass pointing upward, like she was a mischievous student about to be punished by her teacher. “Am I pushing my luck?” I asked as I spanked her ass, hard enough to make her cry. </p><p>I could feel her body tensing, but much to my surprise, it wasn’t because she was trying to attack me. No, it was because she was already suffering on the edge for the last half an hour, and that spank finally pushed her over the edge. </p><p>Her magically-enhanced climax was simply spectacular. She continued to moan helplessly, her skin twitching and tingling, while she gushed like a fountain. “It can’t be,” she murmured again and again, genuinely shocked by her own reaction while her body trembled with pleasure. </p><p>“Really?” I said mockingly even as I grabbed her hair and forced her to look at the mirror, allowing her to full spectacle of her extraordinary orgasm. Her beautiful blue eyes widened in shock as she absorbed the obscenity of her own expression as her ability to control it slipped completely… “Do you think the mirror is lying to you? Or maybe, it’s showing you a different blonde slut that’s currently climaxing like a first-time virgin enjoying the attention of her husband,” I said, enjoying her anger more than I should. “Or maybe you would prefer if I call you a maid enjoying the treatment of her master…” </p><p>I enjoyed the results of her spectacular orgasm, intensifying further as I forced her to face her own expression, all the while trying to decide what to do next. Should I continue playing with her, forcing her to another climax, or should I let her recover a degree of control before pushing for the next step… </p>
