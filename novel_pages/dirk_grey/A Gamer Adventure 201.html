        <p>Luckily, while I needed to understand better how Companion Node worked, it was not one of the boring, joyless magical research projects. No, it was much more fun. </p><p>I continued to slide inside Marianne, enjoying the amazing way her warmth wrapped around my shaft, I split my attention toward the way the Companion Node was getting stronger, enhancing the connection between us. </p><p>Naturally, it wasn’t the first time I was paying attention to this process, but my growing experience with Divine Spark helped me to notice a lot of details I had missed earlier. </p><p>In particular, a particular similarity between the Companion Node and the Divine Spark in its raw form — or what I deemed as the raw form after it had lost its elemental nature with the assistance of Tantric. </p><p>I had no idea whether that was actually the case, but I still received a reward in the process. </p><p>[+2 Tantric]</p><p>Focusing on the way the Companion Process was developing gave me a significant boost on Tantric, more than I had been expecting, especially with its already high attainment as my first Grandmaster skill. </p><p>It was supposed to develop slower, which only went further to confirm the link between Tantric and the Companion Process. Although, I couldn’t help but wonder about the underlying implications. </p><p>Especially since I had learned that I couldn’t block the connection between me and the Tantric, implying wasn’t coming from the System. </p><p>And, if that wasn’t coming from the system, maybe it was the case for the Companion Node as well. So, even as my hips rocked hard, alternating between two girls that presented themselves in front of me, each moment enhanced the subtle core of power that was hidden in their soul spaces. </p><p>With my current Tantric sensitivity, I could see that, even without the notifications, the Node was getting stronger. Only slightly, but still getting stronger. </p><p>Then, I started noticing other important details. There was a flow between the Companion Node and the system, subtle yet unmistakable in its unique nature. </p><p>Divine Spark, in its purified form, reinforcing the girls after coming from the System. </p><p>If it wasn’t for Grandmaster level Tantric, supported by my phenomenal perception, that might have been the only thing I noticed. But, paying careful attention, I could see that a similar flow of Divine Spark subtly flowed out of my body and mixed with theirs, before coalescing into their Companion Nodes. </p><p>It was harder to notice than the interaction between the Node and the System, because the interaction of the system came from a single, linear source, like a drip of water, while from my body, the same amount radiated from a wider area, with the soft consistency of a vapor. </p><p>Making it much harder to notice. </p><p>The amount was really subtle, not enough to have a noticeable effect on the amount of Divine Spark I had absorbed in my body. </p><p>Even then, I frowned at the realization, because I had been hoping that absorbing Divine Spark to enhance my body was permanent. </p><p>That would not do, I decided as I tried to exert some control on that flow. </p><p>Surprisingly, I had received instant success. Stopping my own Divine Spark flow had been rather simple, much easier than intervening with the System, still, Divine Spark was a more reliable source of power. </p><p>And, since I was able to slow down the process, I could use the same trick to quicken it as well. I closed my eyes for a moment and let the Divine Spark evaporate off my body faster, and channeled it to their Companion Nodes. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 86%]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 85%]</p><p>[+2 Tantric]</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>And received great success. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured as I quickened the assault of my hips, and instead focused only on Marianne, sending another wave of power, this time in the form of Mana, giving her more experience. </p><p>[-2910 Mana]</p><p>Even as I did so, I stopped to think for a moment, trying to decide the relative merits of quickening the Companion Process and wasting some Divine Spark — which was, ultimately, only a fraction of my current capabilities — versus letting the System handle it, saving some in exchange of time it would require to complete the last step. </p><p>In the end, I decided on the former. Not because spending several uninterrupted hours with two beautiful women who were willing to do everything to make that period pleasurable was a great chore. </p><p>But the unexpected interruptions to my plans were becoming a norm, and it was for the better not to push my luck to see whether I could do it. Spending my own Divine Spark was not the greatest thing, but it was not a good habit to be miserly. </p><p>And, the fun part had no problem as well. After all, there was nothing preventing me from extending the fun after the Companion Process had been completed. </p><p>So, I decided to change the pace a bit by focusing on Marianne fully. I grabbed her waist, easily lifting her, interrupting their little kiss even as I hooked my arms under her legs while I flared my magic to summon another crystal furniture, this time a chair for myself. </p><p>I sat down, with Marianne on my lap, her back pushing against my chest, her amazing breasts free to jiggle with each push, creating a spectacular view in the process. </p><p> “More,” Marianne moaned breathlessly while Titania looked at the sudden change of pace with a disappointed gaze. </p><p>“As you wish,” I whispered to Marianne’s ear, pulling back only after leaving a soft bite before turning my attention back to Titania, who was watching us with a barely-disguised disappointment in her gaze, not entirely welcoming the sudden change. “Come on, sweetie, what are you waiting for,” I said as I caught her gaze. “Marianne’s breasts certainly need more attention.” Then, I slapped Marianne’s ass. “Don’t they?” </p><p>“Yes, they do!” Marianne moaned beautifully, repeating the invitation, which was enough to break Titania’s momentary hesitance. She shuffled until she was sitting on the same crystal she was lying on a moment ago, close enough to my chair that she could reach Marianne’s tits while sitting on the corner of it. </p><p>I stopped for a moment to enjoy the sight of Titania’s hands disappearing into the great expanse of Marianne’s bosom before turning my attention — most of it — back to the changes going on in her soul space, her companion node getting stronger with each second. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 91%]</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>Even as the companion node continued to grow, I was getting a better sight of the details of the node. Interestingly, the process itself was less complicated than I expected — just not as simple as the headmistress’ direct and violent method, not requiring such a pointless show. </p><p>Though, to be fair, unlike the headmistress, I had full control of the Divine Spark in my possession rather than constantly battling against it in an effort to prevent spontaneous combustion. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 94%]</p><p>I decided to reward Marianne’s help with another burst of experience. </p><p>[-1902 Mana]</p><p>“Yes,” she moaned softly, barely able to gather sufficient breath between her moans. “Another level!” </p><p>“Good performance will not go without a reward,” I whispered, which earned a satisfied moan from Marianne. </p><p>Titania’s expression was markedly more pointed, jealousy coloring her face. Yet, she didn’t explicitly ask for it, showing her shyness was not an issue that could be cured immediately. “Sorry about that, sweetie, but your level is a bit much to boost easily, but don’t worry, I still have a little achievement lined up for you.” </p><p>That didn’t make her give a verbal answer, but I was more than happy to take the way she leaned down to capture Marianne’s nipple between her lips as a win. </p><p>I tightened my grip on Marianne’s hips instead, quickening the assault, catching an interesting detail in the process. The more aroused Marianne was feeling, the more efficient the companion node creation was going excellently. </p><p>Not that it was a shocking revelation at this point, not with the source of my power. </p><p>Instead, I let one of my hands slip forward, teasing her knob to enhance her pleasure even further, seconds turning into minutes. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 100% - Final Stage Completed +20000 Exp]</p><p>[Permanent Perk Established: Mana Regeneration]</p><p>[Permanent Perk Established: Skill Share]</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!” Marianne moaned repeatedly, but as the pleasure hit her, which was not exactly helped by the intensity of the pleasure combined with the rush of leveling. She collapsed, the pleasure and power mixing enough to push her to the edge of a collapse.</p><p>The sensation was amazing, but I still had a frown on my face. </p><p>There was no new perk, which was not exactly a good sign. Especially combined with the recent dearth of Achievements I was suffering. </p><p>I decided to file that to analyze later. It was unfair to focus on that fact while I had two beautiful naked ladies begging for my attention. </p><p>I conjured a bed for Marianne to lie on before I turned my attention back to Titania, who looked fascinated by the explosive intensity of Marianne’s climax. “She lost quickly,” she still managed to stammer. </p><p>“Yes, she did,” I said with a big smirk on my face. “But, if you’re feeling she underperformed, let’s see how long you would be able to handle,” I added as I grabbed her arm and pulled her onto my lap. </p><p>The same space Marianne had just vacated a second ago, my glistening shaft a sign of her presence…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 33 Experience: 556660 / 561000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6732 / 6732 Mana: 5863 / 8250 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [106/110]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>
