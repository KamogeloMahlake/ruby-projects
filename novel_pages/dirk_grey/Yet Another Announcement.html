        <p>Hi Everyone, </p><p>I hope that everyone is having an excellent weekend. I have a change on my update schedule, mostly due to my challenges due to real life. </p><p>From now on, including the next week, I'll take a break from updating whenever the month contains five Sunday. Essentially, it means that there's one week I won't be updating every three months. In a year, you guys will receive 48 updates a year, rather than 52. The next break will be in August, which I believe is sufficiently spaced. </p><p>I know it's a bit abrupt, but I need the occasional break from writing to keep my creativity alive. </p>
