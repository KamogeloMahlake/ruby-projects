        <p>"Shall we,” I said as I gestured for her to walk, enjoying the sudden hesitant expression on her face. Yet, with Charlie and Brenda already in the water, there was nothing that prevented me from putting my hand on her back and leading her down the small stairs that led into one of two rooms in the small boat. </p><p>“Sorry for the limited selection,” I said as I entered the bedroom, which was inevitably small, and opened the wardrobe, which had several small pieces. “But that’s the best we can hope with a rental yacht,” I said. </p><p>“It’s … it’s okay,” Umi murmured as she took a step toward them, and started shuffling, suddenly tense as she realized she was alone with me once more, her fiancee too distracted to interfere. </p><p>I stayed behind her as she shuffled through the swimsuits before she picked one, one that was the largest and the most wholesome among the alternatives. It was still leagues better than her one-piece, of course, but I had no intention of letting her get away with it. </p><p>“That’s good, if you want Charlie to get hypnotized by Brenda,” I whispered, which was enough to make her gasp in anger. Yet, that was the limit of her reaction, and she continued to grab it. “Of course, it’s understandable if you want to admit defeat against Brenda as she seduced Charlie…” I continued, just like a devil that whispered dangerously seductive comments. </p><p>Another gasp left her mouth, one that was softer than the previous one, but I still counted that as a win as she dropped the swimsuit she had picked, and instead, she started searching the small pile once again, her fingers getting faster with each second. </p><p>“You’re right,” she whispered, her voice deceptively bubbly as she kept her gaze down. </p><p>I stayed there only until I watched her pick a white top, one that would rival Brenda’s in sexiness before I turned my back and left. As much as I wanted to stay in and help her pick a top, I knew doing so at this point would push her more than she expected. </p><p>Instead, l slammed the door and left her alone to change and sat on the deck and removed my t-shirt, finally revealing my muscular torso now that Charlie was in the water and wouldn’t get intimidated by the show. </p><p>I grabbed the sunscreen, and, after a gentle spurt, I started working on my legs first. A couple minutes later, just as I finished my torso, hesitant footsteps came into my view, revealing Umi wearing the same white bikini I saw her picking. </p><p>But it fit her even better than I expected. Well, technically, it didn’t fit her properly, it was rather tight for her chest even when she tied it more loosely than it was advised, but that was hardly a problem in terms of coverage. </p><p>“Much better,” I whispered suggestively, enjoying the blush on her face. “But, before going down and giving Brenda a fit of jealousy, why don’t you help me by putting some sunscreen on my back.” </p><p>“I …” she murmured, clearly feeling hesitant in repeating any kind of closeness after the lesson of the night before, but luck was on my side, and Brenda chose that exact moment to let out a beautiful pearl of laughter. “Sure,” Umi said as she pulled the bottle off my hand with surprising aggression, and started rubbing my back. </p><p>Yet, Brenda continued to help me. “Oh, Charlie, you’re so bad,” she followed, her voice beautifully suggestive, doing her task even better than I expected. </p><p>Umi’s fingers stilled, and for a moment, I thought she was feeling embarrassed, but that didn’t last for long. She started caressing me once more, but this time, her fingers were slower, more deliberate as she caressed my back muscles. </p><p>Yet, there was a sharpness in her movements that wasn’t there before. No doubt that being ignored by her fiancee all morning was annoyed her greatly, which had great benefits to my little plan. </p><p>“Thanks,” I said as I turned back and looked at her once she finished. “Now, it’s my turn…” </p><p>“Not necessary,” she started, only for her to come to a sudden stop when I grabbed her waist and pulled her on my lap. “That’s not appropriate,” she whispered. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, it’s nothing we hadn’t already done, what’s the harm,” I whispered. “And, do you think it’s as worse as what is going in the sea.” Just like it was timed, Brenda’s exaggerated laughter exploded again, replacing Umi’s hesitance with anger. </p><p>“Right,” she whispered as I put my hands on her back after a brief pause to get some sunscreen. My caressing was soft, gentle, and definitely unhurried. Something that Umi didn’t like, enough for her to actually show her distaste. “Hurry,” she murmured. </p><p>Admittedly, her impatience could easily be about Brenda’s lush laughter, followed by her words. “Oh, Charlie, you’re amazing, maybe I should keep you for myself.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I whispered into her ear, enjoying the way she trembled. Though, I was even more amused by her submissiveness. Even under the current circumstances, she just accepted my slow and deliberate spreading of sunscreen was not something she could ask me to stop. </p><p>And I was evil enough to abuse that assumption to the limit. </p><p>I handled most of her back rapidly, but my movement slowed down once I reached her neck. The last night’s adventures had revealed she was particularly sensitive on her neck, and I would like to think of myself as a proficient masseuse. </p><p>Not to mention, it was a lesser-known fact, but anger and jealousy could also work as an aphrodisiac as long as it was carefully managed — a process Umi was being subject to since breakfast. </p><p>The combination worked excellently, and a few seconds later, a soft murmur left her mouth despite her best efforts. She closed her eyes and leaned against my chest as I continued massaging her neck. </p><p>In her distraction, it took a while for her to comment when I pulled my hand away from her neck and put it on her stomach, continuing to work on the front of her body. Though, she did notice after a minute. “I … I can handle the front,” she stammered. </p><p>“Maybe, but I’m not in a habit of leaving things halfway,” I answered as my fingers continued massaging her. She stiffened at my words, but that stiffness only lasted for a small while, until my thumb moved the nape of her neck, exerting just enough pressure to make her moan. </p><p>With her complaints gone, I moved my hand down her thighs, first working on the outside of her thighs before moving to the inner part, my thumbs dragging dangerously close to the limited area that was covered by her bikini bottom, enjoying her tenseness whenever I got close. </p><p>As I repeated the move, I could feel the nature of her tenseness changing, the alarm aspect slowly leaving its place to a more amorous kind. Yet, I let my hands climb upward, bypassing the covered area, leaving her without overt contact. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to find a candidate for the next stage of our play. My hands landed on her hips, and soon, I was caressing her shoulders with both hands. Yet, this time, I started dragging them down, and started working on her cleavage. </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit … much,” she whispered. </p><p>“Really?” I whispered as, without a warning, let my hands slip inside her top, earning an alarmed gasp as my fingers grabbed her nipples. “Your body clearly disagrees with that.” </p><p>“But—“ she whispered, but that was all she was able to say as she bit her lips to contain her moan. </p><p>“No buts. Your bikini looks rather unstable, and I need to make sure to cover every part of your body with sunscreen. We can’t afford your breasts getting a sunburn just because your top slipped a bit.” Then, I paused a bit as I pressed my lips against her earlobe. “Your breasts are far too beautiful to suffer such an indignity, as much as your fiancee seemed not to appreciate them.” </p><p>Brenda laughed again, making Umi’s body jerk. “Well, it’s because he didn’t see them yet,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I whispered. </p><p>“We’re saving ourselves for our wedding night,” she whispered. </p><p>“Well, that I know, but I didn’t realize just how far it was going. So, you’re saying that I should feel really lucky for being the first one to rub sunscreen on your beautiful peaks.” </p><p>“R-right,” she managed to answer. She tensed at the reminder that I was taking liberties that her intended didn’t have the opportunity to experience, but that didn’t last long. </p><p>This time, it was the fiancee in question that saved me. “Yes, you’re right,” Charlie attempted to whisper, but it was a whisper in the form of a shout, in a way that only a drunk man could achieve, suggesting that the two cocktails I prepared for him worked even better than I expected. “Your breasts certainly look amazing. But maybe you should remove your bikini so I can get a better view.” </p><p>Charlie’s enthusiastic shouts worked wonders to destroy Umi’s growing reluctance. She even shuffled back, finally capturing my hardness between her hips. </p><p>It was time to move to the next stage. </p>
