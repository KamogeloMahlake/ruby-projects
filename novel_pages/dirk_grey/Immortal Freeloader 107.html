        <p>When I returned to the capital, I stayed outside, observing as Aisnam shuffled the defense. At the same time, I modified the formations I had built, making sure that they would stay hidden from the approaching Foundation Establishment cultivators that were getting closer and closer, as well as the newly embarked Tiger Fist army. </p><p>The flying ship stayed behind, no doubt waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>Curious about exactly how things would unfold, I stayed in place, ready to intervene in case Aisnam needed help. The most recent gift I had received was enough to save Aisnam in case of an emergency. I didn’t know if it was strong enough to hold back the cultivators, but since I could cheat with formations, it didn’t matter. </p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators were the first to arrive. One belonged to Kartpa Valley, and one belonged to Entsa Pavilion. Others, I didn’t recognize. </p><p> But, to my surprise, they didn’t enter the capital. Instead, each picked a nearby hill and activated some formation plates to defend themselves. Curious, I approached them, hidden behind my formations, trying to understand what was going on. </p><p>They were holding recording crystals. </p><p>“Interesting,” I muttered as I realized exactly what they were doing. They were here as observers, to make sure the battle was limited to martial artists like it was supposed to be according to their so-called Covenant, like some kind of United Nations observer watching the battles in Africa. </p><p>I didn’t even need to wonder about the reason. With the fake ruins discovered, the importance of the region suddenly increased significantly, probably enough for cultivators to pull even dirtier tricks. The reason for multiple cultivators observing the battle was likely that each side wanted to prevent foul play. </p><p>I examined them. The unknown cultivators were calm, while, I could see that the disciple of Entsa Valley was the only one that was showing signs of her nerves. Kartpa Valley disciple, on the other hand, looked smug, no doubt thinking that their victory was assured. </p><p>Too bad for him that I had stacked the deck otherwise. </p><p>Aisnam had deployed the royal guards to the outer walls, showing her intent to defend the city. Her secret guard, on the other hand, secretly moved to several warehouses near the walls, ready to be revealed as needed. </p><p>While waiting, I started studying the Furious Palm Nine Tsunami Technique once more. And, to my surprise, I made nice progress. Not a lot, but my previous knowledge, combined with the passive learning effect thanks to Pearyin, allowed me to progress much better, giving me hope that, even without the System tricks, I could learn techniques. </p><p>While I was busy learning, the newly embarked Tiger Fist army arrived. The moment they were seen, the Entsa Pavilion disciple looked shocked, showing that she hadn’t been expecting it. Thanks to my formations, I could watch them from a distance. </p><p>She tried to leave her observation spot, but Kartpa Valley disciple moved to cut her off immediately. “Where are you going, fellow cultivator,” he said smugly. “I thought we had a battle to observe. You can’t be thinking about breaking the neutrality, can you?” </p><p>“Of course not,” the woman answered through squeezed teeth, glancing at the other observers. It looked like the only thing that prevented her was the presence of the others. </p><p>I stayed in place even as the Foundation Establishment cultivators stayed locked in place, while the Tiger Fist army moved closer and closer to the city … and suddenly, stopped. Some of them had been carrying huge bundles, and they started to assemble them rapidly, turning them into catapults. </p><p>I smirked as I realized what they were trying to do. Aisnam had explained before. Even as a cultivator, Aisnam had the right to defend the city, but with the Tiger Fist using siege weapons, she had to leave the city. </p><p>A weird technicality, but it looked like they wanted to use it. </p><p>As they set the siege weapons, the Tiger Fist army started to shout many slogans about freeing the kingdom from oppression and other nonsense. I shrugged, not paying any attention to the details. Ultimately, the Tiger Fist army had many Bone Forging experts and more than a dozen Connate Realm martial artists, their lack of organization showed that they were gathered in a hurry. I guessed that they had been living in the schools that were on the path of the spiritual boat, and they had been gathered together in a hurry. </p><p>I had already provided Aisnam with all she needed to fight against an inferior army like that even without revealing her recovery. </p><p>She didn’t disappoint me. Before the siege weapons could even be set up properly, fifty figures departed the walls, and rushed forward, each dressed in long black outfits that covered them completely. They moved forward with the speed of a Bone Forging realm warrior, but I could see that they were Connate Realm artists. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one that realized it. The two flying cultivators that had been arguing earlier had a change of expression, with Kartpa Valley disciple looking like he had just swallowed a lemon. “What a surprise,” he growled. “It looks like your pavilion has been hiding some secrets, fellow cultivator,” he growled, suddenly finding himself in a reversed situation. </p><p>“We have,” she answered, trying to hide her surprise to act like she was aware of it all along. “It’s not easy to take over Zaim Kingdom. Our pavilion is the greatest sect of the continent.” </p><p>“We will see,” he said as he pulled a talisman and activated it. It was a communication talisman. It was easy for me to tap into the communication while he was in my domain. The combined expertise of formation and talisman made it possible. </p><p>The destination was just as easy to identify. It was where Aisnam’s cousin was waiting. The message itself was simple, calling him to arrive at the capital as soon as possible and deal with his cousin. It made the flying ship to suddenly move toward the capital quickly. </p><p>Just not quickly enough to prevent the massacre of the Tiger Fist army. Fifty Connate Realm fighters, even if they were inexperienced, were too strong to deal unprepared. The mismatch had been enough to devastate the Tiger Fist army easily. </p><p>However, before they could even return, the flying ship had arrived, its presence enough to shatter the morale of the city. </p><p>I looked at the ship again. Now that I had something to compare, I could see that it wasn’t a particularly good one. Its only advantage was its size, while every aspect of its quality was inferior to my flying artifact. Not that it was a surprise considering the nature of my cheat. </p><p>However, the shock started when the cousin in question appeared on the ship, floating down in his own power. </p><p>Foundation Establishment. </p><p>I immediately turned my attention to Aisnam, who was at the walls to watch the battle, her face distorting with fear and surprise. </p><p>“Hello, cousin,” the voice of the Foundation Establishment boomed. “It’s time for you to stop shaming our family and return home. Aisnam’s expression showed that it was hot a good thing. The disciple of Entsa Pavilion disciple looked just as shocked. However, she made no move to cut his path, nor did any other disciple. </p><p>It was clear that his identity as a family member allowed him to bypass the rules about the situation. </p><p>I tensed, even as I used my formation to send her a message. </p><p>‘Make a fist if you can delay any confrontation for more than a day,’ I said to her, already thinking of all the ways to handle the situation without revealing myself. I could still take Aisnam away with my flying boat, but that was the last resort. </p><p>I had some ideas that I could use to solve her situation instead. </p><p>She made a fist, no doubt assuming that the message was from her mysterious allies. </p><p>“What a great surprise, cousin,” Aisnam shouted back, looking like she had been struggling from the exertion, still looking like she was injured. “I wonder what brings you here.” </p><p>“Have you not heard me,” he shouted back, his voice turning into an attack that targeted Aisnam. She was strong enough to resist it, but she deliberately received it, which sent her tumbling down from the walls. Her injury might be fake, but it still annoyed me. </p><p>“I’m sorry, cousin. But I won’t be able to follow your order. I’m in a critical period of my cultivation, and I can’t leave here before the formation is repaired. Unless, of course, you’re willing to take responsibility for all damages,” she responded. As she said so, I triggered the formation, and let out a burst of cursed Qi, enough for the Foundation Establishment cultivators to notice to further her message. </p><p>That brought him short. He looked at the other Kartpa Valley disciple, who activated another talisman, saying not to accept it, and that they would arrange a formation expert to visit the area soon. </p><p>It made me wonder once again just what was behind those doors that just the risk alone slowing down their plans significantly. However, my curiosity wasn’t strong enough to try using the technique that was embedded in my brain. I still had some sense of self-preservation. </p><p>“Very well. I won’t hold you back from such an important mission,” he said, his anger palpable. Clearly, he wanted nothing else than to kill her at this moment, but the complete political situation didn’t allow it.</p><p>“Good,” Aisnam said, then looked at her army. “Defend the walls, no matter what,” she ordered even as she mounted a horse and rode back to Spring Palace. The royal guard looked hesitant, but as another fifty black-dressed guards appeared, it stabilized the situation despite the presence of the cultivators. </p><p>I chuckled even as I moved back, wanting to arrive to Spring Palace before Aisnam. </p><p>I needed to work quick to ensure Aisnam’s safety. </p>
