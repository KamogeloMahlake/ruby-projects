        <p>“Since we agreed about my help, why  don’t we start talking about how you’ll pay for my great assistance?” I offered, enjoying the way she shivered with anticipation. Comfort turned into something else.  </p><p>“Well, it’s not good business practice to pay before goods are delivered.” </p><p>I smirked at her coy attitude. “How about a little advance, then?” I offered. </p><p>“Well, it’s tempting—” she started, but at that moment, her phone pinged. “It’s the HQ,” she whispered, suddenly tense again. “They are asking me for an emergency meeting.” </p><p>“Private, or company-wide?” </p><p>“It’s for the directors of the local plants. It already started,” she said as she stood up and walked to her desk rapidly, though she looked rather stressed. </p><p>She needed some help. </p><p>“Well, that doesn’t mean you can’t pay for your advance at the same time,” I said as I followed her. </p><p>“What do you mean? Are you going to join the meeting?” she asked. </p><p>“I have something different in mind,” I said even as I slid under her desk. Her eyes widened. </p><p>“But —” she started, only to freeze when I made a sharp gesture, signaling her to stop arguing. It was one of the bedroom signals we started to use, but it proved useful here as well. She shut up immediately, her beautiful eyes wide. I snuggled under her desk. She made a move to sit down. </p><p>“Get rid of anything below the waist, except the heels,” I ordered, and she followed that obediently, blushing even as she did so. Then, she called Brenda. “I’m in an important meeting with the HQ. Allow no one in,” she ordered. </p><p>“Yes, boss,” Brenda said, but there was no hiding her amusement. </p><p>“Be careful,” I said with a smirk even as I put my hands on her legs, parting them slightly to reveal her wetness. “Now, your peers want to talk to you.” </p><p>“If you insist,” she whispered as she clicked. </p><p>“You’re late,” an unwelcome voice reached my ear the moment Natalie joined the call. The CEO, who tried to ruin my very excellent acquisition deal. I would have loved to say that it was an annoying, nasal voice, but that would be a lie. It was a  calm, soft voice, almost maternal, like a mother gently admonishing a child. </p><p>The truth couldn’t be further from the truth. Behind her gentle visage lay a monster. She was the business equivalent of Napoleon. Her so-called gentle admonishment was one such trick. With the reorganization going on, she was too smart not to realize Natalie would be panicking already. </p><p>Yet, she deliberately invited her to the meeting at the last minute, and even started by admonishing her. Which informed everyone that </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Natalie said. “I have just —” she started, but I gestured to her again, signaling her not to tell that she had just received an invite. That would be a mistake. The CEO couldn’t say that, not without coming across as pity, but Natalie using that as an excuse would tell everyone that she was on the chopping block. </p><p>A simple yet effective trap. </p><p>“Tell me that your previous client meeting ran longer than expected. Big deal,” I quickly clued Natalie. </p><p>“The meeting with one of our major clients ran longer than expected, so I’m a bit late,” Natalie said, quick to catch on that. “It took a while for me to extract myself from it.” And, luckily, the performance of our IT services was on her side. It didn’t have the smoothest flow, so a momentary break while speaking was nothing out of the ordinary. </p><p>“I see,” the CEO said, her tone normal on the surface, like it wasn’t a problem for her subtle execution notice to be ignored. I smirked even as I tightened my grip. “It’s good that you’re working hard to bring your department to our targets. Should I assume that we will  have no problems hitting them if you’re meeting with the new targets?” </p><p>I kissed her inner thigh, and when she looked down, I nodded again. The new targets were nearly impossible to hit … honestly. But, a little creative accounting, and a few fake deals that allowed the clients to cancel at the last minute with limited penalties should be enough to give us a few months, which would me a chance to work on Dorothy. </p><p>… Or, if that failed, giving Natalie the time she would need to find a new job, making her departure look like poaching from a rival company rather than an ungraceful firing by recognizing some of the revenue early.</p><p>It would ruin whoever was promoted to director, but that would hardly be our problem.  </p><p>“Certainly. We’re on track to hit our new targets,” she said. The CEO followed up with details, but this time, Natalie didn’t need any suggestion from me to continue weaving a web of believable nonsense. </p><p>Which was good, as it allowed me to focus on what was really important. I started going forward, leaving a trail of kisses along her naked thigh, approaching her wetness while she spoke. I avoided the final destination. Teasing her more was tempting, but not when she was the main focus of the meeting.  </p><p>Even with the choppy video, it wasn’t the best idea.  </p><p>Natalie continued to speak steadily as I kissed and caressed her thighs, which lasted for five minutes. “We will see if you can fulfill that ambitious plan, Natalie,” the CEO said. Even without seeing her, I could feel that she was smirking. “Now, since Natalie promises me that those targets are achievable, does anyone have any complaints about them?” she followed, immediately turning Natalie’s assurances into an attack on the others.  </p><p>A dangerous woman indeed. </p><p>I could see Natalie’s smug smile, which meant, she wasn’t entirely aware of how many enemies she had made in the process. She still needed to learn more about higher-ranking policies, but educating her about those would require a long time. </p><p>Meanwhile, I caressed her core for a fleeting moment, alerting her of what was about to follow. Her eyes widened, suggesting that she wasn’t ready for it. She even looked down with a begging gaze. </p><p>I just chuckled softly before I leaned forward and pressed my lips against her core. </p><p>She shivered. </p><p>The meeting continued while I gave her a  little fun service, and her breathing started to quicken. Ordinarily, it wouldn’t have been a huge problem in a large remote meeting, but Natalie had managed to turn herself into a target. Any director that wanted to argue against the target attacked her first. </p><p>Luckily, without receiving a detailed report beforehand, their attacks were pretty much baseless posturing, meaning, I didn’t have to suppress my enjoyment just to allow Natalie to answer. She was easily able to deflect those problems. </p><p>She struggled to keep her tone even, ending in a chippy tone while my tongue danced against her wetness. Ironically, it helped her case, as made her sound dismissive and uncaring … which was a horrible attitude for a meeting under different circumstances. </p><p>But, now, under baseless attacks from several other directors, it was far better than looking angry or stressed. It made her look more confident. </p><p>While she took her breath to answer another question, I let my tongue dance in her core, making her shiver helplessly. She managed out suppress a gasp, but it was a close call. </p><p>I smirked as I continued to lick her core, making her shiver subtly while I enjoyed her taste, each second driving the pleasure further. There were many questions about the schedule of the deals, possible delivery dates, and other details. </p><p>As my tongue pushed deep, her explanation suddenly stopped, and a desperate mouse click arrived before she exploded with a moan. “Stop it,” she whispered, which I ignored. Another mouse click. “Sorry about it, I accidentally muted myself,” she said, and continued with the explanation.  </p><p>I caressed her legs, while my tongue continued to dance against her wetness, occasionally adding one or two soft bite marks to her inner thighs to keep her alert. </p><p>A long, languid torture that lasted for twenty minutes before it got too much. She reached for a glass and acted like she took a sip before she started coughing. </p><p>It was a good excuse to mute herself once more while she shivered desperately as the orgasm hit. A beautiful dance, and an even more beautiful surrender. “Please,” she whispered as she shuddered. </p><p>If it was in the past, her sexy plea would have only made me tease her more, but this time, I decided to be more merciful. I crawled under her desk without being caught by the camera. “You’re lucky it’s just advance payment,” I said with a chuckle and walked away while she continued to fake a cough. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” she said to the team before she continued to meet, still half naked. I left the office and saw Brenda. </p><p>“Interesting meeting?” she asked with a seductive smile. </p><p>“Too bad we had to cut short,” I responded with a matching smirk. I was tempted to bring her away to continue, but considering the state I left Natalie, I decided against it. “Don’t go anywhere,” I warned. “She’s not in a state to greet any visitor.” </p><p>Brenda smiled, and I walked away. </p><p>Luckily, I had my own secretary to ask for help. </p>
