        <p>Mia was lost in a daze until her newest employee deigned to speak. “Are you ready for the real thing, boss,” he said, his voice making her body tingle, but he spoke again before she could say anything. “Sorry, my dear fiancee?” </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” Mia found herself growling. </p><p>“And, I’m about to push into you,” he declared crassly, though  Mia shouldn’t be surprised considering he was first hired as a janitor. “Assuming you can handle it, of course.” </p><p>Mia was many things, but a coward, she was not. “I can handle anything you can do, little man…” she declared, even though the way his muscles pressed against her worked wonders to remind her just how absurd the statement was. </p><p>He chuckled, and she assumed he was thinking the same. Then, he got rid of his pants, and his shaft … his huge, monstrous shaft landed on her ass, and she realized the true joke. </p><p>His pants were keeping it small, and now freed, the possibility of taking it filled it with fear … or at least, that was what she tried to convince herself that tremble was truly about… </p><p>“One last chance to retreat, my dear fiancee,” he offered, but even as he offered, he was already pulling her panties down. She knew that she should take that offer, but somehow, she did not. </p><p>Even if she was about to be bent over her own desk like she was damned secretary rather than the owner of the business, the one that built an empire from nothing. It was wrong …</p><p>Yet it was right. </p><p>She said nothing as he grabbed her, his hips pushing forward to invade her core slowly, straining her capacity in a way even her toys hadn’t done before … yet, somehow, it was smoother than she expected, showing just how wet she was. </p><p> Despite her feelings of defeat, her body was betraying her. Her nipples were so hard she felt they were going to cut through his skin as he grabbed them, squeezing them like a barbarian. She opened her mouth to warn him, afraid of bruises …</p><p>But only a moan escaped her mouth as he started moving … and drilled inside her. She didn’t want to use that word, but there was no other way to describe the way he fucked her fast … far faster than any of her boyfriends in college, and after, she never had the time to date. </p><p>“You’re handling the foreplay better than I expected,” he whispered, and her eyes widened. </p><p>“What do you mean, foreplay —“ she started to ask, shocked by the way she described the situation. The way he was buried inside her didn’t feel like foreplay. </p><p>Then, he used his strength to raise her, and she understood what he meant when she found herself hanging in the air, with no hope of retaliating as he started to pick up speed, each push touching places that she had never even thought to be possible. </p><p> Floating in the air, she lacked the ability to change the pace as he started to move around her desk. And, expecting that to continue, she found herself stumbling when her leg pressed to the ground. “Something wrong?” she asked, panicked. </p><p>“Nothing wrong, my dear boss, I just thought you would appreciate a better angle,” he chuckled. “It’ll be more fun if you can catch the gaze of any employee that decides to walk in, don’t you think so?” </p><p>“You’re a bastard,” she growled, but that was all she was able to say as she trembled under his assault, her naked body a toy for his touch. Well, not entirely naked, she thought. She was still wearing some outfits that cost more than thousands of dollars … but considering that exorbitant bill was concentrated on beautiful branded shoes she was wearing and nothing else, it was hardly a benefit. </p><p>Mia had always claimed that a pair of beautiful and expensive shoes was all a woman needed to feel strong. </p><p>It didn’t work as well when she had a monster buried in her core, rearranging her insides. </p><p>“I … I need a minute,” she gasped, not expecting him to follow, which was why she was surprised when she found herself leaning against her desk, her body suddenly free of his invasion. She breathed hard, but didn’t try to stand up, aware that, with the way her legs trembling, it would have been a hopeless affair. </p><p>“A minute is too long,” he said, his tone smug. “You have fifteen seconds before I taste your wet pussy again,” he whispered. </p><p>She froze at his commanding tone, but she wasn’t too far gone into the pleasure to miss the irony. Here she was, behind her desk, the symbol of her power, and she was following his orders like a secretary… That was wrong. </p><p>“You think?” he said, and suddenly, she realized she had made the mistake of speaking those words out loud… It was a huge mistake. She froze, afraid of what he would do. Continue to  fuck her … or worse, stop ….</p><p>She didn’t expect him to actually agree. “You’re right,” he said, shocking her. “You’re the boss, you should be the one taking the lead,” he said. </p><p>Her surprise lasted barely a second. He sat down on her seat, and pulled her with her. “Since you’re the boss, why don’t you take the lead and show me just how much of my pathetic cock you can handle.” </p><p>“R-right,” Mia said, then growled with sudden anger. She was not a weakling. She could handle it. With a bout of recklessness, she pushed her hips as hard as she could manage, devouring his cock faster than his earlier ramming. “How about this!” she declared in victory. </p><p>“Not bad, not bad at all,” he said, his moan of satisfaction giving her a hint of victory, a face-saving score at the end of the game… And, the game was not over,  she thought as she shifted her hands on his legs, using the leverage to push even deeper. </p><p>She would make him cum first. She would be the winner… She moved her hips, the time losing its meaning.</p><p>…</p><p>Or not,  she corrected several minutes later — or maybe hours, but she had a feeling she wasn’t that strong — as her body started trembling with another orgasm, her arms losing their strength to hold her up. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t handle that little,” he said, his laugh grating her nerves. “We’re just starting.” </p><p>“S-shut up,” she whispered, lacking the strength to continue. </p><p>“Why don’t you use your beautiful lips to finish me, then,” he reminded her even as he pushed her on her feet, somehow finding time to use her discarded panties as a makeshift tie, and pushing her arms behind her. </p><p>“That’s demeaning,” she growled, looking at his shaft, glistening with her juices. </p><p>“And failing to make me cum after all those orgasms is not,” he answered, and she found herself blushing. She didn’t enjoy being defeated, regardless of the form. </p><p>“Maybe, but at least clean it first—“ she started, and then stopped. She would have loved to argue more … but with his cock filling her mouth, it was impossible. And, it wasn’t like what he said was wrong … </p><p>She owed him at least one climax. She forced her mouth open, working on her new duty … desperately hoping none of her employees had a sudden bright idea that would make them visit her.</p>
