        <p>“T-that’s ridiculous,” Sarah stammered, frozen in shock and desire even as I slipped inside her friend, her gaze pointing down, exploring the beautiful sight of Carrie. </p><p>Not that Carrie was in a better condition. The shock in her eyes told that finally, she had realized the ridiculousness of her competitiveness, but when she opened her mouth, the only thing that escaped was an endless procession of moans. </p><p>It didn’t help her to control herself when I put my hand on her belly, rubbing back and forth, each repeat bringing my fingers closer to her breasts, dangling furiously with every repeat. “What - what are you doing?” Sarah managed to stammer. </p><p>“You’re an adult as well, sweetie. I sincerely hope that I don’t need to explain what we’re doing,” I said even my hands completed their climb and landed on Carrie’s breasts. Carrie looked ready to interject, but I didn’t want her speaking. Luckily, after all the times we spent together, I knew exactly how to silence her. I cupped her breasts, my fingers dancing over aggressively, triggering every single sensitive spot I had discovered during our fun times. </p><p>Carrie’s moans turned overwhelming as her body betrayed her. Her legs clamped around my waist reflexively, a habit she had developed through our enjoyable times together, lost in pleasure. </p><p>Sarah didn’t share her expression. “You-you know what I mean,” she stammered as she shuffled uncomfortably. Her tone started to get harsher, but the fact that she was still sitting while Carrie’s head resting on her lap showed her conviction wasn’t particularly strong. </p><p>“I do, but teasing you is fun,” I admitted readily, making her blush. “You’re much cuter when you’re not forcing yourself to look stern.” </p><p>“I’m not-” she stammered before stopping herself, smart enough to realize it was hardly the place to discuss her general attitude, especially with Carrie’s moans running constant interference. “It’s not the point, tell me what is going on!” she said, this time managing to exert her usual stern attitude much more successfully. </p><p>Pity that it was completely useless. </p><p>After all, it wasn’t just about her expression but her general attitude. And, being naked, her friend’s wild blonde hair only thing to cover her core as she lay on her lap, which was not exactly the best position to enable a strong aura. </p><p>“Well, Carrie didn’t appreciate your constant coddling, treating her like a helpless virgin that needs your constant help even to talk to a boy, so she decided to show her abilities more directly.” </p><p>That was enough to make Sarah stricken. She looked down in shock and no small amount of disappointment. Carrie clearly wanted to say something but I silenced her by a strategic push inside her even deeper than my usual pattern, temporarily disabling her mouth with her moans. “So, this is just a sick game…” Sarah murmured, her mind immediately jumping the victim role. </p><p>“Not so fast, sweetheart,” I said even as I flicked her nose, killing her pity party quite effectively. “That was the initial plan, but when you decided to do your best to take her man away, Carrie decided to fight back.” </p><p>Reminding her the aggressive role she had taken at the beginning of the night worked wonders to destroy the platform she was betting to make herself a victim. “But…” she tried to say something, but when I let her speak, it faded. </p><p>“Who was the one who decided to flirt with me in the pool, who decided to use a board game as an excuse to show off?” I asked rapidly, reminding her of the decisions that put her into the condition, all to prove that she was superior to her best friend in terms of seduction?” </p><p>“But…” she repeated, once again fading in shock, enough for her to momentarily ignore the fact that Carrie was between us, redefining the meaning of pleasure. “Still, it’s too much,” she murmured in shock. </p><p>“I see, so you’re drawing the line to getting fingered by someone your best friend has a crush on when the said best friend was still under the blanket, but anything else is too much,” I answered with a wide grin even as she blushed, realizing the ridiculousness of her argument. “Think about it a moment,” I said even as I turned my attention back to Carrie, who was starting to get neglected even with the rather spectacular fucking I was giving her.</p><p>“So, what do you think, Carrie,” I said even as I caressed her satin skin, enjoying the way her heart drummed furiously under my control. “Do you think Sarah is right, that we somehow tricked her into getting into the blanket with us?” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she said, throwing a confused glance at Sarah, who still looked overwhelmed under the combined weight of the naughty situation and the responsibility for the actions that led her here. </p><p>“I need to calm down,” Sarah murmured suddenly as she stood up, though she didn’t neglect to replace her thighs with a pillow, and dashed outside. It was an interesting choice, but when I heard the splash from the pool, I understood her reasoning. “Should we follow her,” Carrie managed to ask, between moans considering I didn’t once slow down my pace. </p><p>Once again, I was so happy with her shyness. Once broken, Carrie had no intention of drawing a new line, more than happy to follow my lead, distracted by the pleasure. </p><p>“No, let’s give her a moment to calm down, she looked like she needed it,” I said, before hitting her with another seductive smirk. “Also, I don’t want to stop, just as you’re nearing another climax. It’s rude to do stop halfway. As a gentleman, I can’t bear such a sin.” </p><p>“Jerk,” she said as she slapped my shoulder, but the way she continued to tighten her legs around my waist told me that she didn’t really have a problem with my smug teasing.</p><p>I loved the way she blushed whenever I teased her, something that was effective even after being impaled repeatedly while resting on the lap of her naked best friend. It made her satin skin glow pinkishly, turning her beauty into an irresistible aura. </p><p>I decided to push that teasing to a completely new level. “So, any idea about what to do with Sarah. Should we let her calm down and act as nothing had happened, or should we go out and seduce her for some proper fun for three?” </p><p>“W-what?” she murmured, staring in confusion, which then turned into a stammering shock the moment she understood what I was suggesting. She opened her mouth, and from her sudden tenseness, I realized the answer was going to be negative. </p><p>Not an answer I wanted to hear, so, I leaned down to capture her lips in a searing kiss, stopping her words excellently, giving her some time to consider before she committed to an answer. And if the way I silenced her pushed her even deeper into the land of pleasure, adding some more votes to the losing side, I wasn’t inclined to admit that. </p><p>And I doubted that Carrie cared too much about the way I used that trick, not when she was busy moaning into my mouth, her hips rocking wildly. </p><p>Normally, at this point, I would have slowed down, caressing and teasing her until she begged for a release, maybe even taking a break to receive a delicious massage from her tits in between while my fingers explored every inch of her soft skin again and again. </p><p>Unfortunately, we had a ticking time bomb in the form of a confused brunette, and I didn’t want to give her too much time, afraid of her reaction once she stayed away too long and got cold feet. Which meant that I needed to be quick, both in terms of making Carrie climax and getting the answer I wanted from her, enabling my ambition to increase the number of my nerdy friends with benefits from one to two. </p><p>Maybe even more, I suddenly thought as I remembered their lively redheaded friend in particular. </p><p>“Any decision yet, Princess,” I asked even as I tapped her legs, making her unwrap them in reflex, something we had developed after a few dangerous close calls. But this time, rather than pulling out directly, I grabbed her legs and parted them wide, using the angle to invade her depths even more aggressively. </p><p>Once again, she was too busy moaning to answer me, but I was happy with the delay, enjoying the opportunity to test the depths of her entrance, her swollen lips wrapping tightly around my girth. </p><p>Since an answer was not forthcoming, I leaned forward, which not only helped me to push even deeper, but also bury my face between her spectacular breasts, enjoying its expanse with aggressive kisses and occasional bites, leveraging her sensitivity to push her to a spectacular climax. </p><p>Her soft hands grabbed my shoulders, pulling me tighter into her bosom even as her body started to clench with the familiar signs of a climax. </p><p>I loved the way she reacted just before the climax hit. She tightened soon after, pushing me dangerously close to a climax of my own as well. Though, after everything that happened under the blanket, it was a miracle that I managed to hold that long. As she let out a loud string of satisfied cries, marketing my prowess to Sarah in the process, I pulled out, spraying her beautiful bosom with my seed. </p><p>“So,” I said, talking with a soft tone even as she was hit by the aftermath of her climax, making it extremely hard for her to disagree with the source of that euphoria. “Should we leave Sarah alone outside, or should we go out and teach her the meaning of pleasure,” I murmured even as I caressed her cheek. </p><p>“I … I don’t know,” she murmured cutely even as her body continued to shake. </p><p>“How about a compromise,” I said with a kind smile, like I was about to do a favor. “Why don’t you just stay here and rest while I go to the pool and have a talk with her. You can watch from the window, and intervene if you feel uncomfortable,” I added, pointing at a small, concealed window with a prime view of the pool, but small enough that it wouldn’t be noticed back from the pool as long as the lights were closed. </p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured noncommittally, which was all the permission I needed. I knew that once she started watching, she would never take radical action to stop what was going on. If she could, things wouldn’t have reached such a point. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured as I kissed her pouty lips for one last time before standing up. “Don’t forget to keep your voice down, we don’t want to startle Sarah,” I said even as I walked toward the pool. Carrie looked confused, too deep in the land of pleasure to understand the significance of my words. </p><p>She would understand soon enough… </p>
