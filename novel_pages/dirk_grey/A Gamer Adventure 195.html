        <p>The roar of a dragon was famed to be legendary, impressive enough that, even with their extreme rarity in the System space, the stories about their roars persisted, becoming the material that would be discussed around the campsites. </p><p>Yet, as Janelor’s voice exploded, it wasn’t the stirrings of fear I felt, but a beautiful tingling that reinforced my arousal. Admittedly, that might be about the fact that her beautiful cry was not let out to convey her fury and willingness to slaughter like those legends of old, but a vessel for her explosion of pleasure, underlined with just the correct amount of pain and pleasure. </p><p>Not to mention shock, guaranteeing that I was the lucky winner of a special privilege. </p><p>As her delicious cries rang in the room, I pushed forward, my shaft disappearing inside her tight hole inch by inch, a process that she had managed to accept with a shocking smoothness, suggesting that her draconic endurance was certainly not only useful for battle. </p><p>Not too different from her cries. </p><p>I paused when my slow and steady push brought me halfway inside her, my girth slowly stretching her tightness even motionless. Her cries stopped after a second, then a weird silence filled the room. “W-what happened?” she asked in a tense voice, her curiousness battling with her determination to act aloof to maintain her pride — or at least, an illusion of a pride. </p><p>“I wanted to check if you were having any trouble, of course,” I said. “If you want to say that you can’t handle it, it’s the opportunity to do so.” </p><p>Her answer was predictable. “W-who can’t handle it!” she stammered, the hitch in her tone showing her wounded pride. “I’m a dragon, and this is nothing!” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I put my hands on her delicious bottom, enjoying her flawless skin. “Then, we can start for real.” </p><p>I could sense her body tightening at the mention, realizing that my earlier words had goaded her intentionally, but it was too late. The same pride that forced her to give her challenging answer prevented her from changing her mind. </p><p>I could feel her body tightening as she prepared to resist to temptation to cry, trying to defend a scrap of her pride. </p><p>Yet, the same pride fell apart by failing to keep her silent as I pulled back quickly, the sensation it created enough to break all the determination she was able to accumulate under the circumstances. </p><p>Though, that cry was nothing compared to the one that followed as I used one hand to grab her beautiful emerald hair, pulling it back harshly to prepare her body for invasion, the other landing on her ass loudly the moment I pushed forward, earning a delicious cry in the process. </p><p>“Excellent work, mistress,” I whispered, my voice inevitably throaty as I pushed deep into her tightness, the pleasure radiating enough to challenge my supernatural ability to keep myself restricted as I started to impale her repeatedly. </p><p>Though, my reaction was nothing compared to my ‘mistress’, each push making her cries louder, even the limited sense of restraint she managed to maintain evaporating, leaving only a primal mixture of pain and pleasure for her. </p><p>In other words, a perfect time to interrogate her for some potentially-sensitive information. </p><p>“I was feeling curious about something, mistress?” I said, under the circumstances, not really bothering to put any emphasis on the word ‘mistress’ to make it ridiculous. The situation was more than enough to put that emphasis. </p><p>“R-right now?” she managed to stammer between her moans. </p><p>“Well, I thought you can easily handle it under the circumstances. But, if you’re feeling that you can’t handle it—“ I teased, only to be interrupted. </p><p>“Of cour—, of course I can handle it,” she said, trying to sound confident, though the loud moan in between went a long way to destroy the convincing nature of her words. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “I was curious about the lands outside the system, particularly how to travel there.” </p><p>“Of — of course, if you want to — commit suicide painfully,” she stammered, managing to sound mocking. Considering that she managed to achieve that effect while being rammed in her tight hole repeatedly, moans interrupting her every few words, it was impressive. </p><p>“Really, then how did you manage to arrive here if it was that dangerous?” I asked, not neglecting to spank her ass for her sudden arrogance. Just because I was amused by her reaction didn’t mean I wanted to avoid training her. </p><p>“Because I’m a dragon,” she said proudly, even trying to push her chest out proudly, though that hardly had the effect she was hoping for under the circumstances. I continued to ram into her, each push creating a more beautiful explosion of cries. </p><p>“And it’s relevant, how?” I asked. </p><p>“P-primordial aether,” she managed to answer. “We have the ability to resist — the corrosion of it much better than ordinary creatures,” she said. </p><p>“How interesting,” I said as I slapped her ass, not expecting to earn such an easy resolution to my suspicions that resulted from her success of arriving in the system space, and the Headmistress’ explanation about the near-impossibility of travel between different planes. </p><p>Maybe my secretive angel started to trust me more than I was expecting. </p><p>“Is this the reason you’re working for —“ I started, only to receive a growl to interrupt me. “Sorry, you’re allied with a goddess.” </p><p>“One of the reasons,” she answered, her tone more steadily as she managed to get used to my steady invasion. “Our ease to travel between planes is hardly the only advantage of our superior heritage. We rule every dimension,” she said, then made a dismissive gesture. “At least, ones that are not invaded by pathetic cheating abominations.” </p><p>I was tempted to say that she was currently being rammed repeatedly by one of those ‘pathetic cheaters’ but considering my own ambivalent feelings about the System, I let that insult slide. </p><p>Instead, I focused on the implications of the ability she revealed, about her ability to travel between planes. “So, can you bring someone else along when you travel between dimensions?” </p><p>“I’m not a pack horse,” she answered instantly, her voice sharp. Too sharp, with a sense of vulnerability underneath, which was even more reliable than a direct answer, admitting that she couldn’t. </p><p>And, considering the amount of sharpness it carried, I was willing to believe that her inability to help others travel between planes was a personal failing and not something that all dragons experienced. Her pride was too easy to read. </p><p>How interesting. </p><p>Still, even that gave me a lot of ideas about ultimately traveling to other planes and saving Aviada from the predicament she found herself in. Especially since it was Janelor’s personal failing to assist others to travel. </p><p>It meant she could be helped to overcome that particular failing. </p><p>But, that was a challenge for another day, when I had managed to learn more about the different planes — and more importantly, how could I use my abilities without the automatic instincts forced by the System. </p><p>And the current moment was a good method to test that as well. I used my mana to block the assistance of the Tantric skill, to see if I could easily copy that trick. </p><p>After blocking, I gathered a minuscule amount of mana, expecting a great challenge of manipulating that. </p><p>[-5 Mana]</p><p>Yet, surprisingly, I managed to coat my shaft with that easily, though that minuscule amount was beneath the notice of my dragon lover, who had been spoiled by much bigger rewards of mana. Interesting, I thought as I blocked Tantric completely as I repeated the earlier trick twice more. </p><p>[-94 Mana]</p><p>[-492 Mana]</p><p>Yet, despite repeating it with much higher amounts of mana, I managed to complete them with great ease, while earning moans of joy from Janelor, ones that were getting shockingly delirious, the combined effect of my mana and my ceaseless impaling pushing her dangerously close to the cliff of pleasure.  </p><p>Under more ordinary circumstances, that display would have stolen my attention, making me watch with a smirk of satisfaction on my face, but under the circumstances, I had other things to focus on. Such as, the performance of my skill.  </p><p>Maybe I was doing something wrong while blocking the skills while under the coverage of the headmistress’ wards, I decided, and applied the same thing to my Arcana abilities, and cast a weak yet complicated light spell.</p><p>[-4 Mana]</p><p>Under that spell, what needed to appear was the five circles of colorful light dancing around each other, barely more than a cantrip, but instead, a flash of light exploded in an uncontrolled burst of light. </p><p>“What the hell?” I murmured, absentmindedly glad that Janelor was too far gone to care about the flash of light or my confusing whisper, as I certainly wouldn’t want to distract myself by explaining that to her. </p><p>Blocking certainly worked. I tried to block Tantric off the System again, and used my mana to coat my shaft. </p><p>[-793 Mana]</p><p>Yet, I once again succeeded without the slightest problem, annoyed by my own success. I released the block from the System and repeated the trick. </p><p>[-839 Mana] </p><p>Naturally, I succeeded again, but that success increased my frown even more, because that success was supposed to be considerably easier with my ability to access Tantric skill. Yet, it wasn’t. </p><p>It was just as easy, no more no less. </p><p>The repeated mana assistance triggered Janelor’s climax, her tightness gripping my girth, even more, triggering a climax of my own. </p><p>Yet, even the delicious explosion of pleasure was not enough to erase the frown off my face. </p><p>Something was wrong with my Tantric skill…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 6790 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
