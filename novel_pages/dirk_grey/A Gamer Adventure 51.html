        <p>Marianne was silent as she slid into the right side of the bed, her gaze bouncing between me and Cornelia, no doubt trying to understand the sudden change. Her surprise was understandable, as during our last encounter, things were rather heated, to a point that she actually cast spells indoors, triggering a battle, only to stop when I tricked her to believe that I was overwhelmingly strong. </p><p>At that point, I was several levels lower than her, so I had tricked her through excessive preparation and several tricks. Luckily, since then, my power grew so much that she was not intimidating toward me anymore. It was the reason I was not afraid of poking fun of her. “Cornelia, before we start, you have an apology to make to Marianne, for scaring her that badly.” </p><p>Marianne looked panicked, no doubt afraid of her reaction, but rather than pulling back, she slid next to me, her tight hug showing her trust. Cornelia, on the other hand, looked like she had swallowed a lemon, but she didn’t dally much before opening her mouth, no doubt aware that it was the much better option compared to the treatment of the previous night. </p><p>“I’m sorry, Mary,” she murmured. “I was shocked by Caesar’s surprise presence, and lashed out. I hope you can forgive me,” she said, as sincere as she could manage. Anger was still present in her tone, but I let it slide. I wanted to teach her obedience, but I didn’t want to extinguish the fire that was making her unique. I liked her passion, it just needed to be under my control… </p><p>“I understand,” Marianne said with a soft smile, though still a bit hesitant. She was skittish enough to be badly affected by Cornelia’s surprise lashing out. “It was a rather difficult situation.” </p><p>“Good,” I said, cutting in to dispel the sudden seriousness. I didn’t want to waste time when they have a lot of interesting things they could do to have fun. “Now, kiss and seal the apology,” I ordered. </p><p>Marianne blushed, while Cornelia smirked, though when their lips met directly in front of me as they leaned in from either side, neither was unenthusiastic. After all, my presence might have put a damper in their relationships, but they were lovers for a long time, and with that background came closeness. </p><p>[More than 5 levels of difference! No Experience]</p><p>The notification of no experience appeared once more, like the System was telling me that I was wasting time. It wasn’t right, of course. Watching them kiss slowly and sensuously might not help me gain experience or progress my companion system, but watching them was a reward of its own. </p><p>As I watched, my blanket rose, lifted by my rock hard erection. I sighed in contentment as I felt a hand wrapping around the base, gently moving up and down. Surprisingly, it was Marianne that took the initiative. Cornelia noticed it when my breath hitched for a moment. She pulled back from the kiss for a second. “Someone is enthusiastic,” she murmured before kissing her once again, this time sharp and passionate. Her hand joined the little game that was going under the blanket, taking the responsibility of the topside. </p><p>I put my hands on their bodies, softly caressing their sensitive spots. I avoided the obviously-sensitive areas, but after all the times we had spent together, I knew how to play their bodies like a flute. Even the most casual touches carried the ability to make them pant and moan helplessly. </p><p>I started slow, wanting to warm them up properly. I had big objectives for the evening. Cornelia had access to one of my biggest secrets, and at this point with their relationship repaired, it was inevitable that Marianne would learn it sooner and later. She had neither the personality nor the ambition to betray my secret, but giving her an even better reason to keep my secrets was a good idea. </p><p>Especially since there were no drawbacks for doing so. </p><p>With that in mind, I decided to start the proceedings with my shy blonde. I leaned down and pressed my lips against her neck, making her moan gently. Her back arched, and she would have broken off the kiss she was sharing with Cornelia if it wasn’t for Cornelia’s initiative to grab her hair to force maintain her kiss. I couldn’t help but smirk in amusement as I watched Cornelia’s rougher habits immediately showed itself. I didn’t say anything though, as Marianne was obviously enjoying it. </p><p>Marianne’s moans intensified as I moved down. First, I nibbled her collarbone to make her gasp loudly. Meanwhile, Cornelia moved until she was on top of me. At first, I had assumed that she was looking for easier access to Marianne, so, she surprised me greatly when she pushed her panties to the side sank herself onto my shaft, making me moan, all without interrupting her kiss with Marianne. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 27%]</p><p>It would be a lie if I said I wasn’t surprised. Combined with her unconscious acceptance of my mark, it suggested that I had misread Cornelia’s personality. I had thought that she was either a sadist or a naturally domineering person, who I had to force and break before remaking her as a better person. But the ease she adapted to my presence and my position over her suggested that maybe the situation was different. Maybe she was looking to connect with people, but her need to protect herself due to her family’s complicated situation had been forcing her to always hold the upper hand. </p><p>Now that she found herself linked to me —she was smart enough to realize that my revealing such a big secret, I was staking a claim, and there was no retreat for her— she was slowly shedding herself of her earlier behaviors. Of course, the pleasure I provided had a rather big impact on the process as well. </p><p>In simpler terms, I managed to fuck the bitch out of her. </p><p>However, as Cornelia started rocking on my lap, my thoughts shifted back to the present. It was unfair for me not to pay attention to the beautiful girls that were doing their best to make me enjoy life. I grabbed Cornelia’s lacy lingerie, and ripped it off just enough to reveal her breasts, but leaving the ripped fabric to hand on her body, partially covering her. Dressed like that, her red hair waving freely with her every move, she was even sexier than her naked state. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 31%]</p><p>As I enjoyed Cornelia’s tightness, however, I used my Tantric abilities to carefully observe her soul space, checking to see if there was any side effect from her forced achievement. The view of her soul space was much clearer than the last time, understandable considering my Tantric skills had almost doubled since yesterday. Increasing the progress of the companion feature helped as well. </p><p>Seeing that the achievement integrated itself without an issue, I shifted my attention to the borders of her soul space, the reason for her inability to level up. Observing Aviada while she leveled naturally taught me a lot, and Helga’s assisted leveling taught me even more about it. Ultimately, it was a lack of potential, reflected itself as the absence of elasticity. The solution was simple. I just needed to strengthen her soul space to ensure the barrier could expand.  </p><p>Of course, simple didn’t mean easy. I dumped a great amount of mana inside her, carefully directing it so that it was absorbed by the borders of her soul space rather than anything else. </p><p>[-723 Mana] </p><p>Despite the mana expenditure that would leave a weaker mage unconscious, her soul space barely reacted. Of course, I wasn’t exactly hurting for mana with my regeneration perk active —especially when I was about to receive a new one from Cornelia soon— so a barely noticeable improvement was more than okay for me. </p><p>I was about to continue my enjoyable treatment, when Marianne decided to pull away from Cornelia’s kiss. “You already started?” Marianne gasped in shock as she looked at where Cornelia was trying to melt into my body. “It’s not fair! You were with him yesterday as well! It’s my turn!” </p><p>I couldn’t help but laugh at the point she had suddenly decided to push through her shyness and defend what she saw as her right. I wanted to shift, but two things prevented me. First, I was making progress with Cornelia’s soul space, and didn’t want to risk it. </p><p>Second, I didn’t want to pull out of Cornelia’s warm grasp until I could paint her insides, especially when she decided to show initiative.</p><p>“Well, you should have acted faster,” I said to Marianne even as I slapped her ass. Her tight, beautiful ass jiggled beautifully under my touch while Marianne moaned helplessly. </p><p>“Not fair,” she moaned playfully. </p><p>“I’m sure I can come up with some kind of compensation,” I countered before I dived down to her bosom, leveraging the revealing corset she was wearing by clamping on her nipple, biting softly. Marianne moaned loudly. “How’s this as an alternative?”</p><p>“Well,” she murmured, “I might indeed deign to wait for a few minutes if you were to continue to pamper me like that,” she answered, but before she could say anything else, Cornelia stole her lips again.</p><p>Cornelia was in deep arousal. Her hips were grinding mercilessly back and forth like she was trying to break my bones, her moans rising despite Marianne’s lips. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 31%]</p><p>“I have a better idea,” I suddenly said even as I wrapped my arms around Cornelia’s waist and pulled her off, and threw her on the bed, her back hitting the soft mattress hard enough to make a sound. Both girls froze at the sudden change, but before they could react, I was already between Cornelia’s legs, once again sliding inside her warmth. “Sit on her face,” I ordered Marianne as I started impaling Cornelia repeatedly in a merciless rhythm, our flesh clapping mixing with her cries of joy. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 35%]</p><p>Marianne followed my orders immediately, pulling down her panties to reveal her delicious entrance, shining with arousal. She reached for her corset as well, but I gestured her to keep it on. Since the corset was low enough to reveal her beautiful breasts, I wanted to keep it. Also, its contrast with Cornelia’s black lingerie —though mostly scraps at this point— added a touch of color to our embrace as well. </p><p>Cornelia responded immediately as Marianne sat on her face, her tongue darting out in a furious dance. I grabbed Marianne’s hair and pulled her close into a searing kiss, tasting Cornelia from her lips. Under a concentrated assault, Marianne started gasping and moaning, some suppressed by my lips, some overcoming the barrier they presented. And when I put one of my hands on her breast and sank my fingers into her inviting flesh, her cries got even louder.  </p><p>With Marianne properly distracted, I turned my attention back to Cornelia, and not just the way she was tightening around my shaft. I pushed another dose of mana inside her, once again strengthening her soul space. At the same time, I put my other hand on her chest, squeezing her smaller, but also firmer, breasts. </p><p>[-357 Mana]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 39%]</p><p>This time, despite spending less mana, the impact was clearer. Ultimately, it might be the pleasure she was feeling. Trying to deal with all different aspects, her control over her power was weaker, helping me to manipulate her soul space easier. </p><p>That, or it was simply because of the progress of the companion acquisition —which was also progressing quite a bit faster than the previous times, but I had a feeling that it had a link with my increased level or heightened charisma. </p><p>Whatever it was, it was working perfectly, so I continued ramming inside her, each push making her moan louder. However, I had a simple and fun way of testing that. A brief moment of concentration allowed me to solidify air into an accurate replica of my shaft. I pulled away from kissing Marianne for a moment, only to jam that in her mouth. She gagged and wheezed, but when I pulled back, the magical dildo was shining with her spit. </p><p>“Couldn’t you use a spell to lubricate it?” Marianne asked exasperatedly. </p><p>“I could have, but that’s more fun,” I answered. I cast another spell, this time to prepare Cornelia’s backdoor to surprise intrusion. Biomancy was not just useful for destroying the undead. I slowly pushed the dildo in her backdoor without breaking a stride. Cornelia tried to cry, but Marianne was in place to silence her perfectly. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 42%]</p><p>[-235 Mana]</p><p>Despite the overwhelming increase in pleasure, I only detected a small improvement at the ease I was able to strengthen Cornelia’s soul space, which could be accounted for increased companion interaction. Not exactly a drawback, but good to know, though I was a bit sad to lose the excuse to have a spectacular orgy. </p><p>On second thought, nothing was preventing me to have one. </p><p>As I continued to impale Cornelia from multiple angles, Marianne started to have a jealous look on her face whenever she pulled away from the kiss we shared, especially as Cornelia started to lose control of her tongue as she experienced yet another climax, trembling and gasping, but still taking it like a champion. However, despite the pleasure, it was starting to make Marianne a bit neglected. </p><p>A change in position was in order, I decided. Another spell ensured that the toy in Cornelia’s backdoor continued to pump while I pulled out. Marianne pulled back, reading the situation correctly. I lay on my back, and Cornelia immediately climbed up on my lap, her hands on my chest to balance herself as she tried to ride me while she was trembling with the after-effects of the orgasms she had experienced. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 46%]</p><p>[-467 Mana]</p><p>“Are you going to wait there, or are you going to give me a taste as well,” I asked Marianne, and she sat on my face, though she was watching Cornelia jumping up and down with a not-inconsiderable amount of jealousy. </p><p>My tongue darted out, circling around her clit and brushed against her sensitive spots. “Yesss!” Marianne cried loudly, suddenly much happier about getting an oral treatment. Luckily, Cornelia was far too gone to notice the reason, or even if she did, feel jealous. She was too busy enjoying the moment. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t just my —rather phenomenal— lovemaking that was making her climax common and effective at the same time. No, she was being extra sensitive, because the treatment she was receiving in her soul space was affecting her mood and amplifying her pleasure. </p><p>With Marianne sitting on my face, I couldn’t see anything, but the sound of their kissing was rather clear. I let it continue, but as Cornelia tightened once more, I felt climax knocking on my door as well. I could have hold myself back, but the idea of filling Cornelia to the brim was simply too tempting. Finally, I exploded, and sent a wide mana rush along with it. </p><p>[-1210 Mana]</p><p>[Achievement: Border Breaker. Limits might be set in stone, but no stone is unbreakable. +2 to All, +10000 Experience]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Master Arcana, Master Elemental, Master Biomancy] </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 49%]</p><p>“Yes, yes, YESSS!” Cornelia cried as I filled her, climbing steadily toward yet another orgasm while I enjoyed the beautiful feeling of getting yet another level. I barely had enough time to select my new skill —Biomancy, as the necromancers were still the biggest threat, and I needed to be ready for them— before Cornelia tightened, signaling her own climax. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 50% - Second Stage Completed +10000 Exp]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 2. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>“Finally!” Cornelia cried deliriously as the earthquake hit her. “Another achievement!” she whispered, her tone drunken. I was happy as well, because unlike Cornelia, I could feel that the achievement sinking into her soul space without my intervention. It wasn’t a surprise though, as the earlier achievement had already confirmed it. </p><p>Her level limit was finally raised. </p><p>It was yet another impossible thing I had achieved. But before I could consider its implications, Cornelia collapsed against my chest, the strain from a combination of her transformation, a new achievement, and several orgasms finally overcoming her willpower. </p><p>It wouldn’t have prevented me from having some deep thoughts, of course, but Marianne pushed Cornelia to the side in an instant. “My turn!” she growled as she took Cornelia’s place. She impaled herself to my shaft, which was already erect thanks to my ridiculously high endurance.  </p><p>It seemed that I had a jealous blonde to placate… </p><p>————</p><p>[Level: 22    Experience: 248100 / 253000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 25</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 32</p><p>HP: 2618 / 2618	Mana: 1820 / 3410        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [75/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>
