        <p>Half an hour passed in silence before the speaker crackled once more. “And, it’s finally over, and you have been an exemplary patient,” finally said the voice from the speaker even as the deafening noise stopped. “We’re going to help you to your room, and the doctor will be with you after examining the results.” </p><p>I said nothing as the bottom part of the MR machine slid out, and soon, I found myself facing two nurses. </p><p>Two shockingly beautiful brunette nurses — who were very much aware of the fact if the unbuttoned tops were any indicator. “Let’s help you to your chair,” said one of them said as she grabbed my arm, her body unnecessarily close. </p><p>Their actions surprised me for a moment before the realization hit. After the match on Sunday, I was a bonafide local celebrity, and the earlier battle I had put in the stadium to get the quarterback position only pushed the situation further. </p><p>“W-what are they doing?” my guide gasped. “And why are they dressed like … this?” she added, an argument that turned even more amusing due to the way she was dressed. </p><p>I caught her gaze and mouthed my answer. “They are just helping me.” </p><p>Luckily, with the hospital gown I was wearing, nurses had other things to focus on than my face — especially since I had a respectable bulge thanks to the earlier angelic show, and my hospital gown failed miserably in its task to hide it.</p><p>They started pushing, one behind me, the other walking forward, the way her hips shook giving me an enjoyable show, their dance too excessive to be accidental. The way her uniform was bunched around her waist showed that her uniform was not that short. </p><p>Though, I didn’t need to notice that to guess that fact, the occasional flashes of her underwear were enough to confirm that. </p><p>Interestingly, there was no one in the corridor to catch the spectacle. </p><p> “Huh, I would have expected the hospital to be more crowded,” I murmured, which was far cleaner and wider than I expected. </p><p>The one walking in front of me turned — not neglecting to lean down to give me a glimpse of her cleavage in the process — before opening her beautiful lips. “It’s because this is the VIP corridor,” she said with a chuckle. “We don’t want our patients to be stalked. </p><p>I smiled. Their actions were firmly in stalking territory as well, but there were many things in life that were acceptable when done by attractive people, and stalking was one of them. </p><p>Was that fair, certainly not, but life wasn’t fair. </p><p>The travel didn’t take long, and my guide said nothing, observing her surroundings. Unlike the first time she appeared, however, her gaze was not filled with a silly fascination, but a cold calculation. </p><p>Suggesting it wouldn’t be as easy to trick her the next time she asked me something. </p><p>“Wow, better than a hotel,” I said as I looked around, which was not an exaggeration. A large, comfortable bed, beautiful furniture, and a huge screen on the wall. If it wasn’t for the medical devices filling half of the room, I would have thought we actually arrived at a five-star resort. </p><p>“Anything for our great hero,” they said together, which was clearly rehearsed. </p><p>I chuckled. Their attempt was transparent, but that didn’t mean I would bother stopping them. Why would I, when they did their best to make the shift between the chair and the bed very enjoyable? </p><p>There was no harm in walking while suffering a concussion, but since they were enthusiastic to help me, it would be rude to reject, I thought, amused by the blush my guide was sporting as she avoided looking our direction. </p><p>“Thanks, my great caretakers,” I said with a roguish smirk, which was already impressive without my Traits helping me. And, the combination of my Seduction and my apparent fame turned into a devastating weapon as they looked at me. </p><p>“W-well, not a bother,” one of them managed to stammer. The other failed even that as she glanced down, their blushes matching. </p><p>Great success. </p><p>“So, girls, what’s next for my treatment?” I asked. </p><p>“N-nothing much,” the other stammered, but the mention of their job helped her to focus. “Concussions are tricky businesses, and there’s not much to do. You just need to stay awake while one of the neurologists goes through the diagnostic and makes sure there is nothing that requires an operation. But from the way you look, it’s clearly not necessary.” </p><p>“Good,” I said. “You girls helped me a lot, is there anything I could do for you.” </p><p>“W-well, we wouldn’t say no to a signature,” one of them said.</p><p>“Sure,” I said, even though I barely held back a chuckle at the request, realizing that I was actually becoming a proper celebrity. </p><p>She clapped her hands, and I didn’t bother hiding my gaze dropping down to watch its impact on her beautiful chest. I expected her to pull a napkin, or maybe even be daring and lean forward so that I could sign her chest. </p><p>This was why I was surprised when she dashed toward the TV, and opened one of the drawers, but it lasted until she pulled out two jerseys, identical. </p><p>Number fifty-two, with my name on the back. </p><p>I looked at her with an amused expression while she blushed. “W-we have always been a supporter of the Pirates, and it was nice to see them finally winning again,” she murmured shyly. </p><p>“Yeah, that, and we were smart enough to go and buy those jerseys during halftime. I heard there had been a few fights after the match for the jerseys,” the other said with a smirk. “My friends will die of jealously once they see them signed.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but curse at the student league regulations. The sales of the jersey and other memorabilia meant absolutely nothing for the players monetarily. As student-athletes, we basically allowed them to use our likeness and name for free. </p><p>At least I received intent from it, which was much better than what other players received. </p><p>A big nothing. </p><p>I suddenly gave them a serious look. “I’m afraid I can’t sign those,” I said, their smiles disappearing. “I’m afraid a real fan would have been wearing the uniform.” </p><p>“But we’re currently working —“ the one that had initially pulled the jerseys started in panic, making her friend poke her on the side. </p><p>“Stacy,” she murmured with a deadpan glare as she looked at her friend, who stopped in confusion at first, then noticed my smirk. </p><p>“Oh,” she murmured even as her still nameless friend turned toward me. </p><p>“Oh, that can be arranged,” she said as she walked to the door and locked it.</p><p>“Wouldn’t locking the door be a trouble?” I asked even as she dragged Stacy, who was clearly shyer — and curvier — of the two to the bathroom. </p><p>“Of course not, there’s a lot of private procedures,” she answered with a wink, then they disappeared into the other room, closing the door behind them. </p><p>Which was, interestingly, not the bathroom, but another room, showing that it wasn’t just a luxury room I was resting, but a luxury suite. </p><p>“What are you doing?” my guide said as she looked at me, finally able to turn and look at me now that the nurses had left the room. </p><p>“I’m doing my best to generate Intent, of course. You told me that the darkness is coming and I needed to get stronger. And, I’m chasing the most viable path.” </p><p>That was enough to make her pause for a second. “S-still,” she stammered cutely. “That doesn’t mean that you need to act like that bastard to do so,” she added. </p><p>“Hey, find a way to give me more without actually being targeted by the cursed flames, and I’ll think about it,” I said, which was enough to silence her. “By the way, I had been attacked by some kind of a shadow assassin while you are away. Is it somewhat related to this Darkness you mentioned,” I added, deciding to ask about it while she was distracted was the best way. </p><p>I would have hidden that information under different circumstances, but considering I needed her to protect me while I was sleeping, that was not a luxury I had. </p><p>I didn’t want to die while trying to act cagey. </p><p>Not that I gave her the full breakdown, of course. I didn’t mention multiple attacks, or multiple assassins. </p><p>“A shadow assassin,” she said with a frown. “How did you handle it.” </p><p>“I don’t know, I was busy panicking and trying to kill it. It seemed that they had a time limit,” I explained, giving her a reasonable explanation that didn’t require my ability to actively channel Intent. </p><p>Maybe I was being excessive not revealing my ability to channel Intent and directly control the system, but she was yet to earn that trust. I needed some advantages of my own. </p><p>Especially since she was actively devouring quite a bit of intent from the System rather than triggering it once more — which, to her knowledge, was necessary to give me more abilities. </p><p>While she thought, I carefully focused on the System, blocking the intent flow from the System to her. Luckily, it was much easier than actually stealing from the initial free Intent flow, giving me a chance to keep most of my gains. </p><p>“Maybe it was miscast,” she murmured after some thinking, then looked at me. “Unfortunately, it’s hard to know. Shadow soldiers is a relatively simple spell, and it can be cast by anyone especially if it collapsed halfway,” she explained. </p><p>Before she could ask anything else, however, the door opened once more, and two nurses entered once more, wearing my jerseys. </p><p>The shocked gasp my guide let out was simply beautiful as she disappeared, and I felt her mental presence settling next to the System once more. </p><p>Though, her shock was understandable, as if the lack of lines around her hips and chest was any indicator…</p><p>They were wearing my jerseys, and nothing else… </p>
