        <p>Several hours —and one extended shower that turned into another tumble— later, we were sitting on the balcony, sipping champagne in silence, the rings shining under the reddish light of the evening sun. </p><p>For a man that was about to be hunted by three dangerous crime families simultaneously, I was feeling rather relaxed. Doubtlessly, a part of it was the security provided by the resort. Even for a dangerous organization like Blue Guard, breaking the neutrality of the place was not a reasonable action. Maybe especially for them, as bigger the organization, the more precious their reputation. </p><p>It left my mission as the only real source of danger. Of course, being on the crosshairs of the Blue Guard and Dominion Cartel would make it harder for me to act unnoticed. On the plus side, it would be easier to get access to private areas and meeting people. In general, I could even say that my mission got easier, though the extraction itself would get harder. </p><p>However, I didn’t pay much attention to those developments. I was more interested in the view. Not the view of the sea, even though it looked gorgeous as the blue waters of the sea bathed under the orange light of the sunset, the white sands of the beach shining with fire. </p><p>No, my eyes were locked on the beautiful figure of Sabrina, wearing only a loose bathrobe, leaving a delicious naked strip that left her breasts and midriff bare, though her crossed legs hid her beautiful core behind their delicious caramel color. I took another sip from the champagne as I enjoyed the beautiful curve of her breasts, climbing to her nipple, which was tempting my lips even after several exhausting hours we had just spent. Despite being a virgin until hours ago, she was truly insatiable. </p><p>Finally, it was Sabrina that broke the silence. “Well, that went a bit further than I had planned,” Sabrina murmured, but I could hear the fulfilled exhaustion in her tone, something that made me rather proud. </p><p>“I can’t say that I complain,” I answered, not bothering to hide my smirk, and received a playful slap in response. </p><p>“Shut up, you bastard. It’s all your fault,” she said, but her chuckle indicated her good humor. “I’m hurting everywhere…” </p><p>“Hey, what I can say, I was motivated. I remember several death threats I received, forcing me to continue,” I added, receiving yet another playful slap in response. I decided to caress her thigh in response, making her shiver. I was tempted to pull her on my lap, but the last session had left her rather exhausted. I doubted that she would be able to walk properly tomorrow. </p><p>After another five minutes of silence, she spoke once more, this time much more serious. “I’m sorry,” she said, her beautiful brown eyes centering mine. “I didn’t tell you but my family is not entirely … legal… I’m afraid that I might have pulled you in a situation too dangerous.” </p><p>“That’s a bit of surprise,” I said calmly. “I’m guessing that, these two assholes that were trying to get your attention aren’t entirely on the legal side as well,” I said, not looking particularly torn up. </p><p>“How did you know?” she said, her eyebrows raised. </p><p>I shrugged. “Well, in the lobby, Brad had found me and spouted some stuff about how Dominion Cartel was going make me pay for playing him for a fool and such things. From there, it didn’t take much to guess that the others on the table had some illegal roots as well.” </p><p>“Why all of my brother’s friends are idiots?” Sabrina murmured, clearly no more impressed with the intimidation attempt. Then she continued, once again serious. “Why are you not panicking, or angry at me? I have put you in danger.” </p><p>“I’m not angry at you because I had already managed to get their attention by recklessly joining that poker game,” I explained, which was completely true. Yes, her identity as the heiress of the Blue Guard complicated things further, but at that point, it was better to have multiple enemies. At least, by that way, when I finally disappeared, each party would assume the other was responsible for it. “And it’s not like they could touch me while I’m still in here,” I smirked. “And thanks to your clever assistance, I have enough money to live here for a long while.” </p><p>“You’re an interesting man,” she said even as she leaned forward, stealing a fleeting kiss. “Too bad that I can’t keep you.” </p><p>I shrugged even as I pulled her to my lap, but choosing to wrap my arms around her torso. “It’s better to cherish beautiful moments rather than lamenting about the future,” I answered. </p><p>She twisted her neck until our gazes met. “You’re really interesting… Too interesting, even. What’s your secret?” she asked. </p><p>I bobbed her nose playfully. “A man needs to have a little mystery around himself to ensure attractiveness,” I said with a smirk, catching her lips in another kiss. “So, are you ready to share that photo?” </p><p>“Of course not!” she answered. “We still need to dress, maybe even call the makeup team?” </p><p>“Do we?” I answered. “Wouldn’t it be even more believable if we share the photo from here, you sitting on my lap, wearing just our bathrobes? Doesn’t it make selling our lightning engagement much easier…” </p><p>“It does,” she agreed, but biting her lips worriedly. “But that makes it even more dangerous. My brothers are very protective and still believe that I’m a little girl,” she answered, the disdain in her tone revealing that their protectiveness was more about the male pride and less about love toward their sister. </p><p>“I doubt that at this point, it’ll make a major difference in my situation. You can choose whichever that fits your objectives the best,” I said, being more generous than necessary, but at this point, it was better to double-down. At least in this way, if I survived, I would have an amazing asset in the form of a high-level member of Blue Guard, making my future career markedly easier. </p><p>“You’re a very brave man, Michael,” she murmured. “A reckless, maybe even a stupid one, but brave nonetheless.” She said nothing else as she fixed her bathrobe, enough to make sure the photo was not obscenely revealing, but not enough to erase all hints of what we had been doing for the last several hours. </p><p>I pressed my lips on her neck and sucked hard enough to leave a mark, earning a warning glare. “Just to make it more convincing,” I said. </p><p>“Good point,” she answered before clamping on my lips, kissing hard enough to leave them bloated and bruised, not to mention stained with her lipstick. “Smile,” she said as she raised the camera, and inevitably, I did so. A genuine one, even, as she shared. “You should probably leave. Believe me, you don’t want to be a part of the chaos that’s about to erupt.” </p><p>“Whatever you wish, sweetie,” I said as I kissed her once more, but this time, I didn’t pull back easily, my hands sliding inside her bathrobe to trail the familiar shape of her breasts, enjoying the way she trembled as I teased her nipples. Unfortunately, I needed to return to my task, so I reluctantly stopped and stood up. </p><p>While I dressed, she quickly added some text to our photo, and sent the message that would launch inevitable chaos. “Done,” she said. “And as much as I would like for you to hang around, you better get away before I start talking with them,” she said. </p><p>“Call me whenever you want to meet up,” I said, and left the room after stealing one last kiss. Her phone was already ringing as I left the room… </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****</p><p>I was in my room, just finished putting on a tux, about to leave my room for dinner, when I heard a knock on the door. I moved to open it, but on the way, grabbed a knife and started to peel an apple, just in case I had a hostile visitor. It wasn’t likely. However, likely and impossible were two different things. </p><p>When I opened the door, however, I met with a well-dressed older gentleman, with a mahogany tray in hand, his impeccable demeanor wouldn’t be amiss in a palace. He was probably one of the classical butlers, the kind that got paid in the millions but with the near-mystical ability to guess the mind of their masters. “How can I help you?” I asked, curious about his presence. </p><p>“I hope you’re having a nice evening, sir,” he spoke with an excellent British accent. “I’m here on behalf of our establishment, to present you with a little gift of appreciation for your continued patronage.” </p><p>“I appreciate the thoughtfulness of the management staff. Please communicate my best wishes,” I answered, not bothering to hide my excitement. It was a VIP card, their shiny black surface was hard to miss. I could feel my heartbeat going crazy. I acquired the key to my mission, and somehow, I did it much quicker than even my best estimation. Of course, I might have gained the dangerous attention of three international illegal organizations in the process, but that was just details… </p><p>“Of course, sir. However, if you’re available, I would like to communicate an invitation for a small dinner to share your joy,” he added. </p><p>I didn’t answer as I reached toward the card, trying to think of a viable way of rejecting the invitation. Now that I finally had the bronze VIP access, I would have preferred to scope the area and try to identify possible candidates rather than suffering through an event that would no doubt be pretentious and useless. </p><p>Then, I flipped the card, only to unable find the bronze strip I had been looking for, replaced by a silver one. I turned toward the butler with a quirked eyebrow, only to receive a soft smile, still impeccably kind and subservient. I took a breath, trying to gather my thoughts. Even for bronze, my only hope of qualification was to gamble rabidly for the next several days until I got the attention of the management. </p><p>Even considering my surprise ‘engagement’ with the heiress of the Blue Guard, it didn’t make sense. </p><p>“So, you mentioned a dinner,” I said, which was probably where the answer for my little question lay. </p><p>“Yes, sir, if you’re available, you have an invitation for the ninety-ninth floor.” </p><p>That was another surprise. Ninety-ninth floor, the restaurant at the top floor of the resort, one that was impossible to enter without an invitation even for the gold VIPs, dedicated only for the management board of the Resort. A management board didn’t sound scary, until one factored in that those nine mysterious figures effectively ruled the island that was at the center of the World’s illegal trades, from weapons and drugs to espionage. “Of course, when should I arrive?” I asked. </p><p>“Whenever is convenient for you sir, including right now. Mr. Hastings is going to be at the restaurant for the next several hours.”</p><p>Once again, I hated the mission. I had no idea who Mr. Hastings was, because I was here with almost no intelligence, trying to improvise a plan amongst some of the most dangerous people in the world. “Right now is fine,” I answered. The sooner I learned about this Mr. Hastings, who was probably the reason for my silver VIP status, the better. </p><p>“How about your room, sir,” the butler asked. I sent him a questioning look. “We have a nice complimentary room on the floor sixty-three, I could ask the waitstaff to carry your items there if you wish so.” </p><p>“I would appreciate that,” I answered fearlessly, mostly because I didn’t have anything incriminating in my room. One good thing about going to a mission unprepared, there was nothing to hide. Also, considering the number of people I managed to anger, I appreciate the increased protection as a result of increased status. </p><p>After making the arrangements for my new room, I walked toward the gold VIP elevator, and even that only went up to floor ninety. I let the scanner read my card as per the butler’s recommendations, and the elevator started climbing. The distance between gave me enough time to consider the possibilities, enough to make me worry. I was afraid that my real identity was discovered. </p><p>Even the invitation itself didn’t invalidate the possibility. I was sure that they would have loved the possibility of catching and executing one of the members of the Agency, the premier international organization for protecting the World. </p><p>The Agency might have turned into a shadow of its previous self during the last two decade —as evidenced by my horrible lack of support— but still, its reputation was miles ahead of secret services worked for governments, regardless if it was CIA, MI6, or even the past KGB. The Agency was the legendary pillar of the world, untouchable. </p><p>Or supposed to be untouchable, as Agent Brown’s disappearance had reduced the number of active agents even further. Even worse, I didn’t know how many of them active, or how many of the active ones were half-baked ones like I was, pushed to the field without their training completed. But the slow loss of power didn’t affect the reputation value of catching of the Agents for the criminal elements. The management of the Agency believed that it was the ending Agent Brown had received. Agent Brown, who was one of the few remaining legends of the Agency. </p><p>When the elevator door opened, I focused on the present, desperately hoping that the itching on the back of my head was not a premonition about the path a bullet would take minutes later. It was not the first time I faced the possibility of death, after all… </p><p>One of the greeters immediately walked toward me, and after a small bow, started walking away. I naturally followed, passing through the opulent restaurant, doing my best to ignore the eyes on me. The restaurant was furnished opulently, each table probably worth more than millions, but still, it was much less important than the people that were occupying the room. </p><p>Weapon dealers, drug lords, government officials including three prime ministers and two presidents from first world countries, even several global stars —some of them sitting on the laps of oil tycoons, giggling obediently. It was a room filled with wealth, status, and vice… I silently walked amongst them, ignoring their curious gazes. </p><p>The waiter left after one last bow, leaving me at the entrance of a private room, making me even more curious about the identity of my mystery benefactor. But when I stepped into the private room and found myself alone with an old man, my concerns rushed back to me. </p><p>Because I recognized that face. </p><p>The Butcher of Boston, one of the most famous hatchet men of the Irish Mafia in his youth, with a number of legendary feats, including single-handedly slaughtering a cell of Chinese Triad of fifty members trying to get established in Boston, killing them all in less than a week. But that was just the beginning of his legend. After his bosses tried to double-cross him, he had left New York and started trotting the globe, news about him getting more sparse, and also more outrageous, until the Butcher became a part of the legend. The last anyone had ever heard about him was one and half decades ago, where the photo of him was taken. </p><p>The itching on the back of my head got stronger…</p>
