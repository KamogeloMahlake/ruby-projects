        <p>The next day passed in a relative monotony. I had gone for another ride with my bike in the morning, making another show of my presence, occasionally interrupted by a lot of new photos from Emily. Some were from her desk, showing her beautiful face, while the others were from the bathroom, focusing on more interesting parts of her anatomy — unfortunately, her clothes stayed in place. </p><p>However, the interesting thing was that she was able to take photos. I wondered whether the Guild didn’t prevent people from taking photos in their employee-only areas … or Emily was bypassing it somewhat.  </p><p>An indirect question received a deflection, confirming that it was the latter. </p><p>How naughty. Not that I was complaining about that. </p><p>Her ability to take photos brought me back to that mysterious message from the puzzle I had received, tempting me to poke around. Not directly, but using the traffic as an excuse and passing near the junkyard that supposedly held the stash was easier. </p><p>I didn’t go inside, but I was just there to make sure to check there was any security like I feared. </p><p>It turned out that staying away from the correct choice, as by overcharging my power, I noticed three distinct high-tech cameras and four security guards that looked far too professional to be working at a junkyard. </p><p>It was definitely a trap. </p><p>Luckily, the holding cell that was supposed to exist was under the guild, and thanks to Emily’s new naughty habit, I had a chance to scout the area indirectly with my power, to at least understand if such a prison actually existed, and holding someone important. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t exactly being driven by a sudden sense of altruism. The supposed prisoner was helpful from two perspectives. If she existed, once I saved her, she would be still vulnerable enough to need allies … and I wasn’t in a position to turn my nose on an ally that was dangerous — or useful — enough to be illegally imprisoned by the New Giant Force. </p><p>The other benefit was even more direct. Even if I didn’t ultimately go through with it, the mission of saving a prisoner from the premier guild gave me an excuse that I desperately needed; high-impact enough to justify the involvement of my non-existent boss, and distant enough from the other villain operations to keep them away. </p><p>Naturally, it had significant disadvantages as well, the biggest being making an enemy out of the Guild, but I was still glad to have that as an option. </p><p>Just in case. </p><p>With that done, I returned to the bar and parked my bike in the front, but not before stopping by a store to order some construction material, like better floor tiles, some new wallpaper, and other construction items. </p><p>I hadn’t been planning to make any visible changes in my place, but having an excuse for the tunnel construction might have been useful. I asked for their delivery to the street, and I returned to the bar. </p><p>Then, once I left several strict instructions to Tara — and a quickie against the wall — I left the bar through the secret tunnel we had just built, once again disguised as a delivery person. </p><p>However, this time, my only stop wasn’t the bakery. I also stopped by a sexy lingerie shop, and purchased a beautiful white corset, complete with panties and a garter belt. It cost me three hundred dollars, which was nothing. I would have happily spent ten times for a gift and not blinked… but it would be too suspicious, particularly since, from her perspective, I was still a struggling young man with two jobs. </p><p>Admittedly, this was very much who I had been my whole life with the notable exception of the last few days, so it wasn’t exactly a difficult role. </p><p>Making my gift appropriate. </p><p>I also added a new lengthy note about how I couldn’t wait to see her in them, and then, after some thought, I also slipped the promised fifty dollars into the box as well. Ordinarily, mixing an intimate gift and payment for professional services would have been a terrible idea, creating a dangerous blurring.  </p><p>Considering my objective, it wasn’t as terrible. </p><p>“Delivery from a thankful citizen,” I said as I arrived at the headquarters, standing in front of Emily, who was suddenly blushing furiously as she looked at me, as if it just clicked with her that she was texting with a real person. </p><p>Looking at her, it was hard to believe it was the same girl who had been taking pictures wearing nothing. </p><p>The difference was shocking at first, but it soon clicked. It was her power. Her ability to interface with the tech allowed her to feel more secure than she did in real life. </p><p>An interesting detail. </p><p>“T-thank you,” she whispered, her blush thick. </p><p>“Don’t thank me yet,” I added as I slid the box toward her. “And, this is the gift from another appreciative citizen, to a particular member,” I said as I slid the box forward, which had her name on the box. </p><p>Curious, she opened it, only to slam it back, her face beet red. “W-what’s this, Jason,” she whispered. </p><p>“Well, one of your pictures showed you didn’t have any leisure underwear to wear at home, so I decided to gift you one,” I explained, like there was nothing more ordinary. </p><p>She said nothing, just looked at me with a growing blush. It wasn’t much compared to all the pictures she shared, but standing in front of me, she seemed to forget just how compromising she had been on the pictures. </p><p>I ignored the temptation to tease her even more, and just left after a wink. </p><p>‘You are evil!’ she wrote five minutes after I left, making me chuckle. </p><p>‘Well, does it mean I’m not going to receive any pictures of you wearing that beautiful corset,’ I replied, feeling like I had a good enough handle on her personality to guess how she would react. If I said that directly, she might have fainted, but in a message, it just received a few angry emojis as a response. </p><p>A few back and forth, and she finally assented. ‘Maybe… If I’m still feeling well once I return home…’ she finally admitted. </p><p>‘How about if we don’t take the risk?’ I responded. </p><p>‘What do you mean?’</p><p>“Well, you have already shared a beautiful photo from the dressing room. Why not one more? It’ll be empty.’</p><p>‘We’re not supposed to be taking photos there,’ she admitted. </p><p>I smirked as I read her panicked reply, reluctantly admitting that she had already violated the rules. For someone with a stricter personality, it would be it, but I just sent a few more messages, which was enough to break her — rather reluctant and lackluster — resistance. Moreover, I could see that she was clearly not the best decision maker under pressure, not even the subtle one I created. </p><p>‘You are evil!’ she wrote again, but it hadn’t been particularly discouraging, considering it followed by a picture of her leg, showing that she had already put on the thigh-high stocking, the white looking particularly good with contrast to her beauty. </p><p>As much as I enjoyed the view, I also took note of where she was. It wasn’t the same dressing room she had used earlier. </p><p>It was far more luxurious and expensive looking … and I could see several superhero outfits hanging around. </p><p>She had sneaked into the locker room of the female heroes. </p><p>Even naughtier than I expected, I thought with a smirk. It wasn’t something serious, but I had a feeling that, she wouldn’t have dared to do so just the day before. </p><p>A fascinating speed of corruption, I admitted, but currently, I did nothing more than take a mental note. The next photo that followed. A mirror selfie, showing everything. The underwear was a perfect fit, which was another benefit of my observation power. </p><p>However, rather than patting myself on the back, I focused on enjoying the way she looked when clad in the corset. It wasn’t exactly something I would call revealing … her shirt selfie was certainly more revealing both in terms of the area it covered, and in terms of the pose. She was far more comfortable with her sexiness back home. </p><p>However, that didn’t mean she looked bad. On the contrary, she looked amazing in the corset and garter belt combo, both innocent white, and her hesitancy only highlighted her innocence more. </p><p>She was just like a cute white rabbit, hesitant to go for a walk … and I was the cunning and villainous fox waiting for the opportunity to catch her. </p><p>I was planning to spend the rest of my day, slowly encouraging her for more, when I received a warning from my other phone, showing that one of the cameras I left caught a movement. </p><p>A quick check showed that it was the old sewer we discovered while we had been digging ours. </p><p>I quickly made my way back to the bar. </p>
