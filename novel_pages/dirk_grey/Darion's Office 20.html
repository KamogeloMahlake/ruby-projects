        <p>As Janet walked toward the bathroom, to fix her makeup, she was having conflicting feelings. Her day had passed completely uneventful … too uneventful, which had been shocking. </p><p>That wouldn’t have been a surprise if it wasn’t for their newest janitor, the brute that had manhandled her as she toyed with her the day he had been recruited. In a way, he was the most difficult first-day employee she had to deal with. </p><p>She had a lot of tools to handle a difficult employee, but facing Darion, she found herself reluctant to use most of them … especially since his unruly actions had brought so much pleasure to her. Today, she had come prepared, conveniently hidden under her work uniform, ready to be unleashed … </p><p>Only to fail to find him all day. First, Mia had sent him to escort that annoying little girl, Lily, then, when he returned, Mia suddenly pulled him to an emergency meeting … and before she could check, Mia left early, which was uncharacteristic for her. She wouldn’t care, but Sakura was gone as well. </p><p>And Darion was nowhere to be found, which made her unique thematic preparation wasteful. </p><p>Janet didn’t want to lose her position to that upstart whore. </p><p>Lost in her thoughts, she didn’t expect anyone in the bathroom … certainly not a man. She panicked, covering herself reflexively. </p><p>Then she noticed the unexpected man was not someone she didn’t know … but someone she had been searching for all day. Still, his presence caught her by surprise. “Hi, Darion,” she whispered, trying to sound less scared and more alluring. “You scared me, I didn’t expect you here.” </p><p>“Really, why?” he said, his tone deadpan and his face sharp, but Janet could hear a hint of amusement hidden regardless. </p><p>“It’s the executive bathroom, and Mia only allows important clients to use it.” </p><p>“Oh, fascinating detail,” Darion said. “And, since she’s not allowing the employees to use it, you must be here as entertainment instead.” </p><p>“T-that’s rude,” Janet stammered, but it was less about being insulted, and more about her heartbeat picking up. Especially as his gaze landed on her red stockings, reading her outfit perfectly. </p><p>“Rude doesn’t mean inaccurate,” he said, and Janet shivered. “You’re dressed like a stripper, why don’t you show me how well you can work as one as well.” </p><p>Janet blushed, but that was all the reaction she had. After all, it was what she had been planning when she arrived today … one that delayed significantly as she failed to find him. </p><p>“You want a show…” Janet murmured as she reached to her jacket, unbuttoning it with a flick, one that revealed her breasts, imprisoned behind her favorite bra. She loved the way it worked with her hair color. </p><p>The hungry expression he had as she pushed her chest forward and give him an excellent view of her cleavage — and slightly more thanks to the transparency of her top. Under different circumstances, she would have stayed like that for a long while, teasing him a lot before moving to the fun parts. But two things stopped her. First, Darion didn’t seem like he would appreciate being toyed with…</p><p>More importantly, Janet was burning with arousal already, and didn’t want to take it long. Instead, she slowly spun around an imaginary pole as she got rid of her jacket, aware of just how good she looked. </p><p>Then, her hands landed on her skirt, a pull of the zipper and a shake of her hips were all that was needed to free her from her skirt, revealing her surprise. </p><p>“So, I wasn’t talking hyperbole when I called you a stripper,” Darion said. Janet blushed, but that didn’t prevent her from giving the most alluring pose she could give. She walked forward, aware of just how her long legs were accentuated by her garter belt and her stockings. </p><p>The way he looked at her burned her body with desire. </p><p>Then, she sat on the counter, positioning her arms in a way that highlighted her cleavage even more. “Anything you have in mind, Darion?” she whispered as he stared at her.</p><p>“Tough call, I need to see more,” he said. She shifted in place, giving him an even better angle of her body, enjoying his obvious interest. She hoped to trigger him so he moved, but he seemed to be determined to enjoy the sight without making a move. </p><p>Janet decided to break his will by making a show. “Come on stud,” she whispered as she pushed her bra up, giving him an even better view of her body. For all intents and purposes, she was naked as she took a step toward him, excitement burning in her. “It’s rude to be fully clothed while I’m doing my best, don’t you think?” </p><p>He chuckled as he got rid of his shirt, once again showing his muscles — which had played an important role in her dreams. She closed in the distance, a smirk on her face. “Come on, big boy. You can do—“ she started, but before she could finish, he grabbed her waist and pulled her against him. </p><p>“Careful, honey. One day, you’ll push your luck too much,” he whispered. </p><p>Janet might have said something, but that was hard to do with her hips rubbing against his crotch, triggering her desire even more than she expected. She just moaned as his hands mauled her tits mercilessly once more, making her shiver and moan. </p><p>Then, she found herself being pushed against the counter. She expected him to whip out his monster and teach her a lesson, but instead, he crouched down… She was shocked as his tongue jumped out, caressing her core. “Good girls get rewarded,” he said, his tone enough to carry her halfway to a climax…</p><p>Then, his tongue started dancing at her entrance with a display of skill that truly shocked her, making her helpless as she found herself leaning against the counter. The pleasure was simply too intense. </p><p>“On your feet,” he ordered, and she followed, too happy doing so as his tongue stayed connected, licking her aggressively. The pleasure was getting more and more intense …</p><p>But, before she could climax, she suddenly found his arms around her waist, flipping her to the other side, being kissed aggressively. She could taste herself on his lips, but as his fingers mauled her ass, she didn’t care much about that.</p><p>She cared more about his fingers, pushing her down. “Now, it’s your turn, slut,” he ordered. </p><p>She might have argued against his statement, but the speed she pulled his pants down, combined with the way she dressed … she had to admit that he had a point.</p>
