        <p>I didn’t want to move, but think about what had happened. However, if there was one useful habit I had gained from my time as a student-athlete, that it was always better to be moving. </p><p>However, first, I consumed the pill she had given me. I didn’t expect it to be poison for two reasons. First, she could have killed me easily if she wished. Second, the system — despite its annoying name — roughly confirmed its nature as something to enhance my abilities. </p><p>I trusted it … because I didn’t have any other option. </p><p>I pulled the bottle open, and the most delicious smell I had ever enjoyed wafted into my nose. “In for a penny…” I murmured, and swallowed the pill. Warmth immediately spread into my body, forcing me to hold against the nearest tree. I started sweating and trembling at the same time, but it only lasted a few seconds. </p><p>Once it was gone, I found out that there was no difference. I thought about trying to get the other one from the System, but I decided against it. There was no guarantee that the magic lady from earlier couldn’t somehow sense it. </p><p>And, I couldn’t trust her with such a secret. She was nice to me, because she pitied me — as confirmed by the System, which I had to trust for the moment — and I did not know how she would act without it. </p><p>“It’s time for some experimentation,” I said instead. I didn’t know the name of the pill she had given to me, but since the enhanced version was a martial aptitude pill, I expected it to be the same.  </p><p>I raised my hands, took a basic boxing guard, and started doing a shadow-boxing routine. I was not a boxer, but I had learned a few moves after my injury during my desperate rush to find another sport that could help me maintain my scholarship. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I said after completing a few basic routines, moving through a fluidity that surprised me. “If I had this pill back on Earth, I would have been a professional boxer,” I said. Each punch flowed fluidly, and the footwork felt natural, just like how sprinting techniques had felt as easy as breathing. “Can I return to my world, System?” I asked, in English. </p><p>There was no answer. </p><p>I decided to move before it was too late. But, first, some shoes. I tried to rip the cloak she had gifted to make something to cover my feet, but I failed. It was stronger than I expected. </p><p>Instead, I gathered some leaves, tied them with some soft branches to create something that could function as a shoe. Then, I broke a thick branch, one that could be used as a weapon against a wild beast, and started walking. </p><p>I did not know where the nearest civilization was, so I started moving toward the nearest hill I could see. Hopefully, the elevation would allow me to discover somewhere else. </p><p>It was barely a couple miles away, which I felt like an easy distance, but the more I walked, the more I realized not that easy without proper shoes. What was supposed to be a short distance turned into something that took almost an hour. </p><p>I stopped before climbing halfway and saw a village at a distance. However, it was at least ten miles away, and it was already late afternoon. I doubted I could arrive there before the darkness — assuming I didn’t get lost. </p><p>And, even if I arrived, could I explain myself with my very limited command of the language? </p><p>I looked around, but I wasn’t able to see the mysterious magic lady. Technically, she could be still watching me, but I took the risk. If she was still watching me, it would mean that she suspected something, and it was hard for me to hide anything. </p><p>It was risky, but not as risky as trying to traverse an unknown forest at night. </p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to reach to the System, to get the language jade. The moment I thought that, another green, glowing rock popped into my hand from nothingness. This one glowed even brighter. “Well, at has smooth user experience,” I muttered to myself even as I brought it to my temple, preparing myself for the pain. </p><p>Yet, the pain didn’t come. It felt like a gentle whisper, followed by a click, and suddenly, my mind was filled with the full comprehension of several languages, along with some contextual information. Like, how much someone should bow for a foundation establishment cultivator, or how long one could make eye contact with a connate realm martial artist. </p><p>Annoying, considering I did not know what a Foundation Establishment was, who was a cultivator. </p><p>Though, the number of ways that were there to explain why one had killed their enemies — a shocking number of them including mentions of mere disrespect — clued me I wasn’t in a peaceful world. </p><p>Luckily, despite the horrifying implications, using the jade was a simple process and useful. “At least the better they are, the less they hurt,” I said as I summoned the aptitude enhancement pill. However, this time, before I opened, I tried to put it back to where it came from, to see if I could use the Inventory as a storage. </p><p>It didn’t work. “Well,” I said as I opened the bottle. It smelt even more spectacular than the previous one. I took it, expecting a gentle caress after I swallowed, but the moment it touched my mouth, it melted and mixed into my body and — </p><p>My blood turned to lava, and my bones were replaced with ice needles. At least, that was how it felt as I hit the floor. I didn’t cry, and as much as I wanted to say that it was about my incredible willpower, the answer was less glorious. </p><p>It hurt too much even to breathe, so I just whimpered. </p><p>Worse, I couldn’t even fall unconscious. I just lay on the ground, helpless, watching the sun move… It probably lasted less than an hour, but felt like a lifetime. “Damn, that was worse than I expected,” I said as I stood up. For all my memories pain, my body felt good. </p><p>Amazing, even. </p><p>“Maybe it will teach me about making assumptions.” </p><p>Despite the torture I just had, as I moved, I felt better than ever, like the pain was nothing more than a bad dream. I took a deep breath, feeling refreshed. I sat on a nearby rock, wondering if I could light a fire to keep the wild beasts away. </p><p>“First, let’s test if it helped me as much as I expected,” I said as I once again took a basic boxing stance and punched. Breathed. Punched. Breathed. </p><p>A weird rhythm took me as I moved smoother than I had ever done. It felt like a dream, but instead of the panic of a missed exam, it filled me with true understanding. Every lesson I had about boxing made sense. I took a deep breath, and something clicked. </p><p>Warmth and pain filled my muscles in equal amount, but after the effect of the pill, it was easier to ignore. I continued to go through basic patterns again and again, and I felt another click, then another…</p><p>It was midnight when I stopped. I was tired and sweaty, hungrier than ever. Yet, I felt stronger than ever as well. I eyed a rock, one that must have weight at least two hundred pounds. A weight I could handle as a deadlift, but barely. Yet, when I grabbed and lifted it. It weighed nothing. </p><p>“I’m a superhero,” I said, then sniffed. “A smelly one,” I added. I smelled bad, far more than I expected, even after exercising for several hours. I grabbed the stick and started walking around the hill. My earlier fears about finding my way during the night faded, as the moon was bright enough to illuminate my path. </p><p>Even better, despite being barefoot, my feet didn’t hurt anymore, allowing me to move far faster. And, once I dashed, I felt my old sprinting techniques coming back in a way I never felt before. They were perfect. Better than perfect, even. </p><p>After some searching, I found a nice little spring, and washed myself. There were several plants next to the spring, but since I did not know whether they were poisonous, I didn’t dare to eat them, even if my hunger felt like it was digging through my stomach. </p><p>I washed the cloak, though its impossibly soft texture didn’t surprise me after punching for half a day gave me superpowers. </p><p>Instead, I let the spring water cover me while I enjoyed the rest. Soon, I lay on my back, treating the cold water as a bed. It felt weird, but somehow, I balanced perfectly for it to feel natural enough to fall asleep. </p><p>It was certainly more comfortable than bare ground. </p>
