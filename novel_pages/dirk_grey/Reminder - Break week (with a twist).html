        <p>Hi guys, once again, we have 5 Sundays, so I was supposed to be taking the next week off. </p><p>I will be doing that ... with a twist. I'll have several more chapters of Freeloader Cultivator as a bonus. I plan to post at least 8 chapters next week, though depending on my productivity, the number could be even higher. </p>
