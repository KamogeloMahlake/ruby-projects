        <p>Hi guys, I just wanted to tell that there will be no update the next week, because it's yet another month with five Sundays, meaning I managed to earn another week of break, which is convenient because I have another annoying travel schedule for my work. </p><p>And I hope you guys enjoyed my updates. </p>
