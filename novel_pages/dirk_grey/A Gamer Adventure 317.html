        <p>Oeyne moaned into my mouth as I kissed her aggressively, giving her exactly what she needed. I was tempted to quicken her bonding process with her Divine Spark, but after a momentary consideration, I decided against it. </p><p>I wasn’t entirely sure about the full range of methods the Eternals possessed, and I wasn’t ready to reveal my hand to improve Oeyne’s merging while she was holding a position where she could be easily caught. </p><p>So, instead of staying focused on the magical side of things, I focused on the physical aspects of our fun. Another flare of mana, and her hands were bound behind her. She tried to break them … but even with her increased strength, they didn’t budge. </p><p>There were benefits to near-infinite mana. </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me great Oeyne is afraid of a little magic,” I teased her between kisses, knowing she enjoyed the mocking just as much as her helpless position. </p><p>“Coward. Why don’t you show me exactly what you’re capable of,” she answered, already getting in the mood. </p><p>“As long as you can handle a little pain,” I said with a chuckle as I tightened the hold even more even as I grabbed her leather apron, ripping it as easily as it was paper, leaving her only wearing her shirt … a shirt she had already unbuttoned, revealing her beautiful breasts. </p><p>“Bring it on—” she moaned, which was interrupted by a slap to her beautiful breasts, making her moan desperately. </p><p>“Oh, that’s it? A little pain, and you’re not even able to finish your sentence,” I mocked, even though I was very much aware it was not the pain that made her pain … well, at least not directly. </p><p>“Arrogant bastard —” she moaned, once again interrupted by another moan, this time by a twist of her nipple leaving her equally helpless. Fascinatingly beautiful, almost as beautiful as the pained gasp that followed when I forced her off the couch and onto her knees without a warning, her magical chains extending to her legs to make sure she couldn’t get free.</p><p>She tried to free herself, but no matter how strong her new Divine Spark-enhanced body was, it wasn’t enough to break through my magical restraints with physical force. </p><p>I let her struggle as I conjured a blade, carefully cutting every piece of clothing she wore while she struggled against the bindings, each helpless moment making her turn even more desperate and aroused.  </p><p>“Feel free to beg for help if you’re feeling distressed. I’m sure someone will bother to save you,” I teased. </p><p>“Never,” she whispered back throatily. “If I’m defeated, I deserve my punishment.” </p><p>I chuckled as I grabbed her chin, and raised her head. “You deserve it indeed,” I said as I kissed her once again, enjoying the way her tongue danced … getting more and more desperate each second, clearly wanting me to continue. “Maybe I should leave you like this and leave. A day or two like this should be an excellent punishment.” </p><p>“N-no,” she said, shivering in real fear, clearly not ready for it. Certainly not after such a long time apart. “Please.” </p><p>Luckily for her, I had no intention of doing that either. It would simply be mean. “Why don’t you show me exactly what are you willing to do to get away from it, then,” I said as I pushed down my pants, revealing my erection. </p><p>“Whatever you want—” she started, only to be interrupted again, this time physically as I pushed forward hard enough to invade her throat. Happy with the sudden interruption, her tongue danced even as I  grabbed her head, assisting her with the movement of her head, each push bringing her closer to a climax with a shocking rapid speed. </p><p>Her happiness with the rough treatment was obvious from the way her tongue danced despite the challenging situation, swirling around my girth repeatedly. It earned a grunt from me even as my hand tightened around her hair. She hadn’t bothered to shape it up while forging, keeping it in a simple ponytail, which allowed me to pull it easily to use it as a handle. </p><p>Her beautiful bosom heaved repeatedly as I invaded her throat mercilessly, going deeper and deeper into her throat. “Divinity suits you,” I said even as I felt our connection getting stronger once more … and this time without an external System as a bridge. </p><p>Though, I could feel that there was a difference between her connection and the others, it was merely a flicker compared to the bonfire of the others. </p><p>The reason wasn’t hard to discover. Her power. She didn’t even properly complete the first step to Godhood, let alone actually establish her domain … and the difference from it was incredibly different. </p><p>Even as I enjoyed her throat, I wondered what would be the better choice for her. A domain that was similar to Helga's, where she could just focus on her craft with little responsibility or a full domain. </p><p>However, as I looked down, watching her enthusiastic expression, and compared it to earlier where I discussed the potential strategies against the Eternals, the answer was clear. </p><p>A small domain was the best for her … and even then, I was afraid that I would still be the one to truly manage the other blacksmiths. Luckily, unlike Helga, whose Spark was very difficult conceptually, Oeyne’s Spark of Forging was … for the lack of a better term, straightforward. </p><p>With that small challenge resolved, I decided to turn my attention to the next stage. I continued to push forward, invading her throat as she choked and gagged, enjoying her punishment.</p><p>She was magnificent. </p><p>“That’s enough playing,” I suddenly said as I lifted her and threw her on the couch, her face burying against the soft surface, her plump ass ready for my attention. And, since her arms were still bound behind her, I had a perfect leverage to hold.  </p><p>“Yes, fuck me,” she moaned immediately ... once again pushing her luck. She was lucky that I missed her after such an extended forced separation. </p><p>I grabbed her bound hands with one hand, and put the other on her hips, enjoying her excited shivers. It was good to see I wasn’t the only one that missed her.</p><p>I sank down slowly, enjoying her naked wetness as she clamped around. “Oh, I missed you,” I whispered as I disappeared halfway inside. With her face buried, I wasn’t able to see her face, but I didn’t need that to read her reaction … particularly her charged moan. </p><p>“I missed you as well—” she tried to respond, but I chose that moment to bury myself even deeper. I rather have her moans showing me just how much she missed me. They were far more honest. She just moaned, her voice thick with desire.</p><p>My own grunts mixed with her moans, and soon, another instrument joined the mix. My hand, landing on her ass, spanking repeatedly… </p><p>It was a good feeling, to ping her down to let our bodies get familiar once more, impaling like a steady warrior. She didn’t say anything, already too far gone in pleasure, her moans trembling, her breathing uneven. </p><p>A few more seconds, and she climaxed. </p><p>However, that didn’t make me stop. On the contrary, I was able to push even more. Her expression twisted with pleasure, but despite her overwhelming pleasure, she was able to handle it easily. </p><p>Understandable, as forging was traditionally connected with long hours of work, which came with the advantage of endurance. Not as much as the other benefits, but still enough to allow her to resist the overwhelming pleasure. </p><p>“Oeyne, are you sure you don’t need rest. You look exhausted,” I said, teasing her even as I drilled her aggressively. </p><p>“N-not at all. Feel free to continue,” she said, unable to keep her voice from trembling. After all, enduring the endless pleasure was one thing, but hiding the impact of it was something else. </p><p>“Good, then you don’t mind discussing our plans for the future,” I said, not even slowing down as I pushed her toward another climax. </p><p>“O-of course not,” she answered. Her answer didn’t surprise me, as she had always been stubborn. </p><p>“Good…” I said, and started giving her a very lengthy explanation about Divine Domains and how they could be established. Not exactly a simple topic to understand even under the best of circumstances … but the fact I continued to drill her without a pause all the while made it even more challenging. “You understood that, right?” I said. </p><p>“O-of course,” she whispered, her voice more certain than I expected … but then I realized that I might have been mistaken about the improvement from her status, somewhere between Demigod and a Goddess, and unlike Mariel that had been fighting to contain it, she had no problem. </p><p>Helga had problems as well, but considering her irregular type of spark, it was easier to guess exactly what had gone wrong. </p><p>It gave me hope about Cornelia, Marianne, and Titania, as all three had standard skill load-outs, similar to Oeyne. </p><p>“Since you understand the choice you have in front of you, I can leave and start on the other parts of the plan. I hope it’s alright,” I said. </p><p>Only for her legs to wrap around me. “Not before you finish what you started,” she said, wrapping her legs around me. </p><p>“As you wish,” I chuckled. </p><p>After all, I still had several minutes … or hours, I corrected as I looked at her expression, as determined as it was euphoric.</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 115</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge}</p>
