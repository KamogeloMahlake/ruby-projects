        <p>It was amusing to watch the expression of dazed arousal on Sapphire’s face, and I was tempted to continue playing with her softly while teasing her about her new habit. </p><p>Unfortunately, that wasn’t as tempting as impaling her mercilessly to cure my throbbing shaft. A flick was enough to reveal my raging erection, then I grabbed her hips and pulled her to my lap, impaling her with one smooth move. Her lack of underwear made the move even more convenient. </p><p>Her beautiful blue eyes widened in shock as my girth invaded her tunnel, stretching it to comfortably allow my presence, though, despite the surprise assault, it had gone unexpectedly smoothly, thanks to her spectacular wetness after the earlier climax. </p><p>“What are you doing-” she tried to gasp, only for me to seal her lips with a searing kiss. The sudden intimacy shocked her even more than my shaft invading her depths, freezing her momentarily even as my tongue invaded her mouth, freely roaming in the depths of her mouth, while my hands nonchalantly gripped her ass cheeks.</p><p>“Marvelous, Sapphire,” I murmured after I pulled back, though my hands moved back and forth, making her move across my shaft. </p><p>Her expression of confusion was simply beautiful. Intellectually, she obviously hated the situation she was in, being fucked once again by a lowly merchant —at least to her knowledge— was bad enough, but doing that while dressed as a slutty maid clearly made it much worse. </p><p>However, carnally, her reaction was the complete opposite. The backlash of her own spells had already triggered her body’s reaction to an amazing degree, but even that was eclipsed by the surprise orgasm, triggered by the spank she had received, unearthing a secret desire. </p><p>“You’re a … a… brute!” she gasped in shock as our eyes met, all the while continuing to impale her. </p><p>“Really, my dear Queen, it that the best insult you can come up with,” I answered, even as I brought one of my hands to her cleavage, pulling hard to rip her costume, freeing one of her tits. Then, I leaned down, kissing the large expanse aggressively enough to leave a hickey behind. </p><p>“I have never denied being a brute, after all. I’m a working man, not a silver-spooned noble. And in my line of work, you either learn to take whatever presented, or you end up as a loser.” I smirked before kissing her again, leaving her mouth open in shock, which was rather amusing considering I was continuously impaling her as I talked. “And with your beautiful lips presented conveniently, how can I resist stealing another taste.” </p><p>She opened her mouth to answer, but at the same time, I brought my hand back to her hips, using it as leverage to increase my speed further. And since her arousal was already to an unbearable point, it wasn’t a surprise when her words disappeared in a chain of moans as she threw her head back. Instead, I lowered my head down, my face disappearing in her cleavage. </p><p>Her hands landed on my shoulders, but surprisingly, she didn’t use it to free herself, instead of using it to balance herself. If I hadn’t watched her desperate masturbation following the events of the previous evening, I might have been surprised with the sudden shift, but with that information, the only thing that surprised me was the quickness of her surrender. Even with all the advantages, I did expect her to resist the call of pleasure for a few more minutes. </p><p>Instead, with every passing minute, she started to get more and more at ease on my lap, moaning louder as my fingers dug deeper into her flesh. At one point, she even grabbed her own costume and pushed it down, removing the last scrap of coverage for her breasts, freeing me to enjoy their spectacular expanse, pale and perky. </p><p>“So, about the business discussion,” I asked mockingly. “Do you want to stop and talk about it, or do you want to leave it after we finish.” </p><p>Her reaction surprised me. I expected her to either accept the opportunity to discuss, using her willpower to suppress her desire, or order me to continue to protect her last scrap of dignity, trying to act like she was in control. So, I was rather shocked when she met her gaze, her blue eyes looking at me beggingly with a weak vulnerability that reminded me of the Princess. Apparently, for all her strength, she wasn’t completely free of the desire to submit. It just took a while to unearth it. </p><p>Pity that she was strong enough to bury that desire when there was sufficient enough time to calm down. </p><p>Luckily, I have a whole night to enjoy her excitement. </p><p>As I pushed inside her repeatedly, enjoying her naked moans, too lost in her pleasure to even ignore the fact that she was dressed as a lowly maid, not reacting —other than letting out delicious moans— as my fingers danced over her ass and her thighs. “Move your hips more enthusiastically,” I reminded her even as I spanked their great expanse. “You’re a dancer, prove just how good of a dancer you are.”  </p><p>“You’re a brute,” she repeated, but that didn’t prevent her hips from picking up speed. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured in appreciation. “I can see why the audience loves you. How a hotblooded male could deny the beauty of those hips.” </p><p>She growled in anger, but lost in the flow of the moment. She realized she was getting lost in the moment, but as the pleasure built up more and more, even the slightest objection was getting impossible to achieve. I decided to push even more. </p><p>“That’s enough for this position. Stand up, go toward the bed,” I ordered even as I slapped her ass once again. </p><p>“Right now?” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Yes, do it,” I ordered, much to her shock. “I want your famous hips dancing in front of me.” </p><p>“As you wish,” she gasped, but she looked extremely put off as she said so. She pulled out, leaving my shaft throbbing freely, still glistening with her juices, while she tried to stand on her trembling legs. She held the nearby chair first, before starting to walk forward the huge bed in the room.</p><p>After a few steps, she managed to stop her legs from trembling, replacing them with a delicious swing. Her skirt was too short to hide her hips during such a move, creating a delicious view, tempting me to follow her. But I stayed on my seat and watched, while she danced toward with deliberate slowness, her aura of seduction peaking. The more she danced, the more confident she looked, believing she was taking back control. </p><p>I was more than happy to disabuse her from that particular notion even as she reached for the bed, about to climb on. “Don’t step on the bed. A maid like you doesn’t deserve to sit on the bed. Just keep your hands on the edge, and bend over,” I ordered even as I stood up, my erection pointing at her glistening entrance. </p><p>“You dare,” she gasped in shock, but that didn’t prevent her from following my order. She leaned against the bed, her elbows on the bed to support her stance, while her legs straightened, the position showing her plump ass in the best possible position. </p><p>“I dare,” I said even as I stood behind her, letting my fingers caress her entrance. “Now, part your legs. I want to fuck you properly.” </p><p>“I’ll make sure you die a painful death,” she gasped, but clearly, it was for her own benefit, allowing her to delude herself that she was still resisting, something her enthusiastic speed as she parted her leg didn’t support. </p><p>I put my hands on her hips with a deliberate slowness before I positioned myself to enter her once more. It wasn’t the first time I was entering her warmth, but bending her in front of a bed like an actual maid taken by her lord felt extremely amazing. I grunted helplessly as I pushed forward, enjoying the way she clamped around.  </p><p>While she moaned helplessly, my hands clutched her hips as I thrust rhythmically into her, trying to touch unexplored depths as every push made my shaft disappear completely, forcing her to reshape with my invasion. “Damn, I still can’t believe how tight you are,” I gasped even as I spanked her ass, every touch making her moan helplessly, driving her to abandon even the fake resistance she tried to use to convince herself. She just moaned. </p><p>I felt hypnotized, pushing inside her again and again, forcing her tits to dangle freely while she hovered over the bed, but not touching other than her elbows. Her ass and thighs jiggled with each thrust as her body moved forward and back in rhythm to my relentless fucking, changing only when I spanked her ass. </p><p>Finally, her arousal hit an unbearable limit. “Oh, yes,” she moaned as I impaled her mercilessly, losing herself in the moment, readily matching my limit whenever I changed it. </p><p>“You love this, don’t you, slut?” I said, enjoying her endless moans. “I bet that for the last decade, you dreamed nothing but a strong man to bend you over just like you deserved. Maybe I should just bend you over your throne to properly teach you.” </p><p>“Please do, sir,” she gasped deliriously, well past her limit to understand the implications of her words. </p><p>I laughed even as I continued to push forward without skipping a beat. “Don’t forget what you promised,” I said. I just said to mock her, but it would be a lie to say that I wasn’t extremely aroused by imagining myself in her throne room, pushing her against her throne, still wearing her crown but nothing else as I repeatedly pumped inside her. </p><p>The rush from that moment, combined with her delicious tightness, was enough to trigger my climax. “Take it, you whore,” I exclaimed as I exploded inside her, once again marking her mine. </p><p>“Yes, fill me,” she gasped deliriously, climaxing at the same time, pushing her ability to stand to the limit. </p><p>Since I was a nice guy, I pulled out and dragged her to the bed. “You deserve a moment to rest.” </p><p>With that, I lay next to her, enjoying the way her expression shifted as the seconds roll into minutes, from pure bliss to a horrifying realization, understanding just how far she let the moment affect her… </p><p>“So,” I said mockingly. “Are you ready to continue our discussion?” </p>
