        <p>The expression of sheer shock on Sarah’s face was spectacular, the impact enhanced further when her fingers stayed wrapped around my shaft as she shuffled on my knees uncomfortably. More interestingly, her fingers continued to stay in place even as her face cycled between several expressions of shock, trying to process the sudden turn of events, but with an eye-catching success, seconds ticking away. </p><p>While her success in keeping her expression concealed wasn’t eye-catching, some other parts of her definitely were. She slid back slightly as if to pull the rest of her body away from my shaft —despite her hand staying around with absolutely no intention of moving— unaware that doing so created a nice distance between our bodies, which gave me a window to peek down her body. The blanket was still wrapped around her shoulders, leaving her body concealed in shadows, all more beautiful in its mystery. </p><p>I said nothing, just dipped my head down to get a lingering view of her body with no effort to hide my attempt, before meeting her eyes with a quirked eyebrow. The blush that resulted was fantastical, almost as beautiful as her first reaction of covering her body. She slid forward again, her chest pressing against mine, her nipples hard, and her legs trapping my shaft in between, her core brushing just enough to signal her growing arousal. </p><p>Naturally, her new position wasn’t a big help to suppress her blush. </p><p>Another big advantage of the situation was the way Carrie collapsed on the side, trying to catch her breath after our latest explosive hug, meaning she wasn’t exactly in the mood of paying close attention to her friend, and the exact nature of her ordeal in my lap. Under different circumstances, I might have felt a touch more concern before making a move on Sarah, as while Carrie and I were explicitly not dating, there was always a chance that she might object me to being with other girls, especially with a friend. </p><p>After Carrie made said friend climb on my lap repeatedly while she was completely naked, she had lost that consideration. </p><p>“You, her,” she whispered into my ear, not wanting Carrie to hear us. Luckily the music video that was playing was loud enough to run interference —not to mention very distracting as it showed a sexy lady giving a muscular man the time of his life while wearing a swimsuit that as well might not exist— leaving Carrie unaware of her friend’s concerns. </p><p>“Yes, I, her,” I whispered back mockingly even as I slipped one hand underneath her, and without a warning, started caressing her wetness. </p><p>Her eyes widened. “What are you doing!” she gasped louder, enough to alert Carrie. </p><p>“Well, the deal was every repeat I slip a hand underneath,” I said cheekily, which earned an absentminded nod from Carrie, unaware of the true significance of what was happening underneath. “So, unless you’re going to retreat and let Carrie win again…” I said. </p><p>Sarah’s fingers around my shaft loosened like she was about to take my offer, which was a completely rational response. However, Carrie reacted just as quickly as I expected, pouncing on the doubtful expression on Sarah’s face, lost in their weird competition. “Yeah, Sarah, are you going to chicken out?” Carrie murmured in a smugness that I would have never imagined coloring her shy lips. The fact that she let the blanket slip down a bit, still high enough to hide her nipples but low enough to create a scandalously deep cleavage in the process made the impact of her words even stronger. </p><p>It seemed that I once again the lengths women could go in a desire to one-up others, especially two nerdy girls who never had to reason to set limits to their behavior, too convinced of their own undesirability —something I was still having trouble to believe as they rubbed their amazing naked bodies against mine. </p><p>“No, I’m not,” Sarah answered, the hesitation in her tone disappeared like a mirage, leaving its place to a renewed determination, the kind that begged me to grab her hips and slam inside her to test the limits of her decisiveness, a desire that I was barely able to keep back. </p><p>Still, there was a limit to my willpower, and I slipped the tip of a finger inside her, enjoying the way her virgin wetness clamped around. Her eyes widened, but made no move to pull back as my finger started to move, teasing her entrance as her expression grew slowly more intense. She didn’t lose much time before her fingers started to move. </p><p>Carrie watched Sarah’s sudden reemergence of confidence, a suspicious glint on her face, realizing that things were developing to a point she wasn’t expecting. Luckily, one of my hands was idle, so I had no problem of slipping that under the blanket as well, slipping inside her wetness. </p><p>She tried to keep her moan hidden, attempting to conceal her reaction. Unfortunately, her attempts to conceal her reaction didn’t work as well as she intended, not when she was already close to the edge after our latest encounter. The way her blanket slipped lower to reveal her heaving chest while she kept her eyes firmly shut, yet not earning even the slightest reaction as her back arched pushed made it even less convincing. </p><p>Not that her failure gave Sarah any new information. After what she had realized about what was going on during Carrie’s turn on my lap, a little direct teasing was nothing. “She’s a bundle of surprises, isn’t she?” I asked</p><p>“She is,” Sarah murmured barely, her attention split between suppressing her own moans and watching the way Carrie’s tits dangled attractively, the sudden increase of desire in her eyes suggested she wasn’t a hundred percent straight. </p><p>Not that I was surprised by that little nugget. Their little game of one-upmanship made much more sense that way, especially toward the latter half. At least, the way she reacted to my fingers left no doubt about her attraction toward me, which was the most important thing in our weird game. </p><p>I just needed to make sure she surrendered to my seduction before I could enjoy the fruits of her confused attraction toward her friend. </p><p> Thankfully, she was positioned perfectly for me to do so. </p><p>I leaned forward, leveraging our closeness by leaving a trail of kisses on her neck, which made her back arch even more intensely than Carrie. The blanket slipped down, pooling around her waist, not only revealing her perky breasts and tight stomach, but also allowing it to slip even lower on Carrie’s side, revealing a hint of where my fingers had been disappearing repeatedly. </p><p>And, unlike the subtle teasing of a finger Sarah was receiving, Carrie was being finger blasted aggressively, two fingers disappearing into her depths repeatedly, every slam dislodging the blanket even more. </p><p>While Sarah enjoyed the show, my lips traveling higher with each kiss. Soon, I was trailing the edge of her chin softly while she lost her ability to keep her moans. Not that it mattered, because Carrie wasn’t too far behind, too lost in the pleasure to care the way the game had devolved into the beginning stages of a much dirtier, yet much more fun, activity. </p><p>Soon, her moans exploded, mixing with Sarah’s tenser moans. That made Sarah’s eyes widen and her moist lips part, realizing that things were soon arriving at the point of no return. The way the desire shone in her eyes suggested that she was dying to let things continue, but her fears were getting stronger. </p><p>I decided to boost her courage in the most interesting way possible. I leaned to capture her lips. I didn’t do it aggressively, nor I did grab her waist, giving her ample time to pull back if that was what she truly desired, but she was unable to resist the desire to feel my touch more intimately. </p><p>Also, her hand around my shaft, steadily caressing up and down, ever slowed down. The kiss was slow, lingering, completely in contrast with the moans Carrie was letting out repeatedly next to us, lost in pleasure as she started to move steadily toward a climax, the sensitivity of her body turning it into sweet torture for her. </p><p>Our kiss lingered on the backdrop of the music Carrie created, with her making absolutely no move to stop. Only when I pulled back, she suddenly realized the position we were in, pulling one arm around her naked breasts. A rather empty gesture, especially when she still kept her other hand around my shaft like it was glued there. “Come on, sweetie. Isn’t it a bit late to be self-conscious about your nakedness, not that you have anything to be self-conscious about? You have an amazing body.”</p><p>The casual compliment brought a deep blush to her face, more intense than the fact she was still being fingered softly by me, or the full nakedness of Carrie after the blanket fell on the floor during our kiss. “It’s too much. I need to dress and go,” she stated. </p><p>“If you prefer so,” I said with a throaty whisper. There was nothing preventing her from standing up, but with gaze dancing between Carrie’s distracted state and her own hand’s rebellion, she made no move to actually pull back. Her arm around her chest was her only attempt to exert her modesty, which, under the circumstances, was worse than useless. It only made her sexier. </p><p>I waited a few seconds to see whether she would follow her request, but seeing that she just waited with her beautifully parted lips, I leaned forward, capturing them in another kiss, this time more intense, almost searing. “I need to go,” she repeated after I pulled for a breather, which was weak even compared to her earlier noncommittal statement.</p><p>It was a weak, trembling statement, more effective as a statement to make me to slip inside her and graduate her into the status of ex-virgin. She said it because it needed to be said, so that later on, she could rationalize the moment in her mind that she was a passive participant. A symbolic gesture of pride if nothing else before she lost herself in the delicious orgy she so clearly wanted.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, I was just bastard enough to make her utter her desires first.  </p><p>“You can always go after resting a bit to catch your breath,” I answered, even as I slipped my fingers deeper into her for a few more quick pumps, which effectively stole her ability to argue back. When I pulled them out and grabbed her waist, her every single hint of hesitancy disappeared, her face invaded by pure desire. She was ready for it... </p><p>Which was why she was surprised when I used the leverage to lift her to leave her sitting on the other end of the coach, her naked body in display perfectly rather than taking the last step. “I shouldn’t push you while you make such a monumental decision,” I said magnanimously. </p><p>It would have been a beautiful gesture if I hadn’t suddenly stood up and pushed Carrie on the couch, laying her on her back, her amazing body fully in the display while I took position between her legs, readily parted. The fact that Carrie’s head was resting on Sarah’s thighs, whose eyes were popped open as she realized what I had in mind while I waited for her to decided. </p><p>“A demonstration might help you make an informed decision,” I said smugly even as I aligned my shaft with Carrie’s entrance, ready to plunge… </p>
