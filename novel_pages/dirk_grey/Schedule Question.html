    <body>
        <p>Hello, everyone. </p><p>I have a quick question. For the next month, there's a chance that I'll have a more lenient schedule, which might mean 4 chapters instead of three for the general tier. </p><p>If this happens <em>(which, unfortunately, kind of depends on the decision of my boss about the schedule)</em> what woud be your preference. (Another qualifier, it also depends the inspiration, so I can't give a 100$ guarantee that I'll follow the result. But I'll try to.)</p>
