        <p>Erin was already having a bad day when she had been interrupted by an uninvited guest. </p><p>As a retired professional athlete — early due to injuries — she was supposed to be enjoying the true peak of her life. After all, she had made millions during her career. She had the ambition to create an even better career. </p><p>Unfortunately, it turned out that, all her experience in sports didn’t translate to a successful business. It wasn’t enough that she was penniless, but the business was losing money. So, she either needed to stop … or find an investor. </p><p>The client she had today, Fatima Shah, had the potential to be the latter. Erin had done her research, and learned that she was a multi-millionaire widow that had just moved around, and she paid for her most expensive package without blinking. </p><p>Now, Erin was hoping that she would invest so that she could inject some cash into the business. As for selling it completely, she didn’t even consider it. She was not a quitter. She was a champion. She just didn’t fail. </p><p>It was the reason why she was annoyed when a man she didn’t recognize entered the place, dressed in exercise clothes. The reception upstairs had strict orders not to let anyone in. </p><p>“Can I help you?” she started, doing her best not to start shouting at him for interrupting, and only because she didn’t want to scare Fatima. </p><p>Before she could answer, her prospective business partner spoke. “Darion, what are you doing here?” </p><p>“I promised to help you with your workout. Don’t you remember?” he said. </p><p>“So, you’re a private trainer,” Erin said. </p><p>“Oh, something like that,” he answered with a cocky smile. At first, Erin assumed it was the usual competitiveness of the athletes, especially against a woman. However, when she heard Fatima’s mortified cough she realized that it was something different. </p><p>That surprised Erin. Fatima looked far too shy to have a boy toy. She decided to tease her a bit. “Oh, my dear client. So you think I’m not enough for you.” </p><p>“O-of course not, it’s not like that,” she explained hurriedly, mortified. Erin knew that teasing her was wrong, but watching her flounder was just too entertaining. </p><p>“But it looks like that,” Erin said as she crouched down to hide her snicker — well, also, maybe, just a bit, to get a better view of Darion’s muscles as he started doing push-ups, as if he was trying to prove that he was a PT. </p><p>Maybe she had been distracted with the work too much and would have no fun if she reacted to his presence like that. </p><p>“Calm down, just kidding,” Erin said. “Tell you what. I’m going to have a quick lunch and return. Why don’t you check the place with your trainer, and make sure it’s as good as I promised.”</p><p>Of course, Erin had a better idea. Fatima might be shy, but Darion didn’t look like a man who would be afraid of a little public fun. Erin would disappear for a moment, then return … catching them in the act. </p><p>Fatima was too shy not to be unaffected by that during the negotiation. </p><p>She crouched down, peeking from the corner to get a glimpse. Not because she expected them to start quickly, but to get a better sense of when to return. She couldn’t return too early, which would be useless. But, she was afraid of being too late and catching them naked. </p><p>That would just send Fatima away running, which was not what she wanted. </p><p>She watched as Darion put his arm around her waist and dragged her. From the intensity of her whimper, Darion wasn’t particularly gentle either. Erin would be lying if she said she didn’t feel her blood flowing faster. </p><p>However, she was surprised by Darion’s next move. He pressed her against the leg raise machine, locking her in place. “Darion, she might come any moment,” she said.</p><p>Erin prepared to intervene. A minute should be enough to —</p><p>And, just like that, she lost her chance. Darion pulled Fatima’s shorts without warning, and before Erin could react, her legs were already around his shoulder. It was already too late. </p><p>She couldn’t just go and catch them. </p><p>At that moment, she should just leave … but then, Fatima started moaning as Darion ate her, showing that he wasn’t a slouch when it came to pleasuring a lady. No wonder a rich woman like Fatima kept him as a boy toy. </p><p>A man that looked like that, yet actually worked for her pleasure…</p><p>Erin could feel warmth pooling between her legs as she watched him eat her to a rapid climax. “Please, faster,” Fatima begged again and again as his tongue invaded her, her body rocking. </p><p>However, when she was hit with a climax, Erin assumed it would be the end. After all, Fatima was the boss, and he was the boy toy. She doubted Fatima would bother paying back. </p><p>Well, it turned out her read on their dynamic might have been inaccurate, and Fatima suddenly ended up on his lap, immobilized. “Darion, please, she can return any moment,” she whispered.</p><p>“Well, then you better pay back quickly, mistress,” he answered. Erin didn’t miss the sarcastic tone in the last word. Erin couldn’t help but pull her top slightly to the side. With her nipples getting hard, it was getting uncomfortable. </p><p>Darion was even more aggressive than she expected, pulling off Fatima’s top directly, leaving her wearing only shoes. It meant, that if someone walked in, Fatima wouldn’t have any chance to fix her clothing. </p><p>A spectacular show … getting even better. Erin bit her lips, and watched…</p>
