        <p>Hi, everyone. I have another surprise book release. This time, the second book for my superhero driven sci-fi/fantasy world.</p><p><a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1118541" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1118541</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>As I mentioned before, the reason I'm publishing this book in Smashwords instead of Patreon is the possible content guidelines. Smashwords has looser guidelines for certain topics. Just in case. </p><p>Also, this book is approximately the double the size of the first one, which had been a rightful point of complaint. The current one something like fifteen patreon releases, arranged into twelve chapters. But still, it's the same price, so a definite bargain (wink wink).</p><p>Feel free to share your comments here. <strong>But don't forget to leave a review, both for this, and the firstone. I can't overstate just how important reviews are for a writer struggling for reach. </strong></p>
