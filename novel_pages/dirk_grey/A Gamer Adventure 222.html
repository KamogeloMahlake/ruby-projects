        <p> Sleeping in a decadently comfortable bed was certainly an enjoyable experience, something that I had enjoyed greatly since my experience had reached a point of great success. </p><p>In comparison, the current bed I had been sleeping in, which was more of a bare cot that even a servant would feel insulted to use, was supposed to be an annoying downgrade. Clearly, the spell I used to transform it had been dispelled. </p><p>I guessed Mariel was responsible for it. Not intentionally, but the integration of her Divine Spark resulted in occasional flares of her mana, and dispelled it. </p><p>Not that it disappointed me. The enjoyment of a soft bed was nothing compared to the great warmth of Mariel’s beautiful wings. </p><p>Which was why I woke up immediately as I felt those wings shuffling around me, pulling back halfway, too smooth and deliberate to be just a sleep reaction. </p><p>My dear headmistress was awake. </p><p>Not only I kept my gaze shut, but also applied my extensive abilities to give her the impression that I was still sleeping — which was not unbelievable considering just how much physical effort I had expanded and how much mana I spent in the process of keeping her happy. </p><p>And kept her happy, I did even as I finally broke her centuries-long dry streak in a very memorable manner. </p><p>I was curious how she would react while thinking I was still asleep. </p><p>Without the mind-numbing pleasure that impaired her sound decision-making capabilities, I expected her to slide away, and thought that the question was whether she would maintain enough presence of mind to do slowly, without ‘waking’ me up, or she would pull back with enough speed to force me to abandon my fake-sleep ploy. </p><p>She had just the virginity that she had been maintaining for centuries. An exaggerated reaction was not exactly unexpected. </p><p>Yet, she surprised me by not picking either of those options.</p><p>At first, her wings continued to pull back, giving me the impression that she would pick the first option, yet, that movement was soon arrested. And even better, after a few more seconds passed, it reversed, once again tightly wrapping around me. </p><p>The warmth and comfort radiation from them as they slowly wrapped around me was beautiful, tempting me to go back to sleep. I fully intended to follow that temptation, but soon, a contradicting message arrived, arresting my slow descent to unconsciousness. </p><p>It was her finger, moving on my chest. </p><p>It wasn’t a hard or painful touch. On the contrary, it was a weak one, soft enough to be written off as nonexistent, as heavy and permanent as a dream, existing only for a second before disappearing.</p><p>That disappearance didn’t last forever, and a minute later, her finger landed on my chest once more, this time staying a little more before pulling back. </p><p>I lost count of how many times she repeated that, but with each repeat, the time between her touches got shorter, and her touches lingered more. </p><p>The duration wasn’t the only thing that changed. The pressure her finger generated increased accordingly, from lighter than a feather to a noticeable caress as she traced my chest muscles, her fascination impossible to be mistaken. </p><p>I still had a lot of things to do, but wrapped in the wings of an angel, I was feeling rather decadent — not to mention curious about just how far she would push. Considering her hesitant start, I guessed that my abs would be her limit. </p><p>The answer turned out to be more than that. She first climbed to my shoulders then shifted to my arms, continuing to trace my muscles, then slipped down to my abs. There, she spent less time than I had been expecting, continuing to slip lower. </p><p>Dragging along my erection, shocking me with her daring. I didn’t expect her to leverage the benefits of her new situation that quickly. </p><p>Though, the moment she touched my full erection — as it should be considering I was sharing the bed with a naked angel — I felt a great shock, though it was not as great as when, rather than pulling back, she stayed on, moving back and forth. </p><p>Soon, her finger was joined by a second one, and a couple seconds later, her palm joined the fray. </p><p>My acting ability was my savior as her hands moved up and down on my shaft, allowing me to hide the signs of both the surprise I felt and the arousal that was steadily growing. </p><p>Admittedly, it was not exactly the best handjob I had received, with its uneven pacing and unnecessary tightness, but that didn’t prevent me from enjoying it immensely — and her fumbling that highlighted her lack of experience gave me much more pleasure than a skilled handjob. </p><p>Opening my eyes and greeting her was tempting, but not as tempting as just how long she would stay there, exploring the unfamiliar texture of my length. </p><p>I stayed there, waiting until she stopped while I enjoyed the amazing warmth of her wings, enjoying the soft nature of the light that infused my body — though I had to maintain a thin layer of light mana inside myself to prevent that from turning into something more painful. </p><p>Even in its calmest state, the light was destructively burning.  </p><p>Her hand stayed in place for several minutes. Soon, I realized her movement getting even choppier, but the only struggle that was created was to make me feel the challenge of forcing it down. </p><p>I felt curious about her actions. I needed to keep my eyes closed, but with my magical sensitivity, it wasn’t as big of a problem as it would have been a couple months ago. Especially since Mariel was an intensely magical being, her natural light mana radiating off her body without her robe to block it. </p><p>And, by focusing on the radiance, I could ‘see’  her movements without opening my eyes. Of course, it wasn’t a perfect view, as, ironically, the intensity of her glow made it very hard for me to pick the details, but I could still notice the broad strokes. </p><p>Like the fact that her hands were dancing on her breasts repeatedly. </p><p>Holding back my smirk was an even bigger challenge than hiding my challenge to her clumsy handjob — especially since, unlike a blowjob, enthusiasm was definitely not a replacement for actual skill — but I managed to keep it down. </p><p>Curious how she would follow. </p><p>Her hand soon pulled away from her chest and landed back on mine, caressing my skin once again, treating exploring my body more important than enhancing her own pleasure. </p><p>Soon, her free hand slipped down to my thighs, but then she chose to push them to the side. I didn’t want to wait for long to learn about that. The familiar weight of her breasts pressing against my legs was indicative enough that she wanted to get a closer look at my shaft. </p><p>As she waited there, I assumed that it was the extent of her ambition. But then, her fingers wrapped around once more, this time dancing gently as if she wanted to see its reaction rather than giving a handjob. </p><p>It was a much more pleasant feeling, especially with her tits pressing to my legs. I took the risk of cracking my eyes, only to see her face scrunched in intense concentration. It would have been just cute if it wasn’t for her wings, spread on her back, twitching with her every move — yet the way they throbbed with magic was more than enough to remind me that they were not just nice-looking accessories, but the representation of her power. </p><p>The power that just enhanced significantly after the last night’s adventure where I helped her to finally bond with her Light Spark. Yet, interestingly, she was more fascinated by the process she attained rather than the result, considering she preferred to molest me rather than wake me up so that she could ask some more questions about how that was possible. </p><p>I wouldn’t have answered them, of course, but her preference was interesting nonetheless. </p><p>I didn’t keep my eyes open, but I managed to sneak occasional glances without alerting her, each repeat showing a growing excitement as she started to abandon her awkwardness and embraced the erotic nature of the situation. </p><p>It was nothing compared to what we had been doing the previous night, but the fact she was taking initiative made it even tastier... </p><p>Soon, she started moving up and down with surprising fluidity, suggesting she was not aware of her own movement, especially since the exaggerated movement would have been enough to wake me up if I had been actually asleep. </p><p>I continued to relax in her bed, the comfort of my blanket more than enough to compensate for the lumpy coat underneath. Meanwhile, the movement range of her fingers got larger, climbing high enough to graze the crown, dipping down to touch the base, and even leaving a lingering touch on my balls. </p><p>Just as I thought it would be the end, she managed to surprise me once more. </p><p>In the form of her beautiful lips, parting in preparation…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>
