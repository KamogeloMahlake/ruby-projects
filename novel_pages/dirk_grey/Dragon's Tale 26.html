        <p>“No, what?” I asked even as I watched her hands dance over her shirt, each button revealing more of her deliciously pale skin, still pristine despite the days we had spent under the sun. </p><p>“No, as in that wasn’t the reward,” she answered with a smug smirk, like the ones I had always sent her way, however, behind that, I can see a soft trembling. She wasn’t as confident as she wanted to portray. “It was just a warm-up.” </p><p>“Really,” I said with a matching smirk, not pointing at her sudden display of fragility. If she wanted to act braver, it wasn’t my place to discuss, especially when she was providing me with such a beautiful distraction, especially when she started to sway to imaginary music as she removed her shirt. It got even better when her hands reached to her pants, pushing them down with one smooth movement that fit perfectly to her dance. </p><p>I could feel my heartbeat picking up speed as she danced, unable to believe the seductive atmosphere she was able to create with just a sway of her hips. Her noble training naturally included dancing, but I had no idea that it could be converted to something like that. “Damn, it’s nice,” I moaned. “Where did you learn that?” </p><p>“One of my maids growing up was an ex-pleasure slave, and she thought it to me, suggesting that it might help me keep my man under control,” she said smugly even as her hands slowly traveled to her bra, gently caressing her belly enticingly on the way. She leaned down, her smile wider. At that moment, I wasn’t sure which was more attractive, her amazing cleavage, or her smile.  “Is it working?” </p><p>“Oh, honey. It’s definitely working,” I answered. “You have captured me, and I’m at your mercy.” </p><p>“Good,” she said as her hands suddenly found my shoulders and she pushed me until I was pressing against the tree. I said nothing, as I was supremely enjoying the sudden change of dynamic, where she was taking the initiative to seduce me. She sat on my lap, and her hips started to grind. Since my cock was still out, it was only her panties that prevented a naughty accident. </p><p>Despite that, she started rocking on my lap, even though her body continued to sway to the same imaginary melody. When I tried to put my hands on her body, I was dissuaded by a slap, signaling that she wanted to deliver her show without my intervention. It was not a big problem, as I leaned back, enjoying the treatment. Still, when her fingers found the buttons of my shirt, I couldn’t help but remind her. “We don’t have much time.” </p><p>“Make some,” her answer came back, and I could detect a hint of panting in her tone, one that was absent moments ago. Rubbing repeatedly against my hard shaft while enjoying my attention seemed to turn her on. “Tell them that we’re going to delay for another half an hour.” </p><p>It wasn’t the best idea to do so with the mysterious enemy behind us, but unfortunately, it was hard to make rational decisions when I had a barely-dressed sexy blonde on my lap, grinding repeatedly while giving me an excellent dance at the same time. So, I cast a simple spell, and send Astrid a message, telling her that we’re going to delay due to a magical reason, and she should inform the team. </p><p>I kept my eyes closed as I cast the spell. Before I opened them, I felt something wrap around my neck. I opened them, only to see that it was her bra. Using it to support herself, she leaned back, her back arching to put her naked breasts to perfect display, so perfect that I could never get bored of them no matter how many times I had seen them. Using her bra, she pulled herself close, her lips an inch away from my lips, only to stand up suddenly. </p><p>I bit my lips, doing my best not to order her back on my lap. I was already feeling horny due to her dance, and her reckless lapdance pushed it to the next level, but she chose to pull back just as things were getting good. Luckily, it was just the beginning of the show —assuming that’s the reason she asked me to extend our break by another half an hour— so I could temper my desire down temporarily while waiting for the show to pick up speed. </p><p>She didn’t keep me waiting for long. She turned her back, only to slowly lean forward, her legs straight, giving me an excellent show of her tight ass. Even better, she parted her legs slightly after a moment, giving me a glimpse of her nether lips pushing against the fabric of her panties, which was getting slightly see-through thanks to her arousal. When she stood up once more and turned to face me, her arm was around her breasts, hiding them from the view, which somehow added to the sexiness of the moment as she used her free hand to slowly get rid of her last piece of clothing, her lower body twisted strategically to hide it from the view, making my mouth water. </p><p>Then, without fully turning toward me, she moved her hands across her stomach once more, slowly climbing up to cup her breasts as she swayed, twisting her nipples invitingly. When she smiled and seductively raised both her arms over her head, exposing her breasts fully again, I wanted to stand up and take her there.</p><p>She was faster than me. She moved forward, and before I could move, was sitting on my lap once again, this time, her wetness rubbing against my shaft. “That’s a dangerous position,” I reminded her, letting my voice darken a bit, which was a better option than moaning in pleasure as her wetness rubbed against my length. </p><p>“I … know,” she whispered, soft and deliberate, making my shaft harden even more, the fact that her hips were moving faster and faster playing a big role as well. Her next words almost made me explode. “But I don’t care.” </p><p>There was something special at seeing Lillian acting like an exotic dancer that would fit perfectly in the harem of an Eastern Sultan, elegant, cultured, yet willing to do everything to make a man happy. Who knew there was such a gem lying underneath her cold noble identity. And just to make things more interesting, she was getting faster and faster. She captured my lips in a searing kiss while enjoying the treatment I was delivering. </p><p>But then, she surprised me once more. As she continued grinding on my lap as she kissed, but her movements changed. Her confidence slowly evaporated, leaving its place to hesitancy, even though she continued to kiss me. The reason showed itself a moment later, when she pulled higher, and when she lowered, my shaft was aligned against her entrance. “Are you sure?” I asked as I pulled back, her expression flickering. “With your responsibilities…” </p><p>It took almost a minute for her to answer. Emotions flickered in her face, her sense of propriety and responsibility fighting against her desires, all pushed further by the danger we were facing. “I don’t care,” she finally murmured, her words soft but heavier than a mountain. “We can die tomorrow, or worse, get captured. I want to be in control, even for a few minutes.” </p><p>“That’s a bleak estimation of my ability to stay hard,” I said playfully. </p><p>“Jerk, I’m trying to be serious,” she said and slapped my shoulder, but she was laughing as she did so, which dispelled the grim aura of her statement. She said nothing else, and there was nothing to say. She started to lower herself, excitement and fear dancing in her beautiful blue eyes as my shaft was finally enveloped by her tender warmth, only to come to a stop as it hit a barrier, one that she destroyed with one sharp push at the cost of a sharp hiss. </p><p>I kissed her, her tongue jumping out to greet me halfway, delivering a kiss that was more passionate than anything I had experienced. She surrendered herself to me and pleasure at the same time as her hips started to move, forcing her body to adapt to my size. Her movements were still hesitant, but the desire was burning in her eyes, destroying her fears and doubts. </p><p>However, my attention was grabbed by something more important. My magic was reacting. As I finally claimed her virginity, a wave of magic rose instinctively and invaded her body, mingling with her magic. I tried to stop it, but that only lasted for a moment before my instincts overrode me. It was like trying not to breathe, easy at first, but slowly turning impossible as my body overrode my decision. However, instead of happening in minutes, it happened in seconds, my magic mixing with hers. </p><p>Lillian was too distracted by her adventure to notice it, her eyes locked to mine, focusing on slowly riding me as her body got used to my presence. I tried to pull back to say something, but it proved to be impossible when she started another kiss, showing a rare initiative. Under the beautiful assault of her lips, I found myself unable to resist the temptation, not to mention. </p><p>I tried to examine the changes in her magic. which was a rather difficult thing to do with the exquisite distraction I had been struggling with. She kept her lips locked against mine even as she grabbed my wrists and guided my hands to her ass, her hips picking up speed despite the occasionally strained gasps. After a minute, I was able to decipher that whatever happening was not exactly harmful, which was all well, because Lillian that moment to quicken her speed even more, the resulting wave of pleasure thick enough to trigger my instincts. </p><p>A desire exploded in my heart, one that was both foreign and familiar at the same time, telling me to take possession of her for eternity, a call that was hard to resist under the calmest of circumstances, something my situation didn’t qualify. I found myself pushing my hips up to complete her motion. And soon, the pleasure climbed more and more, forcing me to focus on her supple body. </p><p>I pushed deep, and she pulled out of the kiss, her back arching beautifully as she moaned, her voice tickling my insides. A moment later, her lips met with mine again, her tongue dancing in my mouth in a delirious frenzy, picking up speed as I slammed inside her again and again. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one that was having trouble controlling myself. </p><p>I started slamming harder and harder inside her as the signs of her discomfort disappeared, allowing me to enjoy her beauty fully for the first time. She was truly delicious. I pulled out for a moment, and she gasped in protest, only to disappear when I pushed her down on the grass, hovering above her just a moment to enjoy her mussed-up hair and glowing face before slipping inside her, launching a merciless assault that would have alerted half of the forest if it wasn’t for the silencing wards. </p><p>“Harder, faster!” she murmured deliriously even as I slammed. Since I was a thoughtful gentleman, I decided to follow her desires to the letter, and slammed in her even harder, rough enough to make it very hard for her to walk without a healing charm afterward. Her only response was to tighten even more around my girth, elevating both of our pleasure at the same time. </p><p>I could feel my magic following the pattern as I slammed hard, injecting another fresh dose with every slam, coiling around her magic as it slowly infused with hers. However, wrapped in the tightest sensation I had ever felt, pulling out was an impossibility. Not exploding early enough to make her earlier mocking statement true was the most I could do. Her first time deserved better. </p><p>“How about this?” I asked as I continued slamming while bringing one of my hands to her hips, and spanking hard. </p><p>“Oh, yeah!” Lillian moaned loudly, proving that I wasn’t the only one that was lost in the moment. Just as I wanted to invade her and make her mine, she wanted to be annexed. “I want more!”</p><p>I could feel her magic. She wanted to be mine, utterly and completely. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I forced myself to slam even harder, every beat hiding my full length inside her, accompanied by an even-greater surge of magic. When I put my free hand on her breast to dig into her supple flesh and occasionally twist her nipples, I only met with a moan of desire. She opened her mouth once or twice to say something, only to melt in another cry of pleasure.  </p><p>Seconds rolled into minutes as we danced in an animalistic haze, only for her to moan. “Make me yours, fill me,” she said. </p><p>It was an order that was impossible to resist. I exploded, filling her not only with my seed, but also with a raging wave of magic that enveloped her whole body. She moaned deliriously, her eyelids fluttering, but she found enough strength to grab my shoulders and pull me to another kiss, her legs wrapping around to keep me in. I collapsed above her, gently pushing back and forth as I waited for her trembling to subside. </p><p>As we lay, I managed to get a semblance of control over my magic, and started examining the changes in her body, only to see no changes at the first glance, one that would make me think that I hallucinated if it wasn’t for the subtle sense of connection I was feeling, like I could find her even if she was at the other end of the world. </p><p>“Well, that happened,” she murmured after five minutes, still barely able to speak more than a whisper. I could have asked her whether she was comfortable with the decision, but chose to steal a gentle kiss off her cheek. “I’m happy,” she murmured. </p><p>“Good,” I said even as I moved down, stealing a kiss off her neck while making her shiver. “Because we’re going to do that a lot of times.” </p><p>“How about we start it now?” she suddenly said, giving out a crystal laugh as she suddenly forced me to flip, and we ended up in a beautiful cowgirl position, my cock once again hard inside her.</p><p>“We’re going to be late,” I reminded her, but a wide smirk. </p><p>“They can wait,” she answered as her hips started moving, and my magic started to rise once more…  </p>
