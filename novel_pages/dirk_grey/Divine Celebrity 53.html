        <p>Lauren watched her students beat a hasty retreat. </p><p>“So, we’re alone,” I said as I sat in front of Lauren, a teasing smile on my face. “Is there anything you want from me, my dear tutor?” </p><p>It took a few seconds for her to recover enough. “What have you done was wrong,” she said, finally managing to suppress her shock of watching the rest of the team retreat in fear. “You should be nicer to your teammates.” </p><p>“Not unless they actually start working,” I answered with a scoff. “They are adults. They should be responsible enough not to waste anyone’s time, especially someone with actual ambitions rather than just getting a management position in their daddy’s firm. What’s the point of treating them with respect when they don’t respect our time.” </p><p>“Still…” she whispered, but before she could continue, I pressed my fingers to her lips, silencing her, her blush spectacular. Her eyes widened at my touch, which was certainly an overreach even with our flirting, but she was just shy enough to accept that as long as I didn’t push it anymore. </p><p>“Let’s not waste any more time with useless people. So, you’re the new tutor of the team?” I asked. </p><p>“Y-yeah,” she stammered, unable to resist my attempt to change the topic. “The coordinator asked me to volunteer some time to help since I’m already an employee of the college.” </p><p>“Excellent, then, let’s play, two minutes, five seconds follow up,” I said as I pulled the chess set in front of me, and quickly set up the board. Without waiting for a second, I opened with the king-side pawn, and pressed the clock. </p><p>“R-right now?” she stammered. </p><p>“Yes, and your time is ticking out,” I answered, more than happy to ambush her with a quick game, one that she was at a significant disadvantage. </p><p>She tried to respond with a queen-side opening, making a defensive move. Technically, it was not a bad move, a solid defense. </p><p>But it gave me the initiative to attack. </p><p>And, I was just annoying enough to prefer a crazy assault, more than happy to leverage her mistakes. Of course, such an assault was not without its costs, easily destroyed if she changed her strategy into something remotely aggressive to leverage the gaps between my assault. </p><p>But she didn’t, which gave her a defeat before we reached move fifteen. “You need to work on your mindset, you’re still getting flustered too easily, I said. </p><p>“You ambushed me,” she answered, her beautiful face contorted in annoyance. “I would have won if I was calmer.” </p><p>“I know,” I said. “But can you guarantee that you wouldn’t feel flustered once you’re in a big tournament, facing one of the top ten players of the world? An ambush is a good way to simulate your mood.” </p><p>“It’s not the same as an ambush,” she murmured rebelliously, but her voice lacked the necessary conviction. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I whispered. “So, you’re saying that you can handle another source of stress easily.” </p><p>“O-of course,” she stammered, her answer arriving automatically, before she truly understood the carte blanche she gave to me with those words. </p><p>I said nothing as I stood up and walked to the door, which took just a couple steps thanks to the smallness of the room. Yet, rather than leaving, I locked the door before returning to my seat. </p><p>“W-what’s going on?” she stammered. </p><p>“We’re going to play more, but in a way that properly pressurizes you,” I said. “Every loss means a loss of clothing item, until you can’t handle more.” </p><p>“T-that’s nonsense,” she stammered. “I … I won’t undress here, in the middle of the school.” </p><p>I smirked. “So, you don’t have a problem with the plan, just the location?” I asked, which only earned a beautiful blush off her. “Don’t worry, I had checked before. The lock is strong enough to keep intruders away,” I said. </p><p>Then, without waiting for her answer, I quickly set the game again and started, once again playing the white. </p><p>“T-that’s nonsense,” she stammered under my gaze. “I … I won’t play.” </p><p>“You’re losing time,” I said smugly, gesturing at the clock, using the moment to subtly pressure her. </p><p>“Y-you’re a jerk,” she stammered, yet the pressure worked. She reached to make her first move. </p><p>She was even more unsettled than before, making it an easy thing to earn the victory. Luckily for her, while I was a jerk, I still had my limits, and deliberately extended the game without putting her at too much disadvantage, giving her an opportunity to recover. </p><p>And, once she recovered, she demolished me even with the recent improvements in my Traits. </p><p>She was truly amazing. “I … I won,” she stammered victoriously. </p><p>“Well, you did. Good game,” I said, then removed my shirt in one smooth move, leaving my torso naked, much to her shock. </p><p>“What are you doing?” she gasped as she closed her face with her hands. Amusingly, I could see her peeking between her fingers in a manner she no doubt assumed to be subtle. </p><p>“Paying the cost of failure, of course,” I said. “I lost the game, which meant I lost a piece of clothing. So, are you willing to play another game, or was that enough for today?” </p><p>“T-this is nonsense,” she said as she dipped her head down, her face getting even redder. Amusingly, that didn’t prevent her from setting the game once again without saying anything. Then, she made a move and triggered the clock, showing she might have other faults, but she was certainly not a slow learner. </p><p>Using my tricks against me. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said as I did my best to defend against her assault. This time, it was a more even game, but despite my best efforts, I lost. </p><p>Without her frustration to help me, she was not an opponent I could defeat easily. </p><p>Luckily, the rules of our little bet made sure that the more we played, the more advantageous we got, regardless of winning or losing. </p><p>Of course, there was nothing that was forcing her to play. Other than the way her eyes were locked to my hips as I stood up and unbuttoned my jeans, pushing them down slightly. Yet, just as they reached halfway, I stopped. “Oh, we were just playing for one piece of clothing,” I murmured, smirking as I removed a shoe instead. </p><p>“That’s how you want to play,” she growled with a sudden passion. She wouldn’t have reacted like that if I just removed my shoe, but after being tempted by the idea of a slow striptease, it was much different. </p><p>“Yes, that’s how I want to play,” I said with a smirk, and we started another game. And, her annoyance worked wonders to distract her, making her lose herself in an overly aggressive assault, allowing me to deliver a deadly counter-attack. </p><p>Losing didn’t frustrate her much, considering my earlier trick allowed her to copy it and she kicked off her shoes. </p><p>Though, unlike me, she was wearing elegant pumps, meaning she didn’t have socks underneath, which meant that I had the advantage. For the next four games, I lost the three of them, and she only lost one, yet we both ended up with naked feet. </p><p>“It’s not fair, you are wearing more,” she stammered. </p><p>“I’m also losing more,” I said with a smirk. “I just have two pieces remaining to your four, it’s hardly the point for you to change your mind,” I said with a chuckle. “Of course, we can stop if you think the game is unfair.” </p><p>“N-no need,” she stammered, her words leaving her mouth hurriedly. “We can just finish the game.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I started another game, doing my best to resist her assault, only to fail spectacularly. With the victory in her grasp, she attacked much better than I expected. </p><p>So, I stood up, swaying to the rhythm of imaginary music. Even with the great assistance Agility was providing, I was not a good dancer. But, as Lauren looked at me with unblinking eyes, it didn’t seem to matter to her. She was more interested in the way my muscles were contracting with every move hungrily. </p><p>For a shy girl, she was surprisingly horny once tempted. </p><p>Soon, I let the jeans slip down, revealing my muscular legs, my underwear the only thing that was between me and total nudity. Unfortunately for her, my boxers were more substantial than the speedos I had modeled the day before, hiding them from her gaze. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but feel amused at the way her gaze dropped down, her disappointment clear. </p><p>“Unfortunately, that part is not yet willing to join the show. It requires a bit to bring it to attention,” I said. “Maybe you’ll be interested in that.” </p><p>I could feel her temptation. The attraction in her gaze was clear. The combination of my bad-boy charm and my ability to put a decent competition against her in chess worked wonders on her even before Seduction Trait was added to the mix, giving me a plethora of tricks I could use. </p><p>I didn’t push Seduction to the limit against her. On the contrary, I barely tapped into its benefits, but even that was enough to turn into a total mess. I enjoyed her silence as I sat down once again, and quickly set the game once again. </p><p>“Another game?” I offered. </p><p>She looked at me, arousal battling against her shyness. </p><p>Unfortunately, the latter won. </p><p>“M-maybe another day,” she stammered as she jumped to her feet suddenly, the realization of the moment hitting her hard. </p><p>She dashed away after grabbing her shoes, not even bothering to put them on. I did nothing, just watching in amusement as she fumbled with the key desperately. “I-it’s not opening,” she begged. </p><p>“Try pulling the door rather than pushing,” I said, unable to keep my chuckles as she blushed even more. I received an angry glare, mixed with shame, which only made me chuckle harder. </p><p>“See you tomorrow,” I said as a chuckle, watching her disappear. </p>
