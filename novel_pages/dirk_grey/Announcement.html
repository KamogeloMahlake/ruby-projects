        <p>Hi guys, two new changes I'm making in the organization of this Patreon.</p><p>1 - 2$ tier is now limited to 250 members, and will not accept new members. Of course, the old members are allowed to stay, and I'll be posting for them as usual.</p><p>2- A radical change. <strong>I'll be posting fanfiction here from now on, starting from 5$ tier. Hopefully, soon, I'll be adding surveys for it as well, but the tier structure is to be determined. </strong></p><p><strong>I'll be posting on fanfiction.net and questionablequesting as well, but with a delay. (Also, I might have some patreon exclusives, but not a certainty yet) </strong></p>
