        <p>“Oh, you want to help me,” I said even as I continued to row, my smile naughty. </p><p>She avoided my gaze shyly, but that didn’t stop her from removing her shirt, once again revealing her ragged dress underneath, which, even after I repaired it, covered nowhere near as it was supposed to be. Not that it mattered much, when she got rid of it as well, leaving only her transparent silk undershirt, the view beautiful. </p><p>She turned her back, but this time, it was nothing to do with shyness. She looked amazing as the soft moonlight glistened on her damp skin. </p><p>“Amazing,” I growled even as I watched her. “However, I can’t stop rowing, so you have to work hard.” </p><p>“What a chore,” she muttered, but the excitement in her voice didn’t match her words. Her fingers were trembling in excitement as they grabbed the straps of her undershirt. A flick, and it was down, once again bequeathing me with the sight of her naked beauty, her blonde mane messy as it danced with the wind. </p><p>Then, she went to her knees before she turned toward me and crawled toward my side. She looked incredible already, but the suggestive nature of her pose as she crawled toward me, especially since, even as she posed,  she was too shy to catch my gaze. </p><p>She grabbed my pants. I lifted my hips and let her pull it. “May I use a small water spell,” she asked. </p><p>“As long as you are careful,” I said. A thin line of water pulled out of the sea, and got rid of all the dirt and sweat. It was convenient, but I wasn’t able to spend a lot of time when Lillian covered the distance and captured my shaft between her tits. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I muttered as she started moving up and down, cursing the circumstances that prevented me from giving my undivided attention to the scene around us. Instead, I had to split my attention in three directions, watching the horizon, trying to feel the presence of any sea beast that might approach us, and enjoying the incredible view in front of me. </p><p>At the same time, I had to row rapidly, but that wasn’t that much of a problem. It was just a rhythmic physical movement, and it was even helpful. With my movement, all Lillian had to do was to keep her amazing breasts pressing together and match my hips to turn things into something incredibly fun. </p><p>Then, she took it a step forward. She pulled back slightly and gave a lick alongside my length, making me tremble in excitement. The sensation of mana, making me feel like a boiling pot, didn’t help it either. A growl escaped my mouth. </p><p>She giggled. “It’s a pity we have to hurry up,” she muttered seductively. “I would have to test slowly and see which tricks my servants had taught me are useful. </p><p>I disagreed. It was not a pity at all. I was not in a condition to survive an extended teasing session. So, I just growled threateningly, and she giggled again before she stood up, and sat on my lap. I happily buried my face between her breasts as she took me inside her. Her hands landed on my neck…</p><p>And, she rode. </p><p>“Incredible,” I muttered, my voice muffled, wishing my hands were free so that I could caress her wondrous body as she deserved it. Instead, I continued rowing even faster, imagining all the things I would do to her when we were at the shore. </p><p>“Not incredible enough if you’re not moaning,” she said as she grabbed my hair hard, and pulled me for a kiss. I wasn’t complaining. She continued rocking on my lap as our lips stayed connected, her movements somehow even hungrier than our first time… Excitement, joy, fear, elation… </p><p>With mana pressure building inside me, I lost my ability to resist, so when she tightened around me, I exploded, filling her with my seed and with mana. She kissed me desperately one last time before she pulled back. “Do you need any more help?” she asked. </p><p>I did not, but I was tempted to answer yes. “Once we reached the shore…” I answered instead. “We just need an hour to arrive, then you can help me for a few hours … or maybe, a few days. Just to be safe.” </p><p>Her blush was beautiful. “If … If I have to.” </p>
