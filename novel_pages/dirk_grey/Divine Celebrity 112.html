        <p>“Was that a good thing, or a bad thing, little buddy,” I murmured as I fed a small carrot to my temporary pet, along with another dose of Recovery-Intent. </p><p>I was torn between being happy or alert about Arthur and German Professor being connected to the same group. From one perspective, it was beneficial for both of them to be a part of the same group, as it would help me to deal with them as a unit rather than trying to play them off against each other. </p><p>On the other hand, it meant that I wouldn’t be playing two groups off against each other in case of an emergency. It was always easier to bargain while playing two groups against each other. </p><p>“But not all hope is lost,” I thought as I focused on the last part of the discussion, particularly the aspects about Doctor Williams and the potential information she had over me. Their discussion implied that, she was either a member that stood at a particular distance — enough not to reveal her information — or a distant ally. </p><p>Either way, it gave me some hope to collaborate, especially now that I wasn’t afraid of revealing magic to her for the first time. She was clearly aware of it, and prodded by that, rather than her curiosity being triggered from scratch. </p><p>“But not now, right, little buddy,” I murmured as I scratched the head of the turtle and fed him a bit more. “No, she’s a demanding bitch, and it’s best to deal with her from a position of strength.” </p><p>I might have considered visiting her right now if I hadn’t discovered the alternative usage method of Intent. Even if I failed to apply anything but Recovery, I still had an incredible advantage in the match. Football was a violent sport, and especially the second half became a game of endurance, pain tolerance, and luck of injury. </p><p>If my near-instant healing could save a tortoise from certain death, it should be enough to cure the football players of their small injuries and their exhaustion. </p><p>Of course, should and would be two different things, and there were many reasons it might not work as perfectly on humans, but I still had two days of training to make sure things had been going perfectly. </p><p>Though, that path had some problems as well. The organization was already aware that I had the ability to use Traits, but they were already expecting someone else to be supporting me — and quite inefficiently, if their discussion about the impossibility of handling the people in the stadium was any indicator. </p><p>I needed a dummy to trick them, I decided. I turned on the Internet, and searched for something I could use for the subject. After some search, I picked the Staff of Hermes as a good object for that purpose. </p><p>My first inclination was to purchase one online, but after some consideration, I decided against it. I just didn’t know about their surveillance capabilities, but checking someone’s order history, especially if they had a friend inside, was not particularly difficult. </p><p>“Why don’t I make one for myself,” I said as I started reading about wood-crafting, to see the process, which looked simpler than I expected. Not exactly trivial, but most of the challenge was the ability to use a bladed tool, and the precision that was required to get the angles right. </p><p>Not something that could be developed in a day or two, even for a savant, but I was betting that, at this point, I was more than a simple savant. </p><p>“I’m going out to pick some wood, little buddy,” I said as I looked at the tortoise on the box and flooded him with another dose of Intent, to test if there was any great side effect, before I prepared to leave. “You must be bored,” I suddenly said and picked him up, though I was sure that I was reflecting my own state. </p><p>Watching tutorials on woodworking was not the most entertaining activity. </p><p>Thanks to the remote location of my dorm, it didn’t take long to arrive at the forest, and soon, I was walking around, looking for a thick branch, continuing to flood Recovery-Intent to my new pet.</p><p>Yet, as I walked, I started to feel some kind of … presence. </p><p>“Weird,” I murmured, but since it was an adjective that defined the latest stretch of my life perfectly, I decided not to use that as a word of dismissal. Instead, I decided to use the same trick I had been using earlier to cure my little pet, but with a little change. </p><p>I didn’t focus on any kind of trait, and spread raw energy… Yet, that didn’t work. Curious, I attempted a few more Traits, including Perception and Pattern recognition. None of them worked either. </p><p>“Was that an illusion, little buddy,” I murmured as I put my hand on the shell of my new pet, and flooded with Recovery-Intent. </p><p>And felt the same sense of resonance. The link was hard to deny, I decided as I started to walk in that direction. I had to walk five minutes before I found the source among the naked trees. </p><p>A broken and charred root of a tree, one that had looked like it was struck by lightning at one point. “Curious,” I murmured as I continued to flood the tortoise, and receive the exact same feedback. “Do you also think that my little fake healing item might end up not so fake, little buddy?” I answered, but he didn’t react, lazing under my magical treatment. </p><p>Curious, I spread some Intent through its structure, little enough that it wouldn’t have even shattered a small pebble, doing my best to pull a variant of the old German’s trick, and it worked. I could see only a part of the trunk actually resonating with the energy. </p><p>“Now, another experiment,” I said as I raised my fist, gathered some Strength-Intent on my fingers — a natured variant of what I had pulled against those shadows — and smashed down, shattering the useless parts easily, like they were made of foam. </p><p>The useful part would fit into a shoebox comfortably. “Still, a good amount,” I said, and started carrying it with me. And, the way he had been rubbing against the wood as we walked back, I wasn’t the only one that was feeling the effects. </p><p>Curious, I started to play with it, and came up with several findings. First, it was reacting to Recovery-Intent, and only that. Another finding was … persistence. Other items got affected by Intent, but it was a fleeting thing. </p><p>The wood functioned almost like a battery, and even as I ceased feeding it with Intent, it maintained its warmth. One that had been disappearing slowly… Very slowly, as when we arrived back to my room, it was still noticeably warm — both physically, and magically. </p><p>“Okay, little buddy, you helped me a lot,” I said as I put the tortoise back on his box, only for him to slam against the box, his gaze following the wood. “So, you liked it,” I said with a chuckle even as I broke a small piece, and filled it with some Recovery-Intent before putting next to it. </p><p>He immediately scampered on top of it, and rested his head against the warmth. I chucked, amused that a tortoise was acting more like a puppy. </p><p>I chuckled even as I walked back. First, I pulled some old papers, spreading them on the ground to catch the wood shavings, before I raised an excess piece of wood — which I picked to practice — while turning on the tutorial once more, watching the video as my blade danced on its surface. </p><p>My toolset was not perfect, but the precision helped me to avoid accidentally cutting myself. Fifteen minutes later, I was looking at the first attempt, which, looked like an extradimensional monster of horror, which could hardly be classified as a success. </p><p>“I’m so glad that I don’t have the luxury to sleep,” I murmured with a chuckle. Well, technically, I did. All I needed was to allow my guide to appear, and trust her to handle any possible shadow assassin that might choose to attack me. </p><p>But a sleepless night or two, especially under the combined assistance of Recovery and Endurance, was a good trade for avoiding a meddling angel… </p><p>It was time to work… </p>
