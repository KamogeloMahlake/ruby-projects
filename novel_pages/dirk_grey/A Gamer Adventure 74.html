        <p>For a long and glorious moment, I stopped to enjoy the looks of the busty beauty with caramel-colored skin lying under me, gasping in a mixture of anticipation and dread as she awaited my promised interrogation. From her brown eyes, I could read a hint of panic as she realized the lost control of her little game of seduction, mixed with an unwillingness to change the course. </p><p>“So, we were talking about the identity of our customer,” I whispered into her ear as I leaned over her, letting my chest press against hers. </p><p>“Is it really important,” she gasped even as she put her hand on my shoulder, dragging softly. “I can think of several more interesting things to do rather than wasting our time talking about the customers.” As she said so, she arched her back, making the sight of her body even more delicious. </p><p>“That does sound tempting,” I answered lazily, enjoying the way hope flared in her eyes, straining her willpower. After all, she was still suffering from my little trick that prevented her from cumming, while her body was covered in aphrodisiac massage oil. </p><p>It was delicious torture. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“Doesn’t it?” she said as her hands started exploring my body. </p><p>“It does, but the identity of the customer is more important,” I countered. “After all, we’re going to spend quite a bit of time together as we forged and aligned a personalized sword,” I commented. </p><p>“Yes, but don’t worry-” she started before she cut herself, frustrated. “I mean, what are you talking about!” </p><p>I chuckled. “Come on, sweetie. It’s obvious that we’re going to spend quite a bit of time with our customer, and creating a personalized weapon is the only reason to spend extended time together.” </p><p>“But how could you know that we’re going to spend time together?” she followed up. </p><p>I sighed even as I let my hand explore the delicious curves of her body. “Simple, if it was a simple order, you could have just given me a random name, and it would be done.” </p><p>“She’s going to kill me,” Oeyne murmured, revealing the gender of the visitor, which put a smile on my face. After all, if I’m going to spend extended time together with a stranger, I would vastly prefer a woman. It had many interesting potential combinations. </p><p>“Not if I make you die with pleasure first,” I whispered as I aligned myself to her entrance and pushed my hips, like I was about to slip inside her, only to pull back when she tried to meet in the middle by pushing herself up. “Not yet,” I whispered playfully as I slipped two fingers instead, teasing her womanhood as I moved down, intending to replace it with my tongue. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>Her response, which came in the form of a helpless moan, was simply divine. “Please, just move onto the main course,” she begged, but I ignored her begging in favor of moving down, about to treat her to a delicious oral service. She moaned helplessly as I flicked her labia, already primed. </p><p>I raised my gaze to meet her helpless looks. She tried to move, but I was prepared. A simple arcana spell restricted her limbs, preventing her from moving. It wasn’t strong enough to prevent it from breaking completely, but she was in no condition to actually exert her full strength, nor she gave a sign of actually doing so. A combination of her burning desire and her urgent need to enlist my aid limited her options very much. </p><p>“You look delicious enough to eat,” I murmured as I looked at her flawless body from my unique angle, enjoying the curves of her body. Just to reinforce my statement, I softly bit her inner thighs, though still leaving a mark. </p><p>“Hurry up and eat then,” she answered quickly, so quickly that if it wasn’t for my ability to catch deception, I would have been assumed she was just submitting to avoid questioning. But her burning desire was unmistakable. I kissed her clit, making her whole body jump, straining her chains. Despite the apparent submissiveness of the act, it was a pure act of domination, signaling that she was nothing more than a toy for my amusement. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle even as I dove down between her legs, nibbling and licking around her clit, teasing softly rather than searching for quick completion. When I added occasional thrusts of my tongue, her hips rose to meet my movement, her body clenching hard enough to crack the chains, forcing me to reinforce them magically. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[-165 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>“Please,” she moaned helplessly, begging me to stop, which was amusing. The chains I created were strong, but definitely not strong enough to resist if she strained her full strength. All she needed was to pull, and the magical chains would end up destroyed, but she chose to push her hips to my face, searching for a quick climax. </p><p>I decided to reward her obedience as I let my tongue slip inside her tunnel, giving her a preview of the activities that would follow it. She responded with a loud moan. It was a good opportunity to push the interrogation further. “Who’s the customer?” I asked.</p><p>“Not really important,” she answered. “She just wants to keep it confidential due to her family situation.” </p><p>“Family situation,” I murmured before returning to lick her nether lips, while my mind focused on the possible candidates. At first, I thought it might be one of the faculty members, but I rejected it. While Faculty members were strong, they weren’t politically strong enough that Oeyne would afraid of saying their names. Admittedly, there were some faculty members that deserved such reputation, but they were either mages themselves, strong enough to assist Oeyne’s forging, or they had enough reputation to ask for a favor of a graduated mage. </p><p>So, it must be either an illegal organization, or a part of the nobility. “You haven’t promised it to a criminal, right?” I suddenly asked. Considering her gambling addiction, I didn’t think that asking that question was unfair. Who knew if she sold a favor in exchange of her debts. </p><p>“Of course not,” she answered in indignation, putting that particular worry to rest. “How can you ask that!” </p><p>“Well, there are two possibilities for a client considering your tight lips, and if it’s not the criminals, it must be a noble client,” I asked, and received a positive moan. Unfortunately, that hadn’t exactly solved my problem. If it was noble, it must be someone like Cornelia who was facing dangerous problems with her family, and looking for a power-up. </p><p>Of course, that left another problem. How the hell a marginalized member of a noble family afford a personalized magical weapon. They were really expensive to produce, and worse, once their intended recipient died, they turned completely useless. I tried to come up with the identity of the client based on the intelligence I had collected on the noble families, but I came up short. </p><p>However, seeing Oeyne’s determination not to reveal the identity of her, I decided to focus on grinding her willpower before I pushed her for an answer. I let my tongue dance wildly at her entrance, until she was mewling like a kitten, begging for a release. “Please,” she gasped. “Let me cum!” </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>“Not yet,” I answered, ignoring the way her thighs tightened around my head along with the implied threat. Instead, I spanked her ass. “Behave,” I ordered. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she warned, but considering she continued to lay obediently, I decided I still had quite a bit of margin to push. As my tongue continued to dance, she fell into a daze, moans escaping uninterrupted, but whenever she fell too deep, I awakened her with a tight slap on her plump ass. </p><p>Five minutes later, I decided to ask again. “Tell me,” I ordered. “Who is the customer?” </p><p>“It’s the youngest lady of the Stilea family,” she said. Unfortunately for her, even under the best of circumstances, she wasn’t good enough to slip a lie when I was careful, let alone when she was panting helplessly, desiring for an orgasm. </p><p>I pulled my head away from between her legs, and spanked her tits as a warning. “Are you sure about that?” I asked. “You wouldn’t lie to me, would you,” I slowly asked as I twisted her nipples, making her shiver in a mixture of pleasure and pain. As she shivered, I pressed my shaft against her entrance, but didn’t slip in. “I would hate to stop here to punish you for your lie, after all,” I murmured. </p><p>Her determination lasted less than half a minute under the assault of her pending orgasm. “No, I’m not,” she gasped. “But, are you sure you want to learn? It’s going to be really big. Big enough to risk your life if you actually let it slip,” she warned me. </p><p>“Nothing I can’t handle,” I countered. Considering the number of secrets I was holding, what was one more. </p><p>“If you’re sure,” Oeyne said, surrendering to my interrogation. “Our client is Silvia. Silvia Romulus.” </p><p>That name surprised me. “Silvia Romulus,” I repeated in shock. “The same Silvia Romulus that is the oldest daughter of the current king. The Silvia Romulus that had just lost an intense battle with two of her brothers, losing her already slim hope of taking the throne as the Queen,” I murmured. </p><p>“Yes, the same,” she admitted. </p><p>“That is a bit more than I expected,” I murmured, overwhelmed with the sudden realization. “And she’s going to come here to get a weapon in a few days,” I said. That was not good. A hidden visit from a candidate to the throne was surprising, but nothing I couldn’t handle. However, considering the circumstances with the traitors in the faculty and the necromancer presence outside the walls, ready to assault at any minute, the situation turned out significantly more complicated. </p><p>The impending assault on the school was scary enough without the disaster that would follow if the visit of the Princess was revealed, or even worse, she was actually harmed during the assault. Yes, despite their name the Royal family was nothing more than a toothless beast when it came to controlling the Empire, but they still controlled the Capital with an iron fist, with a rumored magical arsenal enough to erase any noble family easily. </p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>There was a reason they were untouched despite their waning political power.  </p><p>But that was something to be determined at a different time. I had a more important task. I needed to reward Oeyne for her surrender. “Thank you, sweetheart,” I murmured softly. “Tell me, what do you want as a reward?” </p><p>“I want you,” she moaned immediately. “Fuck me!” </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked even as I slipped the crown inside her, enjoying her wet tightness. “I’m a jealous and controlling lover. Once you’re mine, you’re mine.” </p><p>“You need to be able to handle me first,” she moaned back even as she strained her strength, breaking the chains before she hugged me, pushing her hips upward. “There’s no need to talk when you collapse under me, dried after a long night.” </p><p>Rather than letting her succeed, I pulled back for a moment. “As you wish,” I warned her, declaring my intention, then slammed inside her, extracting a delicious moan off her. “I’m going to teach you just how well I can handle you.” </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 1%]</p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>“What do you want, slut?” I asked even as I impaled her mercilessly, again and again, starting with a rough assault rather than a playful push. </p><p>“I want you to fuck me,” she murmured through her gritted teeth. “Impale me with that big cock. Teach me the meaning of obedience, prove me your strength,” she said even as her legs wrapped around my waist, pulling me even deeper. </p><p>I chose that moment to break the spell that was preventing her from climaxing, and a surprise orgasm exploded like a geyser, leaving a devastating earthquake behind. However, since she challenged me to break her, I didn’t even slow down, continuing to drill her mercilessly. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 4%]</p><p>[+1500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>“How is it,” I asked as the minutes passed, and she gained a semblance of control, but it was barely enough to make her speak. </p><p>“It’s noth-nothing,” she stammered, trying to look brave, but after that spectacular orgasm, chased by an incoming one, her face was a mess. “Do your worst!” </p><p>“You’re daring,” I admitted with a chuckle. “Let’s see if you can handle my best,” I said even as I cast a conjuration spell, quite a bit smaller than my shaft, glistening with lubricants. Her eyes widened when she felt its presence against her puckered hole, slipping inside before she could react. </p><p>“That’s - that’s cheating,” she complained, interrupted by a moan as the plug was safely inserted into her backdoor, enhancing her pleasure further. </p><p>“You’re the one that claimed you can take my best,” I warned her, even as I cast another conjuration spell, this time a pair of ice cubes. I dragged one around her erect nipple, still red after all the twisting, and she gasped in shock. Before she could say anything, however, the contrast, assisted by the unfamiliar presence of an anal plug, triggered yet another orgasm in her. </p><p>She screamed in a desperate need as the climax hit her with all strength of a rabid elephant, leaving a shivering and moaning wreck. As she squirmed, I ran my hands down her breasts, my soft touch triggering even more pleasure from her, while she gushed helplessly around my shaft. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 7%]</p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>I would have liked to enjoy her delicious body even more, but after her last orgasm, she collapsed back, murmuring before she fell unconscious. “I surrender.”</p><p>Pity, I thought even as I pulled out, strangely disappointed with my early victory. On the positive side, she was conquered easier than I expected. Considering her skillset and power, it was a definite win. Now, I just needed to make sure I could trust her about keeping the achievement a secret. </p><p>After dressing, I left the room, my mind focused on the possible implications of the princess’ visit, and whether it was somehow linked to the necromancer presence, or it was just a horrible coincidence. </p><p>I had a lot of work to do…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 27    Experience: 364200 / 378000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 46</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3699 / 3699	Mana: 4914 / 4914        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [82/100]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>
