        <p>As Carol put her hand on my arm, looking at Nicole challengingly, Nicole was the first one to speak. One that Carol assumed to be victory — a small one, but a victory nonetheless — for a moment, then Nicole delivered her sentence. “A good idea. Why don’t you pose as you wish? I don’t want you to push you into something … you can’t handle,” Nicole said, the pause making it particularly sarcastic. </p><p>It was nowhere near Nicole’s usual way of talking, and I could see just how hesitant she was as she delivered those words. She was clearly mimicking someone in her life, one of her neighborhood bullies, most likely. </p><p>Luckily for her, that hesitance could also be read as mocking, especially for someone like Carol, who was already predisposed to assume Nicole was a typical arrogant model. </p><p>“Oh, as much as I can handle, are you sure you want to risk your boyfriend like this?” Carol said, her smile sharp and smug, though there was a brittleness in her expression as well. I had a feeling that the sudden intensity of her reaction had little to do with Nicole, who suddenly turned into the representation of the challenge she had been going through. </p><p>It took all my control not to explode in laughter. It was rare to see a misunderstanding worthy of a romantic comedy developing in real-time. </p><p>Nicole gave a trembling grin, showing that despite her initial desire to use Carol as some kind of practice was already flailing. Yet, misreading the situation once again, Carol tensed with determination. </p><p>I gave Nicole an encouraging smile, which boosted her courage just enough for her to handle Carol’s next attack. Just in time. </p><p>“As you wish, Miss Model,” Carol said, and turned to me. “Do you mind closing your eyes for a second,” she said, trying her best to ooze seduction. </p><p>Which, unfortunately, wasn’t as effective as she might have thought. Oh, she was certainly beautiful, stunningly so, but pure seduction was something else. Her smile reminded me of a femme fatale on the screen, sharp, exaggerated, and paradoxically tame. </p><p>I had a feeling that I was seeing the result of classical acting training — the perfect hobby for a rich girl. </p><p>That made her far more attractive to my gaze than she otherwise would have been. There was something vulnerable and fragile in her acting, one that spoke to my inclinations perfectly, making both a crack in that vulnerability further and repairing it at the same time. </p><p>Pity that it was the exact opposite of the seduction she was trying to achieve. </p><p>I followed her request and closed my back. I even turned my back, which not only made me look even more shy and submissive, but also hid my uncontrollable smirk. Multitasking for the win. </p><p>“Oh, daring,” Nicole murmured as the rushing of fabric reached my ear, her voice trembling already. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t handle just this much nudity,” Carol answered, the seductive tone in her voice too thick, making it obvious that she was trying to convince herself about that decision, therefore missing Nicole’s hesitation. </p><p>It was like watching two people trying to play poker while blindfolded, not even realizing both were holding uno cards. </p><p>A strangely entertaining disaster … even without the reward that was waiting for me at the end of it. </p><p>“You can open your eyes,” Carol called. </p><p>I followed her request, ready to fake an expression of appreciation regardless of the situation. However, that turned out to be unnecessary. She might not be practiced when it came to being a seductress, but her instincts were impossible to beat. </p><p>She still wore her blazer … which was one of the three pieces of clothing she still had on her. An incredible view, considering the other two pieces in question were her very expensive shoes, and her panties. </p><p>Particularly since the latter was a nice white lacy piece, contrasting with the bright red of her real estate agent. </p><p>“How do I look?” she asked as she leaned forward. </p><p>“A-amazing,” I said, faking a stammer. Nicole looked shocked at my reaction, but when Carol was busy throwing her a smug smile, I winked at her, telling her to play along. </p><p>My confidence seemed to shore up hers. “Come on, miss agent. Show me if you can handle being a model,” Nicole said as she raised her camera. </p><p>“Oh, my pleasure,” Carol said as she looked at me once more before closing the distance in a large step that displayed her naked legs to perfection. </p><p>And, if her confident grin was quivering a bit at the edge, I was gentleman enough not to point it out. Especially when the reward for it to have her stand next to me, the angle giving an even better view of her already exaggerated cleavage. After all, while she had buttoned her blazer … it was still only a deep blazer, with a deep valley in the middle, showing enough of her amazing breasts for me to conclusively decide that they were natural. </p><p>Unaware of the deep examination she was going through, she leaned against me while she turned to Nicole, opened her mouth, and paused. “W-wow, you’re more in shape than I realized,” she muttered. She was beautiful and smart. </p><p>But not very observant. </p><p>“Well, it takes a lot of strength to bring around all that photo equipment,” I said, doing my best to act exaggeratedly hesitant to give her an impression of harmlessness. I wanted her to stay focused on Nicole. </p><p>“Well, it’s working,” she said as she moved even closer, her hips pressing against my side. Luckily, not touch my arousal. </p><p> I didn’t want to scare her yet. </p><p>“Okay, enough yapping. Give me a pose,” Nicole said, her voice pointed. Jealousy in her tone was easy to identify. Not just for me, but also for her target. </p><p>Another mistake … with some interesting dividends for me. </p><p>“As you wish, miss model,” Carol said, encouraged by what she took to be a sign of her victory as she turned to me, and put her hands to my neck, pulling me close enough I could feel her breath. </p><p>Her blush as she took the pose was spectacular. It told me that she was already at her limit, but she was pushing because she felt like Nicole would call it off. A reasonable conclusion considering she had first met us while we were in the midst of our carnal glory. Since Nicole was my lover and she was jealous, she had to admit defeat soon. </p><p>Unfortunately for Carol, while that assumption was perfectly reasonable, it was also incredibly wrong due to a piece of information she misread. Nicole was not the dominant person in this relationship … but a natural submissive. </p><p>Worse, she was a natural submissive who had developed a personal and professional habit of following my commands. The slight shake of my head was enough to dissuade Nicole from stopping. Instead, she just raised her camera to the face to hide her blush and spoke. </p><p>“Come on, that’s enough warmup. Show me something more dynamic. Something interesting,” Nicole spoke instead, doing her best to copy me both in words and in cadence. </p><p>She wasn’t successful enough to hide her jealousy and discomfort, but it was good, as those only encouraged Carol further. “As you wish. You’re the boss,” she said as she grabbed my hand, and brought it to her ass. “Squeeze it a bit, so that it can be clear on the camera,” Carol whispered. </p><p>I did so, feeling the texture of her soft panties and even softer skin on my palm. Carol let out a moan, one that showed a deep sense of pleasure, and perfectly aroused. Far better than her earlier paper-thin seductive pose. </p><p>For a moment, I froze, wondering if she had been playing me all along, but then I realized it wasn’t the case. It lasted only after I managed to take a glance into her eyes, and realized how crazy diluted her eyes were. I would have suspected some chemical interference if she wasn’t with us all along. </p><p>I shuffled my hand slightly, adding a little more pressure, and a moan exploded from her. One that she did her best to make look like a fake, which was enough to trick Nicole, but not me. “Oh, come on, mister. Be careful about those fingers,” she whispered loudly, implying that I had been touching to her wetness to explain it to Nicole. </p><p>Quick thinking. Too bad it was nowhere near enough to hide the truth from me. I recognized the signs easily. She had been going through a long dry spell, and considering her tenseness, she either didn’t like masturbation, or she was one of the unlucky women who didn’t derive enough satisfaction from it. </p><p>A deadly combination with her clearly healthy sexual drive. </p><p>Just like that, the game got even more entertaining. </p><p>“How about this, Miss Model,” Carol said throatily, unaware that I was busy discovering every little secret of her body. “Do you think that’s enough to get a sense of the lighting…” </p><p>Carol looked at Nicole as she said that, once again missing the clue I had mouthed to her side. </p><p>“Oh, we’re just starting, sweetie,” Nicole answered. “We have a dozen rooms to test.” </p><p>With that, Carol tensed in my arms, realizing the dangers of playing games unprepared. Of course, there was nothing that forced her to follow Nicole’s suggestion. </p><p>Well, nothing but her pride… And, for I had a feeling that her pride had already been battered down by the situation that forced her to escape into the middle of nowhere. And, now, she wasn’t ready for any more compromises. </p><p>Not even playing a ridiculous game of dare. </p><p>Or naked dare. </p>
