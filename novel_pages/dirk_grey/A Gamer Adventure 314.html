        <p>“I can’t believe you’re going already, you bastard,” Mariel said. </p><p>“Oh, a month wasn’t enough. A month that we spent wrapped around each other, I might add,” I answered with a chuckle as I kissed her, enjoying her blush.</p><p>“That doesn’t count, it was just to repair the plane and seed it with twilight beings,” she answered with a beautiful blush. </p><p>“Oh, there was seeding alright,” I said, enjoying the crass joke mostly because of her scandalized expression. She was willing to experiment in some really fascinating positions during the month we spent together, but a little low-brow humor was enough to dismiss and unbalance her successfully. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she said even as she blushed. </p><p>“Why don’t you make me,” I said, and she did so by slamming her lips against mine, extending another kiss. One that I had to pull back soon, because it was almost time for the beacons to flare, and I wanted to start traveling as soon as possible. “So, a month wasn’t enough,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Not even close,” she answered. “Not with all the times that you disappeared to visit your elf whore …”</p><p>“Hey, get along well. You need each other to defend yourself successfully in case the wards I set up get breached,” I warned. It wasn’t too much of a surprise that they didn’t get along well, especially since I couldn’t just arrange a threesome to make things fun. They were bound to their own planes, and avatars were poor substitutes for a threesome. </p><p>Luckily, the month wasn’t just a waste. Other than helping the two bond with their planes even stronger, I was also able to break down the artifact the Eternals used to bond the two planes together, enough to replicate its function with a ward before it broke down … though it did cost me quite a bit of purified spark to constantly replenish the mana.  </p><p>As a result, the planes ended up getting locked together, which meant they could support each other in case of an attack. Hopefully, it would be enough, especially since they were well-matched against the undead, and I hoped that they would be able to resist any other attack together.</p><p>More importantly, Mariel was able to build another darkness ward that somehow hid the planes. It was expensive in terms of mana … but considering I had integrated a conversion ward to both planes and given them far more mana than they could otherwise use, that didn’t matter much. </p><p>Of course, leaving some Purified Spark with them was risky. If the Eternals attacked successfully, there was a chance they would be able to acquire some, taking away my strongest advantage. </p><p>All things considered, it was a risk I was willing to take. </p><p>“Now, one last kiss before I leave,” I said, sharing another heated kiss while her naked body rubbed against mine, her wings a blanket around me. </p><p>With that, I teleported, once again into the Primordial Aether. And, since I had already said my goodbyes to Seldanna, I moved away from the shadows of it, waiting for the signal from the beacons. </p><p>As I waited, I looked around, realizing Primordial Aether didn’t feel as chaotic and in comprehensive. It wasn’t exactly like the normal world, still a mixture of a haze and a maze, but this time, trying to find my way felt like trying to remember something while drunk. </p><p>Out of reach, maybe, but along with the realization that, once the mist of alcohol faded, everything would be clear. </p><p>My latest stat increase was certainly convenient. </p><p>With that increased capability, the moment I felt the signal of the beacons, I started moving in that direction … far faster than I had hoped. More importantly, as I traveled, I was able to sense the location of the main material plane. Nothing concrete, just a giant shadow in the mist. </p><p>Enough for me to travel the rest of the way even without the beacons, allowing me to complete the rest of the travel in just two days. </p><p>I was getting more and more comfortable in Primordial Aether … which was enough to give me hope. </p><p>Once I arrived at my destination, I found it surrounded by Elementals once again, each desperate to invade. I was almost sure that their desperation was about the System … but exactly how, I had no idea. </p><p>I wanted to poke that particular point, but unfortunately, I didn’t have too much time. </p><p>With my path familiar, sneaking back into the plane and teleporting across had been easy. My first destination was Silver Spires. From a distance, I could see that Silver Spires had gotten far bigger than I expected. </p><p>With almost ten times people living directly, and nearby, I could see a few new towns under construction. The change was interesting. </p><p>Just not as interesting enough to delay my meeting with Helga. I teleported again…</p><p>“Hello, love,” I said as I appeared behind Helga, hugging her. I didn’t surprise her — I couldn’t, not in her domain — but I still managed to hug her from behind. </p><p>She twisted in my arms until we were face to face, kissing me aggressively. “I missed you, you bastard,” she murmured as she clamped against my lips, not asking a single question as her legs wrapped around my waist. </p><p>And, she was supposed to be the Goddess of Knowledge. </p><p>How amusing. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t make that joke to her, not with her lips doing her best to steal all my attention … and succeeding. I slammed her against the nearest shelf, the books raining on the floor even as I ripped her dress hungrily. </p><p>She didn’t seem to have any problem with that, considering she was repeating the same action on my dress. As she pulled, I absentmindedly noted that she was stronger physically … nowhere near me, but enough to match a mediocre fighter. </p><p>It was good to see that even a conceptual Spark like Knowledge gave her some improvements. It might help her in a dangerous situation. </p><p>More importantly, it would help her be even more active in our private fun times … a fact she realized as well if the way she crouched down in front of me with great enthusiasm was any indicator. </p><p>“Wow, someone is in a hurry,” I commented as I watched her kneel down. </p><p>“Yes, because I can’t keep you for long while there’s a civil war going on,” Helga said. “Five minutes, then you’re going to go to the capital and make sure everything is in order,” she ordered. </p><p>“Oh, I love it when you start ordering. Being a goddess suits you,” I said, enjoying her blush … especially that shy reaction didn’t prevent her from leaning forward to capture my girth between her pouty lips and started giving a blowjob that shocked me with its aggressiveness. </p><p>She pulled back once my shaft hit the entrance of her throat and looked up. “What, I missed you,” she said, somehow still shy enough to be cute even as she returned to the task at hand.</p><p>Her hands planted behind my thighs as she pulled me forward, giving me the best blowjob I had ever got. Passionate and wild, yet still with a pattern. Almost like a dance. </p><p>Suddenly, I smirked. “You used your spark to design everything, like a dance, right?” I declared. </p><p>She said nothing, but the sudden pause and the glowing blush showed that I was very accurate. I didn’t say anything else, just enjoying her aggressive yet elegant blowjob in silence, not ruining her beautiful surprise any further. </p><p>I just looked down, enjoying her beautiful nude body while she did her best to make my shaft disappear completely in her throat, ignoring the temptation to grab her beautiful blonde locks. </p><p>It was her gift. It would be rude to ruin it like that. </p><p>I just stayed in place, enjoying as her head bobbed up and down around my hardness. Her eyes stayed open, locked with mine to give me a treat of their blue depths … depths that shone with supernatural intelligence. </p><p>She soon picked up the pace, taking me even deeper down her throat a few times before she stayed there, wrapping my legs … and gulped, the sudden tightening enough to trigger me. As she choked around my dick, I moaned, filling her throat. </p><p>“So, how was it?” she murmured after she swallowed every last drop and pulled back, then proceeded to trace with her finger to catch any of my seed that may have slipped while she was distracted. </p><p>“You’re a goddess, indeed,” I murmured as I lifted her up, and pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek. “Pity that I have to go to the capital immediately.” </p><p>“Yes, a pity,” she answered while she caressed my chest, then turned and walked away with a very deliberate sway on her hips. </p><p>Even as I fixed my clothes and teleported away, I couldn’t help but imagine just how else she was going to use her spark in the bedroom. Too bad I had a civil war to navigate before I could get that answer. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 115</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel}</p>
