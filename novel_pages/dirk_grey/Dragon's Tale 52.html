        <p>The sight of the curvy beauty collapsed next to her husband flicked a switch for the other women that filled the room, breaking a mental barrier for them. As I played with Cera, they were content in watching me, but after the short yet impactful adventure that the busty beauty had just experienced, every single one of them looked at me like naughty kittens examining a particularly tasty piece of liver. </p><p>Surprisingly, before I could even react, a blonde dashed toward me, her eyes glowing with excitement as she fell on her knees. I would have taken her as a drunk, but her movements were perfectly smooth as she took half of my cock in her mouth. She was just aroused. </p><p>Though, as much as I enjoyed her initiative, it wasn’t exactly evidence of her bravery. What was happening in the room was certainly a scandal, not to a degree of ruining their lives, but enough to be a headache for a few months, maybe even some permanent damage to their social standing. But there was one condition for it to be a scandal, for them to talk. </p><p>And that was unlikely after things came to that point. They might be spoiled, but they were smart enough to realize that after things came to this point, none of them would spill the beans, not if they didn’t want other people to assume that they were a part of it even if they decided to avoid. After all, my friends had an orgy with a gladiator but I didn’t join despite staying there wasn’t particularly convincing as far as claims of innocence went. </p><p>They could have left early, of course, but that would have earned the displeasure of their hostess Olivia, which was worse than suffering through a scandal. And Olivia was still on her seat, watching the situation with a hungry gaze in her face, clearly enjoying the liberties I was talking with the rest of the Roman nobility. </p><p>She was such a nice fan of my gladiatorial work. </p><p>The blonde between my legs, devouring my shaft with an aggressiveness seemed to be another fan of the enthusiasm she displayed as she tried to stuff my whole cock in her mouth, and as a performer, it was my job to take care of my fans. So, I grabbed a hold of her hair and started pulling her even tighter, helping her to swallow my full length. It was a tough job for her, but that didn’t blunt her enthusiasm.  </p><p>Gasps filled the room, too loud to be a genuine shock. I let my gaze drag across the room, enjoying the sight of mostly-naked beauties while they all watched me in rapt attention, constructing a circle around me, enjoying the sight of their noble peer being treated as a street whore - and loving it intensely, her enthusiasm compensating for her lacking experience. </p><p>I pointed to one of the other women, this time a lithe-bodied, olive-skinned beauty. “Bring me wine,” I ordered, like I was a Consul and she was one of my servants. The speed she jumped up to her feet, dashing toward the table as her naked ass swayed enthusiastically was a nice sight, especially as she accidentally stepped on a few fingers, making sure their drunk partners wouldn’t just have a headache to worry about the next day. </p><p>“Such a careless servant,” I said even as I grabbed the goblet she passed to me, only wrap an arm around her waist, while pouring some of the wine on her tits, big enough to fill my palm despite her lithe frame, and started licking it off my skin. “Luckily, you provide good service.” </p><p>She started wiggling like she was trying to get out of my grasp, though it would have been at least slightly convincing when she put her hands on my chest, she had spent more than a second trying to push before letting her fingers explore my muscles. “Naughty whore,” I muttered, which made her look scandalized for a fleeting moment before I stole her lips, kissing aggressively enough to constitute an invasion. </p><p>There was no time wasted before she declared her surrender, however, accepting my annexation with open arms. I let my hand around her waist slip lower, squeezing her ass hard enough to leave a mark. She moaned beautifully and I pulled back. I resumed the kiss after giving her a sip of the wine, adding a delicious aroma to the battle of our tongues. </p><p>With both of my hands occupied with the dark-skinned beauty, the blonde kneeling in front of me was free to pull back. She actually did pull back from the aggressive deepthroat I was making her deliver, but considering she repositioned herself slight to be more visible to her peers before she started licking, sucking, and kissing my entire length, with moans to show just how much she was enjoying the moment, I was willing to let it slide. She was really making a spectacle of herself as she sold her enjoyment successfully. </p><p>So successfully that, while I was lost in a kiss with the beauty in my arms I felt a tongue on my balls. Not too remarkable, unless counting the fact that I could still feel a pair of lips around my girth. When my gaze slipped down, I noticed a second blonde head, responsible for the lips around my girth while the first one moved down to lick my balls. The second one looked up even as she pushed her lips forward, looking like a deer ambushed by a hunter, but still pushing forward. </p><p>It was a memorable spectacle, their licks and moans mixing together to create an accompanying song. </p><p>Everyone else just watched in rapt silence, enjoying as a barbarian working on three noble ladies at the same time. Though, despite their silence, more than one was currently caressing their cores, some dazed enough to suggest that they were not even aware of it. </p><p>I turned to face Olivia, with a mocking smile on my lips, who was sitting alone as Cera served Atia enthusiastically, no doubt happy to make herself valuable to their friends. I had no idea which family Atia belonged to, but the fact she was a friend of Olivia and not just a follower, in addition to Cera’s enthusiasm to make her happy, suggested a high-ranking person. Likely the daughter of a senator, maybe even the daughter of an Ex-Praetor or a Quaestor. Regardless of her position and her earlier reluctance, however, she was clearly enjoying the service she was receiving. </p><p>“So, enjoying the show?” I asked Olivia even as I pushed my chest forward, giving the olive-skinned beauty a chance to breathe. </p><p>“More than I expected,” Olivia answered calmly as she took a sip of her wine, savoring the liquid as she savored the wine. Despite her clear signs of arousal —not to mention her being a fan— she was keeping herself back in a deliberate manner. I didn’t know whether she had no intention of partaking in the fun, or just waiting for the others to finish with their entertainment first before she joined. Regardless, I let her continue to enjoy the show. She was the only one I couldn’t push carelessly.  </p><p>Luckily, waiting for her to get into the mood wasn’t exactly a chore. A room full of beautiful noble ladies that were ready to be properly dominated was not exactly subpar entertainment. </p><p>One of the other girls, this time a brown-haired, doe-eyed cutie, finally gathered her courage and moved forward to join the fun, carrying a plate of grape with her. I opened my mouth, enjoying the bite she fed to me, my smirk widening greatly as I chewed the grape that was chilled to perfection, before leaning down to steal a kiss from her pouty lips, making her doe eyes even bigger. </p><p>She didn’t pull back, however, more than happy to share the taste of the grape with me, while the other three played around with various parts of my body. Then, I noticed yet another beauty walking across the room, this one with assets large enough to almost rival the previous busty beauty I had fucked into unconsciousness, her tits jiggling, her hips swaying hypnotically with each step, radiating arousal. </p><p>She tapped the shoulders of the blondes who were busy worshipping my cock. “Give others a bit of chance as well, ladies,” she whispered. From the speed the other two pulled back, I guessed that she ranked higher in the totem pole of nobility, but that part wasn’t as interesting as the way her tits wrapped around my girth, moving up and down with a spectacular passion. </p><p>The second blonde pulled back, but the first one decided to stick around, rising up enough to start licking my chest muscles line by line even as her hands squeezed my arms, enjoying my muscular frame. I let one of my hands slip down to reward my latest visitor, groping her fabulous tits that were busy wrapping around my shaft. When the blonde decided to move down again, this time-bending down to capture the head between her lips. </p><p>It was a good time to properly cut loose, I thought even as I grabbed the hair of the curly beauty that was busy using her tits, pushing her down, and throwing the blonde one on top of her. “Kiss her,” I ordered even as I slipped into the blonde, pushing mercilessly. The resulting moan was spectacular, echoing in the room beautifully. Meanwhile, my hands landed on the generous hips of the one under her, slapping and squeezing, trusting the blonde to properly silence her. </p><p>Though, the blonde’s ability to keep her silent turned out to be faulty, because the moment I pulled out of her and slipped inside the wetness of the busty one, her cries rose unbidden. “Careful on your task,” I said even as I slapped the blonde’s ass, making her cry in pain, mixing it with the unobstructed moans of her temporary companions. </p><p>I started impaling both of them recklessly, shifting after every few pumps, but if their moans were any indicator, they didn’t exactly care about the intermittent service, the depth of my pushes clearly more than enough to compensate for shorter cycles. Seeing that they were sufficiently happy, I turned my gaze to the cuties who decided to take the role of a servant, one still carrying the wine, the other grapes. </p><p>I grabbed their hands simultaneously and pulled them closer, one on my right, the other on my left. “Wine,” I ordered. She immediately leaned down, allowing me to take a sip from the goblet, only to spill it badly when I surprised her by slipping my fingers into her naked wetness without a warning. She moaned as I turned to the doe-eyed beauty, only to find her already reaching down with a grape, her face alight with anticipation. </p><p>Luckily, I still had one unoccupied hand, rewarding her with another ruthless finger treatment, while the room filled with extreme moans. Meanwhile, the other women continued to watch in anticipation, creating a threat more likely to kill me from exhaustion if it wasn’t for my transformation. </p><p>I never have imagined a bunch of noblewomen could be more threatening than a chimera… </p>
