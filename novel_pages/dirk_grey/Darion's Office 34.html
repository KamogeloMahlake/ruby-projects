        <p>“Why the hell you drag me here?” said a familiar voice. Mia, Paisley recognized, cursing the fact that it was her. </p><p>She didn’t want to be seen by Mia. Not because she was naked. If that had been a concern, she wouldn’t have invited her to that private beach party. On the contrary, she loved rubbing her victories in. </p><p>However, she didn’t want to show her defeat, especially not when she had an audience. </p><p>She had a reputation to protect.</p><p>“Someone’s getting tense,” Darion whispered to her ear. “Do you want a massage?” </p><p>Paisley opened her mouth, ready to answer negatively, but as his hand started moving on her body, she held it back. His attitude made it clear that he had no intention of listening to her, so why should she bother with it. </p><p>She just stayed silent as his hands explored her body, listening to the discussion. </p><p>“I dragged you here because we can’t risk going to the other bathroom. It’s clear what’s going on,” Gina said.  </p><p>“What’s going on?” Mia asked, sounding determined. </p><p>“You’re selling out your pride, that’s why. I expected better out of my rival than giving out her boyfriend as a party favor. You know she chews out men and spits them out. Do you want a wreck as a boyfriend, or are you planning to dump him once she’s finished?” </p><p>As she listened to the discussion, Paisley couldn’t help but feel relaxed a bit. It was bad that she had lost control, but at least, her reputation was still intact. Maybe, if she could turn the tables — </p><p>“Oh, sweetie. You should know no man loves being neglected,” he whispered as he pushed her against the bathroom wall and grabbed her panties. </p><p>As she felt his fingers around her hips, she adjusted her thoughts. It was probably impossible for her to take control of him, but at least, she could hide the truth. </p><p>Certainly that, she added as he pushed her down, her naked knees pressing to the floor as she found herself in an extremely disadvantageous position. Not only she would serve him like a submissive, but also she had to be careful about not making any sound.</p><p>She could do it. </p><p>She had to do it. </p><p>Her reputation depended on it. </p><p>As his monster-filled her mouth, their unaware guests continued to talk. “I don’t appreciate such claims. I’m not pimping out my boyfriend.” </p><p>“Oh, so you’re saying it’s just incompetence. You haven’t sold him out, but he just wandered away. Do you ever hear yourself…” </p><p>“You’re just jealous because I got a deal despite all the trouble you went with hosting a private event…” </p><p>Paisley would have loved that argument, but at the moment, it felt mocking. It was supposed to show her strength, not work as an unintended mocking while she did her best not to gag on his monster cock like a back alley whore. </p><p>His cock tasted defeat … and the worst thing, she loved it. </p><p>“It’s so amusing to listen to them, right?” he whispered as if it was nothing more important than the weather. Not only he was dominating her, but also he was doing it with shocking ease. </p><p>She needed to find a way to get back the upper hand.  </p><p>“You’re speaking nonsense. I haven’t lost yet,” Gina shouted, which would have been enough to hold Paisley’s attention fully under different circumstances, but she was too busy keeping herself from moaning as he invaded her pussy once more to enjoy that outrage more than a second. </p><p>“Come on, honey, you can moan. I’m sure they will understand a sexy little thing like you can’t resist pleasure for so long.” </p><p>“Go to hell,” Paisley with all the anger she managed to gather … which, admittedly, was not much. Worse, her hips rose slightly in rebellion, allowing him even better access. </p><p>As if her loss required any other evidence. </p><p>Then, Gina started speaking even louder. “Maybe I should have a go with him as well if you’re so freely giving him around. It wouldn’t be anything much for your good college friend, right?” Gina said.</p><p>“Why, so that you can steal another boyfriend. Whore,” Mia shouted back, signaling that there was an even bigger acrimony between them than Paisley had guessed. In any other situation, she would have loved to know that, going as far as inviting Gina for a threesome and sharing the pictures with Mia. </p><p>Poking old wounds was fun. </p><p>Unfortunately, with Darion, any such attempt would end up predictably. </p><p>“S-slow down,” she begged, doing her best to keep her voice down, but failing. She was glad that the bathroom wasn’t very well isolated, and the music from the main hall blocked the sound … well, somewhat. She was still restricted to panting and soft gasps. Anything else would be caught. </p><p>“No, you wanted to borrow me, you borrow full experience. I don’t think my dear girlfriend could afford bad reviews from you…” </p><p>With that, Paisley abandoned herself to pleasure, hoping that they would go away soon so that she could enjoy her submission properly. </p><p>“I’ll see you around, my dear friend. And say hi to Darion from me. I want to get to know him better.” </p><p>“Bitch. It’ll be a cold day in hell when I trust you with a boyfriend.”</p><p>Paisley felt happy when she heard the door opening, but her hopes were distinguished when she heard running water. </p><p>Mia stayed. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>She did her best to keep her voice down, hoping that she would go away soon. Just another minute. </p><p>Then, Darion showed that he had other ideas. “Let’s go say hi to my dear lover,” he said, and opened the door. </p><p>“M-Madam Paisley,” she stammered in shock. </p><p>Paisley felt happy. At least, Mia failed to understand the exact nature of their fun. “F-feel free to leave or stay,” Paisley said, doing her best to sound smug and victorious, hoping that, after their discussion, it would be enough to make Mia retreat. </p><p>Then, her hopes were dashed by a single word, coming from behind her. “Stay.”</p>
