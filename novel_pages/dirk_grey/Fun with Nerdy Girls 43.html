        <p>I looked down, capturing the beautiful sight of the topless blonde bending over the desk, her skirt struggling to cover her amazing ass, her red garter belt and stockings adding a nice contrast to make the situation even more legendary. </p><p>As I watched her, I couldn’t help but think that, if every study session had such a beautiful reward in the end, I would have certainly studied more. </p><p>It was certainly superior to cheerleader parties after training. </p><p>“P-punishment,” she stammered, trying to sound afraid, but her acting bad enough to get the worst actress award even in a volunteer theater, her voice colored with arousal. </p><p>“Of course, how else you’re going to learn to be a proper tutor,” I said. She opened her mouth to answer, but before she could do so, my hand landed on her ass, earning a delicious moan. </p><p>I didn’t slap her hard, of course. If it was Sarah under me, I would have spanked her a lot harder, but unlike Sarah, Carrie didn’t enjoy the pain as much as she enjoyed the idea of punishment. “Let’s test your math skills properly,” I whispered as I spanked her ass again. “You have failed to explain real numbers, but at least show me that you know your natural numbers.” </p><p>“O-of course,” she whispered. “How?” </p><p>“Simple,” I said even as I spanked her ass softly again, but I flicked my phone with my other hand and did a quick search. “I’m going to spank you, and you’re going to count until you made a mistake.” </p><p>“T-that’s it,” she whispered. </p><p>“That’s it,” I answered with a smirk. Normally, the challenge of that was to count as the pain of spanking build-up, but I didn’t want to spank her that hard, meaning I needed another difficulty. “But, since you’re a genius, it shouldn’t be hard to count in prime numbers only, right?” I asked. </p><p>Her beautiful gasp was enough to show the difficulty of that, especially since I remember her dismissively mentioning that memorizing prime numbers was just another parlor trick that people did for quiz shows to look intelligent. </p><p>It was my honor to teach her that it was impossible to know what could come useful in different circumstances. </p><p>“Let’s start,” I whispered before I gave her a chance to argue against it, and my hand landed on her beautiful hips, hidden behind her skirt. </p><p>“T-two,” she started as I grabbed her skirt up, and rolled up, revealing her beautiful ass and her sopping wet lips, showing the after-effects of our extended foreplay. Since two was the only even prime number, it was only right for that spank to land on her skirt. </p><p>The others would land on her naked ass. </p><p>“Three, five, seven, e-eleven, thirteen,” she counted rapidly as my hand landed on her ass just as rapidly five times, though none of the hits were hard enough to actually distract her, barely more than soft caresses. I delivered the sixth one just as quick, but this time, her answer was delayed a bit. “S-seventeen,” she whispered. </p><p>I slapped again, this time a touch harder. She gasped, though more of a shock than pain. “Well, there needs to be a punishment for the delays and mistakes, right?” I whispered even as I let my fingers dance at her entrance for a fleeting moment, making it even harder for her to get the next one. </p><p>“T-twenty-three,” she whispered, only to gasp painfully as my hand landed again, this time hard enough to add the sting of pain in her tone.</p><p>“B-but I was fast this time,” she whispered. </p><p>“Yes, but you skipped nineteen,” I answered, my smug sense of victory suffocating my tone. It was exaggerated, of course, but it was hard to argue that the sense of smugness it provided was not negligible. </p><p>Carrie’s moan was soft, yet delicious. </p><p>“N-nineteen,” she whispered when another soft spank landed on her ass. </p><p>“No sweetie,” I whispered even as another spank landed on her bottom, this time on the opposite cheek, spreading the growing pinkness symmetrically. “You need to start from the beginning.” </p><p>Yet, this time, my fingers dipped down into her wetness, caressing it to make her answer even harder. “Two,” she mumbled between her bitten lips, trying to keep her voice contained as my fingers invaded her wetness, but failed spectacularly.  </p><p>I let out a defeated sigh, overdone on purpose. “Better, but try to speak clearer,” I whispered as I spanked her bottom once more. </p><p>“Three,” she continued, louder, but no clearer as her voice started to get invaded by the soft tremble in her tone. </p><p>“Better,” I said as I continued spanking. Though, admittedly, it was hard to qualify them as spanks as she counted rapidly and reached the count of fifties. They were more accurately classified as not-so-soft caresses. </p><p>Yet, just as she was about to reach a hundred, she stumbled once more. “Ninety-three,” she whispered, in a hurry to avoid another spank, only to follow by a gasp before I could spank, realizing her mistake. </p><p>This time, I decided to punish her mistake more viscerally. And, in our current position, there were two ways of escalating. One was to spank her harder, but while it would make it more challenging for her, it wasn’t something she would enjoy. </p><p>Luckily, I thought even as I pushed down my shorts and pressed my shaft against her entrance, that the second option was much more fitting for her preference. </p><p>It was impossible to contain my moan as I slipped into her wetness, but luckily, I wasn’t the only one that was facing that challenge as a matching cry let out of her hips. I impaled her only once, the sound of flesh hitting flesh ringing in the room. “Let’s start again,” I whispered, though my shaft stayed inside. </p><p>“T-two,” she whispered, only for me to impale her again, slapping her core to trigger a delicious moan as the sound of a different kind of slap exploded in the room once again. </p><p>“Three,” she whispered as I leaned forward, my hands firmly on her hips to stabilize, my breath falling on her neck, her body trapped between the desk and my body. “You’re doing much better, go on,” I whispered. “Maybe we should increase the challenge until we reach a thousand and I keep you on the edge as we play, what do you think?” </p><p>The way her body froze, in a manner I would have categorized as fear with erotic undertones, was beautiful, though not as beautiful as her tone. “N-no,” she stammered, her voice split between terror and arousal. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, knowing that it was impossible for her to accurately calculate them without making a simple mistake — not that she would have trouble normally, but forcing her to calculate in her mind while continuously distracting her physically was much different. “But then, we need a different challenge.” </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” she whispered erotically. </p><p>“Well, I start working at a stable pace, and you start counting. If you wait too long, you start again. If you can reach a hundred before you climax, you win, and if you climax first, I win.” </p><p>“And what do I get if I win?” she asked, though the confidence in her tone as she asked surprised me. I decided to keep the pace more aggressive just in case.” </p><p>“What do you want—“ I started, only for her to interrupt rapidly. </p><p>“I want you to seduce Irene and Ida, and do it before Friday,” she answered rapidly, too rapidly for it to be unprepared. “It’s not fair that they are the only ones missing the fun.” </p><p>“Oh, really, two targets,” I said, realizing that she had been baiting me all along. “Unfortunately, it’s not appropriate.” </p><p>“W-why?” she asked, unable to hide her disappointment. </p><p>“Well, it’s unfair for me to ask to seduce both of them with that little bet. If it was counting every prime number until a thousand—“ I continued, only to be interrupted again. </p><p>“Deal,” she said. </p><p>“Really?” I said, suddenly having a sinking feeling about our little bet. “Do you think you can—“ I continued, only to be interrupted. </p><p>“Are you afraid?” she whispered. </p><p>“As you wish,” I chuckled even as I felt stirrings of an unsettling feeling, making me realize that I might have been played even more thoroughly than I had expected. I tightened my grip around her hips and started working on her at a steady yet merciless pace, barely giving her enough time to refresh her breath before she could answer. </p><p>Yet, that didn’t prevent her from counting rapidly. “Two, three, five … forty-three, forty-seven … a hundred and one, a hundred and three …” Just like that, she had easily surpassed a hundred despite my deep invasion. </p><p>“You cheeky minx,” I said, unable to help but mutter in fascinated shock, realizing just how far she had been playing me. Not that the forfeit was not something horrible. On the contrary, I would have done a lot to get her permission in the first place. </p><p>But being tricked was interesting. </p><p>Maybe I should have realized caught onto that. Once her shyness was broken, she was really an interesting bundle of surprises. </p><p>Yet, even as her voice tensed, she rapidly climbed the numbers, two hundred soon reaching five hundred, then eight hundred, though I could feel her voice getting tenser and tenser. Technically, I could still win. All I needed was to let my hands join our little game and tease some of her more sensitive spots, triggering her climax early, but her achievement certainly deserved some respect as she worked on it steadily. </p><p>“Nine-hundred-ninety-seven,” she declared victoriously as she took a deep breath as she twisted her neck. The smug victory invading her face might have looked unattractive on someone else, but it only enhanced her cuteness. </p><p>Especially since she let out a loud cry moments later, filling the room with the amazing signals of her cries, signaling my spectacular defeat as she collapsed against the desk. </p><p>“You win,” I whispered, unable to help my smirk as I found myself on the losing side. </p><p>Well, only technically considering the forfeit, I admitted as I continued impaling her even as I grabbed her arms and pulled her up, not giving her a chance to catch her breath. </p><p>I imagined two beauties, one game-obsessed demure Asian, and one fantasy-obsessed redhead as I pushed deeper and deeper into Carrie… </p>
