        <p>“Such a basic mistake,” I muttered even as I looked down. “Maybe you deserve to get fired.” </p><p>“Please, no, sir,” she gasped, trying to sound distressed rather than aroused … a challenge she failed spectacularly. “I need this job. Maybe we can pretend that it didn’t happen.” </p><p>“Why don’t you show me just how much you need this job, then?” I said, enjoying the way she trembled. </p><p>I caught her gaze, only for a moment before she avoided it, but there was no hiding the desire bubbling underneath. She licked her lips, trying to combat her excitement. “What do I have to do?” she asked. </p><p>I could have just ordered her, of course, but it would be a pity after she had gone through the trouble of dressing for me. “Well, you’re a clever girl. Clumsy, but clever,” I said, her cheeks darkening slightly. “Why don’t you show me exactly how hard you’re willing to work to earn forgiveness.” </p><p>She trembled in excitement. “I… I… well, I will…” she stammered, trying to find an answer, but failed to come up with one, finding the words far more difficult to utter than doing and reaching my belt. I stopped her. That finally earned true distress. “D-did I do something wrong?” she asked, panicking.</p><p>“Tell me what are you going to do first,” I ordered, my smirk in full force. </p><p>Her distress disappeared just as quick when she realized we weren’t going to stop, leaving itself to a deep shyness. She stayed silent for several seconds, finding it difficult to speak. But, she pushed herself hard, took a deep breath — which enhanced her cleavage — and opened her mouth. “I … I’m going to give you a … handjob to earn forgiveness, sir,” she uttered, blushing beautifully. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I said, and she immediately reached for my belt, the hesitancy in her words nowhere to be seen as she grabbed my shaft with one hand and began to stroke up and down. Then, her other hand joined at the base. </p><p>She was aroused, but also a touch disappointed, suggesting that her initial plan was different, but she failed to admit it. </p><p>What an amusing little dilemma. </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I enjoyed her hands, gently dancing up and down. She was incredibly sexy, enough for me to ignore the buzzing of my phone … if it was anyone but Emily. </p><p>I reached my phone even as Tara’s hands slowed down. “Did I tell you to stop?” I admonished. </p><p>She trembled in excitement as my harsh order hit her. “N-no, sir, you did not,” she whispered. </p><p>I turned my attention on the message. ’This is the report you asked for,’ the message said, one with two attachments. The first was the report itself … the second one was a photo. </p><p>I checked the photo first, and saw that it was one that showed her in her bedroom, wearing one of the underwear sets we purchased. White and innocent, together with a short, semi-transparent nightie. It was very conservative compared to some of the other photos she had shared with me.</p><p>Except for one important detail. She didn’t use the app we used regularly, but sent it normally, meaning it would stay with me forever. I smiled, as it represented her growing trust in me. A spectacular benefit. </p><p>‘Spectacular as always,’ I wrote even as I enjoyed the continued dance of Tara’s hands, her movement getting smoother without my attention. ‘Why don’t you show me the others?’ </p><p>While I waited for an answer, I tapped the report, but before I started reading, I looked at Tara. “Keep your eyes open,” I ordered, and she shivered. </p><p>She immediately followed my order, her submissiveness stronger than her shyness. An excellent show, and while she kept that going, I started reading the report Emily prepared. My eyes widened as I parsed through the incredible amount of information that she prepared for me. Hundreds of pages, filled with many public records, press releases, and many other random information. Since they were not public companies, there was no convenient financial information that could be accessed, but it didn’t matter much. </p><p>I had enough information to overwhelm even my power, forcing me to overcharge it. As I pushed my power to the limit, several details started to emerge. Fuzzy and uncertain, but I started to get a sense of general direction. </p><p>While I was busy with that, I received another message. ‘Amazing work, and even more amazing pictures. Continue with both,’ I asked her as I enjoyed her next picture. She was wearing the same underwear, but her negligee was gone, and one of the bra straps was askew invitingly. </p><p>Making Tara’s work of driving me crazy much easier. </p><p>I wanted to split my attention between Tara and Emily. Unfortunately, I had a third task, repeatedly checking the security feed. It was getting close to the time to open the bar, and I didn’t want to get caught by an early visitor. </p><p>Luckily, occasionally checking the cameras was enough, allowing me to focus fully on my pleasure, coming from two beautiful supers. Tara’s hands danced more and more enthusiastically, while Emily shared yet another photo, this time even her bra was gone, though the pose was a mirror shot from the back, focusing on her beautiful ass with a generous side view. </p><p>Tara leaned forward, but I put a finger against her lips, stopping her. “Not without telling me what are you going to do first,” I said. </p><p>“Is this… Is this really necessary?” she whispered, but when I gazed at her, her meager resistance was quick to diminish. “O-of course, sir,” she stammered. But, as I waited for her to speak, she delayed almost a minute before admitting. “I … I want to … give you a … b-blowjob, sir,” she whispered, every second of her hesitancy beautiful. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I allowed. Just like before, the speed she leaned forward was far faster than her words. Her warm lips covered the head of my shaft momentarily before she dipped down, easily taking half despite the gagging that followed. She pulled back, but only for a moment before she pushed down even more, easily accepting the physical challenge after the earlier embarrassment. </p><p>Beautiful enough for me to ignore the temptation to grab her head and push her even lower. I just enjoyed the pace she determined, each second more beautiful than the other, begging me for a premature explosion. </p><p>Emily’s next message didn’t make things easier. She had changed into another set, this time an alluring soft green low-cut corset, complete with a garter belt. She was naughtier this time and deliberately took a high shot to enhance the cleavage even further. Then, she surprised me with a mirror shot that focused on her upper body from the back. </p><p>Just low enough to show that, this time it was the panties she ‘forgot’ to put on, but the pose didn’t reveal anything more. </p><p>At the same time, Tara grabbed my legs for leverage even as she pushed down even more, her nose touching my skin, a great contrast to her earlier state, where she had been having trouble saying the word blowjob.</p><p>Such a beautiful contradiction. </p><p>I bit my lip, trying to hold myself back, which was a troubling challenge as the assault from the two sides continued. </p><p>Tara pulled back for a fleeting second, coughing for a moment as she tried to replenish her breath before she went down once again. Not necessarily with her power, but some habits were hard to beat. Her lips strained around my girth once more before rapidly arriving at the base, her throat tight around my presence. </p><p>I found myself checking the cameras once more, just to distract myself from the upcoming explosion … only to freeze when I noticed a blur at the edge of one of the cameras. Something that was easy to ignore as a glitch even with my observation power, and only when I overcharged my power, I managed to get a better sense of what it was. </p><p>Some kind of extremely effective camouflage, nearly completely invisible. Either a hero or a villain. </p><p>I thought about reacting, but luckily, the figure wasn’t rushing forward directly, but taking a wide circle around the bar. For a moment, I hoped that the target was the warehouse … but as I watched its movement, there was no doubt about the exact target. </p><p>I needed to respond quickly … so I grabbed Tara’s head with both hands. “Very well, you earned your forgiveness,” I said as I pinned her in place — well, in a way, considering her power — before I started invading her throat aggressively. </p><p>Her moans showed she enjoyed it as much as I did, her body rocking with climax even as exploded into her mouth. She caught most, though the little that spilled on her chest made her look even sexier. </p><p>I made a note to make the intruder pay. “Quickly, go change to your bodyguard outfit,” I ordered even as I started watching the cameras once more. “We have visitors.” </p><p>She dashed upstairs, quick to follow my order. To my surprise, there was no fear … but only because she found my order confident and comforting. </p><p>While she disappeared, I watched the blur on the camera, trying to decide on the ideal strategy. </p>
