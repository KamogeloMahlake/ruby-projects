        <p>Fatima expected him to take her when he asked whether she was ready or not … but at that moment, she still had been hoping that he was going to drag her to her bedroom before starting, allowing her to finally use the room for a purpose it had been designed for. </p><p>That hope had died when he pushed her down against the couch … though she could hardly say it was a moment of great insight, as it was only a second between that realization and his monster pushing forward inside her.</p><p>A moan escaped her mouth as a feeling far more intense than anything she had ever felt in her life filled her. “We can stop if you don’t think you can handle it,” Darion said from behind her. It was a terrible time to ask that question, but Fatima didn’t tell that. </p><p>She had a feeling that the timing was deliberate. </p><p>A blush covered her face as she struggled to come up with an answer. Saying him to continue was too difficult for her, her shyness still somehow blocking her from admitting that. </p><p>“Answer me,” he said as he spanked her ass. </p><p>For a moment, she thought about playing coy and saying no, but that, she suppressed just quickly. “P-please continue,” she barely managed to whisper. </p><p>“Excellent,” Darion answered as he slapped her ass once more. It was supposed to be demeaning, but it felt incredibly amazing instead. “Now, let’s move it to a better location.” </p><p>“Really?” Fatima said, excited that they were finally moving to the privacy of her bedroom. </p><p>“Yes,” he said, and just like that, Fatima found herself floating in the air, easily lifted like she weighed nothing. </p><p>He took a step. “T-the stairs not that way,” Fatima corrected rapidly. “We can go from inside as well.” </p><p>“I know,” he answered as he took another step, bringing them in front of the couch, and no other. “Why bother going that much while we have this amazing couch here … and not to mention the amazing view.” </p><p>“But —“ she said, which was all she was able to say as he picked up speed, at a pace that she thought to be impossible in their current position. The explosion of pleasure was enough to rob her of any strength to argue. </p><p>Worst, she was happy with it. She was finally having the private party she hoped to have when she moved to the country, proving that she could handle that nightlife. </p><p>Passively, maybe, but still doing it spectacularly. “Harder,” she moaned. </p><p>“No,” he answered, shocking her. For a moment, she was afraid that they would stop, which was the worst thing she could imagine as the pleasure climbed up. “Do it yourself if you want it faster,” he ordered, spanking her ass as they landed. </p><p>“Y-you think I can handle it,” she whispered, a needy statement that contrasted the situation. She was afraid that, somehow, he’d ask her to stop. </p><p>Luckily, he did not. “As long as you put your sweet ass to it,” he said as he slapped her ass, and she moaned. Yet, she also moved her hips just as he requested. “Try holding onto my legs, the leverage will help,” he suggested. </p><p>Fatima followed that suggestion, her fingers landing on his shockingly hard muscles as her moans started to get out of control. As she moved more, her core started to get more and more drenched, reaching a level that was not possible. </p><p>She lost herself in pleasure… </p><p>Until, he spoke once more. “Damn, girl. I didn’t expect you to be this enthusiastic. It was an amazing warm-up,” he commented.</p><p>The gasp of protest left her mouth automatically. “W-warm up,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, yes. Warm up,” he said as his fingers wrapped under her legs, and suddenly, she found herself moving once more, his touch enough to control her pace. </p><p>“I — I see it now,” she moaned, losing herself in pleasure. She should have tried to exert some kind of control … but that hardly seemed possible or preferable. She abandoned herself to pleasure. </p><p>“Your moans are very beautiful,” he said, and she shivered in desire. The way his voice hit her ears was even more arousing than she expected. The intensity of his invasion was enough to tell that she was losing her connection with reality, the pleasure getting even more intense. “It sounds like you’re ready for the real experience.” </p><p>“R-real experience —“ Fatima started, which was all she was able to say before he flipped her over, and suddenly she found herself on her back, with him above her. </p><p>Missionary position. </p><p>It was supposed to be the most boring sexual position possible, but Darion put his full weight above her as he impaled her with a furious pace, the pleasure was intense enough to cut her last connection with reality. </p><p>Her legs parted open obediently, allowing him to invade her even more. </p><p>She enjoyed as he pinned her in place, one of her hands sneaking down to tease her clit to explode even more. “Oh, someone is feeling needy,” he muttered, noticing that. “Let me give that, then,” he said. </p><p>With that, his pace increased even more, completely destroying her connection with reality as they explored every inch of the couch. </p><p>Only too late, she realized she was forgetting something. “M-Mary,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me she’s watching us,” he said, his tone enough to make her shiver even more. “I thought she would sleep more after that spectacular fucking.” </p><p>“Y-you have been fucking her right now,” Fatima muttered shockingly. </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me that you are surprised by it. You already watched us in the morning.” </p><p>Fatima moaned as he pushed even deeper. “N-not that …” she admitted. “Your stamina….” </p><p>Darion chuckled at that even as he brought her to the short end of her couch. “Oh, sweetie, I have an amazing stamina. Don’t worry. You’ll learn that very well soon.” </p><p>Fatima realized that his words implied that it wasn’t a one-time thing, and it further implied that she wasn’t going to be the one that would set that schedule.</p><p>However, as her climax built up, she found it very difficult to correct her…</p>
