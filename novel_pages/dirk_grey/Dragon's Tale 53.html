        <p>Even with my supernatural endurance, it took two hours for me to exhaust the women that were climbing on me like I was a wall while there was a forest fire behind that they were trying to escape, afraid of me falling in exhaustion before it was their turn. </p><p>Luckily for them, I had more than enough endurance to send even the most hesitant ones to the land of happy unconsciousness, their expressions contorted in pleasure, murmuring softly, their bodies covered with the pink marks, reminding them some of the rougher treatments I had leaned for the disobedient ones, much to their pleasure. </p><p>Without a doubt, the barbarian visit to the party was a great success. </p><p>But hat success left one important detail, I thought even as I turned toward the center of the room, where three girls were sitting, a redhead, a blonde, and a brunette. Or more accurately, two girls were sitting, watching the show, while the third one was still on her knees, alternating between their legs. </p><p>Cera was a hard worker, I thought with a big smile. She deserved the social mobility she was so ceaselessly working forward without being exhausted. </p><p>Atia was a more interesting subject. She still looked at me angrily, doing her best to look scandalized with my daring, but even if I hadn’t recognized the signs of arousal dancing in her eyes, it was a hard attitude to sell after watching a full-blown orgy for the last two hours. Being forced by her friend was not a convincing excuse for her continuous presence. Or the fact that her dress was slid enough to reveal her surprisingly large breasts, looking amazing on her thin frame. </p><p>When she fixed her clothing even further as under my gaze stayed focused on her naked tits, hiding them from the view even as she looked at me angrily, like I had committed a sacrilege, and she wasn’t the one that had been watching me while I was fucking her noble peers into the land of unconsciousness. </p><p>Erasing that expression from her face was tempting, but with some reluctance, I turned my gaze to Olivia, who had been watching me with desire-filled eyes, her passion brighter than her red hair. She still stayed in her seat, making no motion to signal her willingness to be a part of the orgy that had just happened, but her eyes disagreed. </p><p>Still, I knew with a certainty that I could move forward, pull Cera from her current place between her legs, and replace her with my shaft, and she would have loved it. And since there was no servant currently in the room —all had been sent away at the beginning of the orgy— after I left her snoozing, I could finally start my search for the library, the whole point of my trip. </p><p>There was one big problem. Her expression. To her credit, she didn’t look at me with disdain —at least, no more than she looked at her own noble peers, she was just naturally smug. No, what annoyed me was the sense of absolute control she was radiating even as she sat there, her dress pooled around her waist to reveal her delicious body, inviting me to take her without a word. </p><p>No, I wanted her to beg for me to take her, forgetting her presence as a daughter of a Patrician house. Luckily, after spending months with Lillian, I perfected the art of making little haughty noble ladies beg to be taken. </p><p>“Satisfied?” I asked with a smug yet gruff tone as I looked at Olivia, not bothering to add any honorific, not even bothering to utter more than one sentence even as I closed in the distance. </p><p>“No, not really,” Olivia answered even as her gaze danced over my naked body even as she pushed Cera away, leaving her legs naked. As far as invitations go, it was a clearly attractive one. Too bad for her that I wanted an even more spectacular one. </p><p>“Too bad, I should work harder, then,” I murmured, but, rather than taking a step to cover the distance between us, I turned my attention toward her sexy blonde friend, who was yet to decide whether to be scandalized or aroused. “Maybe another show,” I added even as I grabbed her dress, ripping it off with one rough pull. </p><p>Atia’s expression was a thing of beauty, a paradoxical mixture of a rabbit cornered by a hungry lion and a sexy dancer aroused by the show she was providing. Three simultaneous gasps rang in the room as I raised the scraps of the dress high, enjoying the sight of Atia’s naked body. Also, it gave Olivia the opportunity to interrupt the show if she wished.  </p><p>But only for a second. </p><p>Then, I let my control slip away once more as I leaned down and grabbed Atia’s fabulous tits, grunting with desire as I squeezed the soft flesh and pulled at her adorable pink nipples, far too roughly to fit her identity as a noble lady. </p><p>She gasped in shock, but surprisingly, she made no move to pull back. “What are you doing, you mongrel!” she gasped, but her body didn’t agree with her words, her back arching perfectly to allow me to grab her breasts. </p><p>“Giving your dear friend another show, of course,” I said mockingly even as I leaned down even more and dropped my mouth to her cleavage, leaving teeth marks on previously pristine breasts, their pale beauty stained with my attention.</p><p>“You’re really daring” Olivia suddenly commented from the side, and I smiled at her smugly, like a barbarian warrior supposed to smile even when facing death, let alone a little naked noble lady’s snarky comments. Unfortunately, it turned out that Olivia had one last surprise, if her sudden smugness was any indicator. “Doing that to the heiress of the house Junia is a daring move. Aren’t you afraid that her father might take offense?” </p><p>I had to admit, Olivia’s surprise was deserving of her smugness. It was a really nasty one that she sprang on me. House Junia was arguably the first family among all the Patrician families, both in terms of history and in terms of achievements. </p><p>A list of achievements that included assassination by Marcus Junius Brutus, of Gaius Julius Caesar, the most preeminent member of now-extinct House Julia, after the defeat of the last member of the family who was also Caesar’s nephew, Gaius Octavius, indirectly gifting me with the amazing lost city I had discovered in the mountains of the Eastern Gallic. </p><p>Small world. </p><p>Of course, the thematic connection with my hidden location wasn’t the reason for Olivia’s smugness. No, that honor went to the fact that the Junia family was arguably the strongest family in Rome. Not only their current head of the family was serving one of the two Consuls —the single strongest political office in Rome, bar none— but also their family had many ex-consuls and ex-preators, therefore filling a significant portion of the Roman senate, which controlled the strongest army in the world. </p><p>It wasn’t inaccurate to say that, when House Junia moved, the world trembled. </p><p>The strategically smart thing would have been to pull back, and maybe even apologize to Atia. But the idea of retreating from the House Junia, after they had completely destroyed House Julia —and weakened their ally House Scipio which I belonged, to a point that they lost their status and escaped into the colonies— didn’t sit right to me. I owed bravery to Julia family after I had used their riches, and I owed my grandfather to make a mark by the Scipio family.</p><p>Well, and if I were to be honest, those thoughts were just additional justifications. Most importantly, I wanted to erase the smug smile on Olivia’s face. It wasn’t the smartest decision, but it was hard to act strategically when hovering above a sexy blonde, whose amazing bosom heaving invitingly under my hands.</p><p>Luckily, my acting abilities were rather impressive after the years I had spent in the school, so I managed to hide my conflict behind an expression of lazy disinterest. “So what? I’m not seeing her family here, do I?” </p><p>That answer turned out to be enough to get a shocked yet aroused glance from all three girls. After all, not every day one challenged the House Junia. </p><p>While they processed their shock, I leaned forward and captured Atia’s lips in a searing kiss, the kind that left her toes curled and her breath out of control. When I pulled back, her blush was spectacular. She tried to stammer, but it died rather quickly, leaving me with an enthusiastic smile on my lips. </p><p>Seeing that she had no intention to stop things, I leaned forward once more, this time pushing my weight on her body enough to feel the twin imprints of her breasts pressing into my chest. My skin shivered with pleasure even as I started kissing her aggressively once more, my tongue invading every single inch of her mouth. </p><p>Meanwhile, my hands joined the fray in a different way. They landed on her hips, squeezing hard to add a layer of sharpness to our kiss, something she appreciated if her muffled moans were any indicator. Seeing that, my hands started to wander around even more aggressively, exploring the wonderfully elegant curves of her body to discover her sensitive spots, giving occasional squeezes hard enough to extract cries. </p><p>She seemed to be rather happy about that part. </p><p>I never stopped the kiss even as I explored her body aggressively. Her lack of experience with the opposite sex was obvious from the speed she melted into my kiss. Soon, her fingers landed on my shoulders, her touch hesitant as she caressed my shoulders, tracing the scars and muscles alike. </p><p>Then, to my left, Cera suddenly moaned. I threw a curious glance, only to see Olivia fingering her aggressively while also squeezing her tits. The more interesting part was her expression, however, carrying more frustration than enjoyment, clearly shocked that her latest gambit failed in such a spectacular manner. Even as I watched, she curled her fingers inside Cera’s slit, provoking a long, shuttering cry.</p><p>Spectacular.</p><p>However, I turned my attention back to Atia after that momentary gaze. It wouldn’t have helped if one of them noticed my wandering attention, not at that moment. I tuned out Olivia’s delicious antics as best I could, my complete focus on kissing and caressing Atia’s hot, delicious body.</p><p>Quickly, I started to get the rewards of that single-minded focus. Atia’s breaths started to get more frantic, her body tenser, signaling an incoming climax. </p><p>I chose that moment to pull back. “So, my noble heiress from that vaunted House Junia, I have something really interesting in mind. Tell me to stop if you don’t want that.” </p><p>Despite her shyness and her unusual conservative attitude, the only thing that she was able to give was an absentminded nod. “Excellent,” I murmured even as I wrapped my hands around her waist, ready to change position. “Let’s play…” </p>
