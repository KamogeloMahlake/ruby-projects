        <p>For a moment, I said nothing, enjoying the sensation of my shaft pressing against Umi’s trembling back, my arms loose around her hips, giving her the opportunity to get away. </p><p>Fortunately, she lacked the willpower to do so, and continued staying on my lap, trying to understand the situation she found herself in as she used her hands as a bra. And Tiffany playing with water across us, her glorious breasts displayed perfectly, was not helping her to calm down. </p><p>Yet, she stayed, a combination of a potential promotion for her soon-to-be husband working together with her natural non-confrontational personality, even as my naked shaft pressed against her. </p><p>The fact that she was trying to hide what was going on from her new friend played a nice role in her mood as well. </p><p>Altogether, it was a spectacular situation. </p><p>And if there was one benefit of pushing her so far outside her comfort zone, her experiences about what was appropriate and what was not long abandoned as she trusted her new best friend about guiding her about appropriate behavior. </p><p>I let the moment stretch for a while before I slid one of my hands to her thighs, the other staying on her stomach, and start caressing softly, her skin softer than silk. “So, Tiffany,” I asked casually, like the situation was nothing out of ordinary. “Any stories about where you have purchased those bikinis?” </p><p>Umi tensed, but did nothing else as Tiffany answered. “Unfortunately, no,” she said with a mock exaggeration, quick to take my hint. “I have purchased them so long away that I forgot to have any stories.” </p><p>“Oh,  such a pity,” I answered. “A beautiful woman like you shouldn’t be bereft of stories. Maybe tomorrow, you should go shopping to buy some new ones to replace them, so that you can have stories to share.” </p><p>“A good sentiment, but how can I have stories if I shop alone. My husband hates shopping.” </p><p>I waited for a second, enjoying the way Umi shuffled self-consciously at the mention of Tiffany’s husband, no doubt indirectly remembering her own fiancee, but interestingly, that was not enough for her to ask for a change in seating. And, even with the limited view due to my angle, I could see her expression enough to ascertain that it was not just about hesitancy. </p><p>She was battling with arousal, a sensation that was clearly unfamiliar to her if her reaction was any indicator. </p><p>“I’m sure Umi wouldn’t mind accompanying you, would you sweetie?” I whispered into her ear, making her tremble badly. </p><p>“I-I wouldn’t mind,” she stammered, not expecting to be questioned. </p><p>“Good,” Tiffany said, her smile getting bigger before flickering. “Too bad that our family budget is stretched tight for the moment, and I can’t afford to splurge for a beautiful bikini,” she said, her sadness exaggerated. </p><p>“Well,” I answered, my smirk reminiscent of a wolf. “Maybe a little promotion could help you ease your worries?” I asked. </p><p>“A promotion, really!” Tiffany said, her earlier despondency replaced by an exaggerated cheer. “I’m sure my husband would love to receive that news.” </p><p>“I’m sure he will, if he gets it,” I answered, though it was mostly to remind Umi that there were tangible benefits to sacrificing her ethics for a bit of pleasure. The way she shuffled in my lap, confused and aroused, told me that it was a perfect mental hit. </p><p>“What do I need to do, boss,” Tiffany moaned softly as she leaned forward, her lips parted sensually. </p><p>I grabbed Umi’s waist and lifted her for a moment, freeing my shaft from the delicious pressure of her ass. She gasped in surprise as I kept her up, her shy voice echoing on the rooftop erotically, making me glad that I had reserved the whole area for our private use. </p><p>I shifted my position slightly before lowering her back, her hips pressing more to my stomach, my shaft peeking between her thighs even though it was still buried underwater. “Why don’t you show me just how much you need that promotion?” I asked. </p><p>“With pleasure,” Tiffany asked as she started leaning down, about to dip her head underwater. </p><p>“W-wait—“ Umi gasped, her eyes tracking Tiffany’s descent, surprised by the sudden escalation, yet, as I pressed my finger to her lips, she fell silent, observing as she slowly dipped down, her lips disappearing underwater. </p><p>Admittedly, Umi’s reaction was understandable. Even with the earlier escalations, what we had been doing was rather exaggerated. Making Tiffany service me in front of her, especially in a semi-public space, was one thing, but doing that while she was still on my lap was something else. </p><p>I Umi froze as Tiffany wrapped her lips around my girth underwater, the sensation delicious after our extended foreplay. Unfortunately, the bubbling water prevented it from turning into a visual show, so I reached the remote and stopped the water jets, making the water much clearer. </p><p>The resulting sight hardly helped Umi to calm down about the situation, making her murmur incoherently. However, I was fortunate enough to have enough experience to know that her morality was faltering against her burning arousal, her inexperience unable to handle our calculated seduction. </p><p>I saw no problem driving the dagger even deeper. “Such a loyal wife, isn’t she,” I whispered even as I put my hands to her stomach once more. “She’s doing her best to earn that husband a promotion that might bring mid-five figures extra income to their household.” </p><p>“M-mid-five figures,” she stammered in shock, though her shock wasn’t enough for her to pull her gaze away from the show that was going on between her legs. </p><p>“Of course,” I whispered. “A decent promotion in sales brings that much…” I added, letting it linger for a moment even as I let my hands separate, one climbing up, the other trailing down. The one that was moving up moved much faster, bypassing the limited barrier that her hands were providing to tease the edge of her breast, earning a moan. The other stayed at the edge of her bikini bottoms, not intruding further yet poised for an invasion. “… provided the boss is satisfied, of course.” </p><p>I kept my hands in place, letting her think my words, enjoying the way she trembled, her morals battling with her desires. “But, my fiancee…” she murmured. </p><p>I smirked at her words. A less experienced man might have assumed the mention of her fiancee signaled a danger, but she wasn’t the first committed woman I had seduced. I was familiar enough with a woman’s mind to know that she was just asking for assistance, that for me to provide an excuse for her. </p><p>“Don’t worry, you’re being loyal to him, putting yourself in the line to give him the promotion that he deserves. Imagine just how happier he would be being that successful.” </p><p>“Yes, but…” she murmured, her words once again could be construed as signs of her changing mind, but this time, there was no doubt. Not with the way her hands fell down, finally revealing her breasts for my gaze. </p><p>I let my fingers invade their pale expense for a moment as I stayed silent. As I squeezed her erect nipples, her cries exploded beautifully, suggesting just how overwhelming her tense pleasure had gotten during our extended teasing, one that stretched since the dinner we shared. </p><p>“What he doesn’t know wouldn’t hurt him,” I whispered into her ear like a devil, then my lips caught her earlobe, gently sucking as my fingers danced at the expanse of her surprisingly large breasts, enjoying their softness. </p><p>“M-maybe,” she whispered as she moaned, acting like she hadn’t come to a decision. But, considering that she was naked except for a tiny scrap of cloth that disguised itself as bikini bottom, rocking back and forth as her newest best friend kept her head buried in water between her soft legs while she did her best to teach a new meaning of pleasure to me, it was just another kind fiction. </p><p>I let that fiction survive for a moment more as my left hand continued to dance over her belly. “As you wish, sweetie,” I said as I pulled my lips away from her earlobe, though my right hand stayed in place to continue massaging her breasts. “Feel free to think as much as you want. No pressure.” </p><p>Of course, my version of no pressure didn’t carry a meaning of no pleasure along, I thought in amusement even as my lips moved down to clamp on her neck, teasing her softly. The surprised moan that escaped from her lips was simply beautiful, even as it told me that her fiancee was yet another incompetent man that knew nothing about the female body. </p><p>The neck was the first lock of the female body, and the surprising nature of her moan suggested even Umi was unaware of that fact. </p><p>I was about to decide what to do next, when Tiffany pulled up for a breather. “Finally,” she whispered, a whisper that went unnoticed by Umi, who was busy moaning in pleasure. </p><p>Though, she didn’t stay unaware of her presence when Tiffany grabbed the strings of her bikini, her only remaining part of her clothing…</p>
