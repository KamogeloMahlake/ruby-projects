        <p>I didn’t say much even as Astrid kissed me, expecting her to act hesitant once the initial shock had passed. She had given me the impression of a shy virgin. </p><p>But, I soon realized that I might have underestimated her. Virgin she might be, but shy, she was not. Not when she finally decided to act. Her fingers were already on my pants, enthusiastic to divest me from my clothing. </p><p>Curious about what she would do, I reached to her top, slowly untying the strings, curious whether she would stop. After all, we were still in a visible location. She did not. I thought about reminding her in case she had forgotten, but then decided against it. </p><p>She deserved to put on a show after peeking at us all those times. </p><p>Her clothes didn’t resist my tugs in the slightest, and soon, we were both equally naked. “You look beautiful,” I said even as she knelt down, her lips around my shaft. She closed her eyes as she pushed forward hard. </p><p>At that moment, I couldn’t help but suspect my earlier assessment. I had been sure that she never had any experience when it came to matters of flesh, but her actions made me reconsider it … for only a fleeting second. Her eyes widened in shock as my cock invaded her throat, enough to confirm that the sensation was utterly unfamiliar to her. </p><p>When the realization hit, it took all I had to not laugh out loud. Astrid was just as inexperienced as I assumed, but she was stubborn. Stubborn enough that, in her anger, she was more than ready to show Lillian she was better than her. </p><p>Even if that meant her first sexual experience was a desperate deep throat. </p><p>A nicer man might have helped her to stop, but I found her self-inflicted challenge too entertaining to stop. Instead, I have done something I wanted to do since we first met. I grabbed her breasts. </p><p>“They feel incredible,” I said. “Certainly the best I have ever felt.” </p><p>“Of course. I’m not one of your Roman girls that can starve any day,” she replied, pulling back just to mock Lillian, even as she coughed and wheezed. Her determination was impressive. While Lillian didn’t have her curves, she certainly wasn’t thin enough to justify such an insult. </p><p>I knew that intimately, because Lillian was merely a hundred feet away, between two trees for concealment, already naked, playing with herself as she enjoyed the show. It was a good visual reminder. </p><p>When Astrid closed her eyes to focus on her self-appointed task, I waved at Lillian. She responded in kind before focusing on her own task. “Why don’t you show me just how much better,” I said as I pulled out, only to slide between her breasts, pressing them together. </p><p>“L-like this,” she stammered as I fucked her tits, but her reaction didn’t prevent her from leaning down to capture the tip with her lips while my hips rocked. Astrid moaned loudly when she pulled back, making no attempt to restrain herself. </p><p>An obvious challenge to Lillian. I could see her standing in the distance, but I gestured for her to stay in place. Lillian looked frustrated and disappointed, but not enough to disobey my silent order. Good. </p><p>While the idea of them using me as a challenge in their weird rivalry was fun, Astrid was already pushing herself outside her comfort zone recklessly. </p><p>I didn’t want her to go too far and panic. I still needed her to teach me properly. While what she had taught me proved useful, ultimately, it was just the beginner stuff. That meant I had to make sure she was comfortable, no matter how much Lillian wanted to push her. </p><p>And, it wasn’t like getting a titjob from her while her pouty lips caressed my shaft was not amazing. I focused on the feeling, ignoring the fact that I could push her down and have my way with her. A fact that wasn’t appreciated by not just Lillian, but also my foreign instincts, roaring in protest. </p><p>Patience, I repeated even as I used the opportunity to get even more familiar with my instincts, hoping that it would help me to align with my vitae more. </p><p>I stayed passively, battling my foreign instincts and the pleasure at the same time, until my body finally surrendered to the pleasure, filling Astrid’s mouth with not only my seed but also mana. </p><p>“One delivery of mana, just as requested,” I whispered. Astrid shivered with pleasure as I leaned down, ready for more. Too bad there was one logical reason to stop. “Why don’t you go and meditate, so we can make sure it works for your magic as well.” </p><p>“T-that makes sense,” Astrid replied as she licked her lips, her tone an intriguing mix between disappointment and relief, showing that I wasn’t the only conflicted soul. She stood up and walked toward the spring, her naked hips enough to make me curse myself for listening to logic. </p><p>Still, that disappointment didn’t last long. She wasn’t going anywhere… </p>
