        <p>An enthusiastic smile invaded my face as I threw myself back, only to meet with the comfortable surface of the cushion, large enough to serve as a bed. </p><p>Albeit it would be difficult to fit all three of us, I was confident in my abilities to find a way. </p><p>I pulled the chain that was connected to the neck of the warrior, quickening her helpless crawl toward the cushion as the chain tightened. It would have been a cruel move if it wasn’t for the fact that she was just a construct. </p><p>The fact that she was a construct didn’t prevent signs of her intense anger, enough to bury her discomfort. </p><p>Delia was quick to stand next to me, her beautiful body on display, her amazing nudity and sexy pose almost enough to distract me from the intense, barely hidden anger she wore on her face, matching the one on the face of the warrior. </p><p>Of course, Delia’s intensity of it was too personal, but knowing she was also a construct, just helped me to make sure there was only one controller. </p><p>Also, it was her own fault that she brought the warrior out with a chain. I was just a poor man. </p><p>“Why don’t you sit down while your friend finishes crawling toward us, just like she deserves,” I said, enjoying her impotent anger. </p><p>Ultimately, it was her fault for bringing her out with a chain… </p><p>She was quick to obey me and sat next to me. I shifted slightly, so that my shaft rested against her legs, my touch enough to awaken her desire, and join to her intense anger. </p><p>The best part, the arousal was not fake.</p><p>I used the distraction my touch created on the controller to stretch a string of mana and touched the wards that were protecting the room. Most of the wards were strong enough that it would take considerably more than a momentary touch to unravel, but luckily, some of the additional benefits were provided by additional layers. </p><p>One of those additional layers was the silencing ward, which took only a touch to modify to allow the sounds from the other side to reach my ear — and only my ear — to avoid the attention of the decoys. </p><p>I had no doubt about that aspect. If there was one emotion I could distinguish easily, it was the ability to see whether it was genuine arousal. With the way I leveled, there was simply no doubt about that. </p><p>And Delia’s arousal boomed without the slightest restriction, a great contrast to the last time we shared a breakfast where every move of hers was intensely guarded, and only the intensity of her need and my masterful manipulations loosened her defenses. </p><p>It seemed that the princess had a different approach to physical fun while not using her own body to do so.  </p><p>She had shown that she wasn’t exactly very resistant to the temptation of pleasure, both then and now. Of course, at this point, the identity of the controller being the princess was still a theory. </p><p>But I was confident in my guess. </p><p>Still, it was hard to argue the fact that, at this moment, knowing the true identity of the controller was just for my personal edification, and not a condition to enjoy the constructs that had been created for me. </p><p>And enjoy them, I did. </p><p>“Oh,” Delia gasped as I grabbed her breast, squeezing hard to enjoy their amazing texture, my other hand still tugging the warrior closer. Once again, I decided to multitask, and filled Delia’s body with my mana. </p><p>Not even bothering to hide. </p><p>“W-what are you doing?” she gasped in shock as she realized that, but despite the gasp, her tone lacked the fear someone else would have carried against such a move, nor did she try to defend herself. </p><p>Perks of interacting through a decoy. </p><p>That disconnected attitude didn’t last for long, not when I cast a little biomancy spell, one that increased her sensitivity a few times, twisting her nipple as I did so.</p><p>[-62 Mana]</p><p>“W-what are you doing?” she repeated, this time with an urgency in her tone. I smiled, but it wasn’t Delia’s reaction that surprised me.</p><p>But a soft cry, unmistakably female, very similar to the voice of Delia, but with certain minor differences. It came from the other side of the wall, audible without alerting Delia and the warrior thanks to the modifications I applied on the silencing ward. </p><p>“Punishing you, of course,” I said as I twisted her nipple again, but this time, there was no gasp of pain from behind the wall. The reason…</p><p>The sudden flare of mana appeared from the other side of the wall before it traveled toward Delia, modifying the structure of the decoy. </p><p>The princess was cheating. </p><p>It didn’t annoy me, because that mana stream was useful to me in many other ways. It was a subtle manipulation, one that I would have missed if I wasn’t directly observing the termination point of the connection, but with that, I was able to identify the flow — one that I followed by sending a small flicker of mana back. </p><p>Trying to intrude on someone from such a great distance would have been difficult if I couldn’t use her connection as a pathway, using it as a track. Even then, I wasn’t able to do much through that trick. It just confirmed my earlier assumption. </p><p>It was the woman I named as not-Delia on the other side of the wall, managing the two decoys. </p><p>“Oh, it’s too much,” Delia moaned as I continued to squeeze her breast, but the earlier intense urgency was gone, replaced by a fake tone. A believable fake tone thanks to all the acting and seduction skills the magical puppet contained, but fake nonetheless. </p><p>I had to admit, the princess’ ability to adjust the feedback she was receiving ruined the pleasure I was receiving from the moment significantly, enough to tempt me to stop. </p><p>I would have done so if it wasn’t for the notification I received. </p><p>[+2500 Experience]</p><p>I might be aware of the fake nature of the view in front of me, but the same didn’t apply to the system. That failure had quite a few interesting implications for the limitation of the System. </p><p>And it would be lying to say if the free flow of experience was unwelcome. </p><p>I leaned against Delia, and without a warning, pulled the warrior on my lap, sheathing inside her mercilessly, using the same sensitivity trick to enhance her pleasure before the princess could adjust. </p><p>My reward, was another muffled moan from the other side of the room. </p><p>Compared to her moans, the moans of her magical puppets didn’t entertain me as much. Instead, I turned to Delia and asked a question while squeezing her breast. “Tell me, what exactly is this mission, and why are you that desperate to actually make someone else take the blame for it?” </p><p>If there was one other benefit to the little show I was putting on, it sufficiently distracted the princess, which delayed the answer quite a bit. “T-that’s not the —“ she started, only for me to slap her breast, and the princess made a noise once more, this time moaning in shock, louder than the previous ones. </p><p>Of course, that was not the only trick I pulled. I timed that spank in an attempt to interfere with her connection with the puppet. Faking a completely new response would have been difficult, but enhancing an already existent communication was a much simpler trick. </p><p>And, since the princess didn’t react it by attacking — or retreating — but trying to adjust the sensitivity of her puppet, it was also not as obvious as I feared. </p><p>I watched her adjustments carefully, my mana senses working in conjunction with the understanding given to me by Biomancy skill working wonders to understand her tricks. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to get a rudimentary control. Her tricks were certainly crude, little more than weakening or increasing all senses in a wholesale manner. And, since her mana manipulation abilities were smooth enough to achieve a more selective adjustment, I was more inclined to assume she lacked a healing-based skill to direct her. </p><p>Interesting, especially when considered together with her incredible ability to create fake skills. Pity the flimsy connection between us was not enough to explore the reason for that particular fact. </p><p>Still, it was good to know that there were limitations to such a scary ability.  </p><p>With her controller distracted, it took a while for the puppet to give the answer — not that I minded it while the second puppet allowed me to fill the time by allowing me to get closer to another level up.</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>“But, the princess —“ Delia managed to say, only to be interrupted by another spank — with the feedback enhanced, making the princess moan once more. </p><p>I decided to tease the princess a bit more. “Since she sent you two here to whore yourselves, the princess clearly needs this mission. What do you think I would not only decide not to do it, but go have a talk with the headmistress and make sure no one else from the school is allowed to do it?” </p><p>“No, please!” Delia gasped, this time a genuine panic — as indicated by a gasp that came from the other side of the room. </p><p>“Then, speak. I want every single detail about it. For example, why this mission is important enough that the other princes already started sending their agents to observe Silver Spires?”</p><p>“T-they wouldn’t—“ she started, only to receive another slap to her beautiful tits, the impact once again enough to make the princess gasp in pain, yet she was distracted enough to realize I had fiddled with her ward that was supposed to keep her silent, her beautiful real moans mixing with the fake gasps of her puppets. </p><p>“Honey, just because I’m paying attention to this slut —“ I said, slapping her ass to highlight my point — once again enhanced to get a moan off the princess — “… doesn’t mean that I suddenly lost my ability to think. The princess suddenly decides someone working directly under the headmistress to a sensitive mission in the capital rather than one of her loyal and capable handmaidens,” I murmured, then smirked. “Like the one that was good enough to actually get into the headmistress’ office without being noticed if I hadn’t been there,” I added. </p><p>This time, her reaction was much more spectacular. Both puppets started to gather their mana, ready to attack, but I just grabbed the chain around the throat of the warrior, activating the spell I buried on it while putting my other hand on Delia, challenging her attempt to gather mana. </p><p>Interestingly, while I felt the princess also gather her mana, it was much less than I expected, probably as a result of the puppets occupying her capabilities. </p><p>“Calm down, the headmistress doesn’t know about that yet,” I said with a soothing voice, then grabbed Delia’s tits once again. </p><p>“And, she wouldn’t know as long as you continue to be a good puppet,” I added, unable to suppress the temptation of throwing a little hint at the end. </p><p>They stilled, their mana calming down. I chuckled as I grabbed the hips of the warrior and quickened my invasion, using her to push toward the next level while they tried to get a handle on the latest revelation. </p><p>The visit was developing in a more interesting direction than I first expected…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 35 Experience: 604170 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7140 / 7140 Mana: 8561 / 8750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/130]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>
