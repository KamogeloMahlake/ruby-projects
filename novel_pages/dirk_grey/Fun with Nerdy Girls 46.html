        <p>After Naomi’s surprising — though, ultimately unsuccessful — attempt to dissuade me from visiting Irene, I expected Sarah to attempt that exact same thing as well, but, interestingly, she chose to stay away. </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder about the reason even as I drove toward Irene’s house with my bike, enjoying the wind on my body as I drove through the empty streets, the engine growling aggressively under me. </p><p>It might be a little risky, but that didn’t make it any less enjoyable. </p><p>The door opened the moment I entered the driveway. I expected Irene to be there, but it was Ida. </p><p>I was glad that I had been wearing my helmet, because the moment I took note of how she dressed, my eyes widened in shock. </p><p>Ida was wearing a colorful skirt, one that could be easily leveraged for other purposes, like a belt, or a bandana. It technically managed to cover her hips, but only because she was absolutely motionless, and there was no wind. </p><p>Most of her legs were covered with the thigh-high boots she was wearing, though they were a garish, bright red. Her crop top was modest, but only compared to the great, permanent danger her skirt provided. It had nice cleavage, enough to reveal that while Ida’s busts were not enough to compete with Carrie or Naomi, she could easily compete with Sarah. </p><p>With her thin stature, it looked even more impressive. </p><p>Her ensemble was complete with some kind of scarf around her neck, tied like a choker, with a lot of complicated lines. </p><p>Her ensemble looked roughly familiar to me, though it took a while to remember the source, one of the cartoons that played on the TV in the mornings, though it was barely an impression. I had never been one to enjoy cartoons. </p><p>Though, looking at Ida, maybe it was wrong for me to write them off as childish, if the benefits included the view in front of me. </p><p>Yet, I wasn’t the only one that was feeling shocked. My slightly widened gaze was nothing compared to the shocked look Ida wore on her face as I stepped down and removed my helmet. </p><p>It wasn’t too hard to understand the reason for her shock. </p><p>At the school, I dressed for invisibility, doing my best to maintain an ignoble aura to avoid the pointless distraction of school life — the current entanglement with my little group of nerds none-withstanding. </p><p>It was greatly different than my current bad boy looks, fitting jeans, a tight leather jacket and an even tighter t-shirt underneath to give a full map of my muscles.</p><p>A great departure from my state of invisibility. </p><p>Of course, thanks to Naomi’s loose lips, Ida already knew that my school attitude was just a facade, but there was a great difference between stories and reality. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk in amusement as I walked closer to her, each step making Ida tremble a little more, as if the closing distance reminded her of the reality of what she had signed for by volunteering to join the ploy.</p><p>Her gaze reminded me of Carrie, back when I had offered her the first exploration of her sensual side in the car, on a fateful weekday evening; afraid of what was to come, yet too curious to stay away, just like a beautiful butterfly drawn to a flame.  </p><p>She had the option to retreat, yet chose not to. “W-welcome,” she said, unable to prevent a shy stammer in her tone as I walked in. </p><p>“I hope I’m not late,” I asked. </p><p>“No, we were just starting,” she answered. </p><p>I didn’t answer that immediately. First, I lowered my gaze, then gave a very slow, sensual assessment of the way she dressed even as she shuffled uncomfortably. “Hmm, if this is just starting, I couldn’t wait for the main event,” I answered. </p><p>“R-right, come in,” she stammered before she turned her back and beat a hasty retreat — which was hardly the correct choice with her skirt, as she plied skirt rose to give me a beautiful glimpse of her underwear for an extended moment, which was surprisingly tiny, revealing most of her pale cheeks without impediment. </p><p>A very promising start to the evening, I decided even as I followed Ida inside. Yet, my surprises were not limited to that. Before I could take more than a couple steps inside, Irene appeared on top of the stairs, wearing some kind of complicated, armored pants that looked like it was part of a set. It was nothing compared to Ida’s beautiful micro skirt. </p><p>But Irene managed to compensate for that, because those pants were the only thing that she was wearing, leaving her top completely naked, her breasts jumping to motion as she came to a sudden stop. “Ida, did you see—“ she started, only to freeze as she registered my presence. A shocked gasp later, she run back panicked, and disappeared. </p><p>Ida threw a hesitant glare back at me, and seeing my naughty smirk, she started running up. I wanted to see her running the stairs, confident that she would forget just how amazing of a show she would provide me as she did so. </p><p>But, I had higher ambitions for it, especially since, unlike Irene, she had already learned from Naomi what awaited her on this evening adventure, yet still chose to hang around. So, before she could take her second step, I grabbed her wrist and prevented her retreat. </p><p>“There’s no hurry for you to help her,” I said, enjoying her widened gaze under my touch. </p><p>“But…” she whispered, but despite her growing panic, she didn’t try to get away. </p><p>I was planning to start our game slowly, but since Irene’s accidental flashing already set the scene,  adding to the fact that Ida had joined intentionally despite knowing the ultimate ending of Naomi’s visit — at least some of it, as I doubted Naomi explained every little detail with their little scuffle with Sarah — I decided to take a risk. </p><p>“So, I’m guessing you talked with Naomi?” I asked, enjoying the shock growing on her face as I challenged her openly. I stopped grabbing her arm, but other than a hesitant step she took backward, she didn’t move. </p><p>“W-what do you mean?” she asked, her panic growing. “S-she is my friend, of course, I talked with her. We talk a lot. There’s nothing wrong with that.” </p><p>I smirked, enjoying the way she folded rapidly under the weight of the moment, babbling without a direction as she tried to recover from her shock, only to push even deeper. </p><p>“I didn’t say that there’s anything wrong with that,” I said as I took a step forward, and she took two steps back — which, considering the height difference between us, was more or less equaled the same distance. </p><p>Amused, I took another step forward, but this time, she took only one step, because before she could take the second one, she found herself pressing against the couch, imprisoning her in place. </p><p>“So…” I said, my voice radiating smugness.  </p><p>“So, what…” she whispered back, her voice barely audible. </p><p>“Nothing much,” I said. “I was just feeling curious about just how much detail she had delivered a particular part of our adventures.” As I spoke slowly, her shock continued to grow steadily. </p><p>“W-what part,” she stammered. Her attempt to deny it was not a bad strategy. Too bad that her shocked expression didn’t leave even the slightest doubt about whether or not she had understood my not-so-hidden implications. </p><p>“Come on, Ida, you’re a smart girl. I’m sure you’re very much aware of what part I was talking about. Isn’t that right?” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she started before she steeled her expression. “A-actually, no!” she corrected her words a second later, her expression steeling for a moment. </p><p>Too bad that sudden courage shattered immediately the moment I touched her chin. “Are you saying that, a beautiful and smart girl like you don’t have the slightest idea what I’m talking about?” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she stammered again, but this time, her expression weakened even further. “Well, yes,” she admitted, surrendering. </p><p>“Excellent,” I whispered as I leaned forward, bringing my lips closer to her face, separated just by an inch, but not actually kissing her. “Then, are you ready for the next question?” She didn’t answer that, but her expression shouted she was certainly not even close to that point. </p><p>I still asked. </p><p>“Do you want to experience the same adventure?” I asked. </p><p>She didn’t say anything, just nodded hesitantly. While her nod was hesitant, her body was more honest. Her chest pushed out to enhance her cleavage, while her legs parted invitingly. </p><p>I had no doubt that, if I chose to push forward at that moment, I would get my victory. </p><p>Too bad that doing so would mean missing the opportunity to complete both stages of the plan at once. </p><p>“Excellent. Then, it should be acceptable for me to test your willingness, right?” I said. She nodded again, dazed. “Give me your panties.” </p><p>That was enough to break through her daze. “W-what?” she stammered. </p><p>“It should be simple enough,” I said. “Give me your panties right now if you want to experience the same ecstasy Naomi had enjoyed.” </p><p>“But—“ she started, but I put my finger on her lips. </p><p>“No buts,” I said as I opened my hand. “Give me your panties, or you’ll just watch while I ask Irene the same question. But maybe it would be enough to watch, right?” </p><p>Her expression of conflict was beautiful, but not as beautiful as the speed with her hands disappearing under her skirt and started dragging down her panties, abandoning their protection — which was rather essential with the skirt she was wearing. </p><p>I took a step back once she passed them to me. “See, was that so hard,” I whispered throatily. “Now, you can go and talk with your friend. You shouldn’t neglect her after she experienced such a harrowing mistake,” I said. </p><p>The sudden change of pace didn’t lessen her shock, but she was obedient as she started climbing the stairs. Her hands were locked tight around her skirt to prevent any accidental reveal, tempting me to ask her to move faster just to get a glimpse. </p><p>Yet, I let her climb unimpeded until she arrived at the top of the stairs. Only then I chose to speak. “Also, you’re not allowed to put any for the rest of the night,” I ordered. </p><p>The whimper she let out as she disappeared was simply spectacular… </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
