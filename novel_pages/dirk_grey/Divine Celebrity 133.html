        <p>I didn’t say anything as Megan declared her lifelong ambition, instead watching her. She looked determined at first, but as I didn’t answer, I could see her expression flicker with a rare lack of confidence. It was clearly something that was important to her, and I doubted she even let many people know. </p><p>I could see that, if it wasn’t for a combination of factors, which included our weird yet close relationship, her actual need for assistance around my fame, and the intense guilt she was feeling for almost putting me into a very problematic situation, she would have avoided revealing it. </p><p>But, she did, and my lack of reaction was making her self-conscious. Of course, with the way she handled it, it didn’t take long for her to assume I was acting dismissive of her dreams, treating her like a bimbo airhead that didn’t understand what she had just told me, and acted as if she could never be successful in that dream. </p><p>Of course, those emotions flashed on her face rapidly, and without my most recent improvement, I would have missed most of them. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said, just as she was tensing to stand up. “I’m guessing you already have a business plan.” </p><p>“Of course,” she growled as she looked at me. “Who do you think am I, a hack?” Though, as much as she tried to sound angry, she couldn’t hide the relief in her tone. The fact that I didn’t laugh at her but actually took her seriously made her relieved. </p><p>“Do you mind if I look at it?” I asked. </p><p>“If you think you can understand it,” she answered bitingly, but she still pulled a tablet from her bag and passed it to me. A spreadsheet was already open. Curious, I started going through its complicated sheets, most of the details going over my head as I lacked the necessary business knowledge. </p><p>Still, I could see a master plan, one that covered the next ten years and factored in more than a dozen businesses, some predictable like fashion, some surprising, like technology. Each industry had hundreds of different possibilities, entrance points, and segments that could be synergized with each other. </p><p>Far more ambitious than I had ever expected. </p><p>What an interesting girl, I thought with a chuckle, realizing that we had even more in common. Even before I had the fortune — or misfortune, as the jury was still out about the ultimate impact — of receiving the system, I had a plan, and I was doing my best to work for that. </p><p>Hers was more ambitious than mine, clearly. Mine was more about graduating without debts and getting a decent job, but that was more about our starting points in life than anything else. </p><p>And, with the System helping me, I was already updating my future plans. Those plans were very nebulous, reliant on the future capabilities of the System as well as the enemies it would bring…</p><p>But I could see the advantages of having some pull in the more ordinary world of business. I had already thought about that, but discarded it. The business was a complicated world, one that required more attention than I could afford to give… </p><p>And, except for rare situations, didn’t bring fame. And even in the rare cases it did, it was hardly the intense, explosive attention that the System clearly and desperately needed. </p><p>But, an alliance, on the other hand… </p><p>“That’s an ambitious plan,” I murmured as I went over it, taking note of her plans. “There are some fascinating ideas here. I’m guessing the idea was to ally with them to launch some kind of fashion line quickly.” </p><p>Megan looked surprised. </p><p>“Why the expression?” I asked. “Don’t tell me you didn’t expect me to understand what I had just read?” Her sheepish expression told me the answer. “You should have realized by now that I’m not just a jock,” I answered with a chuckle. </p><p>“The jury is still out,” she answered, and I chuckled at her expression before going back to the technical details of the issue.</p><p>“So, what are your plans for the fashion industry next?” I asked. </p><p>Just like that, the frown on her face reappeared. “It’s a tough call,” she answered. “I probably have to abandon those.” </p><p>“Why?” I asked. “I know they are a big producer, but they are hardly the only one even in our city.” </p><p>“It’s hard to be taken seriously by the local workshops without the support of an established player. And while there are other companies, none of the local companies will work with me with them blocking it.” </p><p>To her credit, she was aware that her own actions were the thing that forced me to confront Coach Spencer and didn’t try to blame me, even indirectly. </p><p>“What about the suppliers from the other cities, or the international ones? Can’t you make a deal with them? I remember your initial business plan was like that.” </p><p>“No, it wouldn’t work,” she answered. “I need a global team to arrange that, people to oversee production, work with customs, arrange warehousing… Not to mention, the delivery would take months, forcing me to lock my cash flow there. The risk profile is simply too complicated.” </p><p>“I understand,” I answered, looking thoughtful. “Pity, it seems that it doesn’t look like it will be successful unless they experience a big misfortune,” I said. I was tempted to launch the video immediately, as the timing would have been fascinating, but it would have been too suspicious. </p><p>I liked Megan. She and I were very similar. But it was the exact reason I didn’t trust her. Not in a criminal matter. </p><p>Instead, I decided to create an excuse. “By the way, I remember them talking about a reporter.” </p><p>“Yes. They had mentioned one from a national magazine had an arrangement. Having a short interview with her was a part of the deal as well…” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said as I reached my Intent, letting my voice have a convincing, hypnotic quality. “Still, I think it’s suspicious. Why should someone from a national magazine bother coming to our little corner? It’s not like they are important enough to earn that.” </p><p>“Favors, bribery, corruption? Have your pick,” Megan answered, not particularly interested now that her opportunity was lost. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said. “But there’s some suspicious stuff going on. I had already seen a member of their team walking around the office.” </p><p>“Really?” Megan said, intrigued. “Marl was complaining that they were late.” </p><p>“That’s the interesting part,” I answered. “He was at the reception at the same time as me, but he didn’t mention his correct name. I noticed his entrance card in his wallet, and he made sure the receptionist didn’t see it as well?” </p><p>“Maybe they sent someone to dig some dirt,” Megan said, enthusiastic and joking, but I could see that my tone already made an impression on her. </p><p>Excellent. </p><p>“By the way, if you’re interested, I would be interested in cooperating more intensely on business matters,” I said. </p><p>“Really, what do you have in mind?” </p><p>“I could be the face of your male fashion line once you manage to launch it. I’m sure you can twist my identity as both a player and a coach to something fascinating.” </p><p>“Wouldn’t work. You can’t play anymore due to a health report,” she cut in. </p><p>“Already solved,” I said, and her eyes widened. “Meaning, I would be interested in that … for a decent amount of share, of course,” I added. </p><p>“Shares, that’s ambitious,” Megan answered, her expression immediately serious.</p><p>“Fifteen percent as a silent partner, take it or leave it,” I answered. It was not the maximum I could ask, but I didn’t try to maximize it. Some immediate cash flow, and the excuse to start making some moves was all I needed at the moment. </p><p>“As long as it’s just the fashion line and not the whole business, acceptable,” Megan said. </p><p>“Others, we can discuss separately as long as you need my cooperation,” I answered. “Pity we can’t launch it immediately.” </p><p>“Yeah, a pity,” Megan answered sadly. I let the discussion fade into the less important topics while I continued to drink my coffee. </p><p>Then, I finally noticed a news van pulling into the parking lot, giving me the timing I needed. Everyone would blame the magazine for arranging the hack and timing their arrival … but I hardly cared. More importantly, I had a feeling that, their bosses wouldn’t care much either. </p><p>With a smirk, I pressed a button on my phone, one that triggered the script I had set earlier … flooding the web with the news. </p><p>Megan ignored the first buzzing of her phone, but as it continued, she checked it, her eyes widening as she read it. “Holy hell, you were right!” she gasped as she showed her phone to me. “They actually had a plan.” </p><p>“I told you so,” I said, happy that she completely ignored the possibility that I had something to do with it. To her credit, it was really absurd to think I somehow arranged it in a few minutes I had been on the premises … but with my most recent improvements, I was that good. </p><p>She continued to watch the video, then her eyes widened. “It looks like we’ll have that cooperation after all,” she gasped as she stood up, already running. “I have a lot of things to handle, keep your schedule open,” she ordered. </p><p>I chuckled as I watched her dash away, happy about the change. But, that smile disappeared a moment later, when I felt a distinct stirring of Intent flow. Something was different…</p>
