        <p>I had several more messages on my way back, but after checking the first few and saw they were filled with Carrie begging for help unconvincingly, each with a photo of her hands and legs tied — or convincingly — I didn’t check the rest, and focused on the drive.  </p><p>Ten minutes later, I parked my bike in front of my house, and walked inside. </p><p>And met with a sight that made all my hurrying worth it. Carrie was in the middle of the living room, wearing nothing but ropes that immobilized her with great effectiveness yet hid neither her erect nipples nor her aroused smile. </p><p>She was such a naughty girl. </p><p>Ida was not that much better as she moved around Carrie without stopping, taking a great number of photos; and unlike Carrie, who shared her naughty smile with me, Ida was fully distracted by her task, to the point of missing my steady approach as I closed in, her expression sharp. </p><p>She failed to notice my approach as I closed in, her attention wholly dedicated to her task — though that dedication wasn’t enough to hide the arousal on her face — which might have been surprising for me if it wasn’t for the earlier adventure with Irene, where she proved that the enjoyment she derived from the camera was not limited to intellectual boost of art. </p><p>And, how Carrie’s nakedness and tied to the state helped the more carnal aspects of her photography … was too obvious to discuss. </p><p>“What a nice picture,” I whispered once I arrived directly behind her. </p><p>“Yes, it is,” Ida answered calmly, the slightest jump she had given the only sign of her surprise. </p><p>“Help me, my hero,” Carrie moaned seductively, which widened my smile. No matter how many times I had seen it, her transformation was always fascinating. </p><p>“I don’t know…” I answered with a smirk as I turned my attention to Ida, who also looked amazing in her mini-skirt and blouse combo — especially whenever she leaned forward enough to reveal she was s lacking an important part of her outfit. “Maybe I should join your kidnapper, especially since you were silly enough to actually invite her inside.”  </p><p>“Nooo!” Carrie gasped, but even with her tone, her attitude was amazingly playful, showing that she had no problem with the path I had taken. “That’s treason!” </p><p>“Sorry, princess,” I said with a chuckle as I wrapped my arm around Ida’s waist, the touch enough to confirm that her panties weren’t the only underwear she was missing. “But what you don’t know is that I had already allied with the sexy ninja here to get your blackmail pictures. It’s not even the first time we collaborated.”</p><p>“I-it’s not, who!” Carrie gasped, her tone exaggerated enough not to be believable. Which was just as well, considering Ida was there at the lunch table when we arranged the photoshoot. Hardly something that could be dismissed. </p><p>“A sexy barbarian princess…” I said, though I failed to remember the name she had been using, cutting my words short. Not that it was an important detail. </p><p>“Oh, no, betrayal,” Carrie gasped. “Please, don’t ravish me, I can’t handle it,” she gasped, her voice the most erotic I had ever heard, though the ropes around her prevented her from parting her legs invitingly. </p><p>Her struggle just made the view even more beautiful. </p><p>“Of course not,” I said with a chuckle. “I won’t do such a thing. Don’t worry, I’m not a monster.” </p><p>“You … won’t,” Carrie answered, though, unlike her previous words, she sounded confused. Understandable, as it was certainly not the answer she expected to receive, not after going through all the trouble of arranging such a beautiful setup, even bringing someone to record us.  </p><p>Too bad she had picked the wrong assistant. </p><p>“Of course not, not when I have my trusty ninja to sate my lust,” I answered with a smirk, enjoying her flickering expression,  dancing between shock, frustration, and desire.  </p><p>Lots and lots of desire. </p><p>“Hey, I don’t —“ Ida started, but when I grabbed her hair and pulled her into a kiss, the enthusiasm of her tongue didn’t agree with her harsh tone. </p><p>Not that I blamed her. When Irene’s parents arrived, it was her fun that had been blocked — and her heated kiss showed just how badly she wanted to continue. Yet, the moment she pulled back, her gaze shifted to Carrie and she reflexively raised her camera.</p><p>It showed just how badly she wanted to take those photos as well. Luckily for her, I was clever enough to have a functional workaround. “Imagine just how frustrated she’ll look as we put a show for her, yet she can’t join,” I stage-whispered, loud enough to make sure Carrie heard every word. “Imagine just how beautiful those portraits would be.” </p><p>“Nooo!” Carrie gasped once more, but this time, her panic was much more honest. </p><p>I just smirked, enjoying her wrapped state. I wondered if she appreciated the speed her simple plot twisted to lock her. </p><p>The perfect lesson for her to learn. “Yes,” I said with a chuckle as I grabbed quickly get rid of her top, but I continued to hold her. A part of it was the sensation of her naked waist, but another part was to prevent a painful collapse. My help was vital with her legs trembling badly. </p><p>“What do you mean, yes?” Carrie gasped in a shocked tone, showing that she had never considered that answer. </p><p>“Very simple word, yes, commonly used to convey an affirmative message,” I explained, replicating the serious tone she wore whenever she explained a complicated topic. A successful one, if Ida’s beautiful chuckle was any indicator. “It’s finally time for you to take the other side after Naomi and Irene,” I said. </p><p>“But—“ Carrie gasped as she looked at Ida, thinking that I had just slipped a dangerous secret by referring to Naomi. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said with a chuckle. “Naomi had already spilled what happened to Ida, and she came prepared,” I said. This time, it was Ida that flinched at the mention, but my finger was already on her lips to silence her. “Don’t bother arguing,” I repeated,  this time whispering to Ida. “You’re not as good as you think you are trying to hide your reaction, especially without your precious clutch in hand,” I added with a chuckle. </p><p>Ida froze. A nicer man might have given her a moment to process that, but I was more of a believer in equal opportunities. Since she was more than happy ambushing a friend and imprisoning others — though both in dubious circumstances — I saw no problems pushing for more either. </p><p>Instead, I gave her what she wanted. “Keep your camera on Carrie’s face,” I said as I let my hands move down, slipping under her skirt, the following moan leaving no doubt where exactly I was busying myself. </p><p>That was enough to empower her, allowing her to move past the shame of getting caught. She split her attention between taking photos and moving her hips, assisting my fingers to explore her core. One hand stayed there, but the other climbed up. </p><p>First to her breasts, her nipples hard and sensitive, worthy of delaying my fingers … temporarily, before I continued to climb upward, ending up around her head.  </p><p>I grabbed her hair, the pull hard enough to be painful. A moan was her only reaction as she continued taking photos,  one after another, recording Carrie’s expression, shifting slowly yet steadily.</p><p>Help was on the way, I decided. Leveraging the opportunity, my tongue slipped into her mouth, ravaging aggressively. </p><p>Her tongue responded, just as aggressively, allowing me to enjoy her dual personality even more. Her hips pushed back, pressing against my waist to test my erection — even though she had to tiptoe to align with it perfectly. </p><p>Her tongue quickened, and so were her hips, to the point that, for a moment, even her photography took the backseat. I continued kissing, curious whether she would completely abandon her art to enjoy the show. </p><p>However, my expectations of an early capitulation died a minute later, when she pulled back from the kiss just as decisively, focusing on her photography once more. I might have even felt bad if it wasn’t for her desperate panting, showing that it hadn’t been an easy choice. </p><p>Curious about her resolve, I walked away. She turned to face me, only to realize, in that quick few steps, I had already managed to get rid of all my clothes. “Feel free to take a rest whenever you feel exhausted,”  I said as I sat down. </p><p>My erection was positioned perfectly, enough that she turned her camera to me, taking a few quick photos before turning back to Carrie.</p><p>But even as she did so, I smirked, because every time she turned, she was taking a step toward me, getting closer and closer. Another minute, and she was standing in front of me, bent forward sharply enough that her core hid nothing from me. </p><p>“Maybe I should rest a bit,” she whispered as she started lowering herself…</p>
