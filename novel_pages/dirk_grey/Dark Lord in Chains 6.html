        <p>Not exploding into an amused chuckle was one of the hardest things I had ever managed to accomplish in my life, especially when I could feel Emma exuding shame and arousal in my mind in equal amounts, both several times thicker than the sense of accomplishment she felt in my mind. </p><p>I waited with great interest as she stayed in my mind, battling with her own emotions, trying to decide whether she wanted to continue or pull back. Then, she took a deep breath, and her determination intensified, signaling her answer. </p><p>Curious, I thought, even as I started playing with the memory that kept the second key in. I could have tortured her with some of the more intense memories from my battles, but compared to the other possibilities, it was plain boring. Instead, I picked a memory where I went swimming with my bodyguards —a pair of sexy blonde twins that were as skillful in the bed as they were skilled in combat magic— a session that started with skinny-dipping and ended in all three of us collapsing, exhausted after a couple of hours of aggressive lovemaking… </p><p>As Emma’s mental probe moved through my sea of memories —and occasionally touching other sexy memories that I had intentionally put on her way. At first, she just jerked away from those memories, the touch-only lasting for a moment. However, after the first few, her mental agility suffered suspiciously, and the contacts started to last for a couple of seconds before separation, each making her face blush more. </p><p>The real surprise, however, was the second memory. The moment she touched it, she was sucked inside, and found herself unable to extract herself, forced the watch the memory from beginning to end, uninterrupted… </p><p>Even though the memory flow was several times higher than real life, it still meant that I had around ten minutes where I could act without her attention. I cut my finger, and started writing several more blood runes, carefully guiding my magic into the cracks of the chains. I was careful not to flare my magic, not wanting to alert Emma to what was going on, not to mention I didn’t want to damage the surface of the chains. </p><p>Instead, I used the previous cracks to reach the core of the chains, drilling them carefully but steadily, until I was confident that the crack was large enough that I could finish the job alone. And just like that, completing the first step of my freedom journey. </p><p>Such an occasion deserved a celebration. </p><p>Luckily, Emma had volunteered for my celebration. As she was stuck in the memory, forced to watch the full event while experiencing the echoes of emotions, her face was red, her breathing out of control. She was even letting out occasional moans, no louder than a whisper, but still enough to make my shaft throb. </p><p>She was surprisingly naughty, I noted, especially I realized one of her hands reached to her blouse, and cupped her breast over her blouse, leveraging her lack of a bra to maximum effectiveness. Her soft moans got louder in an instant, but her eyes were still closed as she gave her full focus on the memory itself, while her struggles to make the memory stop fading away… </p><p>In her defense, her reaction was very much justified. The show I had put together that day had been rather spectacular, fucking my sexy twin bodyguards into a pleasure-filled land of unconsciousness through an impressive number of positions, and she was getting an accelerated show of it. </p><p>Soon, things got even more heated as her other hand joined the first, and started mauling her breasts recklessly. I decided to help her a bit, and cast a spell —slowly and carefully not to alert her with the mana flare— preventing her from climaxing through her own efforts. It was a rather invasive spell that would have been noticed if her mental focus wasn’t currently in my sea of consciousness, enjoying the show I was putting on. </p><p>This vulnerability was the exact reason she tried to ensure I would stay unconscious through several potions. </p><p>With that done, I lay back, enjoying the show as she played with herself, unaware of my observation. When the memory ended, her eyes opened immediately rather than trying to move back toward the treasure chest in my mind. Her irises wide, and she was gasping repeatedly, but her hands were still on her breasts, desperately squeezing. </p><p>I subtly observed her from my cracked eyelids, feeling a bit frustrated as well. How could I not feel like that, when Emma had interrupted the delicious handjob I had been receiving, only to provide me an amazing show of her playing with herself. The frustrated but erotic growl that escaped her mouth made my cock twitch, but luckily, she had other priorities. </p><p>“Fucking bastard,” she murmured a few seconds later, but she wasn’t looking at my face. No, instead, her gaze fell down between my legs, where my shaft was creating an intimidating sight. “It’s such a degenerate thing to do, hiding the keys of your thoughts in such impure scenes. Unfortunately for you, my teacher is right. I have a natural talent for mental spells, and I’m going to strip down all of your secrets. No matter how disgusting the process is!” she said loudly. </p><p>Of course, her angry monologue that was mired with insults would have been more believable if she stopped playing with her tits as she delivered her words. Instead, she made it obvious that her anger was just a clutch for her to deny reality. </p><p>However, I was more interested in the identity of her so-called teacher who had told her that she had natural talent toward mind magic, because it simply wasn’t true. If she had entered into my mind while I was actually unconscious, even with the help from the potions, she would have been hurt as bad as me, maybe even worse. So, either her teacher was completely incompetent, or malicious. I didn’t know which was true, nor I wanted to waste my time considering it, because my attention was grabbed by the sudden movement of her hand. </p><p>Her hand disappeared under her skirt, while riding it up in the process enough to give me a beautiful glimpse of the fair skin of her inner thighs, begging to be bitten to leave a red mark of ownership. While the skirt prevented me from seeing under her skirt, I could still listen to the wet slipping of her hands while she searched for a release that continued to avoid her desire. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I had long ensured that her search would be fruitless, building her arousal more with each passing second. “Fuck,” she moaned after ten minutes of effort while continuing to play with herself. Her gaze fell on my face, but this time, reflecting a mixture of anger and desire. “It’s all your fault, I can’t keep those memories away from my mind.” </p><p>She took a deep breath as she crouched next to me, one hand still between her legs but the one that was on her chest slid away, giving me an amazing view of her cleavage once more, this time crowned with her erect nipples. “It’s all your fault,” she repeated, like she was trying to encourage herself. “And I’m sure that your memories about your body are inaccurate, just a delusion of yours. A monster like you could never have such a body…” she murmured, anger on her tone not matching with the desperate movements of her fingers as she unbuttoned my shirt before starting to caress my muscles, which started from my chest, and moved downward in determination. </p><p>After hanging around my abs for a long while, caressing the edges like she tried to convince herself that there were real, she suddenly removed my pants, revealing my shaft immediately, making her the second member of Lancelot’s party of Good to wrap her fingers around my naked shaft. Lancelot was really neglecting his lady friends…</p><p>As a guest, I owed him to pick the slack. </p><p>I watched as Emma slowly caressed my shaft, no more skilled than Aria when it came to proper technique, but learning even faster, probably because she had watched several of my memories, giving her a lot of experience. </p><p>Unfortunately, rather than continuing the task at hand, she murmured something about lacking time before delving into my mind, looking for the next fragment of memory with a key. On the positive side, she kept her hand on my shaft, although motionless. </p><p>For the third memory, I had a really good surprise for her. This time, the main actress of my memory was a sexy brunette. One that Emma knew intimately. The moment she touched at the memory, she jerked back in shock, her eyes wide. She collapsed on the floor, unaware —or uncaring— of her skirt sprawling revealingly, giving me a glimpse of her panties —red, lacy, and very revealing. The Queen was right sending her away, as Emma seemed really prepared to go forward with the seduction game tonight. </p><p>“It cannot be! It was … Valkyrie…” she murmured in shock, while I focused on the beautiful view. Her shock was understandable, as the identity of my co-star on that particular memory justified her overreaction. </p><p>Valkyrie was the nickname of one of the most famous holy knights that operated around the borderlands. She had a reputation for righteousness and a single-minded focus on the light. She was also famous for singlehandedly destroying several critical locations for Dark Faction, which made her effectively untouchable for her area of operation politically. </p><p>Most didn’t know that I had a very profitable agreement with her that was going on for the last ten years. I made sure to inform her about some of the more attention-grabbing members of the Dark Army, the kind that thought that killing people was their mission, and Valkyrie was more than happy to ambush and kill them. She got the reputation and saved the people at the same time, while I made sure that my army lacked rebellious members. What she did couldn’t even be considered treason, because without her convenient presence, I might have chosen to send these guys on a dangerous mission, and their death would have been bought by many more deaths from the good faction. That deal was pure convenience. </p><p>Of course, the particular way we chose to seal that deal was less pure. Valkyrie had a particularly devout army that saw her unable to make a mistake, and having sex with any of them would have ruined her reputation. Which, funnily enough, made me the safest choice for a tryst. </p><p>For me, defiling a holy knight was its own reward. </p><p>Seeing Emma’s shocked face was no less entertaining, though, especially since even as she muttered in shock. “It can’t be, I must have seen it wrong,” she murmured in shock even as she put one of her hands to my temple once more, this time, the other resting on her own thigh, still riding her skirt up, tempting me to be naughty. </p><p>This time, I decided to fulfill those instincts. When her mental presence arrived at the location pf the memory once more, I made sure that she would stay in place until the memory finished, then I brazenly reached to her blouse and pushed the right sleeve down until her shoulder was naked, also finally revealing her perky breast to my sight completely, some. </p><p>She looked beautiful, so beautiful that I actually wanted to push for more. I reached and sank my fingers into her breast, and she moaned reflexively while her own hand moved automatically and disappeared under her skirt, once again the wet sounds of her treatment reaching to my ears. My heart was thumping hard, afraid that I would be noticed, which would have forced me to take certain actions that I prefer not to take, but luckily, Emma was far too interested in my memory to actually count the number of the hands dancing over her body. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” she moaned, her pleasure getting more and more prevalent, especially since my own touch wasn’t being limited by the spell, instead of helping her toward her orgasm. Still, that service was not without a cost. I reached the other shoulder of her blouse and pushed it to the side, making her top slide low enough to leave her tits completely naked, jumping up and down enthusiastically whenever her finger slipped inside her. </p><p>Since she didn’t react to that as well, I grabbed the side of her skirt, and folded a couple of times before stuffing it to her waist, giving me a direct sight of her beautiful slit —naked other than a beautiful strip of red, like a delicious arrow leading me for the target. </p><p>Pity that it was still a bit early for that. </p><p>Of course, just because I couldn’t complete the game didn’t mean that I couldn’t turn on the heat further. I grabbed her wrist and gently pulled her hand to my shaft, making her move up and down, while I took the role of her fingers with my own, dipping them into her wetness. </p><p>She moaned loudly when I circled her clit, her wetness increasing further, almost to the point of gushing freely, turning her sexy panties completely damp. I pulled my fingers for a moment, putting them against her lips, aroused by the way she was sucking them unconsciously. When I started fingering her once more, I delivered that with a rapid, merciless assault, enough to finally trigger her climax the moment she finished viewing the memory of me and Valkyrie. </p><p>The moment her loud cry exploded in the room, I immediately pulled my fingers away, and continued feigning sleep. Luckily, for the first few seconds, her eyes stayed closed, giving me the time to shift into the mood. </p><p>“Fuck,” she gasped as she leaned forward, grabbing the chair next to her just to make sure she hadn’t collapsed while she trembled uncontrollably, the delayed orgasm hitting her with the full strength of a raging tornado. “That’s a big one.” </p><p>I watched as she took several breaths before turning her angry glare at me. “It’s all your fault,” she murmured, but I didn’t panic. Because her reaction would have been much more explosive if she suspected me of actually doing something like that. </p><p>She sighed as she fixed her skirt, likely assuming that she had done that between memories, then, before fixing her blouse, she used the chains on me once more. “I can’t believe that the Valkyrie, the foremost holy knight of the borderlands would do something like that,” she murmured dazedly. </p><p>“At least she didn’t betray the light,” she added a bit later, when her gaze fell on my shaft. “All she did was to use your degenerate ways to help the Empire.” She took another deep breath. “If considered from that aspect, she is a saintess, suffering humiliation and degradation just to save our soldiers.” </p><p>Suppressing my laughter took a lot from me, as in that memory, our dear Valkyrie’s expression didn’t exactly shout heroic suffering, though of course, I could be misreading the meaning of multiple orgasms. Emma was trying to rewrite the narration of the memory, and the reason was clear. She wanted to assuage her own guilt by doing so. </p><p>After all, masturbating the naughty memories of a Dark Lord, defiling a heroic warrior of the light was not exactly proper. </p><p>She buttoned my shirt, but before pulling on my pants, she murmured to herself. “It would be suspicious if I leave you like this, especially after I forced you to relive all those memories,” she murmured, once again not exactly a rational statement, but she didn’t look like she cared about rationality when she leaned down, and grabbed my shaft between her lips, her hand immediately between her legs. </p><p>I wouldn’t say that she delivered the best blowjob I had ever received, but considering how backed I was after the extended game with Princess Aria, followed by another charged hour with Emma where I had spent several minutes enjoying the sight of her naked breasts while leveraged my fingers to fulfill her needs, it wasn’t shocking that I exploded into her mouth a minute after her lips first touched my shaft. </p><p>“What the-” she gasped as she pulled back, shocked, but the only result was my shaft coming free, and a new burst exploded on her beautiful face. She put her hand to reign the flow, but succeeded only after receiving a fresh blast to her still-naked chest. “Bastard,” she murmured angrily —which, considering she was coated with my seed, made her even sexier— “Even unconscious, you’re nothing but trouble,” she added, like it wasn’t her that was molesting a prisoner, one that she assumed to be unconscious, even. </p><p>“Fucking asshole,” she murmured as she pulled a napkin and carefully cleaned her face and breasts before fixing her clothes, then cleaned my shaft to get rid of the evidence. </p><p>“I need to finish exploring the memory tomorrow,” she murmured as she left my cell, leaving me alone. </p><p>The moment she locked the door, I focused on my chains. Thanks to the changes I managed to implement, after several hours of careful treatment, the chains clicked open. I was finally free. </p><p>The question, should I go for a midnight patrol. It was risky, but learning a bit more about the political situation would help… </p>
