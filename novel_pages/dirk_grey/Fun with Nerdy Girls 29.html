        <p>“I hope I’m not interrupting,” Naomi said, her gaze on the floor, unable to catch my eyes. </p><p>I found myself facing a monumental decision. I could give her a simple excuse and say that she arrived at a bad time, sending her away, leaving me to focus on Sarah. It was definitely the safer option considering Sarah was currently in my bathroom, half-naked, a mistake enough to create a controversy that would shatter their friend group. </p><p>Acting cold might even tempt Naomi more for the future. </p><p>But the potential fun of having Naomi tease Sarah was just too tempting to deny. “Please, come in,” I said as I gestured for her to come inside without asking. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured. </p><p>“So, what brings you here in a surprise visit, Naomi,” I asked, a touch louder than necessary as we arrived at the living room to alert Sarah that we had a surprise guest to prevent a very interesting face-off. I heard a soft gasp from the bathroom, and covered up with a cough of my own, keeping Naomi unaware of the other mysterious guest. </p><p>Normally, Sarah’s presence wouldn’t have been much of a problem. After all, she was a part of the friend group, and her presence was not something Naomi could point out without highlighting the absurdity of her own night-time visit. </p><p>Explaining her presence while she wasn’t wearing a shirt or a bra, however, was much more complicated. Of course, she could leave the bathroom with a towel, but that didn’t make the situation any less complicated. </p><p>I knew that, despite all her bluster about being the tough and brave one in their friend group, Sarah would fail to take that step, especially since Naomi was the visitor. Things might have been different if it was Carrie with everything that happened during that particular evening. </p><p>Naomi’s presence was not as simple. </p><p>Of course, after losing my last mental bet about her selection of bra, I wasn’t entirely confident of that conclusion, but since the alternative promised to be as amusing — if even harder to control — I was willing to take the risk. </p><p>“I come to talk about today,” she said. </p><p>I barely held back a smirk, amused just how similar their excuses were. And just like Sarah’s case, her excuse only worked if one didn’t think about it too deeply. Talking at the school was an option, and so was a phone call. Yet, she was here, to have a talk face to face in the middle of the night. </p><p>“As you wish, sweetie,” I said as I sat on the sofa, using the opportunity to kick Sarah’s shirt under the desk. “Why don’t you take a seat and tell me what’s wrong.” </p><p>She sat down next to me, but her beautiful lips stayed closed as she avoided my gaze once more, her face gaining a darker hue. I said nothing, letting her gather enough courage to speak, though it seemed to be taking a lot of time. </p><p>Before Naomi could speak, I noticed Sarah peeking from the door carefully. Luckily, Naomi was facing the other way, and missed it, while I caught her gaze, and waved at her cheekily. </p><p>The anger on her face was beautiful, especially since she had no choice but to swallow it and pull her head back before Naomi noticed her. </p><p>It took a minute for Naomi to gather enough courage to speak. “I want to talk to you about what happened today.” </p><p>“I understand,” I said before she could speak. “But in my defense, I had just finished my exercises and was exhausted, so it was hard for me to stretch properly. But I promise to you that I’ll do better the next time.” </p><p>“The next time…” she murmured before she widened. “Are you talking about our workout session?” </p><p>“Of course,” I said in a matter-of-fact tone. “And let me tell you just how much I appreciate you coming all the way to critique my workout schedule. I’m having so much trouble maintaining a workout pattern alone.” </p><p>“It’s not a bother,” Naomi answered, lacking the initiative to correct my ‘assumption’ about the event she wanted to talk about, her confidence lacking during anything but working out. She still opened her mouth like she wanted to continue, but facing my appreciative smile, that died quickly. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “And since you’re here, do you want to drink anything. Water, tea,” I listed, before smirking. “Wine, champagne…” </p><p>“Water is fine,” she was quick to take the offer, too shy to take my offer for alcohol. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I stood up. “Just give me a minute to wash my face, and I’ll bring it,” I said even as I passed her the remote. “Feel free to relax.” </p><p>Then, I left the nervous beauty on the sofa and walked to the bathroom to talk with an even more nervous beauty. </p><p>To her credit, Sarah managed to keep her mouth shut until I closed the door. “What are you doing!” she whisper, her anger still clear as she raised her hands. I wondered whether she didn’t care she was half-naked, or she was just too angry to care. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t too hard to check. I took a step toward her, my hand already rising toward her chest. As I made my move, her head dipped down, reminding her current state of dress. Her blush rose to a spectacular level as she covered her tits with her arm. “Where’s my shirt?” she whispered. </p><p>“It’s under the table, where I kicked it to avoid Naomi’s suspicion, of course.” </p><p>“Why’s Naomi here?” she asked, finally able to focus back on the actual problem after she had been derailed earlier. </p><p>“She wanted to talk to me about my workout schedule,” I said, deliberately smiling in a dreamy manner. “She’s very enthusiastic about it.” </p><p>The sudden flash of jealousy on her face was very beautiful, especially since she was still trying to cover her face. “Do you think it’s appropriate to hang with her in the middle of the night in your house?” </p><p>“Why, are you jealous,” I whispered back, amused that she was questioning the appropriateness of a nighttime visit under the circumstances, but she seemed to be immune to the irony of the situation.  </p><p>It managed to make her blush even more than remembering her naked state. “No, I’m not,” she gasped. “Why should I be jealous of you. You’re just a friend. Less than a friend even. An acquaintance. I’m worried about Carrie.” </p><p>It took quite a bit of my willpower to keep my mouth shut about the lengthy explanation of her trying to clarify our relationship. It would have been at least convincing if she declared we were just friends with benefits, but her desperate attempt to reject the connection between us just made her true feelings more obvious. </p><p>And the less said about the appropriateness of her worrying about Carrie’s feelings, the better. </p><p>Under different circumstances, I would have mocked and teased her for several minutes, but Naomi’s presence forced me to be more economical with my time. “You’re such a good friend,” I whispered throatily instead as I took a step forward. “Such a good friend.” </p><p>She opened her mouth to answer as she tried to take a step back, only to hit against the bathroom wall. And with my long legs, covering the remaining distance was nothing. She found herself trapped, but as I started leaning down, her arms fall to the side, revealing her tits once more. And just like that, another kiss started. </p><p>This time, her tongue managed to retaliate before I could slip inside, creating a beautiful battle halfway to create a background for the dance of our lips. It wasn’t the extent of my tricks, of course. One of my hands landed on her breasts, caressing, trailing, and teasing repeatedly to give her even more pleasure, something she was quite receptive to if the way her back arched was any indicator. </p><p>Lost in the aggression upstairs, she missed the significance of my free hand trailing down her stomach, arriving too her waistband, though she didn’t miss the significance as I pushed her sweatpants down, revealing her panties. </p><p>“Oh yeah, they are definitely not sexy,” I said as I pulled back, watching as she tried to cover them with her hand. Her attempts were effective, but only because her panties were tiny in the first place. Add in their lacy nature, and their sexiness was a given, especially on such a beautiful girl. </p><p>The color surprised me. “You surprise me, Sarah,” I murmured. “I wouldn’t have expected red from you.” </p><p>“I-it’s a perfectly normal, daily underwear,” she managed to murmur, her blush spreading. </p><p>“Really,” I said, only to receive a nod. I grabbed her waist before she could say anything else, and pressed my lips against hers to prevent her from making too much noise. However, this time, my aim wasn’t to enjoy her beautiful lips. </p><p>At least, not entirely. </p><p>I put her down after a short yet heated kiss, but before I did so, I had used my foot to pull her sweatpants away. When I put her down, she was breathing hard, her eyes shining with arousal, no doubt expecting me to continue. </p><p>Instead, I grabbed her sweatpants, and smirked at her. “Since you claim your panties are not sexy, you shouldn’t have any problem walking out, right?” I said as I turned back. It wasn’t a reasonable requirement, of course, but after she claimed her amazing panties were not sexy, I had no problems following her shamelessness. </p><p>“Don’t you dare!” she gasped, though still maintaining enough presence of mind to keep her voice down. Though that was a mistake, as it allowed me to also grab the hanging towels, depriving her of anything she could use to cover her beautiful body. </p><p>“See you around,” I said with a smirk, and left the bathroom, leaving her behind. </p>
