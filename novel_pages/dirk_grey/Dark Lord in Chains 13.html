        <p>Aria was still trying to put her dress back while Emma finished dressing, and turned to me with a stiff expression. “I’m going to check whether this information is correct. If it’s not…” she said threateningly. </p><p>“If not, what? Are you going to try attacking me again, or will you go and reveal the Queen just how badly you screwed up, giving her the excuse she needs to finally kick you out of the palace?” I countered with a chuckle, which made her flinch. I continued in a gentler tone. “Threats are all about leverage. If that’s lacking, threatening only weakens your position, so take note.” </p><p>Emma nodded in frustration as she fixed her dress one last time and rubbed her face to get rid of the marks of my treatment, washing her face to get rid of the tears on her face. After one last nod, she turned to leave the room, and Aria called her panickedly. “Wait for me!” she begged as she tried to fix her dress. </p><p>As she turned back, Emma didn’t bother to hide her anger. Unlike me, despite all of her political power, Aria was a soft target, and after the nice little delivery she conducted with the paddle, she was an excellent target for Emma’s anger. “Sorry about that, but I’m in a hurry. As a princess, you should understand that the security of the realm is the most important thing.” With that, she walked away confidently and pulled the door open, though the said confidence marred with the pain she felt as she walked away, due to the merciless beating Aria delivered to her tight ass. </p><p>I had to admit, it was a good revenge under the circumstances. She could have easily helped Aria to leave with her, and even if I argued to keep her, she might have used that for trade. Instead, she left Aria to her fate alone with me despite the risk, not even trying to extract her. Impressive, I thought even as Aria stuttered in shock. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the only surprise. I was expecting Aria to either froze in shock, or beg for her to wait. Hence my shock when she raised her hand and cast a spell on Emma. I recognized it, but only thanks to my experience in healing magic. Actually, it was a curse that was useful in combat to prevent a healer to save the target, again and again, blocking simple healing magic to affect them. It was simple for any half-decent healer to dispel, taking only several seconds of concentration. </p><p>By using that on Emma, Aria made sure that Emma couldn’t cure her bottom conveniently through a potion. She either needed to go to a healer and reveal the shameful ‘injury’ she had received, or simply use some herbal ointments to numb the pain and suffer the pain. Emma’ unaware of the curse that settled over her, left the cell, unaware of the discomfort waiting for her. </p><p>“Nice work,” I said to Aria, whose satisfied smile turned shocked as she realized her little trick had been caught. </p><p>“I - I,” she stammered, not expecting to be caught. However, the shame of being caught didn’t last long, not when she remembered her exact state of undress, and pulled the ripped fabrics that remained after my rough treatment to hide her body, clad only in a corset and her panties —and copious amounts of my seed, covering both her face and her body. “Don’t look!” </p><p>I chuckled. “Come on, sweetheart. Isn’t that a bit rude after I have revealed such a big secret just to save you from humiliation,” I answered, which reminded her that the situation was bigger than the carnal experience she had just gone through.</p><p>“If you’re free, why didn’t you just…” she murmured, her voice fading, no doubt trying to ask our little teaching arrangement. </p><p>“Well, what I said was mostly true. My career as a Dark Lord is over, and even if I can escape, doing it without gathering more information is wrong.” </p><p>“Why did you reveal it, then?” she questioned. </p><p>“To make sure that you don’t suffer, of course,” I said as I took a step forward, putting my hand on her chin, my tone husky enough to make her shiver. The blush that covered her whole body was not a surprise, as even under the sanest of circumstances, Aria was vulnerable to charm, her inexperience and social status working against her. And the salacious time we spent together could hardly be classified as normal. </p><p>“I… But…” she murmured, trying to find words, only to fail spectacularly. She was silenced when I put my hand under her chin and raised her to meet my gaze, her lips parted slightly. </p><p>“I think it’s for the best if I accompany you back to your room, just in case someone decides to visit,” I explained. “In your state, explaining it might be difficult.” </p><p>“What if they come and see you’re not in your cell?”</p><p>“That’s a risk I’m willing to take for you. After all, you’re the only one that treated me with kindness after my imprisonment, something I had never experienced before.” I was laying it rather thick, but the shine in her eyes told me that it was the correct direction. </p><p>“T-thanks,” she stammered, though she was quick to be silenced when I grabbed her dress and burned it with a touch. “W-what was that!” </p><p>“Its colors were too bright, and its pieces might have interfered with my concealment spell,” I explained easily, which was without a doubt complete nonsense. Something Aria didn’t miss. </p><p>“Why doesn’t my corset interferes with it, then,” she asked. “It’s bright white.” </p><p>Of course, just like Emma had learned before, it was not a good idea to push with a weak hand. “It does, but I had assumed that you might have problems with it. It’s good to see that you don’t,” I explained even as I reached to her corset, once again pulled it off her body while weakening it my magic, creating a delicious ripping sound, once again revealing her beautiful tits, the hickeys and bite marks I left on unfortunately absent. She must have cured them while trying to dress. </p><p>“But-” she tried to speak as I burned her corset, but silenced when walked behind her and wrapped my arms around her, and cast my shadow trick to wrap around us. </p><p>“The spell is a self-cast one, extending its range is very challenging,” I explained. It wasn’t true, but even if she challenged, she lacked the proper knowledge to understand the intricacies of such a unique concealment spell. </p><p>She didn’t even bother to ask, too distracted by my erection, buried between her cheeks, neither my pants nor her panties enough to blunt the effect. “Let’s walk,” she managed to whisper, surprising me with her obedience. We left the cell together —impossible to otherwise with my arms wrapped around her waist, pinning us together. Just to underline my freedom, I unlocked the first gate by using the unique magical pattern required, which I learned by observing Emma last night. “You really could have escaped,” she gasped, like she was just now properly processing that particular fact. </p><p>“Of course,” I answered, and since I was already shocking her, I had decided to raise my arms a bit, so that my arms were resting just under her tits, enjoying their weight. She stiffened as I did so, but said nothing. Not entirely unreasonable considering everything we had already done. “Which way?” I asked after I have led her out of the confusing labyrinth and reached close to Emma’s location. </p><p>“To the - right,” she said, stammering halfway as I grabbed her tits without a warning. </p><p>“Press your back tighter,” I said as I pulled her closer, which was rather ridiculous as far as the excuses went, but it was even more fun. Even after passing the secret entrance to Emma’s room, we walked for a couple of minutes, highlighting the Queen’s efforts to discard Emma. With her achievements, Emma’s residence needed to be closer to the private section of the royals. </p><p>Of course, the distance was important to me for something much more important. It gave me the opportunity to tease Aria further. She was already aroused thanks to the after-effects of the treatment she had received, my insistent massage to her sensitive breasts, caressing and mauling alternatively, didn’t help her to calm down. Just to tease her some more, I decided to speak. “I think I heard something,” I whispered even as I pushed against the wall, my weight pinning her against the cold stone. </p><p>“I didn’t hear-” she whispered, but I closed her mouth with my hand. </p><p>“Silent,” I whispered even as I stayed pressed against her, my shaft lodged between her cheeks suggestively. Of course, even as we stood like that, my hand moved down, clamping around her panties. “This is also white, so we should play it safe,” I murmured even as I ripped them off, finally leaving her with only her shoes. </p><p>She didn’t say anything, trembling under my touch as the time passed. I only let her move after a minute, and when she pulled back, her nipples were rock hard thanks to the cold wall. “You’re shivering, let me help you warm up,” I whispered as I cupped her tits once more, mauling them as we walked. </p><p>“T-thanks,” she stammered, more of a reflex than a genuine response, which I liked immensely. </p><p>“Of course, as a valiant protector, that’s a part of my role,” I whispered.  </p><p>She said nothing, but her hips followed my rhythm as she walked toward her room, but each step getting harder. I had a feeling that if I suddenly let her go, she wouldn’t break contact between our bodies, not that I wanted to test that. </p><p>Then, we arrived at her room. “We’re here,” she said even as she unlocked the secret entrance, either uncaring or not thinking that I learned how to do that for her room —not that I couldn’t have figured out in a few minutes, so it wasn’t exactly impressive. </p><p>“Sure, aren’t you going to offer me some drink for my efforts to protect you?” I said even as I took a step forward, still mauling her chest. </p><p>“Umm, maybe,” she murmured, but we were already in her room before she could finish her short sentence. </p><p>“Nice place,” I murmured as I walked forward toward her bed, my arms still around her body. It was a huge room, filled with expensive furniture and protected with layers of magical protection, not that it mattered as I accessed the room through the most important secret passage, only using it in reverse. All told, a rather horrible design flaw.  </p><p>“Let me get you a drink-” she started to say, only to leave its place to a panicked gasp when I pushed her on the bed. </p><p>“Sure, but let’s give you a massage first, you’re rather tense since we left the cell,” I said even as I pressed my hands on her back, caressing softly. While she tried to stammer a reply, I focused on her neck and her shoulders, making her purr reflexively. </p><p>“No need-” she tried to say, only to let out a moan as I found a particularly sensitive spot along her spine, trailing down as she tried to suppress her moan. If it wasn’t for the amazing encounter back in the cells, I would have massaged her for hours, until she started begging for me to take her, offering me the keys of the Empire as a reward. Unfortunately, as much as I would have liked to spend hours teasing her, I was already risking quite a lot by deserting my cell. Of course, that didn’t mean that I would just turn and leave while Aria was trembling with unmet arousal, especially without an Emma to trick, allowing me to enjoy the moment completely. </p><p>Rather than continuing to massage her gently, I flipped her so that her beautiful tits were pointing at the ceiling, and crouched between her legs, assaulting her delicious folds with my tongue. Circling around her knot, it triggered a rather loud moan, but from the way her legs tightened, I could feel that she was shocked by the action itself. “I’m paying you back for the amazing show you have put on trying to convince Emma,” I said. “Your amazing blowjob performance deserves a reward.” </p><p>She failed to come up with an answer against my satisfied smirk, and soon, it was impossible for her to actually to do so, because I let my tongue free, raiding and invading every sensitive spot between her legs, teaching her a new meaning of the pleasure. Though, she managed to surprise me when she grabbed my hair, especially when she tried to pull me closer rather than trying to push me away. It would be a lie if I said that I didn’t feel proud. Despite everything I had achieved during my previous career, none was as outrageous as giving a delicious treatment to the princess of the largest realm of the light faction. In her own room, even, just to underline the audacity of my achievement further. </p><p>She gasped and moaned as I pushed her steadily toward a climax, so much that she didn’t register as I removed my clothes, matching her in nakedness. She did gasp in shock when I added my fingers to the assault of my tongue, dancing at the entrance aggressively. Her lack of resistance was a mistake, of course, one that would take a while for her to truly comprehend. She danced and crawled under my touch, her moans breaking through her capability to stay silent. </p><p>The addition of my fingers pushed her steadily toward a climax, but just as she was about to achieve that, I slowed down. The previous frantic assault had suddenly tapered into a gentle massage, her speedy climb stopped by an unexpected avalanche, cutting off her path. </p><p>I wondered just how long she would be able to resist being delayed on the edge… </p><p>The answer turned out to be not too long, because before even a minute could pass, she whispered gently. “Please,” she murmured. </p><p>I chuckled, the rumbling of my laugh directly delivered to her entrance as I kept my lips pressed against her wetness, making her tremble in desperation. “Please, what?” I asked lazily. </p><p>“Mercy,” she gasped. “Let me… Let me…” she said, trying to complete, but failing to complete her sentence. It was funny that even after everything we had done, she couldn’t ask for me to help her cum. </p><p>“You want to cum?” I asked, not bothering to hide my amusement as I stood up, giving her a view of my naked stature. She nodded. “Use your words, princess,” I warned her.</p><p>“Yes,” she gasped. She might have managed to answer normally, if I hadn’t used the opportunity to dig my fingers into her entrance to continue teasing her, keeping her on the edge. </p><p>“You want me to make sure you cum? Are you sure?” I repeated even as I sat next to her, one hand still teasing her entrance while the other hand found her deliciously perky tits. I focused on her trembling blue eyes, and repeated my question. “Are you sure?” </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned, half-delirious with pleasure, folding even easier than I expected. It seemed that finally getting a taste of the pleasures she had been denied worked wonders to suppress her rationality. </p><p>I was prepared to get a full taste of her beauty. </p><p>The question, just how far I should go? </p>
