        <p>“Where are we going,” Cornelia cried in shock as I suddenly changed direction, tightening my grip around her waist. Then, she looked back, only to realize the whole monster horde had changed directions, and following us instead. “What’s going on!” she cried in shock. </p><p>“In simplest terms, necromancers were directing the horde with this gem, and since I have it, they are following us.” </p><p>“How!” she shouted, before suddenly stopping. “No, that’s not important. It’s good that they are following us. It’ll give us a chance to alert the Commander, and they can gather a team.” She raised her hand, and her mana flared, no doubt about to cast a noticeable flare spell to alert anyone close to us. </p><p>I grabbed her hand to interrupt her. “Sweetie, I was serious when I said that I’m going to handle it. You just need to sit back and enjoy the show,” I said, even as I looked around, trying to find a decent position to funnel the monsters. I could have tried to take them in an open field, but why bother when they were mindlessly following me. A more defensive position would turn the defense into a trivial achievement. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to find a small valley that would slow down their initial charge, and more importantly, would prevent them from escaping even after the death of the earth turtle. As I passed through the entrance, I quickly drew several runes, but leave them inactivated. Once we were center of the valley, I dispelled the air elemental, much to Cornelia’s shock. </p><p>She watched me in shock as I used my mana to etch runes in a wide circle around us in several layers. Thanks to the speed advantage of the elemental, I had about ten minutes before the rest of the horde arrived, just enough to refill my mana while also setting a temporary defensive position. I drew three circles of defensive runes, injecting enough mana to each to hold the monsters for a small while. I could have put more, but I wasn’t trying to set up an extended defense here. I just needed a few minutes. </p><p>[-251 Mana]</p><p>“This is where we are going to put a defense together,” Cornelia asked in shock. “This is a horrible defensive location, we don’t have anything to isolate our flanks or our rear, and we need to make sure we’re not surrounded by the other creatures.” Frankly, for a team with similar strength to her, these concerns were not wrong. By putting a defense here, not only I risked being surrounded, but also the monsters would have no problem attacking in a combined manner. Creating a fake elemental took half a minute, making it a bad choice for an emergency gateway. </p><p>I felt curious about the potential of the earth gem, so I used it as a medium while casting an earth spell to create a seat. </p><p>[-14 Mana]</p><p>The results were spectacular. Transformation of earth mana flowed in an ease that surprised even me, allowing me to effortlessly create an intimidating throne in the middle of the defensive circles, resting intimidatingly on a raised platform that was created by the same spell. Impressive, I thought. I was starting to understand why people were willing to commit crimes just for a rumor of a natural magical gem. </p><p>“Isn’t it too much-” Cornelia said as I took a seat, only to be silenced when I grabbed her wrist and pulled her closer before forcing her down her knees, also lowering my pants. “Since we have some time to kill,” I drawled lazily. </p><p>“You’re mad,” she gasped, but with the front of her robe revealingly wide, I could easily see her stiffening nipples and moistening core. She was aroused by my confidence, even though it looked awful like recklessness. </p><p>“You better start if you want to make any progress before the monsters arrive at the valley,” I said, reminding her that at best we had just minutes. Of course, I had no intention of interrupting it even as the monsters arrived, but I didn’t say that to her immediately, giving her a moment to get used to the idea. </p><p>I grabbed the back of her head and pulled her toward my enthusiastic erection, not that she was resisting much, her mouth already parted open enthusiastically. The revulsion she had shown the first time was completely absent, along with her concerns that whether serving me with her mouth like a tavern wench was fitting to a noble heiress like her. The way her tongue wrapped around my length enthusiastically showed just how far she had come in a few short days. </p><p>Normally, I would have let her attack my shaft at her own pace, but this moment was about proving my overwhelming power to her, and I wanted to start it on the right note. “Brace yourself,” I commented even as I grabbed the back of her head, and forced her to swallow most of my length in one move, no matter how loud she gagged in the process. “Don’t fight it,” I commented even as I pushed once more, pushing my remaining length into her throat, making her gag helplessly. </p><p>Her hands tightened around my thighs, not to free herself, but seeking more strength to keep her place. She was learning. I let her rise for a moment, giving her the chance to breathe, before pushing her down once more, and started fucking her throat mercilessly, ignoring her occasional pained gasps. As she struggled, I cast a simple spell to remove her robe, but not completely. No, when she brought her arms to her back to let the robe slide away, I flicked my finger, and the robe twisted around her arms, suddenly turning into an armbinder, tight enough to hurt. With my cock lodged deep into her throat, she couldn’t even react to it. </p><p>I only let her pull back when the first monsters started to enter the valley, and at that time, my mana reserves had finally recovered. I waited until the first group was close to the defenses before letting Cornelia pull out. The only reason she didn’t collapse as she coughed was my tight grip on her hair, keeping her upright. With her own body’s painful reminders, it took a few seconds for her to notice the monsters. “Caesar-” she gasped, but I cut it with a spell, not on her but against the monsters. </p><p>[-17 Mana]</p><p>It was a simple fireball spell, or more accurately, it was supposed to be. But it burned brighter than a deadly explosion spell that would leave a weaker caster exhausted, expelling waves of her heat thick enough to be felt over our skin despite the distance. It immolated the monsters in an instant, their low-class resistance no match for even a weak spell from me. Using Tantric, I could feel several invisible pieces of energy leaving their bodies and rushing toward me. From my earlier experimentations with Aviada, I had learned that it was the phenomenon that caused the experience gain. </p><p>I also discovered how to redirect it, removing the biggest challenge in power-leveling people, namely, the need to deliver the final hit. </p><p>Cornelia’s eyes widened as she received the experience, but I cut in before she could say anything. “Don’t waste time, continue sucking,” I ordered even as I pushed her down, feeling her lips around my shaft once more. This time, I didn’t push her for a deepthroat, and satisfied with her enthusiastic bobbing, accompanied by the skillful dance of her tongue. Conveniently, it left my hands free to direct my magic, raining fireballs against the first wave of the monsters. </p><p>It was the reason I picked a hard-to-access valley for my defense. As they entered in relatively smaller groups, it gave me an excuse to pick them easily while giving myself enough time to regain the mana I spent, bequeathing Cornelia experience in the process. It wasn’t much, just a few points of experience for each monster considering the gap between Cornelia and the monsters, but considering their numbers, still very impressive. </p><p>“Uh-huh,” Cornelia moaned, her voice distorted by my shaft, her enjoyment clear. Her cheeks bulged, and her spit dripped down as she attacked my length rapidly, but I could sense that her attention was flickering. I didn’t begrudge her for that. Considering we were under attack from a monster horde, her distraction was understandable. </p><p>The next few minutes passed in a weird routine where I received a delicious —if a bit mechanical— service from Cornelia while burning the first wave of attackers into cinders. Like the Swordsmanship before, I was rather satisfied with the performance of the specialized Fire magic, not that I was regretting taking the more generalist route to elements. Still, the qualitative transformation I was experiencing in my area-effect damage was impressive, allowing me to easily fend the attacks without spending more mana than I could regenerate. </p><p>[-965 Mana]</p><p>[Mana: 3720/3840]</p><p>However, soon, things started to get heated. With a loud clatter, the entrance of the valley collapsed, finally allowing the monsters to spill inside, probably done by the earth tortoise. It was definitely strong enough to handle that. </p><p>Cornelia gasped in shock as she pulled away, turning to the walls with clear panic in her eyes. “We need to escape before you deplete your mana-” she started, but I interrupted her by grabbing her waist and forcing her to face away before I pulled her onto my lap. </p><p>“Honey, the show is just starting, watch carefully,” I whispered throatily even as I aligned my shaft with her entrance, pressing against the entrance. Meanwhile, countless monsters filled the valley, and my fireballs nothing more than a matchstick against a tornado, trying to stay alive. She shivered, but didn’t otherwise protest as I let my shaft slowly penetrate her. She was rightfully afraid, but still willing to wait when I assured her that I had a plan. The monsters rushed against the outer wall of runes, but with a wave, I created an invisible wall of air, keeping them away, giving myself the time required to charge the second circle of runes, which was my main assault, and those runes devoured mana like crazy. </p><p>[-2108 Mana]</p><p>Cornelia was far too busy watching the wave of monsters slowly chipping down our outer layer of defenses, while more and more monsters piled behind them. Meanwhile, I put my hands on her waist, directing her movements as my shaft disappeared into her bit by bit. When the outer defenses were finally fallen, Cornelia was jumping up and down in her own accord, even though her face contorted with fear, her arms still bound behind her back. She could have easily burned it away, of course. The fact that she didn’t, still trusting me despite her hesitancy showed just how far we had come. </p><p>“Do you want to see a really impressive piece of magic,” I whispered even as I forced her down, fully impaling her, accompanied by her moan. </p><p>“Yes!” she moaned loudly, making me doubt whether she was answering my question or reacting to the pleasure of my invasion. However, the monsters had finally penetrated the outer wave of defenses, making it inconvenient to tease her. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I pushed another wave of mana. First, I triggered both the innermost circle, which created another defensive layer —this time a combination of water and air elements— to protect us, and the runes I had left at the entrance, which suddenly created a hundred feet tall stone wall, cutting their way to escape. “Inferno Eternal!” I cried as I triggered the middle layer of runes, while using the rest of my mana to ignite the mana I had stored. </p><p>The result was spectacular. The valley, which was previously covered in monsters, suddenly set ablaze, turning into a veritable hellscape. Flickering flames rose higher than a hundred feet, its heat enough to penetrate the water nature, just enough to make our location deliciously crisp. Luckily, the elemental nature of the defenses was enough to both supply us with air, and to keep the smell away. </p><p>[-920 Mana]</p><p>“Impossible,” Cornelia gasped as she watched the spell to cover the entirety of the valley. Her shock was understandable, as my spell didn’t look like something that could be done by a single person, especially not without the assistance of an established ward. First of all, the spell cost more than three thousand mana, which was a number unthinkable for almost all mages, even if they were above thirty. The only reason I had such a high capability was because of my ridiculous stats. Moreover, the spell showed the perfect attainment of all of my mental stats. Charisma for sheer power, the intelligence and manipulation to still control, wisdom to maintain its nature, and perception shape its borders perfectly. </p><p>The spell was a true masterpiece, equivalent to a masterpiece painting, only temporary, but even more impressive. </p><p>And as an aspiring fire mage, Cornelia was the perfect person to experience the majesty of such a spell. “Incredible,” she murmured as she picked up speed, followed by a cry as she rode me in reckless abandon. Her eyes were wide open despite the brightness, tears slipping down her cheeks as she was impressed. Another gasp escaped her mouth as the monsters started to die in droves, only for her to receive every almost half of the experience it created —even for me, directing all of it was not possible— pushing her steadily toward a new level. </p><p>However, it wasn’t as important as a very welcome notification that I planned, and another welcome one I hadn’t planned. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 77%]</p><p>[Achievement: Fiery Flirting. Who said that the flames of destruction worthy of hell couldn’t be sexy. +1000 Experience, +3 Charisma]</p><p>Finally the fourth stage, I thought with glee even as I grabbed Cornelia’s hips, and a nice achievement as a bonus for my excellent performance rivaling an artwork. I slammed even harder into her, my thickness fighting against her tightening walls, her arousal off-the-charts. I was tempted to tease her a bit, but I realized the moment turned into a holy moment for her, her fascination mixing with her arousal enough to drown her higher mental functions.  </p><p> I sank my hands to her ass, enjoying its firmness even as I slammed even harder, and Cornelia just moaned in response, her eyes locked on the fiery show that was going on. I said nothing, as there was nothing to do but enjoy the moment. I had designed the spell to last five minutes, and interrupting it would have actually taken more of my strength. Instead, I was sitting in the heart of the inferno comfortably, mercilessly fucking my noble maid while also recovering my mana. </p><p>“You like it, don’t you, my poor servant,” I murmured. “You like being my maid, my toy, and my slave, the knowledge that I’m strong enough to destroy you with a flick of my hand, but using that power to make you mine, both body and soul.” </p><p>“Yes,” Cornelia moaned. “I’m yours, master, both in body and soul!” And when I finally cummed, it triggered her climax, her trembling body mixing with her loud cries. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 81%]</p><p>Her words soon turned into slurring moans as she was overcome with pleasure, trembling badly. As the fires weakened, Cornelia collapsed against my chest, murmuring absentmindedly. “Another level,” she murmured dazedly as she rested against my chest, watching the flickering embers as the spell collapsed, leaving the valley filled with smoke and cinders. Another wave of my hand, and a sudden wind picked up the smoke, while making the cinders burn brightly. </p><p>There was almost no movement in the valley, which, admittedly, wasn’t as impressive as it sounded, considering only a few rare monsters were above class ten. Not that destroying it by one spell wasn’t impressive, of course. However, a subtle movement caught my attention. A large mound, which a careless observer might have mistaken for a geographical feature, suddenly moved. </p><p>It was the earth tortoise. </p><p>“How the hell it’s still alive,” I murmured in shock even as I cast an earth spell, creating a sudden ground wave that brought it closer despite its struggles. It was a creature of earth, but the power difference between us absolute, so I was easily able to dominate it through its own element. Cornelia, lying against my chest, my shaft still inside her, barely reacted. </p><p>I could feel the hint of a peculiar energy from the body of the tortoise, one I would have dismissed as the transformative energy that turned it into a horde leader, but it felt weirdly familiar. Curious, I waved my hand, using an air blade to cut through its defensive shell before dissecting it. I didn’t bother to keep the materials, because it was a mere class twelve creature even with its transformation, making it useless for my purposes. To inspire Oeyne, I needed better material.  </p><p>However, when I cut through the monster in search of a source, I met with a very interesting surprise. I found another earth gem, but this one with a slightly chaotic feel. I tried to focus on the sensation, but before I could even grab it, the chaotic sensation had dispelled, leaving only a burning question behind… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 24    Experience: 296400 / 300000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 41</p><p>Precision: 24    Perception: 27</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 32</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 33</p><p>HP: 2899 / 2928	Mana: 2154 / 3912        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Expert Subterfuge [75/75]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>
