        <p>“You!” growled Marianne as she took a step forward, her beautiful face, usually calm and accepting, contorted into a dangerous hint of anger. I was surprised that it was her that spoke rather than Titania. Clearly, the battle mission affected her personality. Though, whether that effect was a positive one was open to argument. “How dare you scare us like that?” </p><p>“What did I do?” I said with an innocence that was too smug to convince anyone. </p><p>Marianne glanced at Titania, and made a gesture to her, earning a small nod and a smile from Titania, a reaction that was no less surprising than Marianne’s angry reaction. Clearly, my blonde goddess wasn’t the only one that was affected by the mission. I could see that Titania had mellowed significantly. </p><p>After all, for her, this mission was not an excuse to learn the merits of aggression, but finally have a calm mission that she didn’t have to work alone. Not to mention, the weakening of the mental effects of the Light Node helped her to connect better with her feelings, allowing her about the reality of the situation. </p><p>Though, I wasn’t able to think about their transformation much, because they raised their hands simultaneously, and a complicated web of magical attacks appeared around me, a rain of light, and rotating blades of life energy that danced inside in a chaotic pattern. </p><p>“Impressive,” I chuckled as I rolled forward, though I had to abort my assault when one of the rotating blades took a turn sharper than I expected, forcing me to change my path to avoid damage. </p><p>Of course, the damage itself would have been negligible, as Marianne barely put any mana behind the rotating blades — and even if she did, the life energy might be the weakest weapon against anyone that was not undead. </p><p>Though, it was still violent enough to cause some damage — and pain — as it was still not a healing spell. </p><p>In contrast, Titania’s rain of light was both easier and harder to avoid. Unlike Marianne’s assault, it didn’t have the ability to change direction midway, but in contrast, they were both fast and numerous — not to mention, unlike Marianne’s like magic, those spears that rained from the sky very much had the ability to hurt the living. </p><p>Otherwise, she would never develop her fearsome reputation.</p><p>Light elemental had a unique destructiveness, able to slip through any other element, including Arcana, easily. Luckily, that was not a problem for me. I conjured a blade of light, using the same element to deflect her attacks. </p><p>I dodged, danced, and weaved through their combined assault, deliberately throttling my Melee skill until their assault had turned an overwhelming rain that forced me to retreat. </p><p>Trying to dodge Marianne’s complicated assault while deflecting Titania’s unpredictable yet merciless rain was good training. And as an added benefit, I was pushing their formation to the limit, making them notice the weak points of their assault. </p><p>While my plan was to get stronger in a different manner, I decided to play along with their game. After all, it not only helped me to increase my Melee abilities without the system, but it also helped them to perfect their own formation, making them safer. </p><p>Unfortunately, not everyone had my boundless mana, and even with their limited expenditure, barely ten minutes later, their attack lost its intensity. Still, it was an impressive achievement for two mages, especially right after taking down an undead fortress. </p><p>“Are you girls bored with foreplay?” I asked, earning matching blushes on their face. </p><p>A part of that blush was borne of frustration, showing their unhappiness of failing to deliver even one hit despite their combined assault, but I was familiar with their expression enough to know that the majority came from the implications hidden in my latest words.</p><p>“S-shut up,” Marianne said, but with her blush invading her face, her earlier domineering attitude was replaced by her usual shyness. </p><p>I just chuckled as I walked toward them, summoning an air elemental halfway. When I stood between them, I presented my arms to them. “Shall we go, ladies,” I said with a smile that was familiar to them on my lips. </p><p>They said nothing, not that they needed to, with their intensifying blush and the hurry they displayed as they stepped onto the air elemental and hooked their arms around mine. And then, with beauty on each arm, I floated away. </p><p>We didn’t fly much. Before they could say anything, I had already stopped in a small meadow I had discovered when I was floating forward, beautiful and free from monsters and other annoyances. </p><p>“So, girls, who want the first relaxing massage after your exhausting battle,” I asked. </p><p>“Me,” both girls jumped simultaneously, their earlier alliance quick to shatter in the face of benefits. I was amused by the way they glared at each other, both unhappy with the initiative the other showed. </p><p>I chuckled as I let my hands move lower and cupped their assess at the same time, Marianne’s wide and soft, Titania’s small and tight. “It looks like a tie,” I chuckled as I let the elemental land next to the water, and slammed my foot on the floor. </p><p>[-729 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Craft]</p><p>And two massage tables rose, both made of crystal and covered with complicated patterns as I once again used the architectural style I had deduced from the headmistress’ stash, as their unique nature allowed them to hold mana much better. </p><p>After all, since I was interrupting their mission, I needed to pay back them properly for such interruption, and a beautiful massage was certainly a good way to do so. </p><p>While also awakening their bodies properly for some post-massage fun. </p><p>“Jerk,” they replied soon, once again simultaneously. </p><p>I chuckled at their response before giving them another suggestion. “Well, we can skip it if you are not in the mood,” I whispered, but my suggestion had received no answer but a pointed silence. “I thought so,” I answered, not bothering to hide my smirk as I continued. </p><p>“Why don’t you girls lay down, and I start the massage to destroy all the stress that you accumulated during your adventures.” </p><p>They looked hesitant, mostly because they were annoyed by my teasing rather than a lack of desire for my massage. </p><p>so I decided to give a little incentive. “And I’ll start with who manages to lay down first, appropriately dressed for a massage,” I added. “Or…” I tried to continue, to add the words, appropriately undressed, but my little joke was ruined. </p><p>Admittedly, considering my little self-indulgent joke had been interrupted by two beautiful girls furiously undressing as they competed to be the first one to lay on the crystal massage tables I had conjured, it wasn’t exactly the greatest loss I had ever experienced. </p><p>Apparently, their little moment of solidarity wasn’t enough to survive the temptation of being the first one in line. </p><p>“Amazing effort,” I murmured even as I looked at their beautiful bodies as they lay on the crystal surface. </p><p>Titania lay on her back, displaying her modest curves directly, her legs parted to give a glimpse of her core, getting wetter by each second in anticipation. Marianne, on the other hand, lay prone, which was supposed to be less sexy than someone laying on her back, but it seemed that Marianne’s curves had never heard that fact. Her beautiful plump ass was as attractive as always, begging for my attention, and her breasts, squeezed between her weight and the massage table, created an amazing view to complement it. </p><p>I said nothing else as I walked toward them, standing between them. “Who’s first?” Marianne murmured, unable to resist the temptation. </p><p>“I’m not sure, who do you think was faster?” I asked. </p><p>Marianne turned to look at Titania, who was already looking at her. To their credit, even distracted by their desire, they had realized that I had been teasing them, and refused to engage. </p><p>Yet, they also wanted to receive a proper massage — and much more — so, despite their frustration, they continued to lay on their massage tables. I chuckled. “I think it’s fair to take it as a tie, won’t you agree?” I asked. </p><p>I received a pair of hesitant nods and prepared myself to start some fun activity. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
