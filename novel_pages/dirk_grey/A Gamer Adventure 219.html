        <p>The headmistress said nothing as we climbed the spiral stairs. As I did so, I couldn’t help but compare the amusement I was feeling with the tenseness I did as I climbed for the first time, expecting to meet an undead monstrosity under her cloak, unaware of the extent of her deception. </p><p>Yet, as I carried her upstairs in a bridal hold, her beautiful wings twitching as she tried to keep them collected to avoid hitting the walls, only to fail repeatedly, showing that her legs weren’t the only part of her body that she was having trouble controlling. </p><p>“Wow, this place is very different when you’re not expecting any guests,” I said, mentioning the noticeable absence of the crystal pillars that helped her to channel her mana. Instead, the room was in the same configuration I had observed when I first stumbled. </p><p>She blushed at the comment as I glanced around like it was the first time I was seeing this layout. </p><p>A wooden bed with a thin cot that even a servant would turn their nose to, a similarly shoddy wooden wardrobe, the crystal platform in the middle. </p><p>And the bath in the corner, one that she used to cleanse herself and reabsorb the Darkness Spark — which moved much more obediently than the Light Spark, enough to be cleansed by the ward before getting absorbed by the ward. </p><p>The bath might be a critical component of the balance she had been maintaining for a long time, but I was in the process of solving that problem, which meant that it was time to explore alternative usage methods of the bath. </p><p>“Let’s see if we can use your light-infused bath water to enhance the impact of the massage,” I said. A thoughtful expression appeared on her face rather than the panic I was expecting, suggesting that, she actually took it as an actual input rather than just a teasing remark I used before I undressed her. </p><p>But then, I corrected, why shouldn’t she. I had done everything I could do to obscure the link between Tantric and her transformation, shifting attention to my relatively elegant way of leveraging Light mana. </p><p>And if that had been correct, the bath would certainly enhance my capabilities significantly, by allowing me to infuse mana all over her body without the need for a direct touch. </p><p>I wondered whether it was more of her naivety or her newfound greed in play as she missed the most obvious reaction behind her situation, but I was sure that, regardless of the reason, the pleasure that blanketed her mind played a big role in her omission.</p><p>That omission didn’t survive for long as I let her step down in front of the bath, one of my hands on her shoulder, stabilizing her. </p><p>The other grabbed her robe, and after one harsh pull, ripped it completely. “Wow, you really don’t like wearing anything underneath that robe, do you?” I muttered as I enjoyed the beautiful sight of her flawless body from behind, her heart-shaped ass on display without any pesky interruption, the soft shine of her wings just adding another shadow to the state. </p><p>“W-what are you doing?” she gasped as her wings moved to cover her ass, with them lowered, I was able to get an amazing view of her breasts, large enough to easily spill out of my hands, yet just as perfect and firm. </p><p>“No bra as well, very naughty,” I commented cheekily, which earned a beautiful gasp as her hands jumped up to cover her breasts. Unfortunately, they were much less adequate coverage, her small hands leaving most of her flesh free for my enjoyment. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at her ineffective attempts of covering her body even as I gave her a gentle push, allowing her to step into the bath. </p><p>I followed her, but not before matching her in the state of dressing, but she was too occupied by her own nudity to notice that before I stepped into the bath after her, and hugged her behind. </p><p>Her wings were between our bodies, but considering the sensitivity she had displayed, it was hardly something that reduced the impact of the hug for her, and even if it did, my hands were on her naked belly, caressing softly. </p><p>“So, are you ready for the real massage,” I whispered. </p><p>She whimpered in shock at my daring, but, just to make things fun, that whimper didn’t survive for long. </p><p>The reason, as I cast another biomancy spell, this time pulling some of her bath water to fly, covering our bodies with a thin layer of water. It didn’t work to erase the traces of darkness from her since she wasn’t channeling her magic. Instead, I used it as a kind of focus to further intensify the flood of light magic. </p><p>Of course, it was just an excuse to slightly increase the effectiveness of Tantric, further tripling the speed of the process, bringing the required time to complete the process from years to months — assuming constant dedication, of course. </p><p>And, just like that her greed, aligned with the unfamiliar touch of pleasure, worked wonders to destroy her complaints, once again making her fall silent. </p><p>“Let’s start by focusing your back, move your wings,” I whispered into her ear, this time my voice reflecting my arousal without the slightest attempt of concealment. </p><p>She didn’t follow that request, but considering she made no attempt to move forward to separate herself from my naked touch, it was less of disobedience and more of indecision. “Or, I can start from the other side,” I whispered into her ear, my lips close enough for my breath to caress her skin. </p><p>I had been planning to let my lips linger down her cheek before focusing on her neck, kissing and nibbling cutely to push things further, but she managed to thwart that insidious plan with a very clever solution…</p><p>Near-instant obedience. </p><p>Before I could even lean down to place the first kiss on her cheek, her wings moved, freeing her body from the protection of her wings. “Good girl,” I said as I pushed my hands through her wings, caressing her feathers softly. </p><p>It might be the single most conflicting yet comforting feeling I had ever experienced. The light mana invaded my body as I touched her wings, almost instinctively, her mana dancing with mine, giving an ethereal feeling to my touch. </p><p>Of course, I could feel that there were two reasons for that reaction. The first was her aroused state, one that was flailing her control. And the second was the current nature of my mana, a soft variant of light, almost wrapping around herself. </p><p>“N-not my wings,” she whispered, needy, but this time, it wasn’t just panic that I was hearing in her voice but a carnal tremble, one that reflected need, showing it wasn’t just simple sensitivity. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, but only pulled one of my hands from her wings, and used that to put her belly. </p><p>“Y-you were supposed to work on my back,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, I am,” I said as I used my hold to pull her tighter against me, one that buried my shaft between her beautiful ass cheeks. Surprisingly, she reacted less than to my continuing caressing of her wings, whimpering helplessly. </p><p>It was not fair for her to be the only one enjoying it, I decided as I started moving up and down, using my muscular chest as a tool of massage. </p><p>Of course, that amazing work was shadowed by the impact of my shaft moving up and down in the beautiful valley created by her perfect ass…</p><p>But one couldn’t get anything. </p><p>At that moment, there was nothing preventing me from pushing forward. Well, nothing but her delicious whimpers and her lack of complaint, showed that she was not too far away from acceptance in the first place. </p><p>Ironically, that just tempted me to tease her more. I took a step forward, pushing her with my body until she found herself pinned against the wall, while I moved up and down repeatedly. </p><p>The constant flow of light mana under the guise of massage, slowly helping her to properly merge with the Light Spark, worked wonders. </p><p>Though, as the process continued, I could see the difference between my process and hers even more. </p><p>After the slight softening, the nature of the Divine Spark was aligning perfectly with hers, slowly taking shape over her body, the subtlest shadow that even she would have trouble noticing. But still, it was almost independent of her, but aligned at the same time. </p><p>Maybe that was how the avatars of the gods worked. </p><p>In comparison, I could see the way I used Divine Spark definitely butchered any potential of leveraging that. </p><p>Because, I could feel that, the only reason she was able to achieve that was the extreme alignment she had with the nature of the Divine Spark — and while I had little idea about what exactly such nature meant, I could see that it was not just a mana trick, but something more. </p><p>My strategy was much similar to what Janelor had been doing with Mana to empower her abilities directly, only using Divine Spark as fuel rather than mana. </p><p>But, as a needy whimper escaped her mouth, I abandoned that track and focused on the present. </p><p>“Please,” she whimpered, and I was more than enthusiastic about understanding what exactly she wanted to think.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>
