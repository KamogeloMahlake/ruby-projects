        <p>“Let’s start with washing your back,” I said as our bodies dipped into the refreshing water of the spring. </p><p>“You don’t need to—” she started, which died just as quickly as my fingers danced on her back, dealing with the stress of our trek. </p><p>“Nonsense. That was a difficult journey,” I said even as I dipped my hand in the water and grabbed her foot, gently pulling it onto my lap before pressing my thumb on her soles. “You deserve some pampering for your impressive performance and lack of protest.”</p><p>She deserved a reward. </p><p>“You did much better,” she murmured as she leaned back, her breasts hidden under the shimmering surface. She tried to look nonchalant, but she failed to hide the fascination hidden behind her eyes. She still enjoyed the novelty of our … closeness. </p><p>For a while, I said nothing in favor of watching Lillian’s expression change as I gently rubbed the soles of her feet. It was a beautiful sight, her naked body barely visible under the shimmering surface of the water with strands of her beautiful hair sticking to her shoulders in their wetness. </p><p>“It feels good, but my feet were hardly strained since you carried me,” she said. </p><p>“True,” I said casually while my hands climbed up her thighs, dangerously close to her entrance. “After all, you spend the whole night riding me. Your thighs deserve the attention,” I explained. </p><p>“Really-YYY!” she said, her shy response turning into a shocked moan as I caressed her entrance, making her moan. She tried to look angry when she found herself under my amused gaze, but my finger around her clit prevented her from saying anything, converting her words to moans.</p><p>“Did you say something?” I asked, not bothering to hide the amusement in my tone as she trembled under my touch once more. Her inability to answer left her frustrated, but after the stress of our latest discoveries, the release was welcome.</p><p>Seeing that she was busy biting her cheeks to hide her moans I decided not to waste too much time in foreplay, particularly since we still had a lot to do. I grabbed her waist with my other hand and pulled her onto my lap. Distracted by the pleasure, she reacted only when she landed on my lap, her back pressing against my chest, my shaft trapped between her tight asscheeks. </p><p>She responded with a moan when I caressed her entrance. My fingers sank deeper into her breast. </p><p>“You’re an excellent healer, risking your body for me,” I whispered into her ear, making her shiver. She didn’t respond verbally, but the way she leaned back and parted her legs, giving me full access to her body was enough of an answer. I let my hands roam over her body, moving back and forth freely without consequence as I pushed her arousal higher while also getting rid of all the dirt and grime our bodies collected during our desperate escape. Miraculously, she managed to keep herself from moaning, for a while, at least. </p><p>Then, I leaned forward and pressed my lips to her neck, biting her softly for a moment before my lips started to dance over her skin. In response, her hips started to dance up and down, massaging my shaft nicely. “Better,” I whispered in approval even as circled my finger around her nipple. She shivered sexily, tempting me to push forward. </p><p>I decided to tease her a bit more. </p><p>I caressed her entrance once more while her hips rocked, her tight asscheecks doing their best to imprison my shaft between them. She stayed on my lap, naked and obedient as I nibbled on her neck. </p><p>“So, tell me, Lillian, do you like this?” I said even as my fingers once again probed her entrance, making her shiver helplessly. </p><p>I liked the way she turned to face me, once again her shyness showing itself at my reminder. She knew that what she was doing was wanton and slutty, but her desires, combined with my impressive heroism prevented her from acting on that guilt. Instead, she obediently nodded, and when I leaned forward, accepted my kiss. </p><p>It was all I needed to let my fingers loose on her body mercilessly. My left hand teased her clit, again and again, even occasionally slipping inside whenever she was too distracted by my kiss. </p><p>Under my determined assault, it wasn’t shocking for her to start shivering. I captured her lips in a domineering kiss without warning, the invasion of my tongue doing wonders to dispel her drowsiness. Then, just as she was getting in the mood, I pushed her back a bit, and under her confused glare, pulled myself out of the water, and sat on the corner of the spring, my legs still in the water.</p><p>Her lack of understanding only lasted until I pointed at the massive monster between my legs, waiting for a release for too long. After everything that had happened today, I had no intention of going to sleep with blue-balls. “It’s time to pay back the favor,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“I…” she murmured in shock, her eyes firmly locked on my shaft, no doubt trying to process just how dangerously close it was to truly ruin her. She stood up, the water barely deep enough to cover her thighs, but she didn’t bother to cover her body with her arms. </p><p>“Come on, beautiful,” I said lightly as I leaned back a bit, which only highlighted my erection further. </p><p>Her fingers were trembling as she wrapped them around the base of my shaft, her eyes widening a bit more when her fingers failed to connect. </p><p>“I’m going to…” she murmured before taking a deep breath, but continuing with a whisper that would have been impossible to hear without the changes my body was going through. “… suck you.” </p><p>“Good girl,” I said as I patted her head gently. “Then, suck it,” I said as I gently grabbed her head and gently pulled her forward until her lips pressed against my head, and my shaft trembled in excitement. </p><p>She opened her mouth obediently and moved her head forward, engulfing the tip with her warmth. She moved back and forth a bit, her eyes firmly shut. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said once more as she actually pushed herself halfway down my shaft despite a gag that escaped her mouth, and looked at me victoriously. I didn’t know what she was expecting, but seeing her watching me victoriously while trying to open her mouth as much as possible to accommodate my shaft, the site of it managed to trigger my new instincts once more, begging for me to dominate her. </p><p>This time, I was too aroused to resist. </p><p>“Good attempt,” I said as I put my hands to the back of her head, cutting off her escape route. “But now we’re going to do the real thing. Open your mouth as much as possible, and relax,” I ordered, unlike the other times, my tone neither calm nor mocking. Instead, a deep rumble escaped my mouth, more animal than human, something I didn’t know I was capable of. </p><p>Lillian trembled. </p><p>She trembled, but it wasn’t fear I saw flaring in her eyes for a moment before she firmly shut them and swallowed my shaft. Instead, it was submission, triggered by my primal tone. That expression destroyed the last of my restraint, and I pushed deep into her throat, her gags echoing in the cave. </p><p>I should keep my instincts back, but it was hard, even with the sudden increase in mana generation.</p><p>Her determination to keep her eyes closed didn’t last long when I pushed deeper into her throat, widening in shock to reveal her beautiful eyes in a novel expression. I ignored her failure to breathe, and slowly pushed deeper in her throat, her throat wrapping around me nicely even as a bulge appeared. </p><p>“Letting my new instincts win was obviously dangerous, but seeing Lillian’s pouty lips around the base of my shaft while she struggled to breathe was not something that helped me control my desire. My instincts took control as I moved forward a bit, enough for my feet to press on the bottom of the spring before cutting loose, drilling into her throat mercilessly. </p><p>Then, without a warning, I pulled back, leaving her gasping and coughing helplessly. “That was…” she managed to say between her attempts to breathe. “… Fun,” she continued a moment later.</p><p>”Excellent,” I said as I repeated the position, until I exploded into her mouth, pushing the excess mana alongside as she desperately tried to catch all. </p><p>My condition might be dangerous, but the medicine was incredible… </p>
