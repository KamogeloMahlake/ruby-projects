        <p>The headmistress was busy processing her shock as she found herself against her desk, while I let my fingers dance along her spine, changing the undercurrent of the massage significantly. </p><p>Yet, her silence was not just about the sudden change the situation showed, starting with her accidental flinch, but also the intensity of the mana flow, doubling in impact as I increased the amount of skin connection as I also let my forearms brush, with a corresponding increase in the mana flow. </p><p>I also thought about increasing the effectiveness of the process, but I had to ignore that part despite its fun potential. It would be a pity to do so after I went all that trouble to disassociate the process from my Tantric — or from her perspective, the Degenerate’s powers. </p><p>And, increasing the effectiveness through arousal was the best way to resurrect that point.</p><p>Instead, I enticed her silence with a simpler equation. The more skin contact, the more effective the massage… </p><p>And faster the process. </p><p>“I hope you’re not unhappy with the pressure from my elbows,” I explained with a chuckle. “But the constant flow through my hands was getting unsustainable, but since you clearly didn’t want to stop…” I added, adding a mocking tone at the last part.</p><p>This time, she didn’t miss the sexual implication in my words and my tone — which was impossible even for her after she was pushed against her desk, still trying to keep her ripped robe in place with her hands, too distracted to even try to use her magic — but that didn’t change her silence. </p><p>Once again, her greed worked wonders to add some more confusion to the challenge she was facing, forcing her to consider things she would never have considered otherwise. </p><p>And, the arousal she felt more and more intensely as my fingers danced along her spine, adding more ingredients to the confusing elation she was feeling after finding a solution to the problem that plagued her for a time long enough that I struggled to comprehend. </p><p>“I can stop if you’re unhappy with the service,” I prompted. </p><p>Her silence was telling. Soon, her tenseness disappeared as she leaned against the desk more, accepting my reckless overreach, making me wonder just how much she would accept. </p><p>And, with her mind plagued by the shock of my achievement, it was the perfect time to test that. My forearms and hands alternated against her naked back, increasing the intensity of mana flow more and more to increase her enjoyment. </p><p>It was reckless, certainly, but her silent acceptance and the sight of her trembling wings were impossible to resist, especially after I kept away from her for so long, afraid of the mysteries that were hidden behind her facade. </p><p>The state of those mysteries was not that different from the state of her body. While they were not completely revealed, I managed to rip through the curtains enough to give a tantalizing view of what was hidden underneath, with curves hinting more. </p><p>I certainly made riskier decisions than I had been doing at the moment. </p><p>That didn’t mean I recklessly charged forward to rip the remaining veil — which applied both the metaphorical existence that hid her secrets, and the literal existence that hid her ‘secrets’. Instead, I let my fingers dance freely over her beautiful back, each moment bringing her to a new height of pleasure. </p><p>A pleasure that she was reacting badly enough to make me doubt the frequency she was applying any self-care method. </p><p>What a great horror. </p><p>I let my thumbs climb back to her neck, pressing softly for a fleeting moment before dragging them back down along her spine, leaving a lingering warmth that triggered her pleasure even more. </p><p>The trembling of her beautiful wings turned into a roadmap for me, giving me a shortcut to reading her reactions as unlike her voice, she made no attempt to contain their trembling and occasional tensing. </p><p>She didn’t stay silent forever. “Careful,” she warned as I dragged dangerously close to her breasts, though that warning would have been more effective if a moan used that as an opportunity to escape from her beautiful lips, echoing against the walls. </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” I said mockingly as I repeated the move deliberately, this time getting even closer, confident that the shame of that slip would be enough to keep her silent as I did so. </p><p>I was correct, as I repeated the move several times, she stayed silent, even when my fingers slipped under her robe to brush against the side of her breast momentarily, though I could feel her preparing to warn me again if I repeated that. </p><p>So, instead, I pulled back after that touch, leaving her with her aborted intent and the flicker of pleasure. </p><p>The resulting tremble of her wings was simply beautiful. </p><p>I returned to the task of caressing her back once more, the intense flow of mana getting even more intense, enough to make me question my magical strength. </p><p>[-683 Mana]</p><p>Luckily, she had other concerns than keeping a tab on the amount of mana I spent, like trying to deal with the unfamiliar touch of pleasure. I focused on her back a few more minutes before making another pass near her breasts, the pleasure delaying her prepared response sufficiently to make it obsolete once more. </p><p>Though, she could have warned me regardless, but I wasn’t unfamiliar enough with the female body to miss the signs of a held-back moan. </p><p>“Tell me if you feel uncomfortable,” I said, using her momentary silence as a chance to enhance the pleasure she was feeling even more by pushing the limits, though this time, vertically rather than horizontally. </p><p>My fingers drifted down to the small of her back, a location that was arguably less obscene than the sides of her breasts, which was enough to keep her lips silent once more as the special mixture of my mana invaded her body and helped her Divine Spark to transform more and more. </p><p>I might have limited our first massage experience to that, if it wasn’t for a sudden tremble that exploded all along her body intensely, along with a swarm of moans that was louder and more intense than I had expected. </p><p>“Wow, you’re certainly loud,” I said, unable to keep the mocking statement off my lips as her cries exploded without restriction. </p><p>“W-what’s going on?” she muttered softly, showing that, despite all her power, she was tethering on the edge of unconsciousness. </p><p>“You’re having an orgasm. It can’t be that long ago you have forgotten how it felt, right?” I said as I leaned down to catch her gaze, only to see that along with the invasion of pleasure, there was a shock, its deepness surprising me. </p><p>“Of course, that assumes you have orgasmed before,” I added, her reaction confirming that while she was familiar with the concept, she had no first-hand experience with it. “Oh,” I said, unable to keep my chuckle in. “No wonder you’re so surly all the time,” I said.</p><p>That earned an angry glare, one that would have been followed by a much more intense reaction if she actually had the strength to move, or could give her lips any order other than the endless moans that exploded off her beautiful lips. </p><p>“Come on, boss, you can’t still think that it’s not a tragedy, living that long without experiencing one of the greatest pleasures of life,” I commented, and she trembled. “But you’re clearly not in the mood of walking. Let me help you to your bedroom,” I added as I grabbed her in a bridal hold, and started walking out of her office. </p><p>“L-let me go,” she stammered. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, only for her legs to tremble badly the moment I let her connect with the floor. Reflexively, she grabbed my shoulders. Her body was still trembling with the effects of her first orgasm, enough to make it impossible for her to actually stand on her feet. “Do you want me to let you go?” I said. </p><p>The glance she threw at me, anger battling with arousal made her look the cutest I had ever seen, though that was not without sexiness, as her inattentiveness allowed her robe to slide down, creating a crude cleavage — crude as in the shape of it, as it was certainly not a comment about the celestial beauty of her breasts. </p><p>“Did you change your mind?” I asked, unable to suppress my desire to tease her. She decided that being carried was less humiliating than collapsing. </p><p>I chuckled as I lifted her to a bridal hold once more, enjoying the way trembled in my arms, with no signs of subsiding anytime soon, suggesting that, without her supernatural endurance, she might have fallen unconscious — which would have been a great pity. </p><p>Though, just because she didn’t fall unconscious didn’t mean she was unaffected by her pleasure — above and beyond the obvious physical impact. For example, she missed the very obvious implication of being carried into her bedroom after an orgasm…</p><p> —————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>
