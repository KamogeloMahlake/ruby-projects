        <p>The sensation of slipping inside her for a second time was just as amazing, though even as I slipped inside her, I realized one very amusing detail. A little oversight — one that wasn’t happening for the first time. </p><p>“By the way, sweetie, before forgetting,” I started even as I skewered her halfway, enjoying her moan. “I remembered that you’re yet to bestow your beautiful name to me. Would you be so kind to deliver that?” I said. </p><p>Despite the invasion of pleasure — and some more material things, she found the power to twist her neck to catch my gaze, her face colored with an intense surprise, enough to suggest that she was sharing the same surprise. </p><p>She might have had some choice words about the circumstances we found ourselves in another time, but. still trembling after her last orgasm while a new wave of pleasure invaded her body, a lone stammer was all she was able to handle. </p><p>“M-Mariel,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>“Mariel,” I repeated, testing the cadence of her voice, enjoying the cadence of her name. “A beautiful name,” I added, intersecting it with a slap to her ass, adding to the rhythmic sound of my hips. “Almost as beautiful as the way you’re tightening around me.” </p><p>“S-shut up,” she managed to say even as she shifted her head and buried her face to the pillow, earning a chuckle from me at the intensity of her blush, even at the moment, the slightest attempt to dirty talk enough to break her confidence. </p><p>“How amusing,” I said, not bothering to keep it to a whisper, and she buried her face in the pillow even deeper. </p><p>Her pillow did more than just hide her shame. It also helped to suppress her boundless moans that displayed the capabilities of her supernatural lungs. Not exactly a development that increased my enjoyment. </p><p>At least, not before her moans got even more intense as my impalings started to invade deeper and deeper, her moans getting loud enough to make the muffling of the pillow rather redundant. </p><p>“Before forgetting, the reward of your obedience,” I added as I reached to my mana reserves. </p><p>[- 318 Mana]</p><p>The sudden addition of the earlier Light-based massage trick worked the opposite direction I was expecting, and rather than pushing her delirium deeper, it actually made her act. </p><p>Well, if I counted the act that was limited to her neck twisting to catch my gaze once more, while the rest of her body stayed under me obediently as I pulled her wings to ram inside her again and again acting. </p><p>Interpreting her gaze was not too hard. Once again receiving the reward that allowed them to slowly bind with her Divine Spark allowed her to cut through the pleasure, reminding her that just an hour ago, we were in her office, having a deep discussion about the nature of the Gods. </p><p>Even more amusingly, I caught a beautiful sheepish expression on her face, suggesting that, as she lost herself in pleasure, she didn’t even realize that the flow of mana from me had ceased. </p><p>Which robbed her of the only excuse she could have for the situation she was suffering. If I continued, she might have at least justified the position she found herself in for herself. Yet, unless the person in question was delusional enough to count as sick, they required a strong excuse to function as a pillar for their self-deception. </p><p>The effects of my massage were certainly such a pillar. Such a pity that she didn’t even notice its absence, making it essentially useless. </p><p>Her expression cycled between expressions, ranging between abject shock and pure arousal, before setting in a grudging acceptance. Grudging, because she clearly didn’t appreciate the indignity she found herself in. </p><p>Acceptance, because her expression told me that she had no intention of stopping halfway, not with a pleasure she had never felt before invaded her body. </p><p>I decided to test that determination for a moment. “I can stop if you—“ I started, only for her to freeze in abject shock for a fleeting moment before interrupting me. </p><p>“No!” she gasped. </p><p>I chuckled even as I spanked her ass. “Try listening to my questions completely, Mariel,” I said, pausing after I said her name, enjoying its cadence like a particularly tasty piece of dessert, its delicious aroma lingering on my tongue. </p><p>“Mariel,” I repeated, enjoying the tone, yet, even as I did that, I realized that that taste wasn’t as theoretical as I assumed. </p><p>She shivered with something more than just pleasure, showing I wasn’t the only one that was feeling that. I turned my attention to her magic even as I repeated her name once more, feeling her magic flaring subtly and mixing with my mana even more efficiently. </p><p>“P-please, slow down,” she whispered, showing she was being impacted by that. </p><p>“Why do you say so, Mariel,” I said, enjoying her trembles getting even more intense as I uttered her voice. </p><p>“B-because it’s my …” she started, only to slow down. </p><p>“Your what, Mariel?” I said, enjoying her tremble even more while I felt a fleeting connection between us, more than just her mana merging against mine. But I failed to understand the full extent. </p><p>“Because it’s my … true name,” she admitted. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked, feeling curious enough to ask. “And why is your true name having such an effect?” I asked, feeling important enough to pause for a moment — but not important enough to actually pull out. </p><p>The reflexive gasp she let out as my constant drilling stopped for a fleeting moment was beautiful, showing just how much she didn’t want the pleasure to stop. “I … I don’t know,” she whispered, which might be the single most obvious lie I had ever heard. </p><p>I was too used to drawing conclusions from half-formed pieces to fail to read her complications. The true name was clearly something magical about her nature, enough to be treated magically important, but considering the shock, she was displaying about the effect it triggered, it was rather obvious that it was more about her changing true nature as she successfully absorbed Divine Spark and slowly progressed into the rank of the goddess. </p><p>Regardless, it also implied that, if I asked her about her name anytime but at the moment, as she was deep into the throes of pleasure, I might have received a different name. </p><p>Of course, that left many questions unanswered. The exact definition, for example. Or whether it applied just angels, all supernatural creatures, or all beings including humans — maybe excluding people connected to the system. </p><p>It also raised questions unrelated to my sexy headmistress Mariel, such as if it applied to the dragons, whether Janelor was actually the true name of my sexy Dragoness, or if she gave me some kind of daily name.  </p><p>However, all of those questions for another time, I decided as I restarted the movement of my hips once more, her spectacular tightness once again testing my abilities to stave off a premature explosion. </p><p>“Let’s leave the question of your true name for a moment, Mariel,” I said, enjoying the shiver of her mana, one that reflected in her body immediately. “Instead, just answer my question. Do you want me to stop…” I said, pausing for a moment to see whether she would explode in a panic once more. </p><p>To her credit, she didn’t. </p><p>“… distracting you with my mana while we’re enjoying our special embrace?” I asked, enjoying the way her head dipped down. </p><p>“No,” she muttered, but her beautiful voice was subdued as she said so, somehow feeling self-conscious about her earlier reaction. It didn’t survive for long before the moans of pleasure stole the show once more, of course. </p><p>“Such a greedy little angel,” I said teasingly. “Wanting a massage and a proper fucking at the same time…” </p><p>Unlike the earlier euphemistic phrasing, the more explicit word was once again enough to push her into a near-catatonic state, making her bury her head into the pillow once more. </p><p>Yet, her hips stayed raised, allowing me to repeatedly ram into her beautiful body without the slightest pause, showing that, her extreme reaction toward dirty language was not a barrier to her pleasure. </p><p>I said nothing else, once again letting the time fly, measuring it by the light sheen of sweat that started to gather on her skin, a little sign of impurity that I had never seen on her before, showing the depths of pleasure she lost. </p><p>As time passed, the pleasure started to get too intense, challenging my ability to contain myself, so I decided to surrender to the pleasure. But not before one last attempt to tease her beautifully. </p><p>“I’m about to come,” I said, which made her tense beautifully. </p><p>“N-not inside,” she stammered, showing that, while she might be woefully inexperienced, it clearly didn’t include not knowing the basic mechanics of the process and the implications. </p><p>“Not even if it would arrive with an amazing flood of mana, enough to fill you to the brim?” I asked, which was enough to make her pause in indecision for a while. </p><p>Once again highlighting her lack of knowledge when it came to the applied side of the carnal business, because froze long enough to make her answer irrelevant. </p><p>“Too late,” I said even as I let my control over my body loosen, filling her with my seed explosively. </p><p>“N-nooo, that’s too much!” she cried, but that was all she was able to say before a spectacular tremble hit her body, triggering another climax, this time even more explosive than the previous one. </p><p>Since I promised her, I let my magic infuse my explosion. And, as a reward for her spectacular obedience, I even made sure to intensify the impact of Tantric to quicken her merging even more. </p><p>[-4728 Mana]</p><p>Such beautiful obedience needed to be rewarded, I thought, my mind already busy with many interesting things I could apply to her. </p><p>Unfortunately, as I looked down, I found her already collapsed, the intense chain of orgasms she experienced without a break, when combined with the intensity of the mana flood, proved more than enough to break through her supernatural physical resistance. </p><p>“Well, that was a fun start,” I murmured, spending a moment to think whether I should go and work. </p><p>But, the presence of her beautiful soft wings was enough to change my mind. Instead, I lay down next to her, smiling as her wings reflexively wrapped around me protectively. </p><p>I fell asleep, not before one last spell, changing the nature of her bed from a simple cot to a large, four-poster bed, decadent enough for us to bury ourselves. </p><p>And, just as one last joke, pure black…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 5106 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>
