        <p>I did nothing as Mariel sealed my lips with her searing kiss. I could have taken back control immediately, but after all the harrowing experiences she had gone through, she deserved to get a sense of control. </p><p>And, to be honest, the way her wings wrapped around my body was too comfortable to change, even when her fingers grabbed my hair painfully, squeezing helplessly as she ravaged my mouth with her tongue, the two sensations contrasting greatly. </p><p>I liked it. </p><p>As she continued to drink my lips with the desperation of a traveler lost in a desert, I let my Tantric mana infuse her body, mixing with her mana, finally helping her to quicken the bonding process. Now that I wasn’t dancing on the blade’s edge, that was much easier. </p><p>At the same time, I felt our bond getting stronger, her domain linking with my domains, enhancing the efficiency of my power just as what I had been experiencing with Intelligence and Endurance.  </p><p>[+1 Wisdom]</p><p>[+1 Manipulation]</p><p>The double notification was a surprise. Wisdom, I understood more, as, despite all the sharp edges, Light was still tightly linked to life and healing, which linked to Wisdom. </p><p>Manipulation was a surprise, mostly because I didn’t expect a double boost, but considering that, Darkness and Manipulation weren’t exactly a difficult connection to make. </p><p>It was surprising, but ultimately, very helpful. Wisdom helped quite a bit when converting Mana natures, particularly when I was fighting against undead or mass healing … and manipulation was even more useful as it allowed me to shape the mana much more finely. </p><p>A combination that would help me greatly … but rather than thinking about those benefits, I focused on Mariel’s hands, which were busy pushing my pants down. </p><p>“Someone is impatient,” I murmured, fascinated by the expression of desire on her face as lowered herself. </p><p>“Shut up. It has been months,” she grumbled shyly as she stood up, while her white robe followed the opposite direction, and pooled around her legs. “Just let me do this … I have been dreaming it for a while.” </p><p>With that, she jumped to my waist, her legs wrapping around my body tightly, just not as tightly as her walls clamping around my girth, enough to make me thankful for my high Endurance. </p><p>As she lowered herself … I had to say, I was a bit disappointed. She was still amazing and beautiful, but the way she said that implied that she had a more interesting idea in mind than a simple position… </p><p>Then, her wings rose and fell once, making me swallow those words. She started flying, and since her legs were safely clamped around me, I was dragged along. “I … I missed flying,” she admitted shyly as we rose to the skies, her hips dancing aggressively in contrast to her wistful tone. </p><p>Clearly, flying wasn’t the only thing that she missed, but I didn’t say anything. I looked at her eyes, enjoying that captivating brightness before I leaned forward to capture her lips, enjoying her taste. </p><p>She let out a chain of gasp as she repeatedly impaled herself with my length, while her wings picked up more and more speed. Our flight wasn’t exactly comfortable, which was a choice. She could have easily used magic to fly a dozen different ways, but she clearly wanted to rely on her wings, each swing radiating mana as she bonded with her Domain even better. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. The jerkiness of our movement made her hip movements even more unpredictable, making our carnal dance more pleasurable as a result. She closed her eyes to enjoy her double sensation, the freedom to finally fly without being hunted mixing with her carnal joy. </p><p>And, as her joy rose, her defenses fell, which would have been devastating if I had any ill intent. Luckily for her, I just used the opportunity to hasten her bonding with the plane even more. </p><p>[+3 Wisdom]</p><p>[+3 Manipulation]</p><p>Her eyes stayed closed, her hips rocking wildly as the last scraps of hesitation disappeared. I might have assumed that it was about her new Domain … but I knew for a fact it was not. Even before, she had shown just how wild she could get once she got going. </p><p>“My beautiful goddess,” I whispered. </p><p>“B-blasphemy—” she started before freezing. “No, this is not blasphemy, is it?” she muttered, as if she was just realizing the true implication of her transformation. </p><p>“No, it is not,” I answered. “With your domain complete, you’re an actual goddess. We just need to find you some worshippers. How do you feel about elves,” I said, enjoying her expression of shock. The following thoughtful expression, less so.  </p><p>“What elves,” she said. </p><p>“Later. I have something more important to do first,” I chuckled as I grabbed her body and twisted until I was behind her, hugging her from behind.</p><p>“W-what are you doing,” she gasped, which was all she was able to say as I grabbed her wings, stalling her flight as I started fucking her from behind. </p><p>“Riding you properly, of course,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“I’ll — kill — you,” she gasped, though not at once with her moans ruining her voice as I repeatedly invaded her. I wondered if it was the indignity implied in the act of riding that angered her more, or the fact that I was preventing her flying. </p><p>Teasing her like this changed the nature of our earlier romantic mood. However, I didn’t want to stop the fun halfway just because she wanted to stop to think about the unimportant aspects … like her Divinity. </p><p>She would have a lot of time to ponder on that once I left. </p><p>I kept holding her wings, using them as leverage to invade her wetness even more aggressively, each moan spectacular even as we fell, the ground coming close with a dangerous speed … well, calling it dangerous was a touch excessive, as we had a lot of magical methods to slow us down … and a collusion was hardly dangerous. </p><p>Yet, that didn’t change the feeling of danger that we drove from the sensation of diving, mixing incredibly with the carnal side of the pleasure. Just as we were about the hit the ground, I exploded in her and shifted my hand, forcing her to pull before we hit. </p><p>Challenging with every inch of her body, including her wings, trembling with pleasure. She slowed down and landed us on a hill, though with a little adjustment so that I was on my back. “Now, it’s my turn to ride,” she said with a raspy tone while her hips started to dance. </p><p>The movement of her hips was amazing, as were her moans that echoed off the empty landscape.  </p><p>The landscape itself wasn’t as beautiful. Other than the Divine Trees with their silver glow, there wasn’t a lot to look good on the landscape. </p><p>While she was busy riding me, I pulled the Twilight Mana around us, creating an emptiness for a moment before I flooded the same area with Nature Mana, triggering the growth, replicating the same trick I had done with the trees. </p><p>Without the necessity of carefully balancing it with Mariel’s condition, it was much easier. Just like that, the bare hills turned into beautiful meadows. Mariel might be passionate enough to ignore the ugliness of her domain … but she certainly appreciated the change. </p><p>Showing it by her hips getting even faster, my grunts of pleasure mixing with her moans, her tits dangling beautifully in the prison of my palms with every shake, her silky wetness enveloping my presence deeper and deeper. </p><p>“Truly a divine experience,” I said as a chuckle escaped my mouth. She sped up even more, fast enough to kill a man who couldn’t comfortably fight against gods.</p><p>“Shut up and fuck me,” she said as she leaned down and kissed me, her hips not skipping even a single beat as she showed her appreciation with her body. </p><p>It was the best way to be silenced, her tongue burying itself into my mouth once more as her hips gyrated, her tightness increasing even more while putting every single part of my body on high alert. Her nibbling drove my pleasure even higher. </p><p>Soon, her tightness turned into an inescapable prison as she started to shiver, her wings glowing beautifully as she orgasmed, which triggered one of my own as she collapsed against my chest, moaning and gasping. </p><p>Her connection with her domain got stronger. </p><p>[+3 Wisdom]</p><p>[+3 Manipulation]</p><p>“I … I missed you, bastard,” Mariel whispered. </p><p>“I missed you too, my sexy angel,” I answered, responding with a kiss, letting her recover.</p><p>After all, we still had a plane to repair, and a domain to bond completely … the fun way. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 115    Charisma: 115</p><p>Precision: 115    Perception: 115</p><p>Agility: 115     Manipulation: 122</p><p>Speed: 115       Intelligence: 151</p><p>Endurance: 168      Wisdom: 122}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 1.147,577}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>
