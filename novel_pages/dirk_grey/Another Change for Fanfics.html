        <title>Another Change for Fanfics</title>
    </head>

        <p>Hi guys,</p><p><strong>Honesty time.</strong></p><p>I know this decision will rightfully annoy (maybe even anger) quite a bit of you, and i know that. However, I'm starting to have some serious trouble actually continuing to write fanfiction, especially when combined with the stress it's causing me with the changes Patreon is going through for the last month.</p><p>I had several nightmares where my Patreon page had been removed without a warning ... and truth be told, it's causing me serious stress.</p><p><strong>For this vein, I'm going to once again remove Fanfiction from this page completely.</strong></p><p>In exchange, I'm planning to replace it with more original stories. I plan to increase the regular chapters by at least <strong>one, maybe two</strong> (maybe even replicating Multiversal Adventures with a different one).</p><p>However, that doesn't mean I'm going to stop writing it completely. Â I'm still committed to finishing Tainted Desire and Dark Discoveries. It's just that they will continue in the usual other platforms, including AO3, and I'll try to write at least two chapters a week, maybe more on them.</p><p>Once again, I apologize. I know it'll anger a lot of you, and you're rightful to feel such anger, but it's not something I can control.</p><p>Have a nice day, and take care.</p>
