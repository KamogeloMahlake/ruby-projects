        <p>Hi everyone, what's your opinion about the new giant chapters for old chapters, so that it's easier to re-read, and since they have their own tags, going through it and pinning to main index will be easier as well. </p><p>Also with a convenient pdf to download. </p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/77960336?pr=true">https://www.patreon.com/posts/77960336?pr=true</a></p>
