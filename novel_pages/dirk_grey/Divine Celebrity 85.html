        <p>The gasp Stacy let out as she found herself filled with my presence was beautiful. Almost as beautiful as the way her expression twisted into a dance of beauty and desire as her wetness wrapped halfway around me. </p><p>Her friend chuckled from the side. “Come on, sweetie, no need to exaggerate, it’s just a lap dance. Continue,” Nancy commented, acting like she was unaware of what was going on. Her naughty smirk was enough to reveal her duplicity, but Stacy had bigger things to do than gaze at that. </p><p>I said nothing, just letting my fingers continue to dance inside her aggressively, not letting her get bored while her friend tried to come to a decision. Nancy shuffled in pleasure, which pushed the jersey even higher to display more of her toned legs. My fingers were still not visible under her, but it was a close call. </p><p>While she wiggled on my fingers, Stacy was busy coming to a decision, which didn’t take too long. “You’re right,” she murmured a while later even as her hips started to move. “It’s just a simple lap dance. Where’s the harm.” With that, her hips started to move, sliding even deeper, her eyes still closed to enjoy the sensation. </p><p>It was a beautiful, erotic dance that was made even more alluring by her amazing curves, intense enough to earn a surprised glance from her friend, along with a blush — though that blush might also be about the quickening of my fingers. </p><p>The desperate way she bit her lips certainly suggested the second.  </p><p>“I think she deserves the title of number one fan, don’t you think?” I said as I looked at Nancy. </p><p>“O-of course I do,” Stacy commented, very much aware of the lengths she was going to for that title. </p><p>Nancy didn’t seem to agree with her comment. “Not necessarily, sweetie. You have the lead, but it’s a marathon, it doesn’t matter who starts first, but who finishes first,” she said as she looked at me. “In a sense of the word,” she added with a chuckle. </p><p>“N-nonsense, I’m obviously winning,” Stacy said as she glanced at her friend with a frown, one that she was only able to maintain for a second before the pleasure erased it. </p><p>“Why, isn’t it just a lap dance,” Nancy countered with a big smirk. Stacy froze, not knowing how to react to those words. I tightened my hand on her hips, leading her to move, and preventing her from stopping even as she tried to answer her friend while trying to conceal her situation. </p><p>Her efforts to conceal it were unnecessary, but she didn’t know that. </p><p>“R-right, just a lap dance,” Stacy found herself stammering after a long delay, showing that, while she had the courage to have sex in front of her friend, she didn’t have the courage to reveal that fact. </p><p>I chuckled, not bothering to say anything, enjoying their little scuffle too much to intervene. </p><p>“Good, then I could easily top it,” Nancy said as she looked to her friend, followed by a crystal laugh, making a point of putting her hand on Stacy’s naked thigh as she chuckled. </p><p>The extra contact was enough to prevent Stacy from answering. She busied herself with tugging down the jersey instead, doing her best to prevent an accident that would reveal what was going on. </p><p>“Oh, such shyness in front of strangers. It’s not like anything I hadn’t seen before back in college, or in the locker room,” Nancy chuckled as her fingers danced on her friend’s thighs. </p><p>I turned my gaze back to Stacy as she blushed, enjoying the way she squirmed under our combined gaze. “I’m guessing there’s a story there? Would you mind telling that?” </p><p>“I rather not,” Stacy murmured, but her determination folded quickly under her friend’s mocking giggle. She turned to Nancy, only to receive an encouraging squeeze — which allowed her to climb higher — to tell her the story. “Well, college is not always fun, and during busy final weeks, we didn’t have much time for dating.” </p><p>“Interesting, go on,” I said, already having an inkling about where the story was going, but watching as Stacy tried to handle her emotions was more entertaining than the predictable end of her story.</p><p>“Yes, Stacy, go on,” Nancy said as she leaned forward, which was handy to hide her own squirming. “Or maybe I should have told how one night you ambushed me in the shower —“ she continued, only to be interrupted by Stacy’s hand desperately silencing her. </p><p>In her hurry, she had also pulled the jersey up, giving a flash of what was going underneath, but she didn’t notice that little aspect. </p><p>She was busy looking frustrated even as she tried to come up with an answer, which didn’t get any easier as I pushed her hips back and forth, adding pleasure to her confusion as she tried to come up with the best way to talk about what was doubtlessly a fun lesbian adventure. </p><p>“S-since we didn’t have too much time for dating…” Stacy murmured, then took a deep breath which pushed her beautiful tits amazingly. </p><p>“You decided to handle those yourselves,” I commented, helping her. </p><p>“Yes,” Stacy whispered in defeat, though despite the defeat in her tone, her hips suddenly quickened, showing that she wasn’t as against telling the story despite her best efforts to look reluctant. “W-we have decided that it was more time efficient than trying to deal with college boys, especially during the finals week where only the worst of them had time for dating.” </p><p>“Oh, really, we … decided,” Nancy said with a chuckle. Stacy tried to cover her lips once more, but this time she was prepared, and leaned back. Which was enough considering Stacy was pinned in place with our anatomic connection. “Try wearing me down with a month of suggestions and subtle insinuations before finally ambushing me in the shower with your monster vibrator.” </p><p>Stacy’s blush was simply beautiful, and her hips quickened even more. “You didn’t exactly complain, did you,” she murmured as she looked down to avoid her amused gaze, and my interested one. </p><p>Nancy chuckled. “No, sweetie, I didn’t,” she said as she stood up, giving me a glimpse of her beautiful body before she fixed her jersey. Stacy was distracted by the movement to notice my glistening fingers, not that it would matter much at this point. “Though I certainly didn’t enjoy it as much as you.” </p><p>“T-that’s not true,” Nancy stammered while Stacy moved behind her, and I listened to a small scuffle between them about who was the true lesbian out of the two, and who was just experimenting. </p><p>“Nonsense, that’s completely inaccurate,” Stacy cut in after Nancy alluded to another story to support her point. Amusingly, as their argument continued, her shyness disappeared slowly, replaced by playful anger as she tried to counter her friend. </p><p>“I guess he has to trust one of us,” Nancy said as she looked at me with a smirk. </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I said, matching her smirk. “After all, talk is cheap, but there’s nothing preventing you from putting on an actual show, does it,” I suggested, giving Nancy the opportunity she was searching for, already positioned behind Stacy. </p><p>And she didn’t waste even a second as she hugged her friend from behind, making her tense. Stacy tried to lift herself, realizing that she was about to get caught, but it was impossible as she was being pushed down. “Let’s do it,” she said as she let her hands trail upward, brushing against the underside of her breast. “Unless you are scared, of course.” </p><p>“M-me, scared! Never,” Stacy answered. Her tone wasn’t exactly convincing, or filled with determination, but Nancy only care about the official permission as her hands moved up, sliding up, caressing her breasts and teasing her erect nipples. </p><p>Which seemed to be the correct choice that was born from experience. Nancy started leaving out a trail of kisses along her neck, showing a great familiarity with her body — enough to suggest that their sessions of fun might not be just limited to finals week as they suggested initially. </p><p> Stacy moaned as one of her hands slipped inside her jersey, caressing her breasts aggressively. The pleasure made her close her eyes, which was the thing that prevented her from noticing Nancy’s other hand sneaking down. </p><p>“Oh, what’s going on here,” Nancy said gleefully even as her fingers landed directly on her core, brushing against my shaft which was going in and out of her. </p><p>“I — I can —“ Stacy managed to say, which was all she was able to say before Nancy pressed her other hand against her lips, replicating their earlier position. </p><p>“No need,” she said with a chuckle. “But I can now understand why you are confident that you are winning, you sneaky slut,” she whispered. Her calling her friend might have been insulting in other circumstances, but it was significantly less effective when her fingers were right at her entrance, teasing her. </p><p>“I —“ she tried to say after Nancy pulled her hand away from her mouth, but this time she was interrupted by her own body, her moans getting louder as her arousal reached an earthshaking point, her moans warning about the earthquake that was about to hit. </p><p>And it hit spectacularly soon after, making her collapse against my chest even as Stacy pulled back, her legs wide as she teased herself with her fingers, enjoying the show immensely.</p><p>It was a beautiful moment, one that promised a  lot about what was about to follow. </p><p>Too bad it was interrupted by a knock. “Why’s that door locked, Nurse Lawson,” said a sharp, serious voice. </p><p>Someone important, if their matching gazes of shock were to be trusted.</p>
