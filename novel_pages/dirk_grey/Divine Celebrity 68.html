        <p>I had many fun expectations from the morning. </p><p>After all, I had gone to sleep with two beauties in my arms, one exhausted redhead after the amazing time we spent together, and one tense yet aroused blonde who was stubborn enough to get into the bed naked just to prove a point. </p><p>And, since they were still in my arms when I woke up, the amazing things I dreamed about seemed to be the case. The warmth of their bodies was superior to any blanket I could even imagine.</p><p>I glanced at Megan, curious just how much it would take to ignite her competitiveness toward her best friend until she joined our morning exercise even if she didn’t join to make it a proper threesome. </p><p>Too bad fate chose to intervene once more, and I woke up to the horrible noise of an air horn. “Wake up, you pathetic worms,” came a loud shout, from a voice I failed to recognize. </p><p>“Don’t move, probably one of those stupid morning hazings,” Megan murmured as her arms tightened around me, her warmth enough to awaken a certain part of my anatomy. </p><p>From the window, I could see that the sun was high enough to tell that noon had already come and gone, but I didn’t bother correcting that little detail. </p><p>There was little difference between morning hazing and afternoon hazing. </p><p>I was about to agree with her point, but then another shout arrived. </p><p>One that I recognized as belonging to Arnie, the starting quarterback. </p><p>“No, it’s not,” I said even as I extracted from the bed, jumping to get my pants. “Wake Kim up, and start dressing.” Of course, technically, there was a high likelihood that whatever made the offensive team react didn’t react to my immediate attention, but I preferred to be on the safe side. </p><p>One didn’t survive the streets by assuming the best in unexpected situations. </p><p>While Megan looked rather disbelieving at first, preferring to go to sleep, the several shouts that followed, similar in content, were enough to change her mind. </p><p>“They sound angry,” she said as I pulled on my pants, and put the car keys in my pocket. I looked around for my shirt but failed to find it immediately, so I abandoned that direction in favor of finding something that could be used as a weapon without being obvious. </p><p>My hand already went to my keys reflexively halfway before I stopped myself, remembering that using anything that could leave permanent damage was a bad idea even if things came to a fight. </p><p>“Yes, they are,” I said even as Megan started poking Kim, trying to wake her up. Meanwhile, I continued looking around until I saw a little spiral of metal, some kind of decorative item, but an excellent way to give my punches some extra edge if necessary. </p><p>I didn’t expect that to be necessary, not with the amazing number of Traits I gained from the football match. </p><p>But it was better safe than sorry. </p><p>At the doorway, I looked back. “Dress quickly, then come to the stairs, and make sure you’re ready to live stream if I give you the signal,” I said, bringing my palm to my back, my index finger bent. </p><p>I had no doubt that, any other college girl in Megan’s place — especially the rich kind — would have been blaming me for overreacting, or trying to make sure I stayed with them to protect them, in case things had gotten violent. </p><p>Yet, Megan proved her attitude by acting rather than trying to keep me inside with pointless questions. </p><p>It was not very likely that things would burst into violence, but it was not impossible either. </p><p>I was getting tenser and tenser as I walked down, because I could hear several defensive players answering, and while their voice was boisterous at first, that was soon replaced by shock. </p><p>“Impossible,” I heard more than one shouting, but anything more had been lost in the cacophony. </p><p>When I reached the top of the stairs, I didn’t look immediately but used my phone, to check the situation with my phone camera. A little exaggerated, maybe, but old habits died hard. </p><p>The situation was even more interesting. The offensive team was there in full force, including all of the backups, and most of the practice squad players — both defensive and offensive — stood behind them. </p><p>To compare, barely half of the defensive team was there, and most of the crowd slowly went away during the party. </p><p>Yet, some of the people I expected to be there were not there as well. Thad, for example, didn’t seem like a guy who would leave a party early. </p><p>Then, I remembered him mentioning an early meeting with Coach Bill. </p><p>Carter was not there as well, but that was less surprising, as, unlike others, he did take his business seriously, and only stayed in the party enough to make the team feel like he hadn’t been snubbing them. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but frown at his absence even more than Thad. Carter was cold and calculative, but he also treated being captain as the only responsibility in his life, and did everything around that — and his eventual hope of going professional. </p><p>Him not hearing such a great commotion was near impossible. </p><p>I frowned as I looked around, trying to find someone that could actually take the position of leadership. It hadn’t been a long time on the team, but I was exposed to it enough that, there were four other players that had the personality to act appropriately in such a situation. </p><p>Three others were not there. </p><p>The fourth was me, watching from upstairs, trying to decide what to do. </p><p>Of course, I had just recently earned that reputation, a combination of my performance, and Carter’s very explicit transfer of power ensuring that I had enough weight to stabilize the situation without other faces. </p><p>Yet, the absence of all of them was suspicious. I remembered Thad mentioning something about a meeting with the Coach, but that was supposed to be long finished. </p><p>I glanced down, fighting my instincts to do the logical thing and extract myself from the situation by climbing down the window. And while Megan and Kim were here, the offensive team was clearly more in the mood to deal with the other players, and even they were not stupid enough to attack girls. </p><p>At least, during the day, under everyone’s view. </p><p>Yet, while their safety was not a problem, I had a bigger one, my reputation. Normally, I wouldn’t care the slightest about my reputation when facing almost three-to-one odds that could trigger violence. </p><p>But things changed when that reputation was currently giving me literal superpowers. </p><p>As I considered that, I saw Megan looking from the doorway. I caught her gaze. “Start recording, but don’t put on the net yet,” I said, confident enough that it wouldn’t be heard during the mess that was going on downstairs. </p><p>Then, I started climbing down the stairs. </p><p>“Wow, it smells down there,” I said as I arrived downstairs, and started walking forward in a confident gait, one that was designed to display unwavering confidence to the other players. </p><p>It was not something I would have considered usually, but one of my newest traits, Leadership, gave me the necessary boost to remind that. </p><p>“Oh, look what the cat dragged in,” Kevin stopped behind one of the offensive linemen, showing that his habit was to hide there even outside the game. </p><p>I didn’t need the assistance of Taunt to know that ignoring him would have been the greatest insult I could lay on him. Instead, I turned to Arnold. “Arnie, what the fuck is going on that needs you lot to shout like fishermen’s wives in this ungodly hour.” </p><p>I loved the flash of anger going through the faces of both quarterbacks, one being called by a diminutive he hated, the other for being ignored. </p><p>“It’s noon,” answered one of the offensive linemen, suggesting that, while not all football players avoided the stereotype. Some were dumb enough to miss an obvious setup. </p><p>“Yes, but unlike you, we actually have to play to win our games,” I answered, which earned several chuckles behind me. </p><p>Yet, that was all it earned, which was rather serious. Normally, they would have reacted much more explosively to the favorite pastime of the defensive players, mocking the offense for being useless. </p><p>Kevin was the first one to answer, though I had a sinking feeling in my stomach as rather than getting angry, he had a smug smile on his face. </p><p>Something really monumental must have happened. </p><p>“Oh, I wonder how useful defense would be going forward now that Coach Bill quit.” </p><p>Okay, I thought. That would do.</p>
