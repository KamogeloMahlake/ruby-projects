        <p>With the beautiful Queen obediently laying on her bed, naked, and the equally beautiful loyal —  for a given value, at least  — knight of hers standing next to the bed, matching her in the amount of clothing, I found myself facing a delicious buffet, filled with choices, each more precious than the last. </p><p>Normally, choosing would have been difficult. </p><p>But what if such a buffet had a meal I failed to get a taste of no matter how much I wanted…A delicacy that was only possible due to the unique circumstances of the beautiful moment I found myself facing. </p><p>“What a disrespectful knight of yours, daring to say such insulting words about stabbing,” I whispered to Sapphire’s ear, with absolutely no attempt to actually keep my tone low.. Valkyrie’s eyes widened, realizing what I was driving at. </p><p>“Very disrespectful,” Sapphire whispered innocently.</p><p>I chuckled. “One might almost say, treasonous,” I added, making Valkyrie reach even more. Not in fear like the latter of the words implied, but a softer, more heated reaction against the tone I had used, realizing what I was driving at. </p><p>“Yes, that would be … accurate,” Sapphire gasped. </p><p>“She deserves a punishment, doesn’t she?” </p><p>“Y-yes, she does,” Sapphire muttered immediately. </p><p>“And who better to do that than the Queen herself,” I said, slapping her hips. “Go and punish your disrespectful knight,” I ordered. She was quick to follow my command as she was lost in the moment. </p><p>Valkyrie tensed under my naughty gaze. During our heated yet transactional relationship, there were limits that she wasn’t willing to touch, punishments and submission being the main ones. After all, for a Knight to submit to the enemy meant something, even in the weird nature of our ‘battles’.</p><p>But what happened if it was her Queen, who symbolized her loyalty, that asked for her submission? I didn’t know the answer, but testing was too tempting to ignore. </p><p>It looked like Valkyrie didn’t know either, watching Sapphire’s struggle as she tried to stand up, the excited trembling of her legs giving her momentary trouble — but the impact of those trembles on her curvy body was simply spectacular. </p><p>Valkyrie neither said anything, nor did she make the slightest movement as Sapphire slowly walked behind her, and put her hands on her shoulders. “Yes, she deserves a punishment,” Sapphire whispered, her voice much sharper behind Valkyrie.</p><p>Reminding us that she was not the Queen by accident. </p><p>I didn’t know what Valkyrie would have done without that shift. Maybe she would have just played along, or maybe, she would choose to commit treason. Only as a technicality, as Valkyrie was smart enough to realize there would be no real implications. </p><p>But as a woman who struggled her whole life between the meaning of duty and honor, fun-sized treason was not an easy concept to digest. </p><p>Either way, that was only academic, as Valkyrie didn’t resist the slightest as Sapphire pushed her forward, unable to react even as Sapphire pushed her down, directly in front of me, her knees on the floor. </p><p>“You can’t be—“ Valkyrie started, but that was all she was able to say before Sapphire grabbed her hair and pushed her down. She did so with a speed that surprised me as I felt her throat around my shaft. </p><p>Valkyrie might have been surprised as well, but her gags and gasps were rather hard to decipher. </p><p>“Not a bad punishment for her crimes, is it?” Sapphire said, her voice mocking as she found her courage immediately. I was surprised for a moment before I realized that it was not a huge surprise. She was already used to switching between the role of the Queen and Dancer regularly. </p><p>A naughty yet aggressive concubine was just somewhere between the two. </p><p>She continued pushing, getting even more aggressive. To make it even more fun, Valkyrie had more than enough strength to push her back if she wished, yet she was helplessly obeying. </p><p>“Certainly not,” I said, my gaze bouncing between my glistening shaft repeatedly disappearing into Valkyrie’s tight throat and Sapphire’s smug smirk, wondering if Sapphire’s aggressive opening salvo would be too much for her to handle. </p><p>Yet, Valkyrie showed that her title as a great knight was not empty, accepting the physical part of the punishment like a true champion.  </p><p>The mental part, not so much, her gaze clouded with a confused mess of anger, desire, and shock, sprinkled with a dose of excitement.  </p><p>“It’s good that it’s just a start, then,” Sapphire said even as she grabbed her hair and pushed her down even more, challenging her even more aggressively. </p><p>“Let me help,” I said, and cast a few spells, breaking pieces from a chair and ripping some from the curtains, ruining two precious artifacts to create a beautiful paddle, and passed it to Sapphire, who had absolutely no problem with the destruction of her own room. </p><p>Valkyrie reacted with shock. I knew that it wasn’t about the upcoming pain.  She dismissed actual deadly wounds on the battlefield, and even her training sessions were much harder than anything that Sapphire could achieve with her meager physical strength. </p><p>Her reaction was about the indignity of being spanked, and the utter dismissal it included. The fact that the thick velvet cover of the paddle would reduce the pain even more only made it more insulting. Without the pain to distract, only spanks remained. </p><p>The paddle landed on her tight ass, and a muffled moan escaped her mouth, softer and more confused than anything else I had heard her making. Sapphire’s other hand, still firmly holding her down, didn’t make the sound any less whimpery, just added a gag to follow. </p><p>“Feel free to tap my leg if you can’t handle your punishment,” I said as I felt Valkyrie wavering. Not to give her a chance to pull back, but to tease her, knowing she would loathe to stop with that challenge. </p><p>Yet, that did nothing to actually reduce the confusing insults her current position triggered in her. Locked in her position, feeling like she couldn’t pull back, she just accepted the punishment passively, each beat confusing her more. </p><p>Her confused expression was not unfamiliar to me, but the intensity was certainly surprising, suggesting that it was not just her role that was preventing her from experimenting with those feelings.</p><p>I suspected some confusing instincts that she did her best to keep down played a role as well. </p><p>I didn’t say anything as Sapphire continued assisting her deep-throat while spanking her, not commenting that, with every push to assist her head required less strength with Valkyrie doing the rest. </p><p>Sapphire looked at me, then to her hand, wordlessly asking for assistance. Happy that she didn’t suddenly start throwing orders at me by losing control, I decided to grant the help she needed, and grabbed Valkyrie’s head, taking the role of repeatedly pushing her down. </p><p>Then, I helped her even more by conjuring a chair. </p><p>Sapphire wrapped her in chains rapidly before speaking. “Excellent idea, my lord,” she whispered, her choice of wording making  Valkyrie flinch even harder than anything else had done. </p><p>Sapphire’s satisfied smirk showed that she was very much aware of that fact — not that it made the way she referred to me any less accurately. </p><p>Without the need to constantly push Valkyrie down, Sapphire’s hand started to move adventurously, one landing on Valkyrie’s back, the other on my knee, both crawling their destination toward a soft, lingering touch that perfectly fit her reputation. </p><p>As a dancer, not as the Queen… </p><p>Valkyrie didn’t say anything about that, but to her defense, her mouth was busy with a task she couldn’t extract herself from unless she surrendered, and her pride was clearly more important than making a comment. </p><p> I bit my lips as Sapphire wrapped her fingers around my girth, caressing the area whenever Valkyrie pulled back, creating a nice chase. At the same time, her other hand continued to move down, caressing her hips for a moment, then turning into a slap. </p><p>One that made Valkyrie even more than the paddle. </p><p> Yet, with her lips around my shaft, her reaction was limited to illegible moans and nothing else. </p><p>I couldn’t help but look at Sapphire, who was watching her loyal knight struggle with a huge smirk, her lips curled beautifully enough to mesmerize me. Though, that didn’t prevent me from pushing Valkyrie up and down, the tightness of her throat amazing as she gagged and wheezed. </p><p>“Not a bad performance for a little traitorous knight that’s making plans to assassinate her Queen, isn’t it?” I asked, enjoying Sapphire’s mocking smirk. </p><p>Even as I thought whether to push her more, or ask Sapphire to show how it was really done…</p>
