        <p>With Emma collapsed in exhaustion, I was tempted to crawl next to her in her soft bed, getting some more sleep. The nap I had while waiting for her was far from enough to completely get rid of my tiredness. </p><p>Ultimately, however, I decided against it despite the temptation, for one important reason. Even after dominating her so thoroughly, I didn’t trust her enough to sleep next to her, not with her latest alliance with the Phoenixes. My instincts wouldn’t have allowed it to be enjoyable. And, after the exhausting day I had, I certainly didn’t want to go back to sleep in my uncomfortable cell. </p><p>Today’s string of successes deserved a better celebration. </p><p>Luckily, there was a comfortable location with no problems of trust. I changed my destination to the room of my favorite princess, once again using the convenience of the secret entrances to arrive there without raising any alarm. </p><p>I found Aria in her bed, her sleeping figure, surrounded by the white silk of her bedding, beautiful enough to qualify as a work of art. If I was less exhausted, I might have watched her for hours, enjoying the way her beautiful bosom softly rose with every breath, straining her cute nightie’s ability to keep them hidden. </p><p>However, I was still tired, so I decided to react more directly. I shed my clothing and slipped into her bed, spooning her from behind, the softness of her curves superior to her bed. I felt her stirring, her beautiful blue eyes opening blaringly. “Go back to sleep, love,” I murmured as I closed my eyes, but not before seeing a huge smile bloom in her face as she stirred in my arms, setting even better. </p><p>The sleep was much more comfortable than the quick nap I had got earlier, her warmth contained under her soft blankets, and I woke up to the delicious smell of some kind of pastry. </p><p>Pity that my arms were empty. </p><p>I cracked my eyes, and looked at the open door, which allowed me to see the small, connected kitchen, where Aria was bustling around, wearing an apron. </p><p>And only an apron. </p><p>“Okay,” I murmured as I stretched in the bed, enjoying the softness, luxury, and the lack of exhaustion, though the beautiful sight of my blonde princess walking around, better than naked as she did her best to prepare my breakfast. </p><p>The picture of total decadence. </p><p>I was tempted to stand up and join her, but the warmth of the bed was stronger than the cell that was supposed to keep me locked. Instead, I continued to lay half-asleep, dazed, watching as my naked-apron princess bustle as she filled plate after plate, fruits, pastries, and other delicious food, turning the late breakfast into a spectacular feast, amazing enough to match the spectacular beauty of her mostly-naked body. </p><p>“You’re awake,” she murmured as she finally finished the preparations, and brought the large tray to her bed, though my attention was on her breasts, her nipples peeking through her frilly apron. </p><p>“I am, beautiful,” I said even as I gestured for her to walk closer. She placed the tray on the bed and leaned for a kiss, giving me something even more delicious than the great breakfast she had prepared. “And with this amazing sight in front of me, I’m wide awake.” </p><p>Her blush at my compliment, despite her nakedness, just underlined her cuteness. </p><p>“I thought … you might use a good breakfast,” she murmured. </p><p>“I certainly do, and so do you. That energy will be very helpful for other activities I had planned for us,” I said, which hardly helped her blush. Unfortunately, that energy wasn’t going to be just used for some fun naked times, like a lot of spell casting I would have to do to explore the palace and reinforce the defenses of her room, but I didn’t want to tell her that right now, not wanting to ruin the mood yet. </p><p>“Come, sit, so that we can enjoy the amazing breakfast you prepared for us,” I said. She grabbed the ribbon of her apron, about to remove it, when I gestured for her to stop. “No, keep it on,” I said. </p><p>“Okay,” she murmured, her blush beautiful. She tried to sit next to me, something I prevented by wrapping my arm around her delicate waist, and pulling her on my lap instead. The resulting beautiful moan was hardly an indication of distaste. </p><p>Since the apron didn’t cover anywhere other than a little line around her waist, our naked flesh connected. Although slipping inside her was tempting, I decided to enjoy the breakfast she had prepared first. </p><p>In a manner of speaking. I grabbed a piece of fruit, but rather than eating it directly, I chose to feed it to my princess while I busied myself by softly kissing her neck while she enjoyed her food. When I pulled back, she had already grabbed a piece of pastry, combined with some cheese, ready to be enjoyed by me. </p><p>I started chewing, an explosion of flavor hitting my tongue. “Delicious,” I murmured. “I didn’t know you were such a good cook.” </p><p>“It helps me to relax when things get too hard,” she murmured. “It’s a secret stress relief.” </p><p>“Your secret is safe with me,” I whispered, followed by a kiss to her soft cheek, enjoying her soft tremble. “And, as far as the secrets that only I know goes, it’s not exactly a big one. There are others. For example, I know that there’s a particularly sensitive spot under your chin.” </p><p>I continued with the practical display of it as I sneaked a soft kiss under her chin, triggering another beautiful moan. “I can stay like this, forever,” Aria murmured. “Maybe we should just run away and find a nice cottage.” </p><p>“Tempting,” I murmured, and much to my surprise, I found myself actually tempted by the idea. Pity that the sudden appearance of Elves and Phoenixes made even dreaming about such a world impossible. </p><p>Not when I had no idea about their objective in the first place. </p><p>Still, the amazing massage of Aria’s naked butt as she shuffled in place was a perfect trigger for me to focus back to reality, momentarily ignoring the upcoming disaster. I slipped my hands under her apron, caressing her naked stomach as she slowly fed me the delicious dishes she had cooked for me, each more delicious than the last. Slowly, I was getting full, marking the time to enjoy a different kind of dish. </p><p>“You’re as good as a cook as you’re beautiful,” I whispered, the compliment working wonders to add a little more speed to her movement. Her hips started to rock over my lap faster, making my shaft grow in the beautiful valley it was currently buried. </p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured. </p><p>“But there’s missing, I need some milk,” I said. </p><p>“We have some,” she said, pointing at the glass. </p><p>“Nope, I don’t like that glass,” I answered as I suddenly flipped her, and she found herself laying on her back. A tug was enough to get rid of the apron, leaving her completely naked. I grabbed the milk glass, dripping some on her breasts, before licking them clean with slow, methodical care. “This, however, a much better presentation.” </p><p>She said nothing as her shyness battled with her arousal, allowing me to enjoy my drink slowly. “Hmm, not delicious enough,” I said, which earned a gaze that could almost be classified as angry, though that only lasted until I grabbed some of the delicious chocolate and spread it on her breasts. “Much better,” I murmured as I enjoyed my dessert. </p><p>I could feel her desperate gaze on me as I stayed focused on her breasts, using them as the most extravagant food delivery surfaces I ever had the pleasure of using. </p><p>Her back arched as the pleasure hit, making the sight even more beautiful, especially when her legs parted, wordlessly begging for her final meal. But, enjoying the sight of her trembling and stretched-out body, I had no intention of hurrying up. </p><p>A feast deserved proper savoring. </p><p>“Who is a naughty princess?” I whispered as my lips clasped around her beautiful nipple, making her tremble helplessly.  </p><p>“I’m not … naught,” she managed to moan as my tongue danced over her hard nipple, triggering a flood of pleasure. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, unable to hide my amusement as I pulled back. Lying on her bed, naked, her back arching to push her chocolate-stained breasts even higher to display them perfectly, she wasn’t exactly radiating innocence. Especially when the treasure between her legs sopping wet. I slipped a finger in, enjoying her wetness while simultaneously triggering a moan. </p><p>When I pulled it back, my finger was glistening beautifully. “If you’re not naughty, how are you going to explain it?” </p><p>“It’s your fault,” she answered immediately, though her legs, widening even further, didn’t seem to be displaying great acrimony for my fault. </p><p>“Hah, just like royalty, blaming others for your own faults,” I said as I lowered myself over her body once more. </p><p>Surprisingly, rather than continuing to lay, she put her elbows on the bed and pushed her body up — which made her look even sexier. “I’m a princess. My word is law, and my judgment is final. I’m not naughty, and it’s your fault. And you’re sentenced to fix it.”</p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk salaciously as she tried to be authoritative. Even discounting the beautiful sight that would have destroyed any authority, she was as threatening as a cute kitten trying to intimidate a lion… </p><p>I wondered which would be more enjoyable. Playing along, or reminding her about the dark and sexy authority of a dark lord? </p>
