        <p>Pushing Emma down to devour my shaft, feeling the warmth of her lips, not only provided me with great pleasure, but also gave me some time to think about Emma’s recent actions.</p><p>More importantly, in relation to the sudden shift in her objectives. Our latest ‘deal’ had been very specific, with me revealing some of the double agents of the dark faction for her — the ones working for my rivals, obviously — while she arranged certain benefits, like a comfortable prison cell.</p><p>Her desire to make her mark in the Empire politics was clearly unchanged — but unfortunately, her incredible magical ability certainly didn’t make her politically competent. With her desires one-directional and easy to read, she was easily manipulated. The Queen started it the first, followed by Fernhand before I took the lead.</p><p>And now, implied by her focus on scouring the library with great hurry in the middle of the night rather than trying to convince the Queen to change my interrogation method, her latest backer.</p><p>Ironically, her first attempt immediately betrayed her new backer, just by her research topic. Before even asking her one question about the mysterious party, I learned a lot of things.</p><p>And the most important piece of information was that another group was searching for information about those mysterious ward-makers.</p><p>A more direct Dark Lord might have ignored the implications of it, but for me, that single fact came with an incredible wealth of information. Their detailed research topics suggested that they had a better understanding of the information available in the library, enough to give Emma a research guide. But the fact that they were researching in the first place meant that their information about the mysterious party was not complete, making it necessary for them to use subterfuge, trying to get more information.</p><p>However, there were also more dangerous implications hidden in the attempt. Sending Emma to the library in the middle of the night to get all the information at once was more dangerous than spreading the same attempt for the next month, allowing her to get a few pieces of information every day.</p><p>Such hurry implied that the other party had a reason to hurry up. The clue that triggered my research, the wards embedded in the throne room, was in place for years without the slightest touch and maintenance, hence, the reason I was doing a more comprehensive sweep about its roots.</p><p>But what if the mysterious party was active somewhere else, in a way with more immediate implications?</p><p>Fuck, I thought even as I grabbed Emma’s beautiful red hair tightly, slamming her face aggressively, more to bleed my frustration than to soften her for the following interrogation. Just as I felt that I had control of the situation and relax, another wild variable came, ruining my plans.</p><p>I hated the feeling of control slipping off my fingers.</p><p>Luckily, I thought as I looked down at the beautiful redhead that was busy massaging my girth with her throat, that I had the perfect double spy already in place to get a better understanding of the situation.</p><p>Though, I was certainly happy that I had undersold my abilities to Emma and didn’t give her even a flicker of my true inclinations. She might be a capable mage, but she was certainly a terribly unlucky spy.</p><p>“Take it deeper,” I murmured even as I pushed her head down, even more, enjoying the enveloping sensation. There was no harm in properly weakening her resistance before launching another chain of subtle interrogation.</p><p>With my iron grip not allowing her to retreat, her only option was to bring me to completion as quickly as possible. Her hands landed on my thighs, using it as leverage to take me even deeper, showing just how much she had learned during our last encounter, where my sexy princess and I double-teamed her mercilessly as a punishment for an extended while.</p><p>Since she was showing such an amazing commitment, I pulled my hands away from her head, and focused on her remaining pieces of clothing. A few controlled cutting spells made sure to leave every single piece of clothing she owned — other than her outer robe — into pieces.</p><p>The image of her retreating from the library, her body underneath covered with my cum, was almost as electrifying as the treatment I was receiving.</p><p>I grabbed her naked breasts, squeezing and slapping, as she tried her best to bring me to completion, her lips dancing along my length aggressively, getting even faster as I squeezed her nipple, earning a delicious moan off her.</p><p>Her obedience was getting smoother and smoother…</p><p>Marking the time for the next stage of the interrogation. As much as I hated stopping halfway before giving her the reward she was in the process of earning, I needed her tense and aching for completion to interrogate her indirectly, without realizing the nature of my questions. She might not be an excellent spy, but she wasn’t stupid either.</p><p>She was rattled as I suddenly grabbed her waist and lifted her, her body weightless against my strength. Confusion was clear in her eyes as her ass landed on the smooth surface of the desk once more. “Is something wrong?” she stammered.</p><p>I chuckled, amused by the fact that she was more interested in why we stopped rather than sitting on the desk naked, her amazing body on display for anyone that might burst in — though, in this hour, it wasn’t very likely. “I decided to give you a momentary break,” I answered with a chuckle.</p><p>“There’s no need for it,” she answered, her answer curiously rapid, and her eyes dipping down, tinged with desire. “I can continue.”</p><p>The interrogation wasn’t just fun for me, it seemed.</p><p>“I’m sure you can,” I said as I took a step forward, bringing our bodies dangerously close. Her legs parted wide even as she slid forward, bringing me the perfect position to slip inside. Unfortunately for her, rather than responding to my slipping inside, I put my hand on her knob, caressing gently. Not enough to push her toward the completion, just enough to keep her tense. “Oh, but I also have some questions about your new spell. Can’t I just ask them?”</p><p>She might not be the sharpest political agent, but even in her aroused state, she didn’t miss that it was just a rhetorical question, a part of my dominance game. “S-sure,” she tried to say, interrupted midway with a moan as I flicked my fingers.</p><p>There was a certain satisfaction watching her tremble under my gentle touch as she tried to fight against the desires of her own body, unable to help but contain them even on the edge of a climax. It was the thing that people misunderstood about the sense of domination, mistaking it for mere sadism or childish tantrum, as if aggressively threatening a powerless widow could ever rival silencing one of the strongest mages of the Empire with a touch of my fingers, silently begging for a climax even as she tried to explain a mysterious spell structure for me.</p><p>And the pleasure I was getting from keeping on the edge was just one benefit. As I hit her with more and more in-depth questions about her nonexistent spell, shedding her poor cover story, she had to rely more and more on the core of the array she was researching.</p><p>It wasn’t that she knew a lot about the magic theory relating to the mysterious array itself, making her cover story about the new spell almost nonsensical as I continually ask her more questions, even as she had tapped into the limited information she had on the mysterious new direction.</p><p>But like before, the absence of the information was information itself, especially as she continued to lose coherency, drunk with pleasure, tortured on the edge, making her answers more incoherent yet honest at the same time.</p><p>And it revealed that whatever new group she had switched after her latest betrayal, they didn’t trust Emma with a lot of information about the nature of the new magical discipline. They just gave her enough information to make her search in the library a smooth affair, but not explain her more. They either acquired her as an asset recently, or didn’t trust her to reveal more.</p><p>Maybe a combination, which would be smart, considering Emma’s loose lips. Though that hardly helped me to pin the identity of her supporter. I could have tried to ask her directly, but that would have alerted her about the real focus of the interrogation, something I was reluctant to do at the moment. Unfortunately, the magic part of the interrogation hit a dead end. More magical questions wouldn’t give any worthwhile information on the subject, but questioning her about the power behind her would alert her again.</p><p>It was a tough decision, so rather than making an immediate decision, I decided to take a break, her naked body in front of me, trembling with unmet arousal, giving me the perfect tool to relax.</p><p>I grabbed her shoulder and pushed her against the table, earning a shocked gasp at the collusion, followed by an even louder gasp as three of my fingers slipped inside her, earning a delicious moan in the process.</p><p>I pumped my fingers aggressively, each twirl making let-out moans filled with desire. My empty hand landed on her breasts, squeezing a cry among her moans. She tried to say something, but that melted into her moans. I didn’t even let her take a breath, until she started trembling desperately, her body turning limp, gushing.</p><p>Only then, I pull my fingers out of her beautiful entrance, still undecided about what to do. I expected her to lie on the desk, trying to catch her breath.</p><p>I certainly wasn’t expecting her to reach to her robe desperately as she turned at the entrance, where the door was still closed. Damn, I thought, realizing that her last panic was likely her alarm wards triggering. “Y-you need to leave,” she stammered even as she hastily pulled her robe on and — after a frustrated glare at me — burned the scraps of her ruined clothing, not even leaving a particle of ash behind.</p><p>Her elemental competency was not a joke.</p><p>The reaction she displayed, and the request for me to disappear rather than help her, made it clear that it was an ally of her that arrived.</p><p>I had another important decision to make, and I didn’t like it.</p><p>Things were starting to move faster than I had been hoping, threatening to ruin my comfortable nest…</p>
