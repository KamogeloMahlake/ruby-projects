        <p>As usual, I started with a spell to coat my fingers with massage oil, once again leveraging the more utilitarian aspects of my Biomancy Skill, enjoying the convenience it provided. </p><p>[-281 Mana]</p><p>My mana consumption was much higher than that trick required, but that wasn’t exactly useful. Most of the mana I had spent wasn’t consumed by the oil spell, but carefully mixed into the outcome as I prepared for my next trick, ready to deliver a proper infusion of mana along with with the massage. </p><p>I wanted to do to test the tricks I had learned after working on Janelor. </p><p>Marianne and Titania wouldn’t benefit from that as intensely as Janelor, but that didn’t mean that it would be completely wasteful. Especially since I was carefully manipulating the mana into a warm sensation with the assistance of Tantric. </p><p>Marianne’s moans rose, more intense than usual, showing her appreciation for my new trick. </p><p>“Well, this feels nostalgic,” I murmured even as I let my hands dance on Marianne’s back, couldn’t help but remember how our relationship started, first through trickery, then through addicting her to my touch, making her moan more and more… </p><p>“S-shut up,” Marianne murmured while I covered her back with the massage oil, clearly feeling self-conscious about the memories. Just not enough to actually ask me to stop,  instead arching her back in appreciation. </p><p>I chuckled as I finished covering her back, then let the oil warm over her body while I turned to Titania, who was lying on her back. </p><p>“Someone is enthusiastic,” I murmured with a chuckle even as I caught Titania’s gaze, enjoying her blush even before I started working on her body. And, since she lay in such an inviting pose, I decided to take that as an invitation for a more aggressive start. </p><p>And started by squeezing her beautiful breasts. </p><p>Titania didn’t answer, busy moaning as I squeezed her nipples. </p><p> “Damn, it just had been a few days, but I missed you two,” I said with a smirk even as I let my hands climb up to her neck, not wanting to push her too fast and too hard because just after a few touches, she was showing the signs of melting. </p><p>Yet, even as I slowed down the treatment, I was amazed at the speed Titania was folding, suggesting that, after getting used to the sensation of pleasure, she was developing a weakness to it. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>The notification that popped into my sight was certainly as welcome as her moans, giving me a little burst of power to push me toward the next level. I continued to work on her neck as I enjoyed her shivers, signaling her anticipation, filled with desire. </p><p>I let my hands wander on her body momentarily to cover the rest of her body with the massage oil before going back to her neck, applying the full range of my massage skills to her in a soft gentleness. </p><p>A subtle purr started escaping her mouth soon as my fingers destroyed the stress she had accumulated during her extended mission. Yet, I pulled back to attend to the other naked beauty that was waiting for me, terminated Titania’s service momentarily. </p><p>Titania sent a fleeting glare toward me as I pulled my hands away, clearly unhappy with the early stop. “We’re just warming up, sweetie,” I said as I put my hands on Marianne’s curvy body once more. “A little patience.” </p><p>Titania didn’t look particularly happy about that idea, but that didn’t prevent her from starting to watch me as I started working on Marianne’s body properly. </p><p>“You’re right, a little patience—“ Marianne tried to tease Titania, only for her words to fade into a moan as my fingers danced along her spine, finding one of her many sensitive spots to trigger a moan. </p><p>It was Titania’s turn to chuckle as I continued to tease Marianne… </p><p>As much as I wanted to move to the main event, I wanted the girls to rest after their difficult mission as well, so I restricted myself to massaging them for the next several minutes, alternating between them, destroying the stiffness that had been accumulated during their tedious mission.  </p><p>It was not without its benefits, of course, as playing with Titania gave me rather beautiful rewards, which, while not enough to make me reach the next level, pushed me to the border of it.  </p><p>[+1000 Experience] </p><p>It was time to push for even more. </p><p>I focused on Titania even more, grabbing her legs as I continued to massage her inner thighs, her eyes closed under the invasion of pleasure. Therefore, she didn’t notice my spell to get rid of my clothes. </p><p>Marianne noticed it, but rather than complaining, she shifted her position to get a better view of the show, her eyes brimming with enthusiasm. </p><p>Titania’s rumbling and mewling were interrupted when I slid inside her without a warning, the sensation of her warmth enveloping my shaft unmatched. </p><p>Though, the emotions triggered by the double-notification were a close second. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 76%]</p><p>I let my gaze slip back to Marianne, catching her gaze for a fleeting moment, whose lips were curled in amusement as she watched Titania’s spectacular moan in amusement. I couldn’t help but feel that her amusement was more about the fact that Titania was more hesitant than her in bed than the pleasure she was deriving from the view. </p><p>Not that the pleasure she was deriving from the scene was not significant, evidenced by the way her fingers disappeared inside her, dancing around her knob mercilessly. </p><p>Watching Marianne was fun, but not as much as watching Titania who was busy gasping and moaning under my surprise assault, the calm yet steady invasion of my shaft working wonders to resolve the last scraps of the stress she was suffering under. </p><p>Rather effectively. </p><p>Her moans got only more intense as I slid my hands under her hips, raising them to a more convenient angle for my repeated invasions while my fingers dug into her tight ass. </p><p>“So, tell me, how was the mission?” I asked with a casualness that contrasted greatly with my other actions. </p><p>“R-right now?” Titania managed to stammer between her moans as she opened her eyes. </p><p>“Why not?” I answered, trying to look calm, but unable to prevent an amused quirk of my lips. </p><p>Titania’s look of surprise was beautiful. “M-maybe Marianne can explain instead,” she offered. </p><p>I looked at Marianne, who was busy enjoying the show we were putting on in a way that kept her fingers very busy. “She is clearly busy, it would be rude to ask her,” I said. Titania sent me a frustrated glare, but that was all she could do, as before she spoke, I quickened my hips, the intensifying pleasure burning her words. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t handle it?” Marianne commented from the side between her moans, followed by a chuckle. </p><p>Titania’s blush was simply beautiful. “Of course I can,” she declared with a dedication that reminded me of the times I had only seen as the scary head librarian that I could never touch. “The mission started by targeting several rumored undead presence, though we didn’t expect to find much,” Titania said. </p><p>“Let me guess, because of some internal analysis, discounting the possibility of a significant undead presence,”  I said. </p><p>“Exactly, someone was clearly fiddling with the reports to make us underestimate the undead presence. The potential was much more than we expected, ready to invade the nearby cities once the initial armies sieged Silver Spires, making it almost impossible to reinforce the area.” </p><p>“Therefore forcing the headmistress to take personal action,” I suggested. </p><p>“E-exactly,” Titania said, agreeing with my conclusion before giving a more detailed report of their mission, including the distribution of the undead presence between different bases and the minor challenges they faced. </p><p>It didn’t take long for her determination to start fading, her words interrupted by her frequent moans. I had no doubt that, if we were alone, she would have folded already, but with Marianne watching with a smug smirk, occasionally supported by her teasing remarks, Titania persisted in her determination. </p><p>And I received my reward soon after. </p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 79%]</p><p>[Level Up!] </p><p>I didn’t even think before selecting my new skill, finally pushing Tantric to the next level. </p><p>[Grandmaster Tantric (100/110)] </p><p>On the one hand, it was not a good feeling to sacrifice my flexibility, the greatest reason for the chain of success I had been enjoying since that fateful day I had gained my first experience, showing that I wasn’t a waste — at least in a world that measured success with martial might. </p><p>Not that I could blame them, not with a world rife with danger. I had lost count of the times I would have met an unfortunate end if it wasn’t for my rapidly-growing strength, as well as the utility of my growing list of skills. </p><p>Yet, ironically, Tantric, despite its abject uselessness in combat, was the only option for me to select to increase my survival ability, for one simple reason. </p><p>It worked even when isolated from the System. I didn’t know why or how, I didn’t even know whether it could be actually relied on or was an illusion. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the first time I was made to make a choice despite lacking information…  </p><p>I put my hand on Titania’s breasts, invading her Soul Space to reinforce it more, which took more mana than it took me to actually destroy an army with my current skills, but earning a welcome notification in return. </p><p>[-2129 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Tantric]</p><p>“I think that’s enough reporting,” I said as I grabbed Marianne’s hand and pulled her over to Titania, creating a delicious sandwich for my pleasure for my own enjoyment. </p><p>“It’s time to start the proper celebration.” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 33 Experience: 528660 / 561000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6732 / 6732 Mana: 6728 / 8250 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [101/110]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
