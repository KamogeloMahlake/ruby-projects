    <body>
        <p>Hey, guys. </p><p>I'm having a bit of a conondrum, namely my old fanfics like Dark Discoveries and Tainted Desire. </p><p>They were started in a time where I was a beginner writer, and, as a consequence, their initial chapters are much worse than I would have otherwise enjoy. Not to mention a few themes that was not allowed on Patreon.  </p><p>I'm thinking of possibly rewriting them (With some major changes to fix themes and plot problems) but I wanted to check your opinion. </p>
