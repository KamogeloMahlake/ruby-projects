        <p>Reality not always agreed with our plans, something I realized in annoyance when I woke up at six-thirty, and failed to return to sleep despite my best efforts otherwise. After twenty minutes of fruitless struggle to fall back unconscious, I surrendered and stood up.</p><p>I looked at the small, uncomfortable shower I had downstairs reluctantly, until I realized that there was nothing that was preventing me to use the one at the upstairs. None of the occupants could really argue against it after the quality times we spent together. </p><p>I quickly undressed, and went out with only a towel around my waist. Until upstairs, I saw no one, but I realized that my plans were ruined when I arrived there. I could already hear the water running. Or was it ruined, I quickly corrected my thoughts when I noticed only Nicole’s door was open. </p><p>I carefully twisted the doorknob, careful not to make any noise as I peered through the crack to see it was indeed Nicole that was there, looking exquisite as the warm water flowed around her, stealing the foam around. I stepped inside and closed the door, doing my best not to make any noise until the door was closed. “Good morning, Nicole,” I said. </p><p>The surprised shriek that left her mouth was quite beautiful. “Stephen,” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?” </p><p>I shrugged like my presence here was something ordinary. “The shower downstairs was having some problems, so I decided to use this one,” I explained, dropping my towel mid-sentence, which revealed my hardening arousal. </p><p>“But-” she said, trying to draw rightful attention to the absurdity of the situation, but I cut her off. </p><p>“Come on, Nicole, it should be okay. A little shower together shouldn’t be a big deal after all the moments we spent together, right?” She stayed silent, but the delicious blush that spread through her whole body told me where her mind currently was. I didn’t miss the opportunity it afforded me, and stepped inside the shower. It was a snug fit, as it wasn’t exactly designed large enough for two people. </p><p>“I should go,” she murmured. “So that you can shower more comfortably.” </p><p>“Stop,” I said, wrapping my arm around her waist, though it turned out to be unnecessary. She stayed frozen as the warm water flowed over us, and I reached for the soap. “Let me help,” I said as I squeezed a dollop of liquid soap in my hand before bringing it over her back, tracing it over her spine. She trembled under my touch, but it wasn’t as interesting as the way she pushed her bottom towards me until my shaft was pressing between her cheeks. Interesting initiative, showing her body had already accepted the thing her mind did its best to reject. </p><p>My hands continued their journey over her wet skin, getting more adventurous with each passing second. One slipped lower on her back, the other shifting to her front, drawing a determined path towards her breasts. “The lock,” she murmured suddenly as my fingers brushed under her breasts. “The lock is broken, what if someone decides to enter.” </p><p>“Good point,” I answered before reaching towards the water valve, increasing the hot water, which started to fill the cabin with hot steam, enough to obscure the view. “Much better, right?” I asked. She gave no answer, but her silence might also be about the way I started to rub her bottom, or my fingers finally clasping around her breasts. I squeezed softly. “Should I remind you about the cost of avoiding answers,” I whispered into her ear. </p><p>“No need,” she moaned in panic. </p><p>“Then, answer the question,” I said, underlining my comment with my tightening grip around her breast. </p><p>“Yes, it’s much better,” she gasped, a loaded, erotic sound that begged for more. It was impressive, just how malleable she was, unable to put even the slightest resistance against my predations. I continued exploring her body, not bothering to act even the slightest like it was about helping her shower. </p><p>“So, my dear Nicole,” I whispered. “Do you have anything to do tonight?” </p><p>“No,” she answered, the way her voice trembled music to my ears. “Why?” </p><p>“We have some more costumes we need to go through,” I said. “In particular, there is a librarian costume that would fit you deliciously, complete with the garter belt.” </p><p>“Why are you doing this?” she whimpered, helpless. </p><p>I smirked at her flailing attempts of resistance. Weak, not because I represented a huge presence pushed her down, but because of the way she was wired, unable to sustain even the slightest resistance once she had accepted my authority over her. A true treasure, I thought as I brought my fingers at her entrance, exploring her entrance. “I’m doing nothing,” I said. “Or better put, I’m doing nothing you don’t want desperately. Or would you like to try to convince me that your wetness is solely due to the shower, that your own desires had no part play on this.” </p><p>Her reply was another helpless whimper, so I decided to help myself on the exquisite treasures she was offering. My fingers slid inside her repeatedly, each increasing her voice a bit more. But before I could slide inside her, I was interrupted by the door opening. “Occupied,” Nicole shouted in panic, despite lack of sight, owing to the steam that filled the room. </p><p>“Sorry, mom,” came the reply from Katie. “Madison’s cousin just dropped me off, and I need to finish my make-up. I’m almost late. And it’s not like I can see anything from the steam.” </p><p>Ideally, I should have stayed motionless, allowing Nicole to deflect the situation without distraction, but it wouldn’t have been as fun. I quickened the pacing of my fingers. “Isn’t it earlier than usual,” Nicole asked, but her voice rose halfway as my fingers pushed deeper inside her. </p><p>“There is an early assembly today for some kind of event, so the bus is going to pick us up earlier than usual.” </p><p>“Good!” Nicole answered, but her response turned into a loud moan when I decided to push the things into the new level, and slid my shaft inside her without warning, pushing deep inside her without waiting for her to get used to her presence. The result was a deep moan that filled the room. </p><p>“Are you okay, mum?” Katie asked, worried. </p><p>“It’s nothing,” Nicole managed to stammer. “I just hit my finger to a corner.” </p><p>“Ah, I see,” Katie answered. “Anyway, let me finish my makeup and I’ll go.” </p><p>The next few minutes passed relatively quickly, nothing but occasional whimpers let out by Nicole that drowned by the noise of the water. But Katie’s presence had put a bit of fight into her, she was trying to push me away. It was a weak, ineffectual display of power. But it was enough to annoy me, so I strengthened my grip on her thighs and changed my rhythm, impaling her with long, hard moves that slowed only at the last second, a small mercy for her to keep silent. </p><p>“It’s done, mom. See you at the dinner,” she said. A moment later, the sound of a door slamming shut echoed in the room. At that moment, she turned towards me, her face telling me that she had some pointed comments about what had just transpired. </p><p>But I had no intention of listening to them, which was why I wrapped my hand around her hair and pulled her back, until her back was pressing against the wall. I released her from my grip, but only because I was already in front of her, my arms on both sides of her, ready to prevent any attempt to escape. “You seem like you’re about to say something,” I ordered. “Go ahead.” </p><p>Her lips parted, but her earlier determination was already lost, unable to sustain itself through the sudden change in the situation. I didn’t allow any words to form nevertheless, pressing my lips against her ruby lips, my tongue invading her mouth to steal her ability to speak. Under a rush of assault, she was unable to make any noise other than occasional low-pitched moan. </p><p>I pushed my hips forward, and her warmth enveloped my shaft once more, filling me with desire. Only after that, I vacated her mouth, trailing kisses on her cheek on my way to her neck. At my destination, my teeth joined the fray once more, leaving a string of hickeys over her neck, each squeeze accompanied by another feminine cry, tempting me to push even harder. Soon, I was at the edge of my ability to hold back. When an orgasm hit her, making her tighten around my shaft, I was barely able to pull out, spraying on her stomach instead, which cleaned almost instantly under the torrent of warm water. </p><p>“It was a good shower,” I said, punctuating the sentence with one last peck on her lips before stepping out, leaving her alone in the shower, trembling under the effects of monumental arousal. “Don’t forget to visit me around twelve for the new costumes, and not to mention the client asked us to do one additional swimsuit,” I added as I quickly dried myself. I stepped out and went back to my room, luckily managing to avoid the girls. I hadn’t been looking forward to explaining why I was leaving the shower wet despite Nicole being there. </p><p>     <strong> *****       *****       *****       *****       ***** </strong></p><p>I was editing some of the photos I got from the earlier sessions when I heard a knock. “Come in,” I shouted, and Nicole walked in the room. “Hello, honey,” I said, my gaze back to the computer. “The costume is behind the screen, you can go and change there.”</p><p>“We need to talk,” she said, uttering the chain of words that was the name of the relationships everywhere. But her tone, flickering with indecision, barely above a whisper, told me that even after the three hours’ of determination behind it, it was still fragile.</p><p>“Go behind the screen and change,” I ordered. “We can talk whatever you want to talk during the shoot. We’re already late as it is.” She looked like she was about to argue, but another hard glance from me was enough to take the wind off her sails. Her gaze slid off my face and she walked towards the screen, defeated. She let out a whimper when she saw the swimsuit for the day, but it was a credit to her training that she didn't complain.</p><p>It was a good thing that I had seen her naked before, because otherwise, I didn't think I could have resisted the sight in front of me. She was wearing the last one from the swimsuit set, a set of string bikini that consisted of triangles barely larger than coins, held together by strings barely thicker than hair. Moreover, it was slightly transparent in its pure white color, just enough to hint me the treasures that lay behind. On her neck, I could see the hickeys I had left in the morning, peeking through the makeup. In total, it was even more revealing than the burnt orange one I had tricked her to try. </p><p>I gestured her to walk towards the set, and she did so, her ass, naked despite the valiant effort of one lone string, tumbling attractively with each step. I asked her to take a basic pose, launching the business part of the shot. Her awkwardness disappeared as she followed my commands without the slightest hesitation. Surprisingly, it took less than five minutes to take all required poses, her natural talent enhanced by the experience she gathered. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, calling the shot over. I could have undressed her on the set as I did previously, but that was getting a bit repetitive, so I decided to go with a different strategy this time. “Why don't you come and we can check the pictures together.” </p><p>I walked back to my computer without waiting for an answer, certain that she would follow. I leaned to plug the memory card, and she was standing next to me when I righted myself. “Take a seat,” I said.</p><p>“But there is no chair-” she started explaining before my arm wrapped around her waist and pulled her closer. </p><p>“It’s more comfortable than a chair, right,” I said, despite knowing it wasn't exactly true. Most chairs didn't have a certain thickness in the middle to press against her entrance. She tried to shuffle away, but my grip was tight around her waist, preventing her from sliding away, reducing her resistance to dry-rubbing. “Calm down, sweetie,” I said mockingly. “All in a due time. Why don't we go through some of your pictures first. I don't think you have seen any of them before.”</p><p>I clicked the folder that held the photos from the first day. “Let’s go back in the history first,” I said even as I pulled her a bit tighter, making sure my shaft was comfortably snug between her legs. I went through the first two dresses we had taken that day, as I amusedly watched Nicole’s eyes grew shocked, with a generous dash of arousal and hesitant anticipation mixed in. The reason was simple. In her mind, the first two dresses had been quite conservative, an impression that was getting smashed steadily as I revealed several photos I might deem as ‘interesting’. The soft caresses my hands left all over her body as we browsed the photos might have a bit of effect as well. </p><p>“How do you find the photos from your first shoot ever,” I asked her. </p><p>“Too revealing,” she managed to say, an answer that supposed to be admonishing, but lost its effectiveness by the following moan that left her mouth as I flicked one of her nipples. It wasn’t exactly convincing at the first place, at least not after just finishing the set for a string bikini that covered nothing other than the essentials, and especially not while she was sitting on my lap in the exact same ensemble. </p><p>“Really,” I said, dragging my fingers at the edge of her swimsuit. “Then, I wonder what you would say for your next set.” With a click, I moved on the last dress we had taken the first day, a tiny black dress, too tight for her underwear. A gasp escaped her mouth as I revealed the first picture without her underwear, realizing that just how revealing the dress looked. “Beautiful, right?” </p><p>She was about to answer, but I moved on the next photo before she could. Her answer froze on her lips, forgotten as her leaning pose, displaying a deep cleavage on my screen. “Daring and beautiful, right?” I asked, but didn’t receive an answer. Distracted, she didn’t even comment when I wrapped my arm around her waist once more, lifting her a bit, my other arm pushing my shorts and underwear down, so when I lowered herself once more, my shaft pointing between her legs, its top rubbing her entrance, insufficiently covered by her swimsuit. </p><p>“It’s too much,” she moaned in desperation when I shifted to the next pose, one she enabled in her desperate attempt to reduce the amount of cleavage she was putting, only to end up in a pose that revealed her bottom completely to the camera. </p><p>I decided to tease her a bit. “Don’t tell me you weren’t aware of it at that time,” I said, my hand sliding down her belly until it slid past the string that was supposed to protect her modesty, but doing a terrible job. </p><p>“Of course I wasn’t,” she stated correctly, but it would be utterly unconvincing to any passerby. After all, it was hard to claim so, when just a few days later, she was sitting on my lap, undressed for all practical purposes, passively accepting as my fingers fondled her womanhood. </p><p>I wondered whether it was possible to convince her otherwise as well. She had already proven that she was vulnerable to suggestions in her distracted state, maybe I could convince her that her memories were less reliable as well. “Really? You’re saying that you were completely unaware of how revealing you were, and it was not an attempt to seduce your poor, hopeless tenant.” </p><p>“It- it wasn’t,” she said, stammering as my fingers slid inside her. </p><p>“Yes, very convincing,” I said, pointing at her wetness on the screen. “It seems that you were really unaware, look how dry you were.” </p><p>“It’s not-” she tried to say, but I prevented her from finishing her sentence when I slid my fingers, which was previously testing her wetness, into her mouth. </p><p>“Yes, you weren’t, just as you aren’t now, right?” I said, enjoying the way she obediently sucked my fingers coated with her juices. </p><p>“I’m not…” she gasped in denial after I pulled my hand back, but I could see the doubt growing on her face as she started to suspect her own recollection under the mounting evidence, her vulnerable state playing a big part on the success of my ridiculous scheme. </p><p>“Of course you’re not,” I said amusedly as I pulled the string that was holding her bottom together, and it slid away uncommented. The move that followed it was a bit more noticeable. I grabbed her hips by both hands and lifted her, only to pull her down directly above my shaft, impaling her deep in one smooth movement, extracting a moan filled with pleasure. “You’re not the kind of woman that would drive a helpless boy like me with your innocent act until he has no option but to take you in the very floor you’re helplessly squirming, right?” </p><p>“I’m not,” she said, trying to lift herself off my shaft, but her trembling legs betrayed her at the last second, and her weight impaled her across my full length, followed by another moan. </p><p>“Yes, I can see that,” I said even as I grabbed her breasts, sinking my fingers into her flesh. “It’s evident by the struggle you’re putting to extract yourself from the situation.” </p><p>“No,” she said in denial, trying to lift herself with a renewed desire. I let her try freely as she rose, only to give a gentle push that resulted in her impaling herself deep with my shaft. The same scene repeated a few times, each repeat taking less strength to send her deep into my shaft. Soon, I didn’t have to do anything as she started to complete the pattern herself, not requiring any interaction from me. </p><p>The balance continued as I quickly passed through the swimsuit photos and arrived at the nightwear section. First ones, I quickly passed, only showing a few interesting ones, then I reached the transparent negligee that I managed to convince her to try without a bra. “Yes, Nicole, please tell me how that wasn’t an attempt to drive your poor tenant crazy.” </p><p>She tightened as I moved through the photos, each more revealing than the last. “Because… Because you asked me to…” she managed to utter, her voice barely above a whisper. </p><p>“Because I asked you to,” I repeated, then wrapped my hand around her hair and pulled back. I leaned forward toward her lips like I was about to kiss, but stopped at the last second. “You’re telling me that just a word from me is enough for you to ignore all common decency, and display yourself like without a hint of shame.” </p><p>For a moment, she tried to resist answering, but that determination crumbled instantly when I started to push my hips up with the same rhythm, pushing my shaft in previously untouched depths. “Yes,” she admitted in defeat. I leaned forward to capture her lips, rewarding her for her honesty. That proved too much for her, and the orgasm hit her with all the power of an out of control plane, leaving her tightening uncontrollably. </p><p>“Let’s test your determination then,” I said even as I lifted her in a bridal hold, and carried her to the middle of the set. Midway, I pulled the string of her top, leaving her as naked as the day she was born. I laid her in the middle of the set and picked up a camera before she could recover from the orgasm. “Now, part your legs and give me a good view.” </p><p>I expected her to follow my instruction, but the fact that she parted them open without hesitation was a surprise for me. And for her as well, if the fascinated expression on her face was any indicator, but it only made the scene more beautiful, the flash flaring to immortalize her expression, innocently erotic. “Cup your breasts,” I added, and she did so, bringing her elegant fingers over her pale breasts, still carrying the marks of my rough treatment. “Squeeze,” I ordered, and her fingers sank into her flesh, followed by another moan. It was beautiful, following my commands without the slightest hesitation despite the persistent light of shock in the depths of her eyes, like she wasn’t able to believe her own reactions. </p><p>“Now, start masturbating,” I ordered, and one of her hands deserted its mission on her chest to invade her tunnel. I took a step closer, my erection danging in front of her eyes. I hadn’t had to speak for her lips to part before closing over my crown, nor when she pushed forward until half of my shaft disappeared into her mouth. “Look at me,” I ordered, and her gaze shifted at mine, a surprisingly innocent moment that made me even hornier. </p><p>The significance of time disappeared even for me as I repeatedly squeezed the shutter, immortalizing every pass she made across my length, her fingers still following my orders, desperately invading her entrance repeatedly to reach another orgasm. It was getting harder and harder to resist her mind-blowing attempts. </p><p>I didn’t bother to warn her before started spraying her mouth, and an astonished expression filled her mouth. “Keep your eyes on me,” I ordered, watching her expression as she desperately tried to keep my seed in her mouth, but a generous trickle slid from the corner of her mouth, dripping on her breasts. “Good work,” I praised her efforts, and a smile appeared on her face despite her puffed cheeks. “Swallow,” I ordered, and watched her throat constrict in glee. </p><p>“Now, spread the rest on your chest,” I ordered as I took a step back, the camera clicking furiously. “Keep your right hand where it was,” I added when I noticed she was about to stop masturbating. She did so, using her free hand to spread my seed on her breasts while continuing to finger herself furiously. Soon, she climaxed once more, sprawled on the ground, panting and wheezing. </p><p>Normally, I would have called it a day, but even in her exhausted state, I could see that it wasn’t enough for her. I had managed to break a barrier in her mind, which freed her desires, maybe for the first time in her life. I put the camera on the side, with an angle that would cover us perfectly, and turned on the recording. It was a good opportunity to record some homemade porn, I thought as I took a position between her parted legs. </p><p>The way her legs wrapped around my waist, pulling me deep inside her, told me that we were in agreement, so I lost myself in her… </p>
