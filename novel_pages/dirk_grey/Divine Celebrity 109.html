        <p>I let my gaze dance on Lauren’s beautiful expression for a moment, her arousal mixing with fear — the delicious kind that was only there to enhance her arousal rather than to make her stop. </p><p>“You’re getting rather familiar with defeat, I must say,” I whispered as I paused, leaning over her, my body positioned perfectly to trap her down. </p><p>“I … I was distracted,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, really, I can’t imagine why? I limited myself only to the rules you have set, and nothing more. I hope you’re not implying that I have cheated, I might take that personally…” </p><p>“Of course not. I can’t ever imagine you cheating,” she answered, earning another point of respect from me by managing to actually inject a serious dose of sarcasm into her tone. </p><p>Under different circumstances, I might have told her that sarcasm was an ugly color for her, but that would be too much of a lie even for me. With her blazer completely open to display her amazing breasts, her skirt ridden high enough to leave the task of hiding her legs to her fishnets — which were failing beautifully in that aspect — sarcasm only made her sexier.</p><p>Yet, none of them added to her beauty than the shyness that she had underneath, showing a long battle with her habits even after our amazing show. Her struggle with it was simply beautiful.  </p><p>So was the contrast of her ripped panties, lazily camping to the side, enhancing the contrast even further.  </p><p>“Of course not. I’m a nice guy, I would never cheat,” I whispered. “And, since I’m such a nice guy, I’m even willing to let you pick how to pay for your defeat,” I said. </p><p>“R-really,” she whispered, her disappointment impossible to miss even as her legs parted open, riding her skirt even further, fully displaying the effect of her missing panties. “You would…” </p><p>“Of course, I could never push you more than you’re comfortable just for a punishment,” I said. Which was certainly true, but that was not the whole story. At this point, her willingness to go all the way was certainly not in doubt, but the difference between surrendering my actions and actually taking the initiative differed greatly. </p><p>There was absolutely no doubt where in that spectrum she rested…</p><p>Hence my decision. </p><p>“But …” she started, but that was all she was able to say before I pressed my finger against her lips to silence her gently, leaving her voice to fade. </p><p>“No buts, sweetie. Your punishment, my call, and I think that’s the best punishment,” I said, letting her smirk widen even more, and a shocked gasp escaped her mouth, along with some understanding. “A good punishment, right,” I said. “You can get as much as you want, you just need to act decisively.” </p><p>I pulled back, leaving her gasp in shock as her breathing quickened, the weight of the moment enough to trigger her intense panic once more, the same panic that held her being a globally-renown chess player despite her amazing abilities. </p><p>I said nothing else, and just sat next to her as she grabbed her blazer and pulled it close. For a moment, I feared that it was too much, a fear that died when I caught the excitement that was coloring her shocked expression, giving me the hope that her distraction was only momentary. </p><p>Still, it took almost a minute for her to let go of the desperate hold of her blazer, revealing her breasts once more. Then, she sent a hesitant glare to my face, ready to retreat the moment she found something that scared her. There were many things that might have scared her in my emotions, but they managed to stay concealed safely. </p><p>“Let’s start,” she whispered, managing to deliver it without stammering, though her lack of confidence was still apparent in her tone. I kept myself from making a comment as she shuffled and stood up, making sure her skirt stayed in place. </p><p>Which was rather pointless considering her next seat was my lap, but wisely, I kept my mouth shut and limited myself to watch as she placed herself, shuffling as she searched for a comfortable seat. </p><p>“A good start—“ I started, only for her to lean forward immediately, capturing my lips. More to silence me from teasing her rather than desire.</p><p>At least, at first, but as our tongues danced, her arousal started to burn faster, her panic quick to melt against desire. Not disappearing completely, but taking the back seat as she got comfortable on her new seat, moving back and forth repeatedly. </p><p>I said nothing when she pulled for a breather, the amazing soft lighting of the room working wonders to enhance her beauty, her blush more beautiful than any makeup could achieve. I didn’t say anything, but that didn’t mean I stayed completely passive. I dragged my finger on her lip, and she responded with a beautiful shiver. </p><p>She paused, still under my touch, her irises widened in excitement. She leaned forward once more, this time more hesitant, afraid of losing herself, but she dealt with that by closing her eyes rather than changing her course. I hummed as my lips pressed against her, enjoying their delicate softness. </p><p>This time, her hips started to move, abandoning the earlier excuse of trying to settle in place, instead rocking back and forth steadily as she massaged my shaft, with my jeans as the only barrier between us. Responding to her show of initiative, I slid my hands under her skirt, my fingers landing on her naked ass. Even then, I didn’t lead her movement, just enjoying the tightening of her muscles instead. </p><p>That didn’t slow her down other than a momentary pause, her lips continuing to devour mine. Even when she pulled back, her lips landed on my neck, biting softly, playfully, her arousal getting more and more intense as she continued. </p><p>This time, the kiss lasted even more, and when she pulled back, she was panting desperately. She said nothing, but that was not needed, not with her looks conveying everything perfectly.  </p><p>I tightened my grip on her naked ass, but did nothing else, once again waiting for her to do something. This time, she chose to remove my shirt, and I raised my arms, allowing her to do so successfully. She put her hand on my chest, caressing dazedly, feeling my muscles. “Amazing,” she whispered as she felt them, showing that, even with all the intellectual nature of her attraction, my muscles were still more than just an afterthought. </p><p>Pity teasing her about that would have triggered a collapse of her confidence, which was already tethering on the edge. Luckily, my fingers had their own fascinating target to fondle ceaselessly. Soon, she moved her hands up, landing on my shoulders. Then, she leaned forward, her naked tits pressing against my chest. </p><p>This time, I decided to take a bit of the initiative, and leaned down. First, I created a trail of kisses, starting from her jawline, and moving to her neck, copying her earlier trick. She responded by moving her hips move even more desperately, determined to create an accident in my pants, her moans sufficiently loud. </p><p>“Maybe I should remove it,” I whispered. “Before an accident ruins them, of course,,” I whispered. </p><p>“Good idea,” she answered, her hands as fast as lightning as they found their path to my belt. A little struggle, and a surprisingly strong pull later, I was just in my boxers. She looked at them, her expression dancing as she doubtlessly tried to decide whether to take that step. </p><p>For a moment, I thought that she was going to do that, but it was only a fleeting moment before it disappeared just as quickly and she took her seat once again. I had no doubt that she wouldn’t have argued if I pulled them down, but I was the one that challenged her like this in the first place. </p><p>I decided to suffer the consequences, no matter how deliciously infuriating they ended up being. </p><p>Her hips danced, slowly at first, but that didn’t last for long as I focused on her neck, enjoying the shivering dance it created. The neck was always an underrated target, just as sensitive as breasts, but never as alarming, making it a perfect little target to amp up the situation. </p><p>A lesson that Lauren was receiving for the first time, if her widened eyes were honest as her hips rebelled against her command, moving faster and faster on my lap, desperate enough to make it clear that she would be the first one to fall in our little game. </p><p>She exploded, trembling badly as she collapsed against my chest. I tightened my hold over her hips, assisting her to rock back and forth. I wasn’t supposed to cheat, but I wasn’t too far away from an explosion — and since Lauren had clearly reached her limit, I decided to handle the rest. </p><p>Only when I was about to explode, I flipped her and pulled out, covering her breasts with my seed, the white contrasting beautifully with her black bra, her moans beautiful as she felt herself lose herself in pleasure. </p><p>“Do you want me to finish you off again,” I offered with a chuckle as I saw her confused expression. She nodded, and I leaned, my fingers landing on her clit. Charged with both the physical and mental aspects of our little game, it took seconds for her to bring her to another climax under the full deployment of my skills. </p><p>Though, even I didn’t expect her to collapse unconscious as the second climax hit, almost right after the first one…</p><p>“A successful celebration,,” I said with a chuckle as I fixed my clothing, left a note for her, and left… </p><p>The little break was fun, and well worth the time, but I had more to do… </p>
