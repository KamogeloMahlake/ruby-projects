        <p>As we climbed the stairs, I half-expected her to change her mind at the last moment. After all, it was a bit different than pawing each other in the confines of a car parked in the middle of nowhere, dragged by the heat of the moment. It was even different than what was happening in the back garden earlier, where I was leveraging her intense arousal to tease her a bit, partly for enjoyment, partly to teach her just how the inability to say no could push the situation more than she could handle. </p><p>I was still her tutor, after all, and I took my job seriously. </p><p>Just to underline that, I turned to her just before we stepped into the shower. Her blue eyes widened as she was suddenly caught under my serious gaze, but she didn’t take a step back, maintaining our closeness, which was always nice. “You know that you can say no whenever you want, right?” I reminded her. “You don’t have to follow it just because I want to.” </p><p>She looked at my face seriously after my words —though I noticed her eyes occasionally dipping to my naked chest, still glistening with sweat— processing my statement. “Thanks,” she finally murmured. “But I want to do this.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said even as I took a hold of her hand and dragged her to the bathroom. “Last warning, don’t forget that you can ask me to slow down or stop anytime,” I reminded her. </p><p>“I know-” she started, only for me to silence her with a kiss the moment we passed through the doorway. My arm wrapped around her naked waist, her tits covered with her sports bra smashing against my naked chest. Unlike the previous kiss we shared in the car, my tongue assaulted her mouth from the beginning, ravaging her tongue as she tried to conduct defensive warfare. From her moans, she seemed to enjoy that. </p><p>Distracted by the kiss, she barely noticed my fingers slipping down, pushing her loose sweatpants down. She took notice as she stepped out of them, nor did she pay attention as I shed my own underwear, leaving myself naked. She even kicked her socks and shoes absentmindedly, revealing her dainty feet. </p><p>When I pulled back from the kiss, we were already in the shower —which, thankfully, was large enough to comfortably host two of us— and the hot water started to flow, her underwear completely drenched, turning semi-transparent. Though, after observing their beautiful glory the last night, I had no intention of letting them stay hidden, even behind such an insufficient cover, so I pulled them off quickly enough to classify them as ripping them off. </p><p>The last night, I had seen her breasts in the car, in a heated environment, where environment light was significantly lacking. Hence, I had some doubts about my recollection. Maybe her breasts weren’t as spectacularly flawless as I remembered, their flaws hidden by the dimness of the interior lights. Or maybe, due to my own horniness and lack of climax, I built them up in my mind exaggeratedly. </p><p>It turned out to be the exact opposite, I realized, as I examined her perfection under a light bright enough to catch every little detail, impressed by a lack of flaws. Perfect skin, perfect curves, and impervious to gravity. The glistening drops of water flowing constantly shone whenever she trembled, making the scene even more delicious. </p><p> Carrie tried to cover her breasts for a moment, but her arms soon dropped back under my amused grin. “Turn your back,” I ordered, and then gently pushed her against the cold walls of the shower, earning a gasp. “Let me help you,” I suggested even as I took a generous amount of shampoo, and started massaging her hair. It might have been a sensual, almost romantic moment, but my shaft pressing against her ass, separated only by the barely-existent coverage of her soaking-wet panties, made the moment much more erotic, her breathing quickening with each passing second. </p><p>Seeing the effect my touch was having on her, I decided to have mercy, and rather than slowly teasing her, I let the shampoo rinse off her beautiful blonde hair before switching to shower gel, and let my hands caress her neck and shoulders, a mixture of gentle caresses and proper massage. If her whimper was any indicator, it was working excellently. </p><p>Honestly, my throbbing shaft was begging me to cut my amusing play short by ripping off her panties and plunging deep, to teach her the real meaning of pleasure. However, her delicious whimpers as I moved to her back, my fingertips occasionally caressing her breasts, managed to convince me otherwise. Carrie was a delicious dinner, and it would be a waste to eat the dessert before the starter and the main course… </p><p>“Ah,” she gasped as I moved onto her lower back, but didn’t waste much time there before moving to her delicious thighs, bypassing her ass no matter how inviting it looked. I had a feeling that, if I pulled down her panties, my resolution to take things slow wouldn’t have survived. Bypassing the area, I was able to finish massaging her thighs and calves without an issue, though her occasional moans hadn’t made resisting any easier. </p><p>After finishing, I stood up, pressing my body against hers, while whispering, “It’s time to handle the other side.” </p><p>“I can’t,” she whispered back. “Not with your body pressing against mine.” </p><p>“My bad,” I said, my chuckle echoing off the ceramic walls of the shower as I pulled back slightly, giving her just enough space to turn, our eyes meeting again, though she failed to maintain the connection as her eyes dipped down, her eyes widening as she saw my shaft at full erection once more, no doubt experiencing a similar shock of what I had experienced while examining her breasts, trying to reconcile her memories and the reality. </p><p>This time, I didn’t waste time slowly teasing her shoulders or arms. Instead, I brought my soapy hands on her breasts, caressing gently as I covered them with bubbles. Surprisingly, rather than staying passive, her hands joined the fray, and after squirting some shower gel to her hand with an adorable slowness, she started soaping my chest as well, though, just like me, she was more interested in learning the intricacies of my body. </p><p>As our mutual assistance in cleaning extended, I didn’t know who leaned in first, but soon, we were sharing a long kiss, one that might have been classified as gentle and tender if it wasn’t for our hands, rubbing each other’s bare skin. And as arousal built up, the kiss soon lost its tender nature, turning into a furious dance… </p><p>I was considering whether to push forward or take it slow, when Carrie surprised me by grabbing my wrist. At first, I was afraid of her stopping me from playing with her gloriously perfect tits, but then, she pushed my arm down while making sure my fingers didn’t lose connection with her skin. After passing her trembling belly, we arrived at the edge of her panties…</p><p>Or more accurately, where the edge of her panties would have been if she hadn’t already somehow managed to kick them off without alerting me during our intimate shower. Instead, my fingers delved deeper toward her soft core, enjoying her smoothness. “Someone came prepared,” I whispered when I pulled away from the kiss, which somehow managed to make her blush despite the situation. </p><p>And it made her only sexier. </p><p>Her way of dealing with the embarrassment was even more surprising. She grabbed my shoulders and pulled me to her so that our bodies pressed together, barely giving me enough space to wiggle my fingers. Luckily, with her orgasm already knocking on the door, asking for an invitation thanks to our extended foreplay, I didn’t need more than a short yet intense wiggling of my fingers, circling her knob repeatedly before delivering the ultimate flick. </p><p>She started shivering as she climaxed, locked between my muscular body and the cold wall. Which, admittedly, wasn’t my smartest idea, because pushing against the naked body of a voluptuous blonde while she climaxed after an intense massage was rather tempting, my cock throbbing with anticipation. If she had been one of the loose cheerleaders I made a habit of hanging at my last school, I would have been already balls-deep, furiously pumping as I sought release. But Carrie was too vulnerable to handle such a direct shift, so I needed to hold myself back. </p><p>No matter how tempting the idea was.  </p><p>“Can you stand on your own?” I asked as her trembling finally ceased. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, her eyes firmly shut, and I let her go. When she fell on her knees immediately, I was afraid that she had underestimated herself, only for her blue eyes to suddenly open, and lock into mine, burning with a purpose that cut through the haze of pleasure. And when her hand wrapped around the base of my cock and her lips parted, she left no doubt about what she was planning next. </p><p>I was more than happy to allow her. I wasn’t going to push her, but it was very different if she was willingly offering. I stood still when her lips touched the crown of my shaft, no matter how tempted I was to push my hips forward and invade her mouth mercilessly. Instead, I let her close her eyes and focus on the task at hand. </p><p>Then, as her head moved rhythmically, she proved that she was yet to run out of surprises. This time, it was the great pacing she was showing as she devoured half of my shaft immediately before pulling back, teasing my already-throbbing cock with an alternating rhythm, showing me a great ability. </p><p>If I hadn’t seen her lack of experience the previous night, I would have never believed it was the first time she was doing that. But with her personality, there was another possibility, one that was both amusing and entertaining at the same time, and the occasional hesitant glance she sent toward my way, checking the effect of her beautiful lips, confirmed my assumption. </p><p>“So,” I murmured lazily. “How many hours you have researched and studied for this the last night?” I asked, unable to keep myself teasing her. </p><p>Once again, her blush was almost as spectacular as the beauty of her naked body, the rest of her skin almost rivaling the rosy tone of her areolas. She pulled back for a moment, and whispered. “Four and a half hours,” she murmured shyly as she looked down, like she was about to escape. </p><p>“You’re really an amazing student to tutor,” I said with a chuckle, grabbing her head to pull her head closer just a bit, signaling that she should continue. “You’re amazing, continue as you wish.” I had no intention to skip such a delicious first-time blowjob from my sexy nerd for a simple teasing. Luckily, Carrie seemed to be even more enthusiastic for the task, and her lips wrapped around my shaft once more. This time, her grip was even tighter, my earlier words clearly giving her the courage to push her limits more. </p><p>Her tongue joined the fray, flicking back and forth over my length, sometimes teasing the base, sometimes tickling the tip, alternating the sensations. The sense of pleasure jumped even higher as she moaned in pleasure, the rumblings giving a nice massage that pushed me even closer to the edge, the tingling starting from the crown and reaching to the base of my cock, testing the limits of my conviction of not pushing my hips forward, allowing her to set up the pace. </p><p>Then, she either managed to read my dilemma, or the gods had nothing better to do and decided to answer my prayers, because, in a surprising move, she tightly grabbed my thighs, using the leverage to suddenly sank herself deeper. She started gagging as she forced my cock deeper into her throat, making me experience arguably the greatest sensation of my life, just as I was already pushing the edge. With each passing second, the waves of orgasmic heat started to get stronger, threatening explosion. </p><p>“I’m about to cum,” I warned her barely a minute after she launched her last secret ability. She pulled out immediately, but proved that she was not out of surprises, because she aimed my cock at her breasts, my fascination with their perfection hardly a surprise at this point. </p><p>I sprayed her chest with my seed like a relentless hose, covering her tits with enough of my seed to make me glad we were already in the shower. With her blue eyes shining and her wet blonde hair stuck over her body, it might not be the most hardcore scene I had ever experienced, but without a doubt, it was the most erotic scene I had ever experienced… </p><p>I couldn’t wait until her next surprise… </p><p><br></p>
