        <p>That was the thing about me and the interesting, but potentially deadly ideas. I was like a gambling addict, unable to resist the call of the siren. </p><p>Hiding inside the same room with the Queen after defiling her completely wasn’t the most dangerous idea, though considering the full implications, not exactly the tamest idea either. However, the potential for entertainment was just too much to ignore, not to mention the possible benefits of observing her more directly.  </p><p>After finding a good hiding spot near the corner, under the shadow of a bulky wardrobe, I examined the curvy naked figure busy scooping my seed out of her entrance magically, struggling to believe it was the same strict Queen that was making people scared with her velvet-covered iron fist. </p><p>“Bastard, I’ll show you,” she murmured as she pooled the seed in her palm. She surprised me when rather than disposing of it, she started to cast a spell on it. A chill passed over my body as I felt a magical connection being established, ready to lash the moment she noticed my presence. </p><p>Luckily, it turned out that whatever spell she was using didn’t connect us in terms of location, because she gave no sign of noticing my presence. She stayed focused on the spell, giving me the opportunity to focus on the tendrils of magic that was invading my body. </p><p>As the binding of the spell got stronger, it got easier for me to recognize the spell, and once I did, a huge smile appeared on my face. The spell was trying to infect my psyche to build up more positive emotions toward her. </p><p>Even as I cut the magical connections of the spell and tied them to each other, making it ineffective without dispelling it, my respect toward her increased. There were several spells she could cast with my remains using her Tantric abilities, and several more if she was willing to spread into darker areas. And it was neither the safest spell, nor it was the strongest one. Even a simple tracker would have brought more immediate benefits, allowing her to send knights to arrest or kill me.  </p><p>However, unique among everything she could use, the one she used was the subtlest, and the most useful in the long term. The effect she used could be reinforced with each repeat, increasing my emotions toward her, creating an obsession. And such obsession would inevitably result in mistakes. </p><p>Or more accurately, would have resulted in mistakes if I hadn’t recognized and disabled it immediately. She had a great plan, but the same couldn’t be said about her luck, trying to take down a master with the dark arts. </p><p>I was already planning how best to use her misconception about the change in my emotions to my biggest benefit, even as I watched as she stood up, stumbling toward the bath on the corner of the room. However, rather than slipping into the warm embrace of the full tub, she cast a spell, turning it into a subtle rain that caressed her skin. </p><p>“I’ll teach you the cost of underestimating me, you worm,” she murmured absentmindedly, and I barely held myself from chuckling, wondering what she would think if she was aware of my continuing presence, and the great show she was proving me. For a while, I watched her as she murmured to herself in the variation of her initial words, all promising me a number of deadly threats. At first, I didn’t react much, after taking her completely, watching her calmly shower wasn’t exactly the peak of the pleasure.</p><p>Then, things started to change. </p><p>“I’m going to kill you,” she murmured again as she grabbed the soap bar and rubbed it against her skin a few times before continuing with her hands. She immediately focused on her breasts, which was a bit surprising, but not as surprising when her motions got weirdly repetitive. “I’ll kill you,” she murmured again, her eyes closed.</p><p>I was surprised, because she wasn’t washing her tits. She was playing with them. As she lathered her body with bubbles slowly, a soft, gentle moan escaped her mouth. “I’ll kill you,” she repeated as she twisted her nipples once again. Soon, one of her hands was wandering over her body freely, sliding across the soft skin I had marred earlier, but one of them stayed on her tits, caressing and squeezing in equal measures. </p><p>Well, I thought, surprised, enjoying the view. I had noticed that she was enjoying the treatment as I fucked her for the first time in years, but I didn’t expect it to affect her so much that she had to masturbate afterward to release the tension. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. </p><p>However, her angry words suggested that she wasn’t exactly a natural submissive like her daughter. On the contrary, she was masturbating because her earlier enjoyment clearly run contrary to her own habits, creating a tension she was trying to resolve. </p><p>Still, regardless of the reason, her hand dancing over her naked skin created a spectacular show. One of her hands continued to squeeze her breasts, while the other one finally found its destination, nestling between her thick thighs. A moan escaped her mouth as her fingers found the soft target area. She traced the outline of her outer lips first, her toes curling as she dragged her fingers. Then, they found her clit, circling and flicking in equal measures. </p><p>However, the real show started when her fingers finally found her entrance, slipping inside, she let out a long, throaty gasp. “Wish I hadn’t tried to drug that asshole,” she murmured absentmindedly as her fingers disappeared inside her repeatedly. “At least I wouldn’t be left out, trying to finish it myself…” </p><p>Who would have guessed that her last heartfelt begging wasn’t completely artificial, I thought, surprised. Still, it was a good note for the first time. That time, I should fuck her until she forgot her own name, just to make sure she wasn’t gossiping badly about me.  </p><p>Meanwhile, she focused on her own body while the light shower of rain still continued, stealing the heat of her body, her fingers invading more and more aggressively. Her moans rose even louder to accompany it, tempting me for a sudden encore. Pity that stepping out of the shadows would reveal far too many cards I would prefer to keep hidden.  </p><p>Finally, her voice hit the crescendo, followed by a loud screaming, paradoxically tinged with frustration and release at the same time. She leaned against the wall, trembling helplessly as she water washed out the last remaining hints of our earlier activity other than the marks on her skin, which were a more permanent reminder. I wondered whether she could cure them, or require a healer for it. </p><p>Somehow, I doubted she would go and reveal the source of those marks to the Princess for healing.</p><p>Unlike her earlier emotional outburst, she stayed silent after she finished her shower and slowly dressed, covering her beautiful skin with the same ugly dark gray cloak she had been wearing when she first arrived, along with the mask on her face. However, she didn’t bother to reapply the spell that turned her into a brunette, relying on the hood of the cloak for the concealment. </p><p>I slipped right after her when she finally left the room, accompanying her in her walk in the secret passage, an easy task thanks to her attention hampered further due to her most recent experiences. </p><p>Another challenge lay in front of me as we stood in front of her private quarters while she unlocked it magically. I either called it a day and left, or followed her in, hoping to discover some of her secrets. </p><p>After some consideration, I decided to follow her. No risk, no reward… </p><p>I was barely able to keep myself from gasping in shock as I entered her private quarters, because I had many different expectations about her private quarters, but what I had found surprised me greatly. </p><p>I hadn’t been expecting the Queen to have a library here, and I certainly wasn’t expecting her to have a copy of my own private library! </p><p>Well, while that might be an exaggeration, as architecturally it was quite different, but it was very similar in the most important aspect, namely, the books it contained. I had seen her use magic that was classified as dark, but the range of books she had surprised me greatly. Quite a few of those titles were also in my library, but I only acquired them after years of efforts, robbing, trading, and raiding the libraries of the most established magical families. The fact that the Queen also had them had very dangerous implications. </p><p>Maybe I should just turn and leave the place. If the Queen was able to get those books from those families, their relationship should be much stronger than I had expected, which ruined every plan I had put in action. </p><p>I was trembling in shock as the queen moved into a connected room, considering running away, but still, I stayed back. It was not my habit to escape at the first sight of adversity. Moreover, something was tickling my mind as I examined the books in her library. Something other than the titles was familiar about those books. </p><p>I identified why when I pulled one of the books from the shelves, and noticed some of the notes, scribbled in familiar handwriting! </p><p>“Makes more sense,” I murmured. Apparently, my library had survived the self-destruction I triggered, probably because it had been robbed at the same time the attack started. My respect for the Queen went up, as the only chance for her to get those books was the short window where the coalition started assaulting me, and my capture. </p><p>She had risked the eventual success of the operation to maximize her own benefits. It was the approach I would have taken. </p><p>Pity that her trump card was in my hands. One of the books was open, laying innocently on a desk. A brief assessment showed that it was a book on the advanced applications of the Tantric spells, the exact tool she was using to attack me. </p><p>I immediately picked the quill and started adding a number of footnotes and other stuff. Since the book was mostly annotated by me, I was willing to bet that she wouldn’t realize that those additions were really late. After all, who would expect their most private spot to be invaded, only to add a few extra notes to a book? </p><p>However, those notes were special, because, at the first glance, they looked like amazing ideas. Actually, they were. I had designed them myself based on my self-study. Pity that each had subtle but very dangerous flaws that would have allowed the counter-attack of a proficient opponent. </p><p>I couldn’t wait until Sapphire tries to use those spells on me again… </p><p>I stayed in the library for until almost the first lights of the morning, adding note after note across a number of books that I expected the Queen to leverage, both against myself, and for the eventual control of the treasures I would help her to ‘steal’ from my stashes. </p><p>Only after finishing that task, I dared to check the bedroom of the Queen, only to find a room much more in line with my earlier expectations, decorated heavily in white, blue, and a smattering of gold, rich enough to fund the capital for a year. </p><p>And in the middle of it was the Queen, laying in on a huge white bed, wearing a little nightie that failed to cover her amazing tits, tempting me for another touch. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was too risky, even for my loose sensibilities on the subject. </p><p>Maybe the next time… </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
