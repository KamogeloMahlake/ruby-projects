        <p>Waking up shouldn’t be a surprise, but considering my last memory was the rage of the elements surrounding me while lightning rained on me with rage, trying to flail my skin, all the while my insides burned with an unnatural heat, I was rather surprised. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was that I was in a bed, with two familiar presences with me, one on the left, one on the right, making me feel rather cozy. </p><p>The second thing I noticed was the sound of the storm that was raging outside, a torrent of rain beating against the ceiling. It wasn’t an ordinary rain but a dangerous storm, accompanied by dangerous winds that made me glad that I wasn’t outside. However, that came with its own complication, namely the fact that I was inside a building. Not exactly comforting despite the protection it granted, considering the number of dangerous people that were after us. </p><p>I forced my eyes open despite my exhaustion, curious about my location. Astrid was lying on my right, while Lillian was on my left, both girls in their underwear as they hugged me, deep in sleep. I wasn’t exactly expecting that level of familiarity from them, not that I was unhappy about it. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the room, trying to understand where I was, but markedly more relaxed, as the presence of the girls next to me indicated that I wasn’t in a situation that was immediately dangerous. It was a modest-sized room, with equally modest but functional furnishing. A bed that was far too small for three people —not that I was complaining—, a small table with a couple of chairs that looked more uncomfortable than the floor itself. Impressively, it also had a door that opened into a small bathroom, which made the room quite luxurious. </p><p>I could have awakened Astrid and ask her questions about the place, but I had something much more important to focus on, something I delayed only to make sure I wasn’t under an immediate threat. I closed my eyes, but rather than trying to sleep, I focused on the flow of my magic… </p><p>Only to find a completely unfamiliar landscape. The magic that was flowing in my body was completely foreign, reminding me of the lightning that rained over me rather than the calm flow of pure mana, but from the way it reacted to my control immediately, there was no doubt that it was mine. The fact that my magic was once again under control was amazing news, enough to take the sting of the fact that it once again transformed completely. The Dragon Heart was gone, shattered and absorbed into my body, and transforming me completely in the process. </p><p>Still, everything paled against the fact that once again I had total control over my own magic. Even its surprising lightning-like transformation didn’t make me doubt it. Why would I doubt it, when it once again flowed in my veins comfortably, ready to jolt out at the slightest flexing of my will? </p><p>I still wanted to experiment, not because I wanted to make sure I had the control, but I wanted to test the limits of my new reserves and the potency of my casting. And getting some experience wouldn’t hurt. I was a sorcerer, on that there was no doubt, but I knew for a fact I had at least one other sorcerer’s eternal enmity, and with the possibility of even more. That captain had surprisingly wide clout for a pirate captain. Who could guarantee that he didn’t have another sorcerer ally? </p><p>I lay on the bed for a couple of minutes, letting my magic circulate in my body, exhaustion flowing away, replaced by a crackling sense of energy, my muscles feeling stronger than ever; another thing to test, probably right after the magic experiments. I had never heard a sorcerer ascension improving the caster’s physique, though considering everything I knew never amounted anything more than scraps, it might be my lack of knowledge as well… </p><p>I was tempted to talk to Lillian about my transformation, but I knew that Lillian already wanted me to return to Londinium with her, revealing that I had strength enough to stand on the apex of the whole Island wouldn’t exactly help. </p><p>To be fair, if it wasn’t for the mysterious enemy, I might have actually considered it. With my recent boost, my uncle was not a threat anymore. But having a fixed place while being hunted by unknown enemies, after stealing a Dragon Heart from them, was hardly conducive for survival. </p><p>I tried to extract myself from the bed, which was rather difficult, considering I was wrapped tight by two pairs of arms, not allowing my movement. Trying to wiggle out failed rather spectacularly when they tightened their arms further, and a repeat of it made Astrid open her eyes. </p><p>“You’re awake,” she gasped in excitement as her arms wrapped tighter around my chest while her lips smashed against mine. </p><p>I knew for a fact that in the grand scheme of things, magical experimentation with my new powers while an unknown amount of enemies were following us was much more important than enjoying the kiss from a sexy redhead wearing only underwear, rubbing her sexy body against mine, but that particular fact felt oddly theoretical when I felt her hardened nipples pressing against my naked chest while her tongue invaded my mouth recklessly… </p><p>I let my hands explore her curved body, my raging arousal blanketing my mind, about to rip her underwear off, when Astrid let out a pained yelp and pulled back. Surprisingly, it was Lillian that was responsible, Astrid’s hair wrapped around her hand. My mouth stayed open, as I was surprised by Lillian’s uncharacteristic action. Not the meanness of it, but the fact that she actually took physical action. </p><p>I was even more surprised when she smashed her lips against mine in a desperate kiss, hugging me desperately. Far too desperate to be something sexual. Even more interestingly, Astrid, rather than retaliating, chose to hug us both, while tears spilled from Lillian’s face. “Idiot,” Lillian murmured as she pulled away from the kiss. “How can you be stupid enough to trigger an ascension ritual in the middle of nowhere with no preparation. I thought you were going to die for sure!” </p><p>It was good that she started another kiss immediately after her words, because I didn’t know how to react. I understood what she was referring to by ascension ritual, since I wasn’t an idiot, but her words implied that it was a common thing, just the way I progressed was unexpected. It made me revise my initial idea about not talking to her about it. My lack of information was much more dangerous than I had presumed. </p><p>As the kiss stretched, I noticed something even more interesting. I could feel some of my magic slipping out of my lips to mix with Lillian’s only to return moments later, calmer and more controlled. I let the kiss stretch even as I expanded my magical senses, only to feel slivers of my magic swimming in both Lillian and Astrid. </p><p>Curious, but not alarming, as I could feel that whatever it was, it couldn’t be used for binding. I was sure, because I studied a lot about binding magic after I learned about the death of my grandfather, afraid of my uncle decided to use it as a shortcut to eliminate me despite the taboo of using them on close kin. </p><p>We needed to talk about what happened since the elements around me decided to go crazy, but then I felt the covers being pulled away, and a pair of lips around my erect shaft, once again convincing me to delay the questioning in favor of more immediate needs. </p><p>Astrid’s ambitious move managed to get Lillian’s attention. She pulled away from the kiss and watched Astrid for several seconds. I couldn’t see her expression from that angle, but her body was stiff, making me curious —and more than a little apprehensive— about how she would react next. </p><p>I didn’t expect her to face me once again with her face burning with arousal while she ripped off her bra desperately. She leaned in for another kiss, but this time, it was a desperate one that conveyed vulnerability. No, it was one that burned with a carnal need, even thicker than the bath we shared in the cave. </p><p>The sudden development surprised me, but not to a point that I couldn’t react. My hands joined the fray immediately, tracing along her spine before it reached the small of her back, caressing softly. She moaned softly without even interrupting the kiss, and I used the opportunity to slide my tongue inside her mouth, invading mercilessly. </p><p>Her moans intensified further as my fingers found her perky breasts, enjoying their firmness mercilessly, enough to hurt her a bit, but from the way her tongue moved, it seemed that she was enjoying it. Normally, I would have stretched the foreplay until she lost herself into arousal, but it was hard to maintain control while Astrid’s lips were around my shaft, moving up and down aggressively enough that whenever she lowered herself, I felt her throat closing around the crown of my shaft. </p><p>I pulled away from the kiss even as I pushed Lillian back, but my lips were already around her nipples before she could react, forcing her to moan in arousal rather than trying to respond to the sudden change of mood, but her reaction was nothing compared to when my fingers found her knob, a gentle circling enough to make her shiver in anticipation. “Touch me harder,” she moaned. </p><p>“I’ll do something even better, but you need to help Astrid push deeper,” I said even as I grabbed her hips and lifted her, easily pulling her on my face and flipping. She didn’t feel any heavier than a feather, showing the extent of my strength boost, unexpected but very welcome. </p><p>“Of course,” Lillian moaned as I brushed my tongue against her entrance, enjoying the taste of her arousal. Then, she leaned and once again grabbed Astrid’s hair, and I felt my shaft fully engulfed in Astrid’s warm mouth, her throat tightened around most of my length.</p><p>Astrid gagged and moaned, her desperate attempts to take a breath increasing my enjoyment even further, but Lillian kept her in place. Her juices were flowing even faster, showing her enjoyment of the situation. My tongue quickened further, exploring her entrance for sensitive spots while she continued her attempts to make Astrid suffocate.</p><p>She must be enjoying it even more than she had been displaying, because it barely took two minutes for her to shiver uncontrollably as the orgasm hit. Even more surprising was my own eruption, coming out unexpectedly, filling Astrid’s mouth, and when she pulled back to avoid being drowned in, covering her face and tits. From the amount I exploded, I could guess that I was unconscious for a long while. At least three or four days… </p><p>The more interesting thing was the sudden sense of connection I felt with Astrid on a magical level, something I had never experienced before. Like the earlier kiss, my lightning-natured mana slipped out with my cum, only to end up covering Astrid, increasing the sense of connection between us. I wondered whether it was about the transformation itself, or something that happened afterward… </p><p>I could have just asked the girls, but when my shaft jumped back in life immediately, I decided that I had more important things to focus on. Especially when that erection was accompanied by an animalistic sense of possession toward the girls that were doing their best to teach me the meaning of true pleasure. It was similar to the urges I got when I was battling against the Dragon Heart, but with one great difference. At that time, I was sure that if I yielded to those emotions, I would have lost a part of me. </p><p>This time, it was just something to fulfill me further, a natural part of my transformation. </p><p>I decided to trust my own sixth sense, and stood up and grabbed Astrid, only to throw her on top of Lillian, who was still trying to breathe after her explosive orgasm. Astrid looked like she was about to argue, but when she turned, she saw me standing behind her, my shaft already aligned against her entrance, so she did the smart thing and braced herself. </p><p>I couldn’t help but moan in satisfaction as I slowly pushed in Astrid, enjoying the way her virgin hole tighten around my shaft while her back arched beautifully. I enjoyed Lillian’s jealous expression peeking through Astrid’s red hair almost as much as I pushed even deeper, destroying Astrid’s barrier. </p><p>It was clear that whatever happened after my loss of consciousness had pushed them closer, but not enough to prevent Lillian from feeling jealous, especially since due to her noble identity, she needed to protect her virginity. Respecting that decision was markedly easier when I had a sexy redhead wrapped around my shaft, moaning as I slowly explored her untouched regions. </p><p>Lillian tried to wiggle out of her position but her action was in vain. “Do it somewhere else,” she complained, but I just smirked. “I need to-” she tried to continue, but I decided to cut her in a rather innovative way. I pushed Astrid’s head down, connecting them in a kiss. The fact that Astrid’s lips were still covered with my cum made the situation even better. </p><p>“Be a good girl and help Astrid clean up,” I said even as I continued impaling the redheaded beauty, who was getting more used to my invading presence. I could see outrage dancing in the depths of her blue eyes, but Astrid didn’t share her concerns if her enthusiastic moan was any indicator. </p><p>No matter how much she wanted to deny, Lillian was no less aroused than Astrid, and the taste of my cum managed to break through her reluctance. She closed her eyes in surrender as her lips joined the fray, their tongues battling in abandon. I rammed inside Astrid even harder, partly to ignore the temptation to push inside Lillian to enjoy the beautiful sandwich they created even more. </p><p>Lillian seemed determined to make that decision even harder, because when she pulled away from the kiss, I was expecting another round of complaints from her. Instead, she continued kissing Astrid’s neck and face aggressively, following my earlier order to clean her up with remarkable gusto. I wondered if it was the taste, or the fact that my seed was weirdly magical. Nonetheless, seeing the proper and impeccable noble heiress devouring the breasts of a barbarian priestess just to get a taste was a spectacular view. </p><p>With Lillian busy with her breasts, Astrid’s lips were free for the moment. “Harder!” she moaned, using the opportunity to ask for better treatment, something I was more than willing to give. The sound of flesh hitting flesh exploded in the room as I pushed deep inside her mercilessly, as hard as she could manage. When I started spanking her ass, her moans intensified even further. </p><p>Then, Astrid cried even louder. The reason showed itself when her torso rose a bit, showing bite marks around her nipple, hard enough to leave a mark that would last for days. Lillian just smirked at satisfaction. “You’re too loud,” she said even as she grabbed Astrid’s hair, pulling her into a kiss once more, which also had the added benefit of pinning Astrid in place, allowing me to really cut loose. </p><p>Time lost its meaning as the three of us fell into a hypnotic rhythm, ending only when I exploded once more, filling Astrid’s insides with my seed, which, once again, accompanied by a flow of magic. This time, however, the sensation even more intimate. With our direct connection, I could feel my magic connecting with hers, and —for the lack of a better term— illuminating it brightly, like it was forcing transformation… I could feel our magical presence mingle, creating a lingering connection with me at the dominant position. </p><p>I decided to push for an explanation, but that decision was once again delayed when Lillian wiggled from underneath Astrid, only to move behind her and start licking her nether lips, enjoying the treat I had just left there. Looking at Lillian’s lithe body, aroused face, and wet entrance, I decided to delay questioning for a while… </p>
