        <p>Even as I walked toward Oeyne’s bedroom, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my aim of getting her in the bed was working even better than I hoped. Of course, a part of it was her intention, she was clearly trying to seduce me as I tried to do so as well. </p><p>The change of pace was very much welcome. </p><p>I knew that her attempts were not about my handsomeness —or, at least, not entirely so. Her sudden offer to share her forging secrets suggested she was in a pickle big enough that she couldn’t be sure to pull me in the mix without a personal connection. And considering the amount I was willing to pay her to craft my weapons, she had considerable leverage, but clearly it was insufficient for her request if her sudden change of attitude was any indicator. </p><p>My sixth sense was telling me that whatever the issue was, it was going to be dangerous, so much that, if it was just a few days ago, I wouldn’t have taken the risk. However, with the amazing benefits I received thanks to completing the companion process, as well as the last few levels, I was confident to face risks. </p><p>If I could risk fighting against the necromancers, I could handle whatever problems a blacksmith could have. </p><p>With that in mind, I once again focused on the present. In her bedroom, I did two things. First, I put my hand to my pack before casting a biomancy spell, creating a unique massage oil that would work excellently to relax and lubricate me at the same time. Second, without even turning my back, I removed all of my clothes except my underwear without looking back, and lay on her bed, my face buried on her pillow, which conveniently hid my smile after I heard Oeyne’s shocked hiss. </p><p>I was proud of my muscular body, one didn’t look like a mage at all. Oeyne clearly liked what she saw, even though she was surprised by it. </p><p>Still, my heartbeat got stronger when I heard the sound of leather hitting the floor, suggesting that she had got rid of her leather pants as well. Since she had already removed her top, it meant that she was standing only in her panties. But before I could even imagine that, another sound reached my ear, this time much softer, like a whisper. </p><p>Her panties hit the floor as well. </p><p>How interesting, I thought even as I listened to the sound of her applying oil to her hands. “Are you ready, big boy?” she whispered as she pressed her soft hands to my back —which was rather interesting considering her job, but considering the abilities of the System, it wasn’t completely unexpected. However, while her touch was soft, it didn’t mean that the strength behind it was delicate. Her hands wandered over my back rapidly with a pressure that would have cracked me if I was still level ten, though, despite that, it wasn’t unpleasant. Clearly, she was decently skilled in massaging. </p><p>“Of course,” I whispered back lazily. “I can handle whatever you can dish, no problem.” </p><p>“Oh, is that so?” she murmured. “Those words seem like a challenge for me.” </p><p>“Take it as a challenge if you want to taste defeat once more,” I answered smugly. She didn’t answer, though the sudden tightening of her hands was answer enough. Her pride clearly didn’t appreciate the reminder of her recent loss, nor did she liked the implications about the current challenge. </p><p>I felt a momentary worry when her hands left my body, but that worry was squished when I heard the sound of oil pouring. Still, it was weird, as she was pouring far too much oil. Apparently, she decided to compensate with excessive oil, which, unfortunately, was an amateur mistake. I prepared myself for an unsatisfactory massage experience. </p><p>Only to be surprised when I felt her climb on the bed, and immediately after, sitting on my back, her oil-covered skin teasing mine. Her torso pressed against my back, with a pair of globe-shaped presences pressing against both sides of my neck, once again covered with a generous amount of massage oil. </p><p>Generous, but definitely not wasted. </p><p>[+100 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>She said nothing, but her pride was apparent as her delicious body rubbed against mine as she slowly moved down, as if she was trying to map her curves on my body. I let out a satisfied moan, conveying my thoughts and encouraging her at the same time. I was surprised by her initiative, bringing the massage to such a heated level so soon. I couldn’t help but feel curious about what she had in mind the next. </p><p>For the next few minutes, she glided up and down on my back, treating me to a delicious massage through the pressure of her breasts. I lay without saying anything, enjoying the glorious, uninterrupted treatment. Then, she spoke once more. “Switch,” she ordered even as she grabbed my arm, making me turn. </p><p>I was more than happy to turn under her control, enthusiastic about catching the sight of her glistening caramel body, but this time, my plans had been ruined. Just as I was about to catch a glimpse, she pressed a towel on my face, cutting my sight. How quaint, I thought in amusement. I could have dealt with it easily, but I decided to take the passive route. </p><p>Partially because I genuinely enjoyed the change in the pattern, being seduced rather than playing the aggressor, however, it was still mostly about watching her squirm. The spell to prevent her from climaxing was still on, ensuring that no matter how aroused she felt, she wouldn’t be able to reach orgasm before I let her. I was curious just how much it would take for her to reach that point. </p><p>[+150 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“How do you feel?” she whispered into my ear even as her tits rubbed against my chest, enough to turn my underwear into hell. </p><p>“Pretty relaxed,” I answered, my tone much lazier than my actual feelings to tease her, and if her stiffening was to be taken as an answer, it worked as well as I could have hoped. </p><p>“Relaxed?” she questioned as she started to lower herself, and suddenly, I felt her hand pressing against my bulge. “That doesn’t feel relaxed. I better help you.” Then, without waiting for a response, she dragged them down, freeing my erection. “You don’t mind, do you?” she asked with a playful, exaggerated giggle. </p><p>“You’re the boss,” I answered, but I failed to maintain my tone of disinterest when I felt the unfamiliar yet recognizable presence of her amazing breasts wrapping around my shaft, sliding easily thanks to the thick layer of massage oil. “That’s nice,” I murmured. </p><p>She giggled, but said nothing as she abandoned all pretenses of a massage and focused on my erection, teasing it with her tits, occasionally assisted by her tongue, enhancing my pleasure build-up significantly. </p><p>“You’re enjoying the treatment, right,” she murmured as she suddenly changed position, and lay next to me, replacing her tits with her hand. She pulled the towel off, letting me enjoy the glistening caramel wonder that was her body for a while, before pinning me under her chocolate-colored irises. She hovered above me, which presented her curvy body to the best effect, tempting me to eat her. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“It should be obvious,” I answered with a satisfied smirk. </p><p>“It is,” she answered with a matching smirk, though I could see frustration behind her gaze. I would have assumed that it was the frustration of her denied orgasm, but one important detail changed my mind. It wasn’t her unmet arousal, or at least, not only that. If it was so, she would have pushed things further rather than slowing things down. </p><p>No, she wanted something, and she decided it was the perfect time to do so. </p><p>“I’m sure you would like to make it a regular thing,” she whispered as she lay next to me, trapping my arm between her amazing tits while continuing her hand job. </p><p>“Well, to be frank, I wouldn’t mind. If this is the starter and not the main course, of course,” I said, my smirk widening even further. </p><p>The shine of interest in her eyes was impossible to fake. “That can be arranged,” she whispered. “How’s your schedule for the next few days.” </p><p>“A bit complicated,” I admitted. “But not so bad that I can’t squeeze a few short visits,” I suggested, and her expression flickered before she could recover. It was an important tell. Whatever she was trying to convince me, she needed it soon. </p><p>For a moment, she said nothing, just quickening the treatment of her hand. Then, she shifted, kissing my neck before trailing down, leaving a trail of kisses, tracing my muscles back and forth, paying particular attention to my abs. When she arrived at my crotch, she gave me a challenging smile and whispered. “Is there a way you can adjust your schedule a bit?” she whispered before giving a seductive lick across my length, her eyes firmly locked to mine as she did so. </p><p>When she swallowed my length without a warning, I was unable to contain the gasp of pleasure that escaped my mouth. The reason, the smooth way she swallowed my shaft, devouring half of its length in one move, suggesting that she hadn’t had a tame youth. I watched as she bobbed her head repeatedly, each repeat pushing her deeper and deeper, and soon, she was swallowing two-thirds of my length with each repeat. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“And what if I need you to stay more than a few short visits, to give me a hand?” she finally asked after five minutes of enthusiastic sucking, but I could hear the strain as she asked that. </p><p>It couldn’t be easy to stay on the edge for all that time. </p><p>“Depends,” I answered lazily, without bothering to change my lazy position. “What exactly you need me to do?” I asked. I was rather happy with her service, both in terms of forging and in terms of ‘massage’, but neither was critical enough for me to commit to a task before I knew the truth behind it, especially since she was being very careful not to reveal that particular aspect. Not when I was already beset with enemies on multiple fronts. </p><p>Rather than answering immediately, she continued to suck me, alternating between the shaft and the balls, however, that amazing service only made me more suspicious. The more she avoided, the more my sixth-sense warned me about the underlying dangers. At this point, the smartest thing to do was to ask her to stop, put on my clothes, and leave, never to return. </p><p>However, as usual, I chose the more dangerous path, and continued to lay as she devoured me. </p><p>It took five minutes for her to speak once more. “Nothing much,” she murmured. “I just have a challenging forging job, and your assistance will be useful,” she said. “It will be exhausting, very exhausting, and will probably require at least three days of forging, without even an opportunity to sleep. It takes a real man to handle such a grueling task.” </p><p>“That seems like a tough job,” I murmured, admiring her simple, yet effective trick. What she was asking for was indeed huge. For a normal mage, casting full power for three days would be indeed disastrous. The experience itself would have been exhausting enough, but the aftereffects of such effort on the body would put a normal mage out of commission for a week, maybe even more. Altogether, it was a sufficient reason for her to make that request in the bed, especially considering our mutual attraction made it an amusing challenge rather than a degrading chore. </p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>It was what made her offer insidiously clever. By asking it in such a distracting moment, while giving me a very convincing reason for it to be reasonable, she did her best to prevent me from digging deeper. Her dig on my manhood, while obvious, was also a nice touch, adding another layer of distraction. If it wasn’t for my own mastery in deception, I would have missed the slight quickening of her tone as she explained, indicating she was trying to hide something. </p><p>[Subterfuge +2]</p><p>Something big. </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured. “It will be tough, but I trust my mana reserves. I doubt it would take more than two days,” I said lazily, like I had already accepted it. The smile that tugged visible despite her best effort showed her elation. Of course, with my regeneration and my ability to replenish her mana, I would be surprised if it took more than a day, even less if I could make decent progress in our companion process. “What are we going to forge?” </p><p>“A shield,” she answered, her tension draining even more as she answered. </p><p>“And who’s the customer?” I asked. </p><p>That made her stiffen. It was again a subtle movement, but for me, she might as well be waving a huge flag of alarm. My digging finally hit the vein. “That’s confidential,” she murmured. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked even as I lifted myself on the bed for the first time, slowly and deliberately, alerting her. She raised her body as well, but before she could react, I grabbed her shoulders, and pushed her on the bed, and put my hand between her legs, reversing the situation. “Who’s the customer?” I repeated the question, slowly and deliberately, even as my fingers slipped inside her. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>Her lips pressed shut, realizing her mistake, but that only galvanized me further. </p><p>An interesting interrogation awaited me… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 27    Experience: 358700 / 378000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 46</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3699 / 3699	Mana: 4914 / 4914        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [95/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [81/100]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17]</p>
