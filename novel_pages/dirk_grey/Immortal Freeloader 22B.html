        <p>She said nothing as she dragged me to a huge bedroom and threw me to her bed. More daring than I was used to, but the speed she was able to throw me suggested that Elsana liked having control in the bedroom. </p><p>I was more interested in the speed she climbed onto the bed right next to me, showing that all those poems and sexy gazes were not for nothing. She was already panting with desire, which she didn’t bother to hide. </p><p>It was ill-advised, maybe, but I was already aroused before she fed me a pill that made my blood boil with heat and desire, so instead of letting her play, I grabbed her waist, and flipped our position. She was strong enough to prevent that, of course, but she let that happen even though she ended up on her back. </p><p>“Well, you look enthusiastic,” she said as she grabbed my shirt with one hand, then ripped it off without showing the slightest strain, showing just how strong she was physically. </p><p>I just leaned and captured her lips. Her eyes widened in surprise as my tongue invaded her mouth, but when she responded, her tongue danced skillfully. At the same time, she quickly ripped the rest of my clothes easily. </p><p>I understood the reason for the pill she had fed me. She wasn’t being metaphorical when she mentioned she needed my warmth. Her essence was freezing, and as we shared a kiss, it invaded my body. It might have been dangerous if it wasn’t for the pill she fed to me earlier.</p><p>As I kissed her, my hands danced on her cold yet warm skin, using not only my lifetime of experience, but also the massage skills I had learned, which helped the cold to start moving slightly. </p><p>“Not bad, you know how to massage,” she said. “Just ordinary technique, of course, but good expertise.”  </p><p>“I’m always open to constructive criticism, Master Elsana,” I said seductively before I let my lips slide down and start sucking her neck.  </p><p>“Maybe later. I’m feeling impatient,” she said as she tightened her hips around me and flipped, and I ended up under her. At the same time, she managed to get rid of her corset and her skirt, leaving her in panties only. </p><p>“You are beautiful,” I said. </p><p>“I - I,” she stammered, not expecting the compliment, but that didn’t last long, not when she remembered her exact state of undress. “Enough talking,” she said far more confidently as she captured my lips, letting her body rub against mine. </p><p>Her cold essence infused my body aggressively, overwhelming the pill she fed to me somewhat. Luckily, her best friend’s technique countered hers, so I carefully converted some of my essence through Volcano Technique, easily countering her essence. </p><p>An unexpected benefit. </p><p>She could have stopped me easily as I pulled her panties to the side, but instead, she paused her hips slightly, giving me the time I needed to align with her entrance. </p><p>I slipped inside, and she moaned. “You’re very impatient —” she started, trying to sound dissatisfied, but that contrasted with her moan. And the speed her hips moved as she rode me aggressively. She was not a virgin, but every move of hers made it clear that it had been a while since she had a bed partner. </p><p>Quite a while, even. </p><p>I let my hands dance over her body, desperate to discover her sensitive spots. Fascinatingly, my budding massage talent helped me with it greatly. As the pleasure infused her body, she picked up the pace, her tunnel tightening around me like a clamp. </p><p>It was impossible to keep back my growing explosion … nor I could keep myself when she moaned even louder, her sudden flood signaling her climax. “Well, that was quick,” I said smugly even as I flipped her, not stopping even for a moment. </p><p>One big advantage of her cultivation, she was strong enough to handle the aftermath of her climax. As for the consequences … well, she was a super pharmacist, so I didn’t need to worry about it. </p><p>“You’re pretty arrogant for a traveling scholar,” she said, trying to sound confident, but it was a difficult mood to maintain as her chest heaved up and down. </p><p>“Some effort is necessary to keep such a magnificent woman satisfied,” I said even as I started moving. After my climax, I felt the warmth from the pill she fed me weaken, but luckily, reinforcing it subtly with the Volcano Hammer technique was easy. </p><p>I wouldn’t risk acting in such a forward manner in other circumstances, but after her climax, Elsana was vulnerable to pleasure enough to make the risks manageable. I continued moving back and forth, each repeat pushing her pleasure higher and higher. </p><p>The results were spectacular, owing to the long break she had taken from the bedroom activities. A pity considering her beauty. Someone like her needed to be pampered more … later. </p><p>Tonight was about a nice, proper hard fuck. </p><p> I drilled her hard, enjoying her moans. I had always been good in bed — there was a reason I was able to keep those rich and bored ladies interested in me — and while a part of it was about my good looks and even better stamina, my ability to read my partner needed help even more. </p><p>And, at this moment, Elsana needed nothing more than a proper, hardcore, merciless fucking.  I pushed, and her hips followed my rhythm instinctively. Soon, her legs closed around my hips, tight enough that I couldn’t escape. </p><p>Her level of power made sure of it. </p><p>As I drilled, I used my newly acquired massage skills to the limit, teasing her. “Try to move your hands slower. It’ll help the essence move slowly,” she commented. </p><p>“As you wish, madam,” I said with a big smirk. “Any other suggestions.” As I said that, my hips quickened. I wanted to make sure that I enjoyed receiving orders.   </p><p>The opportunity to improve my skills was too useful to skip. </p><p>“Try to press your finger to my collarbone harder. There’s an acupuncture point there. Even as an Initiate, it’ll help you move my martial essence,” she suggested. I did so, even cheating somewhat with the Volcano Essence, and she moaned even harder. “That’s good—” she said, interrupted by another moan as I twisted her nipple. </p><p>Daring, but clearly enjoyed it. </p><p>She moaned even harder once I flipped her and took her from behind while I caressed her spine, though she maintained enough presence of mind to give me some suggestions. The idea of slowly massaging her for hours, until she started begging for me for a release was tempting. </p><p>Unfortunately, as much as I would have liked to spend hours like that, there were two problems. First, Lannayin was supposed to visit after her meeting was over, and with her personality, it wasn’t impossible for her to breach in. </p><p>Also, it was dangerous to try to control Elsana, even for her fun. I still didn’t have a good hold of her personality, so I didn’t want to push my luck too much. </p><p>Instead, I continued delivering my combined pleasure assault, the soft massage contrasting with the aggressive invasion. She gasped and moaned, occasionally interrupted by some suggestions to enhance my massage skills. </p><p>With her medical skills, that advice was spot on. </p><p>I accepted all, and focused on keeping her happy … but when we climaxed again, the chill hit even harder. Using Volcano Essence was tempting, but too risky, so I made a point of trembling to show the cold infused me deeply. </p><p>“Servants already prepared a bath for you. Just go and stay submerged until the chill is gone completely,” she said, dismissing me from her room casually. </p>
