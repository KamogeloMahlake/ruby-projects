        <p><u><strong>Update : I'm closing the poll early because the majority already voted, overwhelmingly choosing to stay in the previous focus poll model. Thank you all for your time.</strong></u></p><p><u><strong>-----</strong></u></p><p>I have an idea of changing the benefits for the Behind the Scenes, but I would prefer the decision to my supporters. The changes will include: </p><ul> <li>The focus poll will determine only one update rather than two. </li> <li>However, in return, each month, I'll have a one-shot, where you will determine the content. I'll add a couple of prompts to each poll, and you'll be also free to add your own. Then, the short story that gets the most likes will be written. This will be in addition to three stories I usually update. </li></ul><p>The vote will finalise by March 24.  </p><p>We'll have March as an experimental month, meaning focus poll for April will still determine two stories, and in addition, you can write down your story ideas under this thread, and the winner will be determined by <strong>3rd of March</strong>. I'll try to post the winning story by <strong>15th of March</strong>. </p><p>Have fun!</p>
