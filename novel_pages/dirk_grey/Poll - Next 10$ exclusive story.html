        <p>Hi all, </p><p>Now that Dark Lord in Chains is coming to an end, I'm going to start a new story. However, this time, I won't be taking polls for every chapter as that will be with Multiverse. </p><p><strong>Villainous Perks (rewrite without the system) </strong>Okay, I have to admit, I made two mistakes with this story. One, Smashwords is a difficult platform to sell, and two, the story has a System. If it wins, I'll rewrite story with a supervillain with observation powers and military training; but trying to hide as a bar owner. </p><p>The system kind of ruined the scale of the story to the point of killing my enthusiasm. </p><p>The other worldbuilding aspects like gang warfare, heroines sneaking around will stay, </p><p><strong>Art of Dual Cultivation: </strong>An isekai progagonist with Dual Cultivation support system, with a lot of action, seduction, and posturing. </p><p><strong>Journey of the Swordsman: </strong>A medieval fantasy adventure story of a farmer boy using his sword and 'sword' to explore the world and the ladies</p><p><strong>Harem Stealer: </strong>Fantasy world, there are heroes with harems, MC has to break the harems to save the world. </p><p><strong>Ability Doctor: </strong>Modern world, The world is suddenly filled with dungeons, and people with abilities. However, abilities are deliberately limited. </p><p>MC receives an ability to adjust abilities, but it requires trust ... and MC uses a unique method to develop trust...  </p>
