        <p> The idea of pushing her down against the desk was tempting. Too tempting to ignore, especially since I had managed to awaken a very unhealthy incarnation of pride in my dear coach. I just needed a tiny excuse to push for more. </p><p>And until then, I did my best to look hesitant and fearful, like her half-naked state allowed Coach Juana to hold the advantage. A fascinating little dance. </p><p>“So, about this tactic,” I pointed to one of the papers which had one of the most complicated tactical schemes I had prepared for the current game. I had little hope of using that, and it was there to test the limits of Teaching traits rather than any expectation of usefulness. </p><p>However, as I pointed that, I stretched my arm, making sure I had revealed my muscular chest. Normally, that would have gone unnoticed, as Coach Juana was a conditioning coach and familiar with the visual aspects of my body, but that didn’t prevent her blush. </p><p>Context mattered, just like the difference between swimsuits and lingerie. Even if the latter covered more skin, it would still look sexier and more suggestive. The same went for my ‘accidental’ glimpse. </p><p>She tried to hide her attraction as she tried to look focused on the paper, but she asked me several questions that made me lean forward to get more glimpses. And, more importantly, to maintain the facade, she had to pay a lot of attention to the tactic itself — which was dangerously complicated — as well as her own tricks to convince me to keep giving her glimpses. As a consequence, she started to pay less attention to my hand that was still on her back, saying nothing as I slowly weakened the facade of a massage. </p><p>Instead, I caressed her back, which was greatly different than massaging, allowing me to tease her sensitive spots with much greater effectiveness than I might have otherwise achieved. Soon, her body was burning with pleasure, but, she hadn’t noticed until she let out a loud moan that did wonders for me. </p><p>“Is something wrong?” I asked, doing my best to look concerned, yet just as she was about to answer, I dragged my finger along her spine, even using a touch of Intent to give her some supernatural pleasure. She moaned even louder. </p><p>“N-no, just a cramp,” she muttered in a panic. </p><p>“Your thigh?” I asked just as I repeated the trick, forcing her to nod in answer. A mistake, she realized only when I moved in front of her and put my hands on her legs, and started working on her right leg. </p><p>“It’s not —“ she tried to say, only to be interrupted by another moan. </p><p>“It’s worse than I thought, let me remove your sweatpants, so I can access the skin,” I said to her, and before an answer could be given, pulled her sweatpants down. “You’re wearing shorts, right?” I asked as I did so, forcing her to nod again. </p><p>“Yes,” she found herself saying, too late to keep her shorts on. It took all I had not to celebrate as I had seen what was underneath. Technically, she was wearing shorts, though they were more like stretchy yoga pants that ended very high on her thighs. Combine that with their thinness and the lack of underwear — very noticeable — it was obvious that she had no intention of actually removing her outfit for exercise unless it was in the privacy of her home. </p><p>Her core was particularly striking, her wetness very noticeable. Yet, in an effort to avoid my gaze, she didn’t look down, missing the erotic sight she was providing for me. “Close your eyes and focus on the absence of pain,” I said as I pressed my fingers to the naked parts of her thigh, the soft sensation of her caramel skin incredible. </p><p>The pleasure was high, but still, I expected her to put some token protest. She did not, and just murmured obediently before closing her eyes. More importantly, her legs parted open, giving me an even better glimpse of her core. Things were getting naughtier, and she wasn’t doing anything to stop things. </p><p>I focused on her inner thighs to ‘destroy’ the cramp, each second making her arousal smell more intensely, her moans beautiful and soft. I expected her to try and stop, as even with the previous tricks, it was too early for someone as reticent as her to allow me to touch her body recklessly. Yet, she did nothing, which was why I was surprised. </p><p>It must be even more than I expected since she had visited someone’s bed to react this enthusiastically once things reached this stage, even with my tricks. After all, my tricks were merely optimized to distract, yet she was already losing her coherence. </p><p>I had no problem following her indirect invitation, doing my best to conceal my excitement. She shuffled in her seat to lean deeper in the chair, even pushing the back of the ergonomic seat so that she got a diagonal position. Combined with the way she raised her head, it hid her expression from me completely. Luckily, I didn’t need to see her face to read her mood. Her moans were already giving a real-time update on her situation, </p><p>As she started to react to the pleasure, I started to abandon the trickier aspect of our game and focused on her pleasure in a purer manner. Her body begged for more as I let my hands move upward slowly, each circling giving her more pleasure. She moaned once more. </p><p>“So, any more questions about that tactic,” I suddenly asked, and she stiffened under my hands, as she had just remembered where she was. Maybe she actually did. </p><p>“I need to study a bit more,” she said as she tried to move, but my hands landed on her thighs to prevent her from moving, which, with my strength, was extremely easy to achieve. She looked at me, shocked, and I caught her gaze, smirking. The widening of her eyes was beautiful, showing the realization that she had been played … again. </p><p>She could have asked me to stop, but it was hard to do with her body rocking with growing pleasure, the climax tantalizingly close. I could read the panic and confusion on her beautiful face, followed by a subtle surrender. </p><p>With a desire to avoid my gaze, she grabbed the paper and raised it in front of her face, creating a convenient concealment for herself. </p><p>I continued to caress her body as an obedient servant. Her body was tempting enough to make that ‘indignity’ easy to suffer, and the biggest question in my mind was about the speed of the massage before I reached my ultimate aim. </p><p>She kept her face hidden with the paper, but unfortunately for her, it wasn’t soundproof, and her moans reached my ear no matter how much she wanted to keep them suppressed. My fingers moved higher, invading the area that was covered with her slutty shorts, her wetness turning a dangerous area half-transparent in the process. And,, the material was thin enough to be non-existent as far as isolating my touch, her moans getting stronger the higher I moved. </p><p>At this point, I had no intention of wasting the beautiful opportunity I had. Yesterday evening had been the limit of my mercy. My only regret was I didn’t have any massage oil with me to spice up the situation. However, just because I intended to finish it didn’t mean I was in a hurry. I felt her tense as I approached the truly dangerous areas, so I reversed my path immediately, and after a quick journey, I was massaging the soles of her feet. </p><p>It helped me greatly. She was under the impression that my playing with her feet was safer than her inner thigh, which was incorrect. There were a lot of nerve points that responded to my fingers there. Yet, it worked to subvert some of her attention as she focused on the pleasure she was getting, enjoying my touch without conflict. After all, it was supposed to be a submissive position, and if the fleeting glare she threw at me while thinking she was hidden was any indicator,  she was more than ready to believe that as well. </p><p>Or at least, trying to convince herself to that, as the alternative would mean she had to stop the massage — which would leave her right on the edge. She hoped that the massage would soon allow her to topple to the other side. </p><p>A vain hope, as I was determined to keep her on the edge until she begged…</p>
