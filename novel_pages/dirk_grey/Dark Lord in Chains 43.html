        <p>Based on my initial plans, I was supposed to stop pushing Fernhand, to prevent her from reacting adversely while getting used to her new political position after her ambitions were destroyed, with all the unpleasantness of a rug being pulled under her feet just as she was about to step into the most important ball of the year, only to be teased by the hope of a smaller reward. </p><p>It was a shift of mentality not many people could adapt. Most would get too invested in what they had lost, spending a wasteful amount of time and energy to reacquire their lost fortunes or political assets, ultimately causing them to lose even more. It was yet another thing I had used to great effect in my own rise of power. </p><p>However, the speed Fernhand was showing in adapting her modified role surprised me, though, it might imply two opposite things. Either she accepted her modified position with surprising mental agility, or she was completely unaffected by the changes, waiting for the opportunity to upend the table again. </p><p>Just like what I had done with my imprisonment.</p><p>Despite being diametrically opposite, however, those two possibilities had one shared implication. It meant that I could push her further without fearing an adverse reaction from her side. Either way, she accepted my power over her —though whether permanently or temporarily was an issue for another time.  </p><p>“Damn, girl, you’re tighter than Sapphire, she would have been broken up if she knew that,” I murmured in a way that could be easily taken as an absentminded slip, the kind that could be done by an overconfident dark lord. After all, just because I was enjoying her tight asshole with an ever-increasing speed didn’t mean that I couldn’t use the opportunity to carefully manipulate her understanding of the relationship between me and Sapphire, especially if that could be built through a delicious mixture of truth and lies. </p><p>“Really?” she asked in a flirtatious yet elated tone, enthusiasm painting her tone bright. Too bad that it was completely fake. </p><p>“Yeah,” I said even as I slapped her ass before picking up speed, enjoying the way her tightness stretched to open a slippery pathway for me. “Hers is much more beautiful, of course, but yours is tighter,” I added in the same absentminded tone. </p><p>“I see,” she answered, but different from her previous words, her jealousy felt much more genuine, suggesting that I managed to hit a soft spot. The fact that she was jealous of Sapphire was not surprising, considering she was spending a significant chunk of her time to get the things that belonged to Sapphire, such as political power. Under that circumstances, jealousy was not a weird emotion to develop, and that was only if her jealousy wasn’t the driving factor that started everything in the first place. </p><p>Something that I was happy to notice, giving me another lever to push along physical discomfort to make her slip. “Of course,” I said in an insensitive manner. “Don’t get me wrong, sweetie, you’re a beautiful woman, but you lack her curves, which is a great assistance in bed,” I continued, before punctuating it with another slap on her tight ass. </p><p>A grunt escaped her mouth, more of an annoyance than pain even as I started ramming into her hard enough for our hips to create a loud symphony. </p><p>“Don’t worry, you’re beautiful in your own way,” I said, driving the dagger even further. I always liked that sentence, because it worked even better than an offhand insult, accepting her inferiority as a given, then adding a dose of pity to make it even more painful. Fernhand shuddered in anger, the sharpest jab of emotion I had ever managed to extract from her, making me wonder about the source of Fernhand’s enmity toward Sapphire. </p><p>The most significant driver of her action was getting more power for herself, of course. Her actions were too calculated and too conservative to be just a revenge drive, but still, it wouldn’t be surprising if it started from a purer negative place. With her beautiful body and her hidden tantric magic, Sapphire was uniquely equipped to drive her fellow women into irrevocable fits of jealousy. I had no idea, who was the male in question, whether the late Emperor, or another noble who didn’t a young and idealistic Fernhand the attention she deserved in lieu of trying to seduce a newly-widowed Queen, enamored with both her beauty and the power of her successful seduction represented. </p><p>Regardless, her intensifying reaction suggested that I had the perfect lever to unbalance her. “Sweetie, why did you stop, you were talking about the recent changes in the tax collection regulations,” I said, once again using a spank as a punishment. </p><p>Fernhand continued to explain, though getting frustrated by the dwindling attention I was paying on her. I grabbed some of the papers from her desk and started reading just to push her more. And just to add insult to injury, I spread those papers over her back, using her body as another desk. </p><p>The growl of frustration she let out in response was just spectacular. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t just my dismissal that was affecting her. Even as I subtly mocked her for being less beautiful than Sapphire, I continued to enjoy her tight hole with an increasing speed, hitting her with an unexpected rush of pleasure. </p><p>Things got even more intense when I reached down to slip a finger into her wetness, the movement of my fingers skillful yet mechanical, selling the idea of being disinterested despite the great pleasure that was triggering in her. </p><p>The paradox of my actions started to work wonders, as grudging yet intense moans started to interject themselves between her words, breaking up her explanation even further. </p><p>And, the more distracted she got, the looser her lips become, having some interesting slips about her supporters and her aims. I was willing to treat them as truth, because whenever she had one such slip, a sharp realization hit her, temporarily chilling her fury. </p><p>I couldn’t ignore the chance that she was even better in manipulation than I was giving her credit for, and actually using that to trick me, of course, but luckily, none of the information was absolutely necessary, giving me enough time to validate through alternative channels. </p><p>As I pushed inside her, I was getting closer to a climax of my own. I could have just exploded in her bowels, of course, but why should I, when there were so many better options. </p><p>I pulled out without a warning. “W-what happened?” she asked, murmuring dazedly at the sudden absence of pleasure. Clearly, I wasn’t the only one getting closer to an explosion, and she clearly didn’t appreciate the sudden stop. </p><p>“Well, the explanation I had received is more than enough for today,” I said even as I started walking, amused by the way she closed her eyes as she tried to suppress a biting reply about stopping halfway, smart enough to realize I wouldn’t treat such a move nicely. </p><p>However, her reaction to close her eyes allowed me to move to the other side of her table without her noticing. She might have amazing political instincts and manipulative capabilities, but her spatial awareness was horrible, a perfect fit for a little noble politician that never faced mortal danger without hordes of guards to protect her. </p><p>When she opened her eyes, only to find myself standing in front of her, her mouth opened in shock, a perfect opportunity for me to push my throbbing girth through her lips, hard enough to cut her breathing. The outrage on her face was one of the most delicious sights I enjoyed, intensifying further even as my shaft touched the entrance of her throat. </p><p>Ignoring her outraged gags, I pushed even further, enjoying the tightness of her throat. As I pulled her hair, her outrage quickly melted, leaving its place to an accepting resignation, the combined weight of her secrets and her pleasure enough to earn her passive obedience. </p><p>As I read her expression, it was getting pretty clear that I was reaching the edge of her resistant obedience, meaning that unless I wanted her to react explosively, I needed to stop surprising her, at least for the rest of the day. But, since the avoidance was the only rational strategy for the rest of the day, I decided to enjoy her throat as much as possible. </p><p>I grabbed her hair even tighter, using it as leverage to impale her throat thoroughly, her gasps and gags rising to create an enticing melody. I even used my grip to pull her torso up a bit, enough to slip my hand between her and the desk, squeezing her tits mercilessly. </p><p>Despite the roughness of the treatment —or maybe because of it— she was enjoying it immensely, any little breath she was able to take escaping back as moans, followed by another string of gagging. The shock in her eyes told me that it was the first time she was being treated like that, and the level of enjoyment she was driving from it was completely shocking.  </p><p>I continued enjoying her body without the slightest hint of restraint, even when her hands found my thighs, resting on them lazily like she was having trouble deciding whether to push me away or achieve the impossible by pulling me even deeper… </p><p>And since she was already primed by the earlier anal treatment, it barely took a couple of minutes for her to achieve a spectacular climax, her body invaded by endless trembling. The tightening of her throat also helped me to close in the remaining distance. I didn’t resist the pull, but I didn’t fill her throat either. </p><p>No, I had one last nice surprise for her. </p><p>I pulled out at the last possible second, and started sprouting my thick lines of seed on her beautiful face, just to underline the perks and responsibilities of her new station in life. Her expression, dancing between shame, outrage, and a guilty pleasure, was beautiful, especially when it failed to land on just one expression even as I slowly fixed my pants and started walking away. </p><p>I stopped just as I was about to open the door. “It was a useful meeting, certainly enough to keep me from mentioning it to Sapphire, unless you have a sudden change of mind and not happy with the trade we’re conducting, of course.” </p><p>“No, no problem,” she uttered, her tone carrying the same mixture with her expression, suggesting that she couldn’t decide whether to like or hate the treatment she had just received, unlocking the doors of a completely new universe for her. </p><p>She just needed to decide whether to take that step, or turn back. </p><p>“See you around, then,” I said with a chuckle before leaving her, my mind already on the next step… </p>
