        <p>The moan she let out as I dragged my fingers along the side of her breasts gave me a reason to adjust my plans once more. An excellent one, especially since that was accompanied by a flare of her wings, brightening the room momentarily, suggesting that her pleasure reached a point to compromise her self-control. </p><p>In other words, the perfect opportunity to push her limits. </p><p>But not before giving the proper bait. “Pity I can’t use the full extent of my massage abilities,” I whispered, soft enough that if she was an ordinary woman, she would have missed it. </p><p>She was not an ordinary woman, very noticeably so. She was a supernatural phoenix, which allowed her to hear that. “What do you mean?” she asked as she raised her head and looked at me. </p><p>I faked a shocked expression, mixed with just a flash of fear, giving her the impression that I didn’t intend to be heard by her, my smirk slowly widening at the sight. “Y-you heard that,” I said, stammering for a moment. </p><p>Admittedly, my acting was too exaggerated, but her widening smile after my fake fear suggested that I didn’t misread her. With her unique brand of confidence — one that implied an extremely sheltered upbringing — the exaggerated nature of my little acting project only made it more effective. </p><p>“Yes, I did,” she said proudly as she turned toward me even more, making me wonder whether she was intentionally displaying her nudity, or she had forgotten that she had shrunk her dress into a deficient piece of underwear, and missing the fact that she gifted me with a glimpse of her beautiful nipple. “So, what’s the full extent of your abilities, and why are you not using them?” </p><p>I stopped for a moment to enjoy the spectacular sight before I answered her, still hesitant. “Well, it was something I regularly applied to the queen. It’s challenging, and at times, it had a tendency of getting a bit exaggerated, not to mention requiring a lot of action from your end. I just didn’t think that you can handle— appreciate it,” I added, both using the word handle and the sudden attempt to correct it intentionally, goading her to take the next step, ensuring her commitment. </p><p>A commitment that came even quicker than I expected, carrying all the hallmarks of a reflexive reaction. “I can handle anything that useless Queen can handle,” she responded. Getting caught by the deliberate misleading framing, giving her the impression that the challenge was about abilities than carnal preference, her answer was as quick as a lightning. </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked. Not because I wanted her to change her mind, but because I wanted her to further commit to her misleading decision, expecting her pride to work better than chains. </p><p>“Don’t make repeat myself,” she said. Her wings of fire flared once more, but this time, it was about her anger than arousal. Yet, her anger just reinforced my impression about her unfamiliarity with the position of command, as reflexive displays of anger were one of the most effective ways of ruining the authority over one’s following.  </p><p>“As you wish,” I said. Without a warning, I slapped her ass, hard enough that even her tight flesh rippled for a fleeting moment, but before she could gasp, my hand was already on the area I spanked, using magic to soothe the area and relax it more. </p><p>She froze in shock, caught flat-footed by the sudden change, enough to delay her response for a moment. “What are you doing!” she gasped warningly as she shuffled in place, shifting in place enough to give an even better view of her tits as she turned hurriedly, the intensifying brightness of her wings enhancing the aura of attraction even more. </p><p>“Moving to the next stage. You said you can handle it,” I said, doing my best to sound bewildered rather than challenging her directly. Her ego was clearly fragile enough to react badly if I directly blamed her, but doing the same indirectly worked much better. </p><p>And, just like the time she ‘decided’ to transform her silver dress into a deficient piece of underwear, her fragile ego forced her to make a terrible decision — though, admittedly, my skillful massage and the incredible amount of tantric mana I managed to infuse into her body made sure that her terrible decision came in a form that would bring her more physical pleasure. </p><p>Without that trick to adjust her priorities, she would have probably reacted much more explosively.  </p><p>She stopped, split between her pleasure and the indignity of getting spanked, but I used her momentary freeze to continue work on her skin, using my magic to heal the sting of my touch — once again mixing it with tantric mana to awaken an intense pleasure with it. </p><p>A sensation that she didn’t miss if the widening of her beautiful eyes was any indicator. </p><p>After closing her eyes for a moment to enjoy the sensation, she caught my gaze again, her gaze conflicted as she glanced down at the dance of my fingers. I continued caressing, reducing the intensity, as I had obediently accepted her earlier complaint directly… </p><p>“Who told you to stop?” she finally answered, doing her best to sound angry, but unable to hide the sudden huskiness of her tone. </p><p>Pride and arousal created a deadly combination. </p><p>I spanked her ass again before dousing her bottom with even more tantric mana, triggering another moan. “As you wish, I’m here to serve,” I said. My words were certainly exaggerated, and under different circumstances, I would have refrained from uttering them, as it risked ruining the helpless but still proud image of the king I was trying to reflect. </p><p>But, having the target lay in front of me, mostly naked, and squirming helplessly in a vain attempt to deny the impact of pleasure, I felt safe pushing that limit. </p><p>She was not in the mood to catch such nuances. </p><p>I spanked again even as I spoke once more. "Now, turn around,” I said even as I continued squeezing her beautiful ass. “Let’s start the next stage properly."</p><p>She tensed at the request, but that only worked to delay her for a moment before she followed my request, letting out a shaking breath, finding herself unable to extract from the careless commitment without trampling her own pride. </p><p>Her eyes were closed to hide her emotions, but the way her body’s stillness was broken by the occasional trembles betrayed her and revealed them. </p><p>It was a beautiful sight, surprisingly cute considering the amount of nudity and arousal it included, enough to earn the mercy and love of most men. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I was not like most men. I spanked her beautiful tits twice, one for each, watching them sway before returning to their beautiful state, enjoying her shocked gasp even as I sank my fingers on her breasts, my fingers dancing over its expanse. She gasped desperately as my fingers met around her nipples, squeezing them hard. </p><p>She bit her lips in an effort to contain her moan, a move that wasn’t as effective as she might have hoped. </p><p>I was tempted to test the capabilities of those lips in a different manner, but, unfortunately, that wasn’t really an option, at least not yet. Just because I managed to make considerable process didn’t mean that I could just push the situation recklessly. </p><p>Forgetting her explosive magical power, and even more, explosive fury, would have been a deadly mistake. </p><p>With a soft sigh, I continued working on her breasts, alternating between spanking and massaging. Though, seeing that she reacted to the teasing of her nipples effectively, I soon added several flicks to the mixture, each repeat making her gasp in shock. </p><p>Her body shivered in anticipation as the pleasure built up further and further. She was getting drunk on pleasure, her determination to hide her moans fading. Occasional gasps slipped out of her mouth, while I enjoyed the extraordinary shape of her body more and more. </p><p>I decided to challenge her a bit more, and dragged one of my hands down to her stomach, the other staying on her breasts. As I caressed her stomach, she shivered more and more, smart enough to realize that, with the speed and steady direction my hand-picked, they had no intention of just focusing on her belly. </p><p>I stopped just at the line her magical panties created, dancing along the edge back and forth, suggesting a touch at her most intimate place, but didn’t take that step. I just teased her with the idea. </p><p>The location of my right hand was enough to make her much tenser, and with her attention focused on that carnal threat, my other hand started to treat her breasts even more roughly, slapping and mauling harder and harder before dousing them with more tantric energy, conditioning her for the rougher side of the bedroom fun. </p><p>A concept she was clearly unaware of if her incredible reaction was any indicator. </p><p>She finally opened her eyes once more, catching my gaze, shock and arousal dancing in their beautiful depths.</p><p>And, just like that, I faced another choice.</p>
