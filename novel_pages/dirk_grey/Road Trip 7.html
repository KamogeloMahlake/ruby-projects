        <p>Once again, I lay naked, carefully watching her from the reflection of a small mirror. The moment I closed the curtain, she abandoned her flailing attempts of innocence, leaving its place to worry and anticipation as she carefully watched the curtain. As I watched her, I had to struggle not to explode into laughter, though that amusement soon left its place to arousal as I watched her slowly remove her top, revealing her amazing breasts, clad in the baby-blue underwear I had picked for her. Hidden behind the flattering clasp of a lacy bra, she somehow looked even sexier than when she was naked, begging me to unwrap it. </p><p>The impact only got stronger when she removed her sweatpants, showing her matching panties, which were stretched to the limit thanks to her generous curves. Simply delicious. I still couldn’t believe that this girl was somehow unpopular, even untouched as she prepared to go to college. </p><p>She was lucky that she had me as a guide… </p><p>She sat down in her underwear for half an hour, her attention split between her phone and her e-book reader, unable to focus on both. Still, I wasn’t bored, as I watched curiously as her nipples getting more and more erect as time passed. Considering RV was rather warm even with the windows open, it didn’t take a genius to eliminate the other possibilities for the reason. </p><p>“Michael,” she whispered loudly just as we passed the half an hour mark. “Are you awake?” I naturally didn’t answer, not even a grumble, giving her the confidence that I was already asleep. She waited a couple of minutes before repeating it, this time louder. “Michael, are you up?” </p><p>Seeing that there was no answer to her inquiry, she gasped in anticipation as she walked forward, tiptoeing toward my bed. She turned off the lights in the RV, leaving only moonlight spilling through the gaps of the closed curtains, giving her beauty an ethereal edge. With a lazy push, I changed the angle of the bedside mirror before she arrived, just to avoid an accidental realization. Just as I did so, she pulled open my curtains, looking like a naughty goddess. </p><p>I watched through my cracked eyelids as she pulled down the covers quickly, without fear. Apparently, after last night, she assumed that I was a heavy sleeper. While it wasn’t correct, I was very happy for her to think that. I appreciated her curves, hugged by the moonlight, while she gave the same treatment to my body, her breaths quickening in a visible degree. I was surprised when rather than touching my erection —which was raging hard before she pulled open the curtain, thanks to the beautiful view of Anna wearing underwear— she started caressing my arm gently, trailing my muscles. </p><p>“So strong,” she whispered in fascination as she reached to my fingers, and only then I realized it was the same hand I had used to caress her back while we shopped. It was good to know that it left an impression.   </p><p>I continued to lay silently, carefully not making a move even though I wanted nothing more than to grab her wrist and pull her to the bed, teaching her a lesson about poking a sleeping bear. Pity, it was too early for that. </p><p>“You’re so handsome,” she murmured as she looked at my face, then let her gaze move down between my legs. “And so big…” </p><p>At this point, I expected her to repeat the last night’s activities and reach to my shaft for another furious hand job, or maybe another blowjob if she could gather enough courage. Which was why I was surprised when instead of doing so, she lay next to me, her torso pressing against mine, her heartbeat alone frantic enough to wake me up if I had been sleeping. I had to struggle with my desire not to hug her back as she put her arm around her chest, squeezing me gently. </p><p>But to my shock, it was just a beginning. Soon, she put her head on my shoulder, breathing repeatedly like she was trying to memorize my smell. She followed that with a tender kiss to my neck, soon moving to my shoulder and biceps, while one of her hands started to caress my chest muscles. </p><p>She might be a hesitant beauty, but as a molester, she was really brave! </p><p>“I can’t believe you called me beautiful,” she murmured even as her free hand reached toward her waist, and pulled down her panties, which was stained wet with her arousal. She didn’t throw them away, instead of wrapping them around my shaft, and started jacking me off. Another naughty detail that suggested that she might be inexperienced when it came to real relationships, probably didn’t apply to the digital world. Her selections were curiously on point. </p><p>Playing possum was difficult when I had a sexy bombshell laying next to me, doing her best to drive me crazy by giving a hand job using her soft lacy panties, or when my arm trapped in the valley between her spectacular breasts, large enough to suffocate him if she pressed them to my face. Her tits felt softer than a bag of marshmallows, but somehow they defied gravity effortlessly. </p><p>“It’s all your fault,” she whispered softly even as she continued to play with my erection. “If you didn’t treat me like I’m a beautiful girl, I wouldn’t be burning with a desire that was impossible to quench with just my fingers. Now, you need to suffer.” </p><p>I was tempted to answer that she was blaming me wrongly, as her naughtiness started well before our shopping trip, when she decided to masturbate to the sight of me exercising. But life wasn’t fair, especially when it came to giving a pass to a sexy blonde when she said something wrong. Especially if said blonde was currently had nothing but her underwear, with her panties around my shaft to tease me toward an explosion. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean I would leave it unpunished. Since she was already laying on top of my arm, it was a simple task to curl it, and locking her body against mine. “Michael! Are you awake!” she gasped in panic, but luckily, she had enough presence of mind not to shout, which would have forced me to wake up to prevent my ploy from becoming too unbelievable. But since she didn’t shout, I didn’t reach other than a senseless murmuring, acting like I was still asleep, and it was just a sleeping reaction. </p><p>She sighed relaxedly, only to stiffen once more when I rolled, trapping her underneath my weight. She wiggled, trying to get away, but failed to do so. The only benefit of her action was to bring my shaft closer to her entrance, rubbing against it threateningly. “No,” she gasped, but from her tone, I could read excitement rather than panic. Impressively, rather than trying to get away from underneath me, she started jacking her hand faster, trying to make me cum, likely assuming that if I did so, I might roll once again. </p><p>Not a bad assumption. Too bad that I had more interesting plans in mind to punish her little naughty adventure. </p><p>“You’re finally back,” I murmured softly, trying to fake sleep-talking. It seemed to work, as while she stiffened, she didn’t explode in panic. My excuse in place, I let my hands dance over her body, and since she was convinced that I was acting in my dreams, she felt safer, her hand around my shaft picking up speed, trying to push me toward climax sooner. </p><p>I had no intention of allowing her to succeed easily. I started moving lower. It, unfortunately, prevented my shaft from rubbing against her entrance, but it allowed me to bury my face between her tits, which was a win. She shivered as my teeth clamped around her bra while my fingers wormed toward her back, flicking it open with great ease. It was something I had great practice in, so much that I could do it in my sleep. And since Anna didn’t react in panic, she must have believed I actually did in my sleep. </p><p>Still, she gasped as I pulled her bra off with my teeth, leaving her naked under my weight. It was tempting to throw away the illusion and teach her the dangers of teasing a virile man, but playing with her slowly was far too amusing to stop. Instead, I did something I had been wanting to do for a long while. I started kissing her breasts repeatedly. I started softly at first, creating a large circle, before I slowly spiraled in, my kisses lingering longer and longer the closer I got to the center. </p><p>“I can’t believe it,” Anna gasped in shock, still a whisper, but she made no effort to actually pull under my body. Instead, her hand around my shaft quickened further, while her other hand disappeared between her own legs, making herself shiver. </p><p>Just as I was about to bite her nipple, I suddenly stopped and reversed direction, only to shift to her other breast when I finished the first. Her bosom was a treasure, and deserved to be treated as such during our first encounter. </p><p>“Hmm…” Anna moaned as she got closer to her climax, struggling to keep her voice down. I chose that moment to finally assault her nipple, my teeth clamping around just hard enough to trigger a jolt of pleasure. A cry of pleasure escaped her mouth as she pushed me back reflexively, her body trembling helplessly. Since I didn’t want to reveal my real status, I didn’t resist her push, rolling to my back obediently. </p><p>She immediately rolled off the bed, watching me with wide eyes, biting her lips in panic, no doubt thinking that she had finally pushed too hard, but her breathing relaxed when I continued breathing deeply. “That was close,” she sighed, and turned. After that excitement, she would have left, if I hadn’t suddenly put one hand to my chest. </p><p>While still holding her bra… </p><p>“Fuck,” she gasped, the shock enough to crack her aversion toward crassness. She reached and tried to pull it from my fingers, but I held it even tighter, even as I murmured in my ‘sleep’. She stopped soon, a frown on her face. I could have let her win an easy victory, but after her earlier daring, I was feeling curious about her next action. “If I make him relax, maybe he’ll loosen his grasp,” she murmured, her eye once again turning toward my midsection. </p><p>She proved that her surprises weren’t over by rather than moving to the feet area, she climbed to my bed, her slit hovering above my chest, before she leaned down and captured my shaft, her thick lips wrapping around my girth once more, her head bobbing. </p><p>I had no idea why she picked such a difficult position to maintain, though I wasn’t unhappy about it. It presented her freshly shaved pussy just inches away from my lips, still smelling deliciously of her recent climax. I licked my lips in anticipation, trying to decide whether a gentle payback would be too much and would alert her. </p><p>Then, while searching for a better position, she pushed her ass even farther, her wet lips an inch away from my tongue, taking the decision away from me. If she was going to present me such a beautiful gift, who was I to reject, especially when she was the one that climbed to my bed, completely naked. </p><p>A shocked gasp escaped her mouth as my tongue brushed against her entrance, and she pulled back panickedly. I made sure to keep my eyes closed tight, just in case she might notice something amiss. The silence stretched for a while, enough to make me suspect that I had finally pushed her too much, but that thought went away when I felt the presence of warmth inches away once again. Still, I cracked my eyes open only when I felt her lips around my shaft once more. </p><p>Since she was comfortable with the idea of an equal exchange of service, I let my tongue dart out once again. The moan that escaped her mouth was heavenly, especially since her lips were still around my shaft, the vibration adding a new layer to my pleasure. My tongue explored her entrance aggressively, though I didn’t use any complicated trick, as I was still supposed to be asleep. I circled her knob lazily several times, making her moan each time. </p><p>In response, she pushed her hips back more, her bottom smashing hard against my face. Even if I was suffering from a sleep disorder, such a move would have been enough to wake me up, but Anna seemed to miss that fact under the fresh rush of pleasure. I didn’t want to blame her, considering it was the first proper head she received in her whole life. Her hips moved in the response to my tongue beating, grinding her pussy against my face with choppy, forceful movements. Her inexperience made the situation even hotter, especially while her lips did their best to cover my shaft with her mark. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she murmured dazedly when she pulled for a quick breather, the pressure of her hips increasing even further. I was so tempted to sink my fingers to her hips, testing their firmness against her breasts. Pity that I had already pushed too much. I was afraid of spooking her. “Please don’t wake up, Michael. Please…” she gasped before returning to her task, her tongue licking across my length, making me throb in anticipation. I was getting close…</p><p>I didn’t know why, but every passing second, I was getting more and more excited. Maybe it was the tricky nature of our game, or maybe it was watching such a sexy girl slowly shedding her innocent ways through interesting means, but I could feel arousal growing in me, much more than I experienced even when I was spending time with top tier models after a painting session. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, I could feel my arousal growing to a dangerous point. Naturally, I had my pride, and wanted her to climax before I could. Still, even as I was forced to unleash my skills to push her to a climax, I couldn’t help but feel fascinated about just how delicious she tasted. I could spend hours slowly teasing her as she lay on the bed, handcuffed, spread-eagle, and begging for a release. </p><p>And considering this was just the second night of our travel, and we supposedly had twenty-eight nights more, such a scene wasn’t exactly impossible. I just needed to convince her to do stuff she was doing with me when she knew I was awake. Shouldn’t be that hard. </p><p>I was already close to a climax, and my imagination churning interesting scenes one after another didn’t exactly help. To ensure fairness, I let my tongue jump out, exploring the curves of her nether lips aggressively, lapping her juices. Her cries rose louder and louder, but even as I increased the pressure, she made no attempt to pull back, convinced that my delicious service just the reflection of a dream. </p><p>“Oh, yes. Just a bit more,” she moaned as she pulled her head for a fleeting moment before her lips returned around my shaft once more, her head bobbing repeatedly. It was just seconds later I finally exploded, filling her mouth with my seed. Luckily, the taste of my seed proved to be decisive, assisting my tongue-assault and she started shuddering, her juices flowing uncontrollably. She continued to suck my cock, determined to drain me, missing the significance of the mess she left on my face. </p><p>Only after she swallowed the last drop the realization hit her. “Holy hell,” she gasped in shock as she stepped down, her body covered with a delicious sheen of sweat, which made her look ethereal under the gentle illumination of moonlight. She gasped in shock, and reached for the nearest item in her reach, which was her bra. She quickly dried my face with its soft side, which worked sufficiently well. There was nothing she could do about the taste on my tongue, of course, but I doubted whether she even thought about it. She could have licked it off as well, but it wasn’t shocking that she lacked the courage to do so. </p><p>“I can't believe I did that,” she murmured in a horrified fascination as she carefully dried my body, uncaring of her beautiful tits swaying with her every move, tempting my shaft to awaken once more. “I can't believe it. And he still hadn’t wake up. Maybe… It’s not like he’s going to know," she murmured as she looked at my shaft, which was already going back to its erect state. “No, that’s too much,” she finally said, disappointing herself and me at the same time. </p><p>Pity. I was curious how exactly she would top her last action. </p><p>She soon finished her self-appointed task of cleaning, pulled the covers on, and sighed as she watched me. “Maybe the next time,” she murmured as she walked away, pulling the curtains behind. </p><p>In her wake, a smile bloomed on my face. The next time it wasn’t going to be as simple as she assumed…  </p>
