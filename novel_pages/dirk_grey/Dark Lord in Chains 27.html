        <p>As I looked into Aria’s blue eyes, only to find dark, vindictive arousal rather than her usual passive goodness that reminded me of a saint. It put an equally dark smile on my face, as corrupting a hero was always good, and corrupting a heroine, especially in my preferred manner, was much better. I was satisfied by the impression I got, not just because it indicated the progress that overwhelmed my expectations, but also it provided me the perfect angle to finally conquer Emma. </p><p>I wasn’t one to miss such an opportunity. </p><p>“So, you want mercy?” I whispered to Emma’s ear, only to receive an enthusiastic nod, her lips firmly shut to keep her moans in to protect the last sliver of her pride, although unsuccessfully. “Do you think you deserve mercy, my sweet Aria?” </p><p>“She doesn’t,” came the answer immediately, followed by a slap to her inner thigh, soft enough to trigger another moan rather than a cry. I met with her gaze once more, and nodded in approval, only for her to blush thickly despite the aggressive pace she had embraced, showing that her aggressive front was nothing but an enthusiastic veneer. Still, that was more than enough for my purposes, as I didn’t want to lose my little innocent princess. </p><p>“Do you hear that, Emma? Your precious comrade doesn’t believe you deserve mercy, because you’re panting like a whore under the slightest pressure,” I whispered into her ear. “Is this the limits of the famous Elementalist that intimidated armies with her magical flares? Begging for mercy just because of a couple of measly touches?” </p><p>“Bastard,” Emma managed to murmur between moans, only to trigger Aria to quicken her assault. </p><p>“Not the worst I had been called, sweetie,” I said with a genuine chuckle. A thick skin was a requirement if one wanted to become a successful Dark Lord, especially half-assed insults like Emma had just thrown. However, just because her insult failed to awaken an emotional response in me didn’t mean that I was going to let her insult slide without making her pay. Luckily, I didn’t need to change my plan for it, just quicken it a bit, in the most fun way possible. </p><p>“What are you doing?” Emma gasped when she felt my grip tightening around her thighs, only to force her to stand up. </p><p>“Punishing you, of course,” I answered cheerfully, while even Aria slowed down to see what I was doing. They received their answer a few seconds later, when I aligned Emma’s entrance to my shaft, the crown pressing against her entrance. </p><p>“You can’t do that,” Emma gasped. “That’s too much.” </p><p>“I’m not going to do anything,” I said as I shifted my hands, holding her body from sides rather than pushing her up. “It’s your additional punishment. You just need to stay in that position while Aria finishes her task, and then we can discuss business.” </p><p>“What if I can’t stay in this pose?” she asked. As we argued, Aria pulled her hands back, waiting for a resolution.  </p><p>I chuckled. “You’re a smart girl, Emma,” I said, then chuckled. “At least, smart enough to understand the implications of failure. Isn’t it clear?” </p><p>“It is,” Emma stammered, her legs trembling in the realization of the potential. “It is too much,” she declared, though she didn’t try to pull out of my grip. </p><p>“Your call,” I answered her with a sudden change, pulling back my hands, which let her free. “You can just leave.” </p><p>“Really?” she asked, shocked at the sudden change, which was a reaction that Aria shared. “You’ll just let me go.” </p><p>“Of course, it’s not like I forced you to come here and undress. You’re free to leave whenever you wished,” I said, and her hips started to move. Then, I finished my words. “As long as you don’t want any more information about the spies, of course.”</p><p>Her movement stopped immediately. “That’s not fair,” she gasped. </p><p>“Really?” I said mockingly even as I slapped her ass, enjoying her yelp. “In that case, I should immediately offer you a better deal. Because, as a Dark Lord, I pride myself for offering people fair deals, especially the ones that actually ruined years of my efforts just to maintain the status quo.” </p><p>“No need to be snide, Byron, I’m sure she understands,” said Aria, surprising me with her interjection, especially when her smirk was pointing to Emma. An actual attempt at sarcasm. Even if it was the result of the excitement she was feeling at the moment, it was a great development. </p><p>“See, even your princess agrees,” I said, like Aria wasn’t the one that was delivering her punishment, during her current visit as well as the previous one. “So, what is it going to be? Do we stop, or do you dare to take the challenge?” The silence stretched for a moment while I was busy smirking. “You’re a strong girl, Emma. A simple challenge shouldn’t scare you this much. You just need to resist for fifteen minutes. Not a second more.” </p><p>Emma said nothing, but the direction of her hips was sufficient as an answer. Instead of moving away, they took the previous position, her sopping wet entrance touching to the crown of my shaft, ready to be plowed at the slightest mistake. Her silence just completed her challenge. </p><p>“Go ahead, my sweet princess,” I goaded Aria. “Teach her a lesson, and make her share your suffering.” Aria had the slightest flicker on her face as she realized the magnitude of my request, but her confusion only lasted until our eyes met once more. With her submissive personality, a calm look and a gentle smile were all I needed to dispel her doubts. </p><p>She leaned forward, capturing Emma’s nipple between her plump lips, taking another irrevocable step after the loss of her virginity, helping one of her teammates to lose hers. </p><p>Corruption was an interesting concept, every step of the descent suddenly making previously inconceivable actions palatable. Especially a submissive soul like Aria, who instinctively worked to make people around her happy, including me, the poor prisoner that was suffering under the yoke of the empire —if one looked from a lens warped by excessive compassion. Luckily, Aria had one of those lenses. </p><p>Emma moaned as Aria once again started working on her breasts, alternating between kisses and bites just like I had previously applied on her spectacular breasts. Her moans intensified further once Aria’s fingers started to dance over her clit, pushing her steadily toward the climax.</p><p>Unfortunately, even after ten minutes of steady assault of Aria, Emma managed to resist, which was admirable. It was easy to forget by looking at her pretty face that she had to have iron willpower to rise as the foremost Elementalist of the Empire, destroying her rivals through her sheer power on both sides of the alignment spectrum. </p><p>Too bad for her that my challenges were too unfamiliar to allow her to properly tap into her willpower. </p><p>Still, she managed to hold on, even as her wetness intensified under Aria’s insistent fingers, dripping along my shaft, like she was trying to lubricate it for the eventual inevitable ending. Still, as time moved, she held on. </p><p>I decided to join the fray. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said. “Just another couple of minutes, and you’ll win,” I said, informing Emma about the eventual victory. The human mind was a fascinating thing. A well-conditioned person could run for miles and miles, ignoring their exhaustion, but once they realize the closeness of the finish line, the exhaustion shows its maximum impact. </p><p>Just like that, just by being reminded that the finish line was close, I increased the pressure Emma was feeling several times. Her legs trembled in anticipation, but still stood without toppling. There, I decided to use my second trick. It was no different than the first one, a subtle, almost invisible pressure. This time, I waited until Aria was pulling back after a particularly furious assault to breathe, and Emma was busy bracing herself for the next assault. </p><p>I chose the moment between Emma’s two breaths to caress her spine, to a particularly sensitive spot I had discovered during our previous activities, my touch as gentle as a breeze. Already on the edge, that gentle push was all that was needed to trigger an unexpected climax, hitting her like an out-of-control inferno of flames. </p><p>“No,” she gasped in shock as her legs trembled, losing their strength. She still managed to react in time and grabbed Aria’s arm, managing to save herself. I met with Aria’s eyes, and shook my head subtly. </p><p>Aria pulled back her arm, leaving Emma without support. </p><p>With the pressure of her full weight, and her wetness, she easily slid down my shaft, surrendering her virginity in the process. </p><p>“You lose, Emma,” I whispered into her ear even as I grabbed her waist. </p><p>“No,” she repeated. “It can’t be. It’s just a dream.” </p><p>“Really,” I said even as I grabbed her hips and raised her slightly, making her enjoy the friction as her nether lips clamped around my girth tightly. “What kind of dream. A nightmare? Because I don’t think you should be moaning like that during a nightmare.” </p><p>Emma said nothing, because resisting the pleasure brought by the climax was hard enough without the additional waves of pleasure as her body reacted automatically, clinching around my girth, trying to milk me. Emma was another evidence of the dangers of stringing harem members too long left them far too thirsty for actual physical attention. </p><p>As my shaft explored Emma’s depths while accompanied by her melodic cries, her red hair jolting as she jumped up and down. Aria, on the other hand, took a step back, watching what was happening with a shocked expression, only now realizing the significance of her actions. But it was too late. </p><p>Still, it would be an asshole move to neglect her, so I gestured her to come closer. Despite her dazed expression, she did so, and when I started kissing her —without changing the pace of impaling Emma— her realization was awash by a fresh wave of pleasure. “You’re a good girl,” I whispered to her as I pulled back, which made her smile even as I slapped her ass. </p><p>“You’re not,” I continued, this time slapping Emma’s ass, who was split between the anguish of her loss and the new land of pleasure that was open in front of her. “Luckily for you, I have enough time to teach you how to be a good girl.” I slapped again, which triggered another cry of joy. “Understood?” </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned. I was tempted to push her more, to make her call me her lord, or another pretentious title, but Aria made that impossible. Not by any kind of actual resistance, trying to protect her comrade in arms. No, it seemed that she was feeling neglected, because I found myself being buried in her delicious bosom, which prevented me from speaking the best way possible. </p><p>Emma widened her legs as the pleasure invaded more and more parts of her mind, making it easier for her to jump up and down, especially after I grabbed her bottom, boosting her range of motion. Soon, she was able to take most of my length in every single repeat, turning her tits into a delicious pendulum as she jumped up and down —though, not as delicious as the ones I had my face buried in. </p><p>A loud moan escaped Aria’s mouth as I took her nipple between my lips, sucking furiously. Momentarily, distracted, I stopped boosting Emma’s aggressive jumps on my lap. Surprisingly, that didn’t affect her speed or range of motion even the slightest bit, only making her slow down a bit as she had to rely on her trembling legs. </p><p>What a wondrous reaction, my mind raced as I enjoyed Emma’s rhythmic treatment. I would have expected her to rebel even under the current circumstances, even that way was as ineffectual as sitting on my lap passively. Instead, she was jumping up and down aggressively. Clearly, I underestimated the allure of the pleasure, even though I shouldn’t have. After all, hadn’t I seen many people sacrificing both virtue and power to get a flicker of pleasure. </p><p>Why should Emma be any different? </p><p>I alternatively enjoyed Aria’s enthusiastic lips and her perky tits while Emma continued to jump up and down on my lap, almost automatically under the thrall of pleasure, her tunnel getting more used to my girth with every repeat. It was a unique experience to pump Emma’s tight hole from behind, especially as she moved like she had a grudge —whether that misplaced grudge was aimed at me, herself, or Aria, was a mystery. </p><p>It was pure, unadulterated fucking. </p><p>“Oh, no,” Emma moaned soon after, but her tone conveyed anything but distress. Instead, her tone was coated with pleasure, amplifying my enjoyment. “Fuck, you’re tight,” I said, or more accurately, mumbled, as my words were blocked by Aria’s tits once again. In response, Emma grunted absentmindedly, focusing on the enjoyment she was harvesting, both the spies and our bet forgotten. </p><p>I decided to remind her that, as much as I didn’t want to abandon the delicious hug of Aria’s breasts. I grabbed Emma’s hair, her beautiful red hair that fluttered animatedly whenever she cast a strong spell, making everyone recognize her from a distance. I pulled her precious hair hard, forcing her to look at my face. “So, Emma,” I said with a victorious tone. “Tell me, are you enjoying your loss?” </p><p>She didn’t expect to be confronted as she was building toward another climax, so she froze, and her hips came to a stop. Of course, that didn’t prevent her from steadily climbing the stairs of pleasure, because I took where she left off, and started pumping viciously, each hit forcing her hips to rise, only for me to pull her hair to keep her in place. She cried and moaned alternatively, enjoying my treatment. </p><p>However, when she grunted like she was trying to prevent an explosion, only to be accompanied by a sudden tightening of her tunnel, things changed. She climaxed again, this time even more explosively than the previous time which started her unique and enjoyable plight. </p><p>I would have liked to continue slamming into her unaffected, but even I had limits. A sexy redheaded mage tightening around my girth as she climaxed while a blonde princess leaning forward to steal another erotic kiss turned out to be one of those, and I exploded inside Emma, spraying her insides with my seed, conquering her in an even more visceral manner than just stealing her virginity. </p><p>She just moaned helplessly, while my own grunts of pleasure were devoured by Aria’s enthusiastic lips. </p><p>Who said being a prisoner was boring… </p>
