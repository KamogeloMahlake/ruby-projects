    <body>
        <p>Hi everyone, </p><p>As I mentioned before, I will be taking a one-week break from writing every month with five Sundays (essentially, once every three months), and August is one of those months. </p><p>The initial plan was to take the last week of August as a break, but I have been ambushed by an emergency work travel, which ruined my writing plans. So, I will be taking this break this Sunday instead. </p><p>Apologies for the late warning, but the work kind of ambushed me as well. </p><p>Have a nice week, </p><p>Dirk</p>
