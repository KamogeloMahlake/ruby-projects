        <p>I just looked at Carol, not bothering to hide my smirk at our compromising position even as I held onto her back. She shuffled a bit, but didn’t try to pull back from the compromising position. </p><p>However, her expression wasn’t particularly hard to read. She was trying to find an excuse to get away, one that was needed considering she was the architect of our current situation — the fact that she was under the impression that I was the submissive party, sensitive enough to be hurt by a wrong move delayed her even further. </p><p>Amazing. </p><p>I decided to take the initiative. Thanks to her little competition with Nicole, she was already at the edge both mentally and physically, and required one last push. A push that I could deliver in many different ways, but I chose to stay loyal to the theme. </p><p>“Maybe we should separate. I don’t think you want to anger Nicole,” I suggested. </p><p>She stayed silent for a moment, her hesitant expression flickering as she processed the first part, more than ready to take the offer of the first part, then the second part hit her. “Oh. Are you sure you’re not a nature photographer instead?” she asked. </p><p>I did my best to look confused. “Why?” </p><p>“Because, for a fashion photographer, you don’t seem to know exactly how women work,” she said. I opened my answer, but I didn’t bother coming up with an answer, not when she rose to seal my lips with hers. </p><p>Making her claims that I didn’t know about how women worked absurdly. She would soon realize that as well as I put a practical display of my abilities. But, not. Immediately. For a while, I let Carol lead, her arrogance delicious as she did her best to dominate the kiss, but lacking the necessary experience to do so. </p><p>Just from that kiss, I could have pegged her as one of those rich kids that were desperate to prove they deserved their richness by spending all the time that was left of their social obligations studying — though, leaving quite a bit of time for yoga as well, as I added as I cupped her ass once again, this time much more aggressively. </p><p>We kissed for a while as I led us toward a wall, searching for a surface to properly ravish her. It was not exactly needed, but her every movement was shouting that it had been a while since she had the experience. </p><p>And it would be remiss of me if I didn’t make her return to the field memorable. </p><p>“Wow, you can get really heated once you start, right —” she started, only to yelp as I pushed her panties to the side, making her realize I had already shed my boxers while I brought her against the wall. “Oh,” she whispered, clearly having a last-minute panic. </p><p>Luckily, that was an easy barrier to pass. “We can stop if you’re scared,” I said, doing my best to look genuinely concerned rather than teasing, which was a tough call. </p><p>“Nonsense. Me, scared,” she growled, happily embracing her competitive anger rather than her concerns — like the fact that she was exposed in a warehouse, or about to get fucked by a man she had met just an hour ago. </p><p>And, sank down aggressively. </p><p>Not the best choice, though, thankfully, our long photoshoot was excellent foreplay, making it merely momentarily uncomfortable rather than actually painful. “Oh, I didn’t realize you were this … big,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, you’re barely halfway there,” I said even as I shifted my hands slightly, pinning her against the wall. “Do you want me to properly stretch you so Nicole doesn’t mock you when she arrives?” </p><p>This time, it finally clicked with her that her chosen field of competition was rather absurd. And, if I was reading the realization of her beautiful eyes accurately, she also realized that I wasn’t just an innocent submissive somehow being torn into two. </p><p>“Oh, why don’t you help me solve it,” she whispered sweetly as her legs tightened, showing that I might have overestimated her a bit. It seemed that she was still missing that second part. </p><p>She pushed herself down a bit more, her moan filled with equal amounts of desire and strain, and I adjusted my assessment slightly. It wasn’t that I overestimated her intelligence, but underestimated her arousal. </p><p>After all, it wasn’t only men who lost their rationality in the throes of passion. </p><p>Carol pushed herself down, then up again, her legs tightening around my waist for leverage as she pushed herself down, doing her best to contain her moans as she pushed herself to the limit, strain replacing with pleasure with the passage with each second. </p><p>And, as her pleasure reached to the surface, I decided it was enough playing. I started to move my hips, first just matching her movement, but then slowly taking the lead. In a way, it was like dancing, a subtle shift, and instead of me following her lead, she followed mine. </p><p>Too lost in pleasure to miss its significance.</p><p>At first. </p><p>As my hips got faster and faster, I was soon drilling her against the wall. She was just accepting that invasion at first, moaning louder and louder as I turned her into a beautiful ornament against the wall. The only thing that I pitied was that I didn’t have my camera to immortalize the contortions on her beautiful face as the orgasm hit her, quicker than I thought to be possible. </p><p>I let her recover for a moment, afraid that her first orgasm after a while would send her unconscious. Which would have been a pity considering I still had one more plan for her before we left. </p><p>However, as her orgasm faded, clarity returned. “Y-you bastard,” she gasped. </p><p>“Oh, that’s a new one,” I said, teasing her openly. </p><p>“Y-you knew exactly what was going on. You tricked me!” </p><p>“Oh, how exactly I did do that? By letting you act as you wished? By asking whether you’re afraid of Nicole?” I asked, deliberately vocalizing the situation to make it sound more absurd than it actually was. </p><p>She opened her mouth to answer, but no words came out as she realized it wasn’t exactly defensive. After all, acting submissive and weak to her advances didn’t sound nice. </p><p>I chuckled. “Does that mean you want to stop just after warmup,” I said. </p><p>“W-warm up?” she whispered, no doubt trying to match those words with what she experienced. “T-that was the best orgasm of my life, and you claim that it’s a warm-up,” she whispered, before blushing wildly. </p><p>Either she stayed away from the touch of the others even longer than I realized, or she had some really disappointing partners. Not that I wanted to delve it right at this moment to ruin the mood. It was hardly a priority. </p><p>“Since it was the best, should I assume you don’t need another?” I asked instead, watching her expression dance. Shame, arousal, desire, hesitation…</p><p>In the end, she just whispered a word. “P-please,” she whispered. </p><p>“As you wish, milady,” I answered with a deliberate exaggeration, acting like a gentleman, one that contrasted greatly with my next move.</p><p>I let her step on the ground, but only to flip her before I pressed her against the wall again I slipped inside her, this time from behind, impaling her hard. </p><p>This time, there was no holding back her moans. Pinned against the wall, she didn’t put the slightest resistance as fucked her hard — not as hard as I could go, but still a touch harder than could handle. </p><p>Her moans rose unbidden, echoing in the empty warehouse excellently. </p><p>I looked around, searching for Nicole. There was no chance she didn’t hear what was going on, and I knew that, after everything, she wouldn’t go away … but also she wouldn’t dare to come in. </p><p>Then, I saw her in a corner, peeking in a way she thought to be hidden. I thought about calling her, but after a moment, I decided it would be too much too soon. She was still unfamiliar with the concept, and even in the earlier confrontation, she barely managed to hold on with all my support. </p><p>As much as it disappointed me to admit, she wasn’t ready for a threesome yet. </p><p>I turned my attention to Carol, drilling her aggressively against the wall, enjoying her howls as she reached a new high of pleasure. “I … I’m splitting apart,” she moaned.  </p><p>“Does it mean I need to slow down?” I asked. </p><p>“No!” she cried in desperation and delirium. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said I tightened my grip before I truly loosened my assault, relentlessly fucking her even as I grabbed her elegantly cut shoulder-length hair, my other hand still on her hips.</p><p>I pulled at the last second, covering her ass with my seed while she moaned and gasped. She was at the edge already. </p><p>“I think that marks the end of our site visit,,” I said I chuckled while she fell on her knees, breathing desperately to control herself. “Now, you can send the documents to my email once completed,” I said, enjoying the panic on her face. “Or, you can drop me a message and I can pick them up from your home. Whichever you prefer,” I said as I leaned forward, and left a soft kiss on her cheek. </p><p>She said nothing as she watched me dress, and I didn’t either, happy to leave the ball on her court. </p><p>Especially since I had no doubt about what her choice would be. </p><p>“So, did you enjoy the show?” I asked once I met with Nicole in the corridor, only for her to blush wildly, almost as much as she did during our first meeting. </p><p>I decided not to push her too much and let her process her new experience. </p><p>I still cupped her beautiful ass as we walked, of course. After all, I had my limits, and not taking her in the backseat was already pushing them. She needed time….</p><p>And I needed to work. </p>
