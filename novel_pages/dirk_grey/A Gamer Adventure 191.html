        <p>I couldn’t help but smile in anticipation as I looked down at the caramel beauty in front of me, her legs parting readily as she pushed forward, more than happy with the punishment she was about to receive. </p><p>Not that I blamed her. Considering some of our earlier encounters in our relationship, it could be hardly considered a punishment, but I neither had the time nor the inclination to punish her for real, especially with the Princess’ team waiting on the edge, waiting to latch on to the opportunity to actually convert her to their side. </p><p>I was confident in preventing that, of course, but that was under the condition that I was around to intervene — a fact that I could no longer take as a given considering the recent chain of events. I couldn’t guarantee that I would be around, and it was for the better not to leave Oeyne’s vulnerable to their political predations.  </p><p>Of course, there was another, more primal, reason for my decision. It was hard to deny having such a beautiful and accomplished woman in front of me, parting her legs obediently to receive her ‘punishment’. </p><p>I couldn’t help but lean forward further and bite her shoulder, leaving a soft mark — one that I made permanent with a little application of a healing spell by modifying a scar-removal spell — to underline my ownership. </p><p>“You’re mine,” I growled as I grabbed her hips and impaled her, earning a loud moan. There was not a little bit of gentleness in my push, but she clearly didn’t mind that the slightest of her moan was any indicator. </p><p>Or the notification I just received, the numbers working excellently to show the depth of her pleasure. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 41%] </p><p>Meanwhile, my hands tightened around her waist, enjoying the feeling of her supple skin while her back arched under the aggressive invasion, her body melding against my transmission. </p><p>Yet, just because I decided not to punish her didn’t mean that I wouldn’t use the opportunity to drive my message deeper. “So, tell me, what was your biggest mistake,” I asked. </p><p>“Losing the game —“ she started, only to be interrupted by a slap to her beautiful breast, making it jiggle erotically, which was further enhanced by her beautiful moan. </p><p>“No, it wasn’t that. Try again.” </p><p>The pleasure invaded her body after my spank, but I was happy to see that, behind that, a thoughtful expression appeared as she considered my question again. “Betting too much —“ she started, only to receive another spank, this time twisting her nipple in the process. </p><p>After the twist, it took a while for her moans to subside, her body tensing as the pleasure reached a level that would have triggered an explosion if it wasn’t for the spell that kept her on the edge. </p><p>I kept that spell ongoing, as it was the only thing that underlined the sense of punishment. </p><p>Even though it came with a reward at the end. </p><p>“Try again, but this time, try to think based on my warnings.” </p><p>She paused for a long while, trying to think, which didn’t get any easier with the steady rhythm of my hips invading her core repeatedly. “P-playing with them,” she managed to stammer after a while, her hesitant tone interrupted by moans, making it even harder for her to answer. </p><p>I leaned forward, softly kissing the bite mark that I left earlier on her shoulder, then moving to kiss her neck. “Good work,” I whispered into her ear. I rose back, once again focusing on the steady movement of my hips. “Don’t forget that they are not our allies, and they have nebulous objectives. The less involved you get with them, the better.” </p><p>“But… But what if they ask me for more.” </p><p>“Tell that the headmistress has an urgent request from you, and start working on the most complicated, the most nebulous research project you have, and say that you’re under orders not to stop for anything except helping me forge the item they need once my research is complete.” </p><p>“But…” she gasped in shock. “Faking an order from the headmistress is —“ she started, only to be interrupted by another slap to her beautiful breast, this time hard enough to leave a mark. </p><p>“Who do you think you’re talking with. If I say the headmistress would send an order, it means that she’ll send an order. No question about that.” </p><p>As I talked, I let my hands wander, climbing up until they arrived at her spectacular globes. But this time, rather than visiting for a flash, they stayed on their glorious peaks, digging down harshly. </p><p>She moaned as I kneaded her tits aggressively, her moans rising even more as her tunnels tightened, extracting a moan from me as well. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 47%]</p><p>“Then, the next question. Tell me everything that happened during the game, particularly about the Princess’ handmaid. First, what was her name?” </p><p>“D-Delia,” Oeyne said. Unfortunately, with their spectacular ability to change their looks, it was impossible for me to be sure whether what Oeyne said was accurate or she had been in disguise. Yet, it needed to be asked before going to the next stage. </p><p>“Good, now, tell me everything you can remember about what Delia said and did,” I added. Her expression of shock was understandable. While she had an impressive memory thanks to her stats and could remember her actions in great detail even if she hadn’t paid much attention to them during the game, her current position wasn’t exactly conducive for accurate recall. </p><p>Luckily, my aim was not to listen to her observations but to add another layer of punishment to our game. Unfortunately, with their ability to modify their skills, anything Oeyne managed to notice would have been under subject. </p><p>Yet, it worked wonderfully to increase her strain even more, with the added benefit of exerting my power over her even more, triggering her submissive nature. </p><p>I focused on her body as she talked, squeezing and kneading her beautiful breasts while my hips worked steadily into her core. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 50% - Second Stage Completed +10000 Exp]</p><p>[New Perk: Mana Regeneration]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>It was always nice to receive another instance for mana regeneration, as if my recent experiences taught me anything, there was no such thing as too much mana. </p><p>Meanwhile, Oeyne was gasping in shock for a different reason. “A-another achievement,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Sweetie, when you’re with me, a measly achievement is the least of your rewards,” I answered as I leaned forward, interrupting her next words by pressing my lips against her busty chest, making her moan beautifully in the process. </p><p>With her arousal unable to come to full fruition thanks to my spell, her moans were getting more and more delirious. I smirked, but not just due to her amazing moans. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 55%]</p><p>It was amazing to see her passing another milestone without a skip, though I had a feeling that our earlier discussion played a significant role in increasing her trust in me, which, in turn, allowed her companion's progress to improve even further. </p><p>Amazing achievement. </p><p>I grabbed her tight yet bountiful ass, my fingers encasing her bubble butt in my merciless grip. She let out a beautiful gasp while I explored every single inch of her beautiful breasts with my tongue, each brush making her moan even harder. </p><p>“So, Oeyne,” I whispered when I pulled back for a breather, interrupting her chain moans. “Tell me. Are you enjoying this?” </p><p>Her answer was never in doubt. “Yes!” she cried loudly, her voice echoing against the walls, strong enough to deafen a weaker man. And, more importantly, it wasn’t the only action she displayed that had the potential to injure a weaker man. Her legs wrapped around my waist, carelessly applying her strength as she pulled me deeper, one that showed her growing arousal. </p><p>Not that I needed any other sign, not with the way arousal was dancing behind her lovely brown eyes… </p><p>“Do you think you earned a climax,” I asked, unable to reject the temptation of growing arousal? </p><p>“Y-yes,” she gasped in answer, though her usual confidence replaced by a hesitant tremble, successfully giving an aura of begging — one that was wrapped in a nice erotic package. </p><p>“How daring,” I growled, giving a menacing tone, one that made her gasp in fear, a fear that had absolutely no impact on her arousal. I replaced that with a smirk soon. “Luckily for you, you deserve it,” I told her even as I leaned forward to twist her nipple, while simultaneously canceling the spell that was keeping her on the edge. </p><p>The resulting explosion of moans and fluids was spectacular, especially with the speed she tightened around me, finally breaking my ability to reject the temptation of arousal, filling her… </p><p>Of course, that was not the end, not when I had been receiving such incredible benefits from our little dance. I let her catch her breath before we started again. For me, it was amazing from both perspectives, watching her moans intensify. </p><p>Though, as much as I loved her toned caramel legs wrapped around me, it wasn’t the reason I was pushing her without break despite having so many things to deal with — including a dragon to interrogate. </p><p>The answer popped into my sight after almost three hours of intense lovemaking… </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 75% - Second Stage Completed +15000 Exp]</p><p>[New Perk: Skill Share]</p><p>It was good timing, because, under the endless rush of pleasure, Oeyne was on the edge of collapse already, and the fresh pleasure broke her resistance. “A…another perk,” she gasped. “This time, even stronger.” </p><p>“I know, sweetie. I want you to be stronger in case you face a threat,” I added before leaning forward and stealing a kiss. “Now, why don’t you take a nap while I go and work. And don’t forget to stay away from the princess’ team, and don’t agree to anything before talking to me.” </p><p>“A-as you wish,” she murmured. “A nap wouldn’t be…” she added, unable to finish her sentence before the exhaustion caught up with her. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
