        <p>Teasing her further that might not be the smartest choice considering our living conditions for the next month, but after getting a glimpse of her breasts through her sweaty t-shirt, the temptation was too thick to deny. So, instead of pushing the shower door hard to make sure it closed properly, I let it stay cracked, already turning my back when it reached. </p><p>I immediately turned my back, afraid that she would realize I had left the door open intentionally, and get scared. While I removed my sweaty shorts and underwear, my eyes were dancing in the room, hoping to find a reflective surface I could watch the door without being caught, if she gathers the courage to actually peek inside. </p><p>I had already turned on the water, waiting for it to get hot when she did her first pass, but disappearing as quickly as she appeared. I sighed in disappointment as I stepped under the shower, enjoying the blast of water. Maybe I had overestimated the temptation of seeing my body naked, which, I had to admit, was kind of a bummer. I was proud of my body. I had spent a lot of time sculpting it to perfection, but apparently, even for a nerdy little girl, it wasn’t enough to risk the shame of being caught. </p><p>However, that funk didn’t last long, not when I noticed her passing in front of the door twice in very quick succession, each time, her steps getting slower. There was no reason for her to walk around that much, I realized with a smirk, and decided to give her an even better show, though I also wanted to watch her reaction. Pity the metal surface I was using for reflection wasn’t as good. I needed a better excuse to watch her, and also make her watch without fear. </p><p>After a moment of consideration, I came with the perfect excuse. The shampoo. It was my best bet to convince her that I can’t see anything, especially if I turn off the water as well. I quickly shampooed my hair, thick enough to make opening my eyes really ill-advised. Luckily, I did manage to crack it without the pain. I closed the water, left the bubbles on my face, and reached for the bottle of shower gel instead, slowly soaping the rest of my body. The moment was excited enough to make me stand in full-mast, though. </p><p>I was subtly watching the entrance to see whether she would gather sufficient courage to take the step, but that turned out to be unnecessary in terms of observation. The moment she appeared in the doorway, she alerted me to her presence with a soft gasp, a reaction that did wonders to soothe my wounded ego. She panicked at her own reaction, and I acted like I hadn’t noticed her reaction, focusing on the immediate pressure of the moment instead. </p><p>Still, seeing my apparent obliviousness, she decided to stay. Her expression of hesitant arousal was enough to make my shaft even harder, even when she hovered around the corner, ready to dash away any moment; something she appreciated if her focused gaze to my midsection was any indicator. </p><p>Keeping myself from laughing was a challenge, but not as hard as actually keeping myself from starting to playing with myself. The former, I resisted easily, but the latter, I only managed to resist for a minute before I put my hand on my shaft and started playing with myself. It was a way to pay her back, I decided. After all, I spent twenty minutes watching her playing with herself —though I didn’t have the best vantage due to the presence of that inconvenient curtain. </p><p>However, I soon learned that the trick with the curtain wasn’t the only surprise Anna had for me. As she watched me jacking off slowly, she first pressed her legs together, rubbing furiously. Soon, however, she didn’t stay limited to that, and one of her hands slipped under her t-shirt, riding up and pushing the t-shirt up along, revealing her panties —which were as boring as I imagined them to be— and her beautiful stomach that was fitter to a cheerleader than the class nerd. </p><p>Her hand continued to rise up, until her fingers started playing with her breasts under her t-shirt, occasionally pushing it enough to give a glimpse of the underside of her boobs. I was so tempted to invite her to shower, unfortunately, I knew that it would have sent her running away immediately. </p><p>Just as I was sure that it couldn’t be better than getting a partial glimpse of her breasts, her hand in her panties, forcing them to bulge as they tried to accommodate for her presence, dancing furiously. It was a good view, but I decided to throw a curveball to my little voyeur’s plan. I turned my back and turned on the water once more, blasting the shampoo and the soap away. </p><p>As I enjoyed the warmth of the shower once more, I could hear her sliding away with a panicked gasp, something I once again ignored. Instead, I finished my shower, wrapped a thin towel around my waist, and left the shower. Anna was once again on the couch she was using as a bed, covered with her blanket, her e-book reader in hand. </p><p>“Shower is free,” I said, walking toward my bed, still glistening after the shower. </p><p>“Noted,” she answered, giving her best attempt to look engrossed in her book, which impressed me since it was a half-decent effort. </p><p>I said nothing else until I arrived at the separator that was supposed to be my room. I grabbed it, pulled it halfway, then suddenly, I decided to add one last amusing detail to mess with her further, mostly to see how she would react. “I’m going to take an early night, because I want to be awake for the first rays of the morning to do some painting,” I explained, and she used that as an opportunity to raise her gaze, once again ogling my muscles. “I want to apologize for the alarm preemptively, because I’m a really heavy sleeper,” I said, acting like I hadn’t noticed her eyes slipping toward my abs, particularly the exact area where my towel ended… </p><p>“N-noted,” she repeated, this time unable to keep herself stammering. I gave her one last smile and pulled the screen close, once again failing to close it completely. This time, I left a small opening that would allow me to see the room if I watched from the small mirror on my bedside, wondering whether she would be brave —or perverted— enough to act on my supposed heavy sleeping… </p><p>She had walked into the shower, fully dressed, and carrying some extra clothes, as I lay to my bed, closing my eyes. What I said to her, except my supposed inability to wake up easily, was true, after all. I needed to wake up early to catch the morning light. </p><p>Teasing her was amusing, but I was here to make myself a better painter. </p><p>So, I closed my eyes, trying to sleep despite the sound of the water blasting in the shower, and things got even more challenging when she moaned softly, no doubt assuming that the sound of the shower was enough to conceal it —a rather inaccurate assumption that I had no intention of correcting. </p><p>When she finally finished with her shower, I was yet to fell asleep, so I opened my eyes to watch her through the mirror. So, through my cracked eyes, I watched her as she pushed her head out, checking something. “Michael, can I ask you something?” she said in a soft tone, almost a whisper, and I let it go unanswered. “Michael,” she repeated a couple of times, each time a bit louder, but spaces in between. </p><p>I smiled in amusement as I realized what she was doing. She was checking whether my sleep was as deep as I had implied. For a nerd, she was really a little dirty girl. </p><p>She took a deep breath after her repeated attempts provided no result —or provided the exact result she had been expecting— and her head disappeared back in the shower. I kept my eyes open, still watching her from the reflection, glad that my partition was too dark for her to notice my gaze even if she had noticed the conveniently-placed mirror. </p><p>Then, she stepped out of the shower. </p><p>It took a great deal of effort from my end not to react, because she was wearing nothing more than a small towel as well, a towel that was wrapped around her waist, leaving her breasts naked, still glistening after the shower. I could myself growing harder even as she took a step forward, her tits jiggling perfectly as she finally stepped out of my field of vision. </p><p>How the hell she failed to get herself a boyfriend with that body was a mystery. </p><p>I cursed myself for peeking, not because I felt guilty, but because after getting that glimpse, listening to the way the fabric rustled against her voluptuous body was pure torture. Then, she passed through my field of view once again, this time wearing her underwear. Like her normal clothes, her underwear was the most boring it could be, white panties wide enough to cover her amazing ass and an equally large beige bra that managed to cover her breasts. Still, despite that, she was an arousing sight. </p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to catch some sleep, which was a struggle after the rush of seeing her half-naked. Still, after half an hour, it seemed like I was about to succeed. The darkness slowly crept in, and I was about to fall asleep, when I heard the distinctive sound of a curtain moving. The curtain was responsible for separating my bed from the rest of the RV. </p><p>I kept my eyes closed determinedly, curious what my naughty little guest had in mind. I had to admit, when I felt my covers slowly sliding to the side, I was rather surprised with her reaction, my shaft reacting to the idea immediately. </p><p>Curiosity was a dangerous emotion, and I was feeling very curious about what she had in mind, in particular, her limits. I kept my eyes closed as the covers slid lower, revealing my stomach. Only after they passed the critical point, revealing my shaft to her —and earning a rather loud gasp— I cracked my eyes open slightly to watch her.</p><p>Whatever I had in mind, she managed to surprise me greatly with her body illuminated by the dim light coming from behind, giving an ethereal quality to her body. She was still wearing her underwear, and only her underwear. Even then, it couldn’t be classified as wearing. It was more accurate to say that her underwear was on her body. Her panties were around one of her thighs, bunched up, giving me a fleeting glimpse of her entrance before she covered it with her hand, cutting my view —not that I was dissatisfied by it when it started dancing at her entrance. </p><p>Her bra was in a similar state of uselessness. It was already hooked, dangling uselessly from one arm, leaving her tits naked for my viewing pleasure. Pity that I couldn’t get more than a glimpse without alerting her. Despite playing with herself, she was quite tense, aware of the risk she was taking —but unaware that she had been caught long ago. </p><p>I continue to lay silently, not making a peep, giving her confidence that my claim about being a heavy sleeper was correct. </p><p>However, I realized that I might have been too convincing, I decided when I felt something being wrapped around my shaft. Once again, I decided to take the risk and peep a bit, catching the beautiful figure of Anna even closer, but luckily, turned sideways, removing the risk of getting caught as I examined her beautiful ass and her smooth back. </p><p>Rejecting the temptation to slap her ass to test its potential to jiggle was difficult, especially when her hand started moving up and down around my shaft, making me enjoy her clumsy attempts of handjob —but made even more erotic by that reason. The fact that it was clearly her first time touching a cock, and she was horny enough to do that in the middle of the night, completely naked and playing with herself, made the situation even more exciting. </p><p>I was tempted to inform her that her forays hadn’t been as secretive as she had assumed, curious about her reaction. But watching her fumble while she thought herself to be sneaky was too amusing to actually miss. I continued watching the way her ass jiggled whenever her jolts of pleasure got too much, her movements making me closer to the climax. </p><p>Almost ten minutes passed like that, enough time for even her unskilled attempts at handjob to push me closer to the edge. But then, she decided to surprise me even more. When she pulled her hand away from my shaft and cupped her own breasts —the other still carefully teasing her own clit-- I felt disappointed. </p><p>Then, she leaned forward, her lips already parted open, and captured the crown of my shaft. She started moving up and down, the fumbling of her fingers replaced by the fumbling of her tongue, equally unskilled, but even more erotic. I was already close to the edge, and her lips allowed me to cover the distance. </p><p>The panicked yelp she let out when I started spraying into her mouth was delicious. She pulled back in panic, but it only resulted with her receiving another blast on her face, while a third spread around the room. She looked around panicked, then noticed her bra, but rather than trying to pull it away, she chose to lean with that, receiving another load to her breasts before she could wrap her bra around my shaft, absorbing the rest.</p><p>Holding my laughter at her panicked expression while she examined my ruined covers was a challenge, but luckily, I managed to hold. She stood frozen, looking at the stained sheet and my body. She looked like a hungover girl who had woken up in a cell, her memories returning slowly. </p><p>“Damn, damn, damn…” she murmured to herself panickedly as the implications of her actions slowly pushed themselves in her mind. She looked around, until she saw the wet wipes that were sitting on the kitchen table. She dashed to them, pulling a bunch generously before running back. </p><p>I was very satisfied with that particular action, because she was still naked, each step making her deliciously tight body jiggle beautifully. How I wished to dig my fingers into her breasts, testing their firmness firsthand, but unfortunately, that wasn’t a viable option, not if I didn’t want to scare her off. </p><p>I wanted to see just how far she would go when she thought to be unobserved. </p><p>She reached down, too focused on the stains on the covers to notice the amazing show she was providing, her concentration impenetrable. Her determination faded somewhat when it came to clean my body, however, clearly considering the relative risks of me waking up with the clear signs of an ‘accident’ the night before versus the depth of my sleep and the possibility of it sustaining the touch of a wet napkin. </p><p>The way she rocked back and forth as she tried to decide, biting her lips, would have been cute if it wasn’t for her nakedness. Instead, it was intensely erotic, enough to make my cock twitch in enthusiasm, slowly rising for a second round. She watched that development with rapt attention. For a moment, I hoped that she was going for a second round, but when her fingers touched my shaft once more, our skin was separated by a wet napkin. </p><p>Pity, I thought as I watched her leave after finishing cleaning the mess she created, and pulled my curtains close. Not that I was feeling sad. It was just the first night of a month-long journey. </p><p>I couldn’t wait for her next surprise… </p>
