        <title>Dominating the Boss 31</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Natalie might be surprised by the surprise inclusion of the handcuffs, but that didn’t prevent her from continuing to display an amazing performance around my girth as she went down, barely needing her girlfriend’s assistance to do so. </p><p>That didn’t stop Jenny from pushing her head down, not when she was this committed to dominating her girlfriend. </p><p>The next push she gave left Natalie helplessly skewered on my shaft as she gagged, proving that just because Natalie was showing an incredible improvement in the art of deep-throating didn’t mean she couldn’t attain even higher achievements with the assistance of her lovely girlfriend. </p><p>I would have loved to continue faking sleep, to see just how far Jenny was willing to push during our current situation, but my state of sleeping was getting incredibly unbelievable as Jenny pushed Natalie to her limits, so I made a show of waking up. </p><p>“Wow,” I gasped in fake amusement the moment I opened my eyes, though slurring words just slightly to sell a groggy impression. “It’s rare to wake up to a reality that’s better than a beautiful dream,” I said as I let my gaze dance over their naked bodies before I fixed my gaze on Natalie, the woman who had the great honor of being my superior at work, at least officially. “Good to see you, boss. What a nice morning, right?” </p><p>The fire in her gaze told me that she had several select statements against my mocking tone, but those could hardly be delivered with the impediment in her throat. </p><p>“I’m sure she agrees,” Jenny said as a smile covered her beautiful face, though that didn’t stop her from pushing her down more. </p><p>“I’m sure she does,” I repeated while I Natalie’s head. “But I can take over the task of helping her, why don’t you come here and give me a good morning kiss.” </p><p>“Good idea,” Jenny said as she pulled back and climbed on the bed. While she slowly moved closer, I gazed down Natalie’s eyes, enjoying the sharp jealousy dancing in her eyes — but after three months of continuous exposure, that jealousy was just an aspect of our relationship, one that she was developing a taste for. </p><p>That aspect of her arousal hardly disappeared when Jenny leaned and delivered a slow, lingering kiss on my lips. “Delicious,” I murmured as Jenny pulled back, the small blush giving her face an ethereal quality. “Now, why don’t you give one to Natalie as well. We don’t want her to feel neglected, do we?” </p><p>“Sure, are you going to let her pull back?” she asked. </p><p>“No,” I answered with a smirk. “But she still has more lips, ones that aren’t currently occupied, right?” </p><p>A beautiful pearl of laughter escaped from her mouth and exploded in the room. “You’re right,” Jenny said. </p><p>While Jenny traveled the same road, I turned my gaze back to Natalie, whose face was filled with anger and relief. </p><p>Relief because the idea of being treated from both sides clearly attracted her, and anger because, even at the moment, she hated that I was the one that allowed her to have pleasure, and could have chosen a path that would torture her on the edge. </p><p>While Natalie was busy processing the complicated nature of our relationship, Jenny arrived at her destination, her hands landing on Natalie’s thighs, making her widen her legs. Natalie complied quickly to the touch of her lover, her eyes firmly shut at the moment Jenny’s tongue touched her wet slit. </p><p>Jenny stayed there, teasing Natalie, aggressively as well if their quickening squirming was any indicator. As the pleasure hit, Natalie’s resistance to her assisted blowjob disappeared even more, obeying my every push enthusiastically. </p><p>I wondered whether it was the pleasure making her lose control, or if she was trying to pay me back for triggering Jenny’s involvement. Either way, the tight grip on her throat was certainly spectacular. </p><p>I watched as Jenny’s small, dainty hands slipped and danced on her thighs before landing on her perky ass, squeezing her butt cheeks — surprisingly, hard enough to leave her mark. Jenny was definitely feeling like playing the dominant side today. Since it was a rare occurrence, I decided to enjoy it fully, and while Natalie’s eyes closed and Jenny rose for a breather, I made a gesture for a slap. </p><p>Jenny was a smart girl, and was quick to get what I meant. Her hand floated up for a moment, yet, rather than landing down, it stayed motionless for a moment, while her gaze found mine, showing hesitation. Clearly, she wasn’t feeling too confident in her newly adapted dominant role. </p><p>Yet, I caught her gaze and nodded, prompting her to take action. My silent prompting proved to be sufficient for her to overcome her earlier decision, and her hand landed, the sound of a slap exploding in the room. </p><p>Natalie tried to let out a gasp, but it was terminated before it could form. Her throat was occupied with more important tasks, but her widened eyes reflected her shock successfully. </p><p>These last few months had taught Natalie a lot about being the submissive party, but being dominated by her otherwise sweet girlfriend was clearly a different experience than accepting my more confident brand of dominance. Her eyes widened even further Jenny repeated her spank, her legs trembling. </p><p>Yet, despite the shock, Natalie didn’t fight the sensation, accepting Jenny’s changing attitude with a smoothness that surprised me — but maybe being handcuffed prepared her for that. </p><p>When I let her pull back for a breather, she limited herself to moaning and gasping, showing Jenny just how much she had been enjoying the sudden change of treatment. Jenny responded by spanking her again, this time even harder, eliciting a painful cry. </p><p>“Did I do it too hard?” Jenny asked. Natalie opened her mouth to answer, but I had no intention of allowing her to do so. I pulled her down before she could answer and turned to Jenny. </p><p>“First rule of spanking fun, no need to stop without a safe word,” I explained, my smirk widening. “That’s the fun part of it.” </p><p>Jenny smiled at my explanation, then her hand landed on Natalie’s ass once again. Natalie’s shoulders tightened as she tried to balance herself on the bed, with her legs starting to tremble under the rush of pleasure.  </p><p>Yet, when Jenny changed her pace and returned to Natalie’s nether lips, her tongue dancing against her softness, it triggered a climax in Natalie, making her let out a string of moans — moans that were unfortunately silenced with my shaft in her throat. </p><p>In a rare merciful moment, I allowed her to pull back, treating us to the latter half of her beautiful moans as her orgasm ravaged her body, making her shake badly. </p><p>Though, just because I let her pull back didn’t mean that I wouldn’t tease her. As her back arched, her position displayed her tits excellently. I was quick to cover them with my hands, my fingers circling her fingers and pinching them. Her entire body shook at the invasion, the pleasure pushing her hard enough to unbalance her. And with her hands locked, she toppled forward. </p><p>“Someone needs a little help,” I said with a chuckle and pulled her to my lap, skewering her with my shaft, earning a beautiful moan in the process, her hands still tied behind. Jenny threw a jealous glare, but that didn’t prevent her from sitting on the side of the bed, her legs wide, her fingers dancing around her knob to enjoy the show. </p><p>Since Jenny wanted to watch, I decided to give a proper show. I tightened my hold around her body and pushed even deeper, making Natalie moan more and more. </p><p>“Faster,” she gasped, showing that her earlier orgasm was not even close to satisfying her. I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for her handcuffs, her hands would have been digging into my shoulders to push herself even deeper. </p><p>I was too familiar with the level of passion Natalie liked the display once she started going… </p><p>Natalie wasn’t the only one that started breathing even harder. Jenny gasped and moaned, her fingers disappearing deeper and deeper into her core. </p><p>I let my hands drift down, squeezing Natalie’s hips for the extra leverage I needed as I plunged deeper into her, fucking her fast and hard, giving her the perfect treatment she needed after a long and exhausting flight. </p><p>“Pity we didn’t fly together,” I whispered into her ear even as I plunged, making sure to speak soft enough to avoid Jenny’s attention. “Because, we had a familiar stewardess.” </p><p>“T-that girl,” Natalie murmured back, not as effective as my whisper. She was lucky that Jenny was moaning loud enough to deafen herself. </p><p>“Yes, Tanya,” I whispered. “And she was quite fun, but she mentioned she missed you. But, hopefully, we will get her on the way back as well.” </p><p>“H-hopefully,” Natalie managed to gasp as her hips danced and crawled. Then, the urgency of the pleasure overwhelmed any distant fantasy that might or might not include the participation of a cute blonde in an exciting location, and Natalie started crying with a more primal need. “Harder, harder.” </p><p>“Your wishes, my order, boss,” I whispered as I tightened my grip even further before pushing her down, and launching an aggressive assault into her core, my full weight behind my strokes as the sound of clapping exploded in the room. </p><p>She gasped continuously, her toes curling up and her feet stretching out. I watched in a primal satisfaction as her head tilted back and her eyes rolled, her moans exploding without cohesion. She tightened around my cock, her entire body quivering.</p><p>I used the opportunity to grab her thighs and fuck her as fast as I could manage. Combined with her tightness, it didn’t take long for me to explode in her, filling her to the brim. </p><p>Natalie trembled helplessly as I grabbed and lay her on the bed, then leaned forward to Jenny and stole a quick kiss. “I think that’s enough for morning fun,” I whispered as I pulled back. “I’m going to have a quick breakfast and maybe a swim. And, it’ll leave you two alone to have some private fun.” </p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Jenny murmured with an uncharacteristic enthusiasm as she looked at Natalie, still in handcuffs. She was clearly enthusiastic about the opportunity to reverse their usual relationship. “It’s going to be fun…” </p>
