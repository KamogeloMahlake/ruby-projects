        <p>I was still trying to decide how to progress as I pulled Aria on my lap. Aria froze, while I turned my attention to Emma, waiting for her to speak. “Why are you still here?” Emma asked, still in a daze as she looked at us. “Why didn’t you escape?” </p><p>She had finally processed her shock enough to ask a good question, I realized. From the way she stiffened on my lap, I could feel that Aria had the same question. “What do you think?” I asked even as I let my hands caress Aria’s naked belly, enjoying the smoothness of her stomach. She tried to stand up, only to decide against it when my arms tightened around her body. I really loved Aria’s lack of decisiveness. It was so convenient. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Emma answered, confused. “You could have just escaped the city before we realized your absence and sounded the alarm.” </p><p>“Well, you’re not wrong,” I answered. “And considering where this little secret tunnel is connecting, I could have easily assassinated several key people on my way to sow chaos, leaving the Capital in tethers,” I added, enjoying the way their faces contorted in shock, like they just remembered how I rose to the helm of the forces of darkness. “Any idea why I didn’t do that, but waited for this pretty girl’s arrival,” I added even as I let my hands rose, and cupped Aria’s tits. </p><p>“R-revenge,” Emma offered, while Aria froze under my touch, not unlike a cute rabbit that realized the inviting cavern she found was housing a dragon. I used the chance to test the perkiness of her breasts, sinking into her flesh deeper and deeper. </p><p>“Come on, my little redhead. You need to be more agile if you ever want to survive the palace politics,” I murmured in amusement. “Do you want to try again, or do you want me to enlighten you?” </p><p>“Please,” Emma murmured, her eyes still wide as she watched me grope Aria. And if I was reading the way her tongue darted involuntarily, she was starting to get aroused again. The memories she had watched the last night was really showing its effect, I surmised, another reason that her ill-conceived mental intrusion was deemed too dangerous. One could never know how much they brought back. “Tell me, please.” </p><p>“Remove your dress first,” I said. </p><p>Emma wasn’t the only one that stiffened at the order, but it was easy to silence Aria. Just a twist of her nipple, and I killed her argument with a gasp. Emma spoke. “What are you talking-” she said, only to be cut halfway with a wave of my hand, and a ball gag appeared in her mouth. I dispelled it a second later, but it gave the message. I had my magic, and I was strong enough to destroy both of them without even bothering. “I - I can’t,” she stammered. </p><p>“Really, you were rather enthusiastic when I woke up the last night,” I said, once again using the opportunity to reinforce the misdirection about her mental intrusion. I wanted her to believe that her mental invasion had been successful, which would mean that she still had the hopes of acquiring the Eternal Core. An empty hope, the best way to manipulate someone as idealistic as her. </p><p>“That’s - different,” she whispered, but even as she said so, her shoulders went down. </p><p>“Of course, it was different. The last night, you were trying to satisfy your inner whore. Now, you’re trying to save your precious Empire from a very dangerous crisis,” I explained lazily. “Look, either we play by my rules, or we don’t play,” I said lazily, using a magic trick to exude self-confidence. From her perspective, I had no concerns and no fears at the moment. To be fair, molesting the half-naked princess of the Empire was the perfect item to deliver that particular impression, especially when her face and tits were still covered with my cum. </p><p>Watching the dance of emotions on her face, starting from anger and outrage, only to suffer under the iron fist of the circumstances to land a furious acceptance. “Now, the dress,” I ordered her, the same tone I would have used when I was still the ruler of my domain and facing the entertainer of the night. Emma flinched, but that didn’t prevent her from reaching to the back of her dress, unzipping it. “Slowly,” I commented, even as I waved my hand lazily to conjure nice music. “Dance for me.” </p><p>“That’s too much,” she gasped. </p><p>I shrugged. “That’s your call, but if you impress me, there might be some benefits for you,” I suggested, dangling a nice piece of metaphorical carrot in front of her, making her eyes widen. Even without trying to read her mind, I could easily predict her thoughts. She was thinking about the memories she had watched, where the Valkyrie, the hero of the border, was debasing herself in my bedroom —and many other interesting locations— in order to get important intelligence about the movements of some dark factions, which solidified her place in the hierarchy. And since Emma saw that in my memories, it was much more convincing than anything I could say. </p><p>My happiness brought rewards. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when Emma started to dance to the rhythm of my music —both literally and metaphorically— but the same couldn’t be said for the poor princess who was currently sitting on my lap, trying —and failing— to understand the sudden change of the situation. </p><p>“It shouldn’t be that surprising,” I whispered, but loud enough to be heard by Emma. “She’s making the same choice that you did, helping to mollify my mood so that I would be open to cooperation. Are you surprised to see that you’re not the only one that is willing to work hard to help your precious Empire?” </p><p>Aria failed to say anything even when her beautiful lips were parted, and when I stole a lingering kiss from her neck, it turned into a moan that was the perfect mixture of pleasure and shock, proving her lack of experience once more, as not only her body was very sensitive, but also she kept being surprised by the reactions of her own body. Meanwhile, Emma was delivering a beautiful dance as her dress slid lower, first revealing her flawless shoulders, tempting me to leave a bite mark to stain them, just like the countless marks I had left on Aria’s previously pristine breasts. </p><p>I kept one hand on Aria’s perky breasts, enjoying the sensation, while the other started to move down, soon reaching to the hem of her skirt. Only then my hand reversed direction, but with a major difference, it slid underneath her skirt, once again enjoying the texture of her naked skin, this time her soft yet supple thighs. The moan she let out was a masterpiece, but still, I liked Emma’s sudden flash of jealousy more. </p><p>A pearl of laughter tried to escape my mouth, but I suppressed it, not wanting to dispel the unique atmosphere. I couldn’t believe that Emma was still feeling jealousy under these circumstances, but maybe I shouldn’t be. After all, she was a part of Lancelot’s party from the beginning, with enough achievements to rival Lancelot himself, only to be pushed to the second seat after things calmed down, her spotlight stolen by the flawless and innocent Princess Aria, both in terms of status, and in terms of her love life. </p><p>And now, here she was, debasing herself in front of me, the feared Dark Lord, and even now, the princess had the spotlight. </p><p>I kept my attention mostly on Aria, caressing her inner thigh as I climbed up further and further, paying attention to the jealous redhead occasionally. It worked just like I had hoped, and her movements soon shed their mechanic reluctance, flashing with a renewed enthusiasm as she tried to prove herself. The dress slid lower and lower as she delivered a dance that would rival the concubines of an Emperor in terms of quality, making my shaft even harder. Aria flinched as she felt my shaft hardening under her ass, pressing against her distinctively. </p><p>Meanwhile, Emma’s dress slid even lower, revealing her corset fully. She had chosen to wear a black and red corset, perfectly combining with her crimson hair. Even more impressively, she was walking around the room, the way her hips shook apparent despite her bunched dress. Her dance was still amateurish, but it only made it sexier. Her body continued to sway as her dress slid down, until they finally ended up on the floor, revealing her beautiful legs, toned to perfection during the endless missions she took for the sake of the Light. She turned out to be wearing a pair of panties barely more than a thong, their lacy fabric giving a hint of the soft skin underneath. </p><p>“I removed my dress, now it’s your turn,” she said as she stood straight, in a belligerent pose. Or more accurately, it would have been a belligerent pose if she was still wearing a dress. In her underwear, when her hands crossed underneath her breasts, when combined with the effect of her corset, it created an amazing view of her cleavage. Her legs positioned aggressively, gave me a beautiful frontal view of her panties, including a hint of dampness that suggested I wasn’t the only one that enjoyed her dance. </p><p>“Oh, right,” I said even as I dragged my gaze over her body slowly, devouring every single detail until she started shuffling uncomfortably. Of course, during that, I didn’t neglect Aria. My fingers finally reached to her treasure, which was hidden by much thicker panties than Emma’s sexy piece, and started caressing, much to her shock. She stiffened of course, but the situation was far too overwhelming for her to react in a useful manner, especially as her body betrayed her. I felt significant wetness as I caressed her womanhood over her panties. </p><p>“Speak,” Emma ordered even as she tightened her arms, trying to look like she wasn’t affected by her half-naked state. I admired the attempt, which was decent for an amateur. Too bad that she was playing against a master of the craft.</p><p>“Mind your tone,” I said in a chilly tone, which contrasted greatly with the sensual music that was still playing in the background, and she took a step back. </p><p>“Sorry,” she murmured. </p><p>“Better,” I said as I leaned back, but intensified Aria’s special massage, both squeezing her breasts and caressing her entrance harder, finally overcoming her ability to contain herself. She started moaning loudly even as she closed her eyes in shame. “Now, I was about to offer you beautiful girls an interesting deal.” </p><p>“An alliance?” Emma asked, shocked. “With you? Impossible.” </p><p>“Alliance is a strong word,” I said. “Limited cooperation is a better classification. Since I’m going to stay in here foreseeable future, I’m sure that we can create a deal that makes both of us happy.” </p><p>“Why would you stay here?” Emma asked. “Why don’t you run away and take back your throne.” </p><p>I sighed. “A good question, but not one I will answer for free,” I commented, and before she could ask, I added. “Continue dancing.” Of course, she could have pointed out that removing her dress was already the payment for that explanation, but I was willing to bet that she had forgotten that small detail. </p><p>“You’re … You’re…” Emma murmured in shock, but I chose that moment to tease Aria’s clit, forcing an earth-shattering cry off her, interrupting Emma’s explanation. </p><p>“You need to be silent, sweetie, we’re talking,” I said to Aria even as I ripped her panties with one merciless pull, then stuffed them into her mouth. Aria tried to say something, but she was properly silenced. My fingers returned to her nether lips, finally touching her most sensitive spot naked. Aria moaned, once again muffled by her makeshift gag. </p><p>Only then I turned my gaze to Emma, who was watching the proceedings with wide eyes, no doubt shocked by the liberties I was taking with the princess of the Empire. To be frank, I was also a bit surprised by the ease I was taming Aria. I knew she was submissive, but not to this degree. “Dance,” I told Emma, and she did so. Her hips, finally free of the oppressive concealment of her dress, swayed to the steady beat of the music. </p><p>“Impress me,” I commented, and her hands ran up her hips, caressing her stomach and core. Her legs parted open, giving me a glimpse of her wet core as her underwear strained, then she bent down to enhance her cleavage even further. “Much better,” I said. </p><p>“You are supposed to explain why you’re still here despite your freedom,” she reminded testily, which did nothing to my good mood. To be fair, it was hard to hurt my good mood while I was enjoying a sexy dance show from one of the most important heroes of the Empire while simultaneously molesting the Princess of the said Empire like she was a bar wench. “How much do you know about the political structure between the different Dark Factions,” I said. </p><p>“Quite a bit,” she answered even as she turned her back and bent over, giving me an excellent view of her perky ass. “I spent most of my adult life fighting against them, after all.” </p><p>“True,” I said with a chuckle. “And you know that most of the factions are ruled by the ancient families, most prominently the Five,” I said, referring to the five major families that had the most resources between them. “Do you know which one I belong to?” </p><p>“None of them,” Emma answered immediately. “But the Five was once the Nine in the ancient times,” she added, including the four families had been destroyed in the hands of the Empire, or destroyed due to infighting several centuries ago. “Everyone knows that you’re from one of the lost four families, but we weren’t able to identify which one despite all of our efforts. You have revealed many ancient techniques from all those families.” </p><p>I chuckled. “I don’t belong to any of them, honey. I’m a commoner.” </p><p>“What- IMPOSSIBLE,” Emma exclaimed as she froze, but Aria was too far gone to even notice that, wiggling in my lap as I fingered her softly, blanketing her mind with pleasure. “But if that’s true, why didn’t your opponents used it, it would have helped them to weaken you?” </p><p>“Dancing, sweetie,” I said, reminding her that she was supposed to be giving me a delicious show. Upon reminder, she started shaking her body once more, making my mouth water greedily. Yes, I had a delicious blonde princess overcome with pleasure on my lap, but that didn’t prevent me from wanting to taste a feisty redhead, especially when she walked closer and pushed her hips forward, tempting me to lick a taste. </p><p>“About my commoner status, they didn’t reveal it, because they are long-term thinkers. They knew that even if they couldn’t take me down, I would eventually die, and it’ll go back to the beginning. Even if I can establish a dynasty, the Five would have become the Six, and that’s it. Much better than revealing everyone that a particularly strong and smart commoner can actually take and hold power, isn’t it?” I said, while Emma listened in shock, dancing automatically. </p><p>There was a benefit to her unconscious dancing, because her arousal and emotions took control, making her moves even more erotic. I played a bit with her by casting a spell to loosen her corset, and she didn’t even try to tie them, just using an arm to keep it in place. Still, it loosened enough to give me a delicious view of her areolas whenever she bent down, even showing her erect nipples occasionally. </p><p>“How does it tie back to you not escaping?” she added. </p><p>“Honey, the only reason I managed to hold power, because I managed to take the throne before the families could realize my true nature. But now that they’re aware, do you think they’ll sit back as I took back the power,” I explained. Which, admittedly, was not entirely correct. I could still plan several ways to take power, but funnily enough, most of them I could try from my cell even easier than outside. Not only it was actually safer here, but also my rivals were feeling safe without my presence, which would change if I actually escaped. </p><p>I didn’t tell Emma that, of course. It was for the best for her to think it was impossible for me to get back my title. </p><p>“So, you want to cooperate with us to get back your throne,” she said, her tone negative as she stopped dancing once more. </p><p>“Nothing so crass, sweetheart. I know you won’t do that, and I don’t want that either. But don’t stop dancing.” </p><p>“Okay,” she said as she started swaying once more. “Then, what do you want-” she started to ask, only to interrupted by Aria’s helpless moans —loud despite her makeshift gag— as she finally climaxed, which was even stronger than the previous ones, making her collapse against my body like a rag doll. </p><p>“We can discuss that,” I said, even as I tried to decide the payment for that particular talk… </p>
