        <p>I couldn’t help but smile as I walked towards the dressing room, a sexy set of underwear in my hand, a black lacy set, unfortunately opaque. I would have liked to see Emma dressed in something even more courageous, hoping to trigger her sexuality, but I had a feeling that she would melt from shock if I dared to do so. I wasn’t even completely sure that the current one wouldn’t go amiss. </p><p>“W-what is this!” Emma exclaimed behind the door, confirming my earlier opinion. </p><p>“That’s the only thing that I was able to find fitting for your size,” I answered. “You’re rather stacked in the upstairs.” A gasp escaped her mouth, but I was quick to reassure her. “Don’t worry, that’s not a bad thing!” </p><p>The silence spreading from the dressing cabin was palpable, and I had to force myself from chuckling. “I can’t wear these,” she wailed. “They are too revealing.” </p><p>“Come on Emma, they are going to stay under your clothes, what difference does it make?” I said even as my mind churned plan after plan to get rid of those clothes. </p><p>“I don’t…” she murmured while I walked away before she could finish her sentence, leaving her alone in the cabin with the underwear I had picked, fully aware that she lacked the courage to walk around in a tight shirt and a cheerleader skirt. Of course, she could have just called for a saleswoman to help her, but that would have required her to call them and reject my ‘generous’ help; something impossible thanks to her crippling lack of confidence. </p><p>After leaving, I first went to the checkout counter, and quickly paid for a leather wallet for myself. It wasn’t that I needed a wallet, but it gave me the excuse to flash my fancy credit card, highlighting my means above a normal teenager, meaning the employees would be much more willing to turn their gazes away when I started acting my plan. After that, I went back to the cabin, with a pair of tight pants in my hands, too tight to contain Emma’s rather impressive bounty. “I picked some pants for you, I hope they fit,” I said as I passed it over the door. </p><p>She grabbed it immediately, only to whisper a second later while passing the pants back to me. “They don’t fit.” </p><p>“Sorry, I’m not good at guessing sizes. It would have been better if I had something to compare,” I replied, then snapped my fingers like I had a sudden idea. “I know, why don’t you pass your current clothes to me, and I can use them for comparison.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to argue, probably going to do the reasonable thing and just tell me her sizes, but I cut her off. Of course, a calmer mind would have just mentioned the fact that I was able to pick underwear for her size perfectly.  </p><p>“Come on, Emma, pass them to me. I don’t have all day,” I said in a sharper voice, tinged with a dash of annoyance. It wasn’t an angry tone, but a serious one, one that demanded respect and obedience. After all, in her mind, I was the one that helped her while she was suffering from a humiliating joke. I had no problems implying that she was pushing my patience. She whimpered, but still, she passed the small skirt and the tight shirt I had acquired for her, leaving her in her underwear only. </p><p>I walked in a leisure pace as I looked for a dress for her. The time was working for my benefit because every second she waited in the cabin in just her sexy underwear made her more comfortable with her revealing state. Not enough to give me a show of her underwear, of course, but enough to make her model in the dress I had picked for her. It wasn’t anything special, a dark green sundress with a reasonably long skirt, and loose enough hide some of her curves. Still, when I passed it to Emma, she gasped in shock, likely because of the loose cleavage on the chest area. </p><p>“Have you tried it yet,” I said, ignoring her gasp. </p><p>“Putting it on,” she answered. </p><p>“Okay, come out so I can see it as well,” I said, which earned another gasp from her. Just to put pressure on her, I started tapping my foot on the floor in a display of impatience, and the rustling of fabric sped up. It didn’t take long for the door to be opened, revealing Emma with all her glory. It didn’t take long for her to agree, as while the cleavage on the dress was a bit on the excessive side, it was still nothing compared to her tight shirt and non-existing underwear she walked into the shop with. </p><p>“How is it?” she managed to ask, her gaze strictly on the floor. </p><p>“You look beautiful,” I said, and immediately, she blushed deep enough to rival her hair. “However, the dress doesn’t fit with your complexion. Go back to the cabin, I’ll find a better one,” I said, and once again walked away without waiting for her response. In the next half an hour, the scene repeated itself numerous times, though the skirts get shorter and the tops got tighter as she slowly got used to the rhythm, and we even picked a few casual clothes on the way, though they were still way sexier than anything Emma would have picked in her own volition. Though I avoided anything truly sexy until I noticed a little black dress, tight and short, the kind that a sexy model would wear to a night club to make her sugar daddy happy. And I wanted to see it on Emma. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, I met with another gasp when I passed it to her. “I can’t wear this!” she exclaimed. “It’s far too revealing.” </p><p>“I’m just curious how it’ll enhance your beauty,” I answered. “We won’t buy it, but just put it on.” </p><p>“Okay,” she murmured after a brief silence. I smirked, happy to see that my efforts were paying off. “But it’s just…” </p><p>“I know,” I said, not waiting for her to finish her sentence. “But wearing that even in the dressing room only will help you with your confidence, and in turn, it’ll solve your bullying problem.” </p><p>“You think so?” she asked in a trembling voice, clearly unconvinced. </p><p>“Of course. If there’s one thing that bullies never deal with, it’s a confident target,” I explained, even though I knew it was half correct. Because while bullies would avoid a confident person, it wasn’t the case for the ones that they picked for their victim. For them, it would bring an intensified wave of torture, because their increasing confidence would be an attack on their dominance. Of course, that fit me just well, because I would be there to protect her from the increased assault, tying her to myself even further. </p><p>“Really?” she asked. </p><p>“Believe me. I’m not saying that they’re going to stop instantly, but less you react to their words, more difficult it would be harder for them to justify the effort they put in. And the knowledge that you’re much sexier than they ever will help immensely, I promise,” I explained with a confident tone, avoiding the fact that her increased confidence would just launch a new line of weaponized gossip about her sluttiness, especially when she would start to hang around me. </p><p>“Really,” she murmured in fascination, and after my affirmation, she continued. “Okay, I’ll give a try.” Still, after a while, her shy whisper reached my ears. “Rodnick, I can’t wear it.” </p><p>“Don’t tell me that it doesn’t fit,” I answered to her in a fake shock. “But I made sure that the size is perfect for you,” I added in disappointment, trying to evoke her pity.  </p><p>“That’s not the problem!” she quickly answered, ready to console her white knight. “It’s just that … it’s too sexy…” </p><p>“I think you need a second opinion,” I said as I pushed the door open, only for her to freeze, because apparently, instead of trying the dress on, she was holding it against her chest, meaning I had a direct view of her underwear-clad body. And that view was spectacular; the fragility of the bra struggling to keep her bosom under control, her panties hugging her hips hungrily. “Sorry, I thought the dress was on you already,” I explained, but I kept my gaze on her body. She stayed frozen, except a full-body blush invading her body. I closed the door, but very slowly, giving my gaze time to dance over her body for one last time. </p><p>A more confident girl would have responded in cries, or at least, requested a different dress frostily, but Emma lacked the confidence to take such a confrontational stance, especially after all the help she received from me, unaware of my plans. And the crush she was obviously developing for my ‘heroic actions’ made it even more difficult for her to push back in any form. Instead, she stayed silent for a while while I apologized repeatedly, mixed with a generous dash of compliments telling her that she had nothing to be ashamed of. Still, she grabbed the pair of heeled shoes I had passed her. </p><p>Several minutes later, the door opened, and she stepped out, trying to balance herself on the unfamiliar shoes, wearing the little black dress I had picked for her. And she looked delicious, her legs going on for days, the skirt only starting a few inches below her waist, enough to reveal everything in one wrong move. The top was even better, its tight grip enhancing her cleavage further -though the presence of her bra reduced the impact quite a bit. After all, the dress was designed to be worn without it. </p><p>“You look beautiful,” I said, completely honest. The blackness of the dress was contrasting with her pale skin perfectly, and her crimson hair spilling on her shoulders was reminiscent of a flame. </p><p>“T-thanks, I like it as well,” she murmured, unable to meet my gaze. “It’s a pity that I can’t wear it, or afford it,” she said.  </p><p>“Let me check,” I said as I moved forward to check the price tag, which was rather hefty, and ripped it off with a stiff pull. </p><p>“Why did you do that!” she said, panicked enough to suppress her shyness for the moment. “I can’t afford it-” she tried to continue, but I silenced her with a finger on her lips. </p><p>“Sorry about that, it was an accident,” I said with a shrug. “But since it was my mistake, let it be a gift for you.” </p><p>“That’s too much!” she argued as she waved her arm, missing the amazing impact her move had on her cleavage. “I can’t accept it.” </p><p>“How about if you paid me back later on,” I said. </p><p>“That’s better,” she said, relaxing a bit. “But you might need to wait for a while, because I first need to find a job. I can’t ask my mother that much money.” </p><p>I made a show of thinking. “How about if you tutor me in sciences, and we can agree on a rate that will drop from the total.” </p><p>“That might work,” she murmured. </p><p>“Excellent, a deal, then,” I said, putting my hand forward like I was about to shake her hand, but when she moved forward, I chose to hug her instead, her shocked gasp echoing in my ear. I kept the hug going for a while, enjoying the way her curves pressed against my body before letting her go, leaving her crimson on the face. She dashed back to the dressing cabin immediately. When she came out, she was wearing a tight pair of jeans, and a loose blue shirt, both the cheapest and the most conservative clothes from my pick. </p><p>Paying didn’t take much, though we received a few suggestive glances from the salespeople around us. I considered buying her more from the ones we had picked, but I had already pushed the situation quite a bit with the black dress, and didn’t want to risk it further. The trek to my car was silent while Emma tried to process the details of our shopping trip, sending occasional shy glances to my side, probably thinking that the recently-fallen cover of darkness would be enough to hide her expression. </p><p>“Are you hungry?” I said once we were in the car, and when she nodded, I took a turn toward the outskirts of the city. </p><p>“Where are we going?” she asked, for once her tone is not colored with shyness, replaced by worry. </p><p>“I have found a really good food truck toward the outskirts of the city, I’m sure it’s still open,” I explained even as I pressed on the pedal, and we soared through the road. </p><p>“No! We can’t go there!” she exclaimed even as she grabbed my arm, her fingers digging into my flesh hard enough to hurt. </p><p>“Why?” I asked even </p><p>“That part of the city is really dangerous in the night. There’s a lot of gang activity,” she explained rapidly. </p><p>I knew it wasn’t the gang activity that worried her, but a supernatural variety of danger, but I let that slide. “I’m sure I can handle it, but I don’t want to worry you,” I answered as I took a turn, and Emma let out a relaxed sigh, unaware that it put us into a route that ended up in a blind alley due to a collapsed building, nor that she knew about the small tribe of possessed that was on the hunt for more prey, which was why she looked shocked when we ended up looking a broken wall, and almost twenty people with blank faces and blanker eyes looking at us, armed with a variety of improvised weapons, from broken pieces of chairs to rusty iron bars. </p><p>“We need to run away, they are too many,” I said while Emma looked at the crowd, shocked, proving that just because she knew about the supernatural hadn’t meant that she would be able to react immediately on the face of danger. I dashed toward the passenger side, and grabbed her arm before dashing forward, dragging her along. </p><p>It wasn’t difficult to get away from the possessed even with Emma half-stumbling, slowing us down. The possessed were one of the least dangerous supernatural threats, because it took a while for the demon to get used to their new bodies. Not to mention they rarely took good care of their new bodies, further reducing their potential. Their advantage lay in numbers, and avoiding them was rather easy. After all, I picked their nest for a reason. </p><p>A minute later, we had holed up a small room two floors up an abandoned building, and Emma was breathing hard. “Damn, that’s a lot of addicts,” I said with a sigh before turning her, my expression resolute. I put my hand on her cheek. “I’m sorry to put you in danger, but I promise no harm will come to you,” I said, shamelessly stealing the role of a tragic hero. </p><p>“T-thanks,” Emma murmured, her blush suddenly back despite the danger. </p><p>“Should we call the police?” I suggested. </p><p>“They won’t respond,” she simply explained. “They are understaffed, so any call that comes from anywhere other than the rich districts are usually ignored. The best case is a delayed response that would arrive in an hour or so. But I’ll text for my friends, they are experienced in such things,” she added. I watched her as she quickly sent a message, though she kept her screen away so I wasn’t able to read what she sent. Not that I needed to while it was obvious that Allison was the recipient of the message. </p><p>“Is it done?” I asked.</p><p>“Yes. We should just stay hidden, my friends will be here quickly,” Emma said rapidly, her tone begging. </p><p>“I prefer to fight,” I said, and panic bloomed on her face. Before she could say anything, I caressed her cheek gently. “But I can’t risk your safety.” And just like that, a blush covered her face, evidence of a rapidly evolving crush. She simply didn’t have a chance at my treatment. But before she could say anything, I whispered harshly. “I hear someone getting close. We need to hide better.” </p><p>From her confused expression, it was clear that she hadn’t heard anything, but luckily for my ploys, she lacked the confidence to confront me. She followed obediently as I dragged her to a small room which once was a fitted wardrobe. The space was dusty and dirty, but more importantly, it was tight, something Emma only realized when she ended with her back against the wall and her chest against mine, with no room to wiggle. She tried to move nonetheless for a while before abandoning that path quickly. </p><p>The reason: her wiggling managed to awaken my shaft rather easily.  </p><p>“We just need to stay put and wait for help,” I whispered, struggling to hide my amused smirk. The wait was going to be fun… </p>
