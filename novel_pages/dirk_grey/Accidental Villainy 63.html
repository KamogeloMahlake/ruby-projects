        <p>Emily’s lips were just wrapping around my girth when the waitress had returned with our drinks, and looked around. “Oh, your date is gone already?” she asked, her tone seductive as her hips started to dance even more. She looked beautiful with her curves stuffed in already-revealing exercise clothing that was purchased by someone leaner. </p><p>“Just visiting the bathroom,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, a pity,” she said, neither her tone nor her expression agreeing with the sentiment. I just chuckled, which was a good way to hide my reaction to pleasure. Emily’s head started to bob the moment she heard Eva’s voice. </p><p>“Not much. I’m sure she’ll return soon,” I said. </p><p>Eva walked closer, but once she put her drinks down, her hand landed on my thigh rubbing it softly, unaware of what she would have touched if she went just a few inches more to and pushed the tablecloth away. </p><p>However, with the tablecloth hanging between my legs, Emily saw where she had been touching. It might have been a problem if it wasn’t for our agreement that I would ‘punish’ her, but now, it merely made Emily bob her head faster. </p><p>“How about I help you keep … entertained until her return,” she said, then she noticed Emily’s phone, still on the table. She reached to her phone immediately and typed a message. She tried to keep it hidden, but with my power, it failed. It was a text to someone, likely to her coworker, asking her to block the entrance of the ladies' room for a few minutes, excuse it a mechanical malfunction. </p><p>Quick thinking. It also reminded me just how nasty women could be against each other once properly motivated, reminding me that I needed to be careful with my growing web of supers that I seduced. </p><p>“Well, it depends on how you keep me entertained,” I said even as I grabbed her ass. “You need to work hard to prevent me from going to the bathroom and visit her instead. </p><p>Eva’s eyes tightened just as her fingers tightened on my thigh. Yet, she stayed in place even as I squeezed her ass. Whatever memory that triggered her anger must have been spectacular for her to act like this. </p><p>“Well, I have to…” she said, unable to prevent a vicious edge from slipping into her tone as she rubbed my leg. “After all, we can’t allow our customers to get bored,” she added, though as she spoke, her voice weakened while a blush spread. She was no doubt realizing the absurdity of her words. </p><p>I gave her a confident grin, which made her quiver with excitement and fear in equal amounts. She tried to cover up her reaction by reaching for my drink and taking a sip, but she was nowhere near as successful as she might think. I grabbed her waist, and pulled her on the table, her legs dangling down in a way that Emily could see. </p><p>Emily must have enjoyed that, because her fingers fingers joined the game, cupping my balls for a gentle massage while she pushed herself down even deeper. </p><p>“Now, let’s see if you have what it takes to keep me entertained,” I said with a throaty tone that was working wonders on Eva to establish her mood. She was reacting to the bad boy persona very well. </p><p>She blushed as she tried to say something, but that staggered for a moment as I put my hand on her leg. “I …” she started, which turned to a gulp as I continued climbing up. Soon, I was touching her shorts, but that didn’t help her any. The elastic of her shorts was already thin enough before they had been stretched to the limit. </p><p>“What’s wrong, sweetie? Cat got your tongue? I thought that you were supposed to keep me entertained while my date is away. It’s hard to do that without talking, is it?” I said, but I could see her hesitation. The situation had escalated further than she expected, and she was having second thoughts. “Speaking of my date, I wonder just how long she’ll stay there. She was supposed to return,” I added. </p><p>That mention was not pointless. After all, she was still under the impression that she was the one who arranged Emily’s absence once she noticed she had left her phone back. A ticking clock that she had introduced, unaware that it became a tool to goad her to further action. </p><p>“Well, not necessarily,” she whispered, once again her vicious tone enough to suppress her shyness. </p><p>“Hmm, what an intriguing statement,” I said even as I let my fingers climb up, landing right at the center of her legs, where her lack of underwear was paying incredible dividends. Her growing arousal was spreading to her thin shorts, leaving irrevocable evidence of her growing desire. </p><p>I put my finger against her wetness. Two of my fingers landed on her entrance, while my thumb found her clit. A little aggressive for foreplay, but considering the constraints we had been operating, it was necessary. </p><p>Her eyes widened as my hand assailed her wetness in an aggression she was nowhere near prepared for. Lost in pleasure, she fisted the tablecloth aggressively as she moaned. </p><p>It was good that Eva was distracted, because it allowed me to slip my hand under the tablecloth without raising any kind of issue as I grabbed Emily’s beautiful hair … and started facefucking her, an escalation my naughty tech heroine was more than enthusiastic about. </p><p>She tried to keep her gagging down, but she wasn’t entirely successful. Luckily, Eva had her own concerns, such as containing her moans to register it. </p><p>“Show me your tits if you want to continue,” I ordered her. A daring, rough order, not my usual style, but, I didn’t forget that, as much as playing with a naughty musician with some really weird mental hangups was fun, it was truly about Emily. And, she would appreciate that humiliation. </p><p>Eva followed my order immediately and pushed her top up, the pleasure momentarily making her forget her exact location. A concealed corner it might be, it was still a public cafe, where any coworker or customer stumble upon the sight of her naked breasts. </p><p>Her incredibly beautiful breasts which defied gravity, instead shook as she started to tremble. I could sense that her climax was not too far away, the location enough to overwhelm her concerns. </p><p>“Now, play with your tits,” I ordered even as I pulled her bottom down enough to reveal her naked pussy, and slipped two fingers inside. </p><p>“I —” she started, which was all she was able to say as I started fingering her mercilessly, each second driving her deeper into the pleasure. “Impressive. I have to admit, you are fulfilling that promise to keep me entertained,” I said. </p><p>I didn’t push for more for a simple reason. Emily’s lips were still around my shaft, giving me the best blowjob she was responsible to date. </p><p>Then, Emily’s hand appeared under the tablecloth. For a moment, I thought that she had been asking for a reprieve, but then, she mimed taking photos — not very accurately, considering she was still busy with my cock in her throat, forcing me to rely on my power to understand it. </p><p>Naughty. I stopped holding her hair, and instead grabbed her phone off the table and passed it to her. </p><p>Then, I grabbed my own phone with the same hand, and took several photos of Eva, who, at this point, collapsed on the table. “P-pictures?” Eva whispered. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie. A nude is nowhere as bad as laying on your back on a random table at your workplace,” I said to her. She might have reacted negatively to it, but as I fingered her furiously, her reaction was just tightening around my fingers as she climaxed. </p><p>I took a lot of photos, each going to Emily, who responded by sucking me even more aggressively, so I summed up not too much after Eva. “Give me your number. I’ll send them to you,” I said. Eva, too dazed after her climax, rattled her number, giving me a way to maintain contact with her. </p><p>Was having her number necessary? No. </p><p>Did I want it still? Definitely.</p><p>“I … I need to go change,” she stammered as she regained her wits and pushed herself off the table, fixing her clothing to regain her modesty, which, considering her clothing, didn’t help much. Her bottom got even more transparent, and her top was not capable of hiding her hardened nipples. </p><p>Emily appeared from under the table before Eva could disappear, but luckily, Eva was too concerned about being seen by others before she could go back to an employee-only section and didn’t look back. </p><p>My sexy tech support watched her leave even as she licked her lips. “Well, that was—” she started, which I interrupted by my fingers into her mouth, still wet with Eva’s juices. </p><p>“Lick,” I ordered, and Emily did so, treating it as a part of her reward. Incredibly sexy, and it also allowed me to test her attitude toward some future fun. Incredible. </p><p>I teased her a bit more until she sat down. However, this time, I didn’t start playing footsie. </p><p>It was the perfect time to make her an offer she couldn’t refuse. </p>
