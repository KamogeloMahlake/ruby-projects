        <p>My sexy dragon’s eyes widened as she found herself filled to the brim after her accident. Her mouth opened, no doubt to complain, but her body had other intentions. </p><p>Like releasing another earth-shattering moan, showing that, even in this form, she had the lungs of a dragon. </p><p>“Careful,” I said even I squeezed her tits, enjoying their softness. “Try not to take anything you can’t handle.” </p><p>The slight dig to her pride once again worked excellently even when she had found herself in a position far farther than she had planned for. “I can handle anything you give,” she replied immediately, ready to defend her pride. </p><p>Though, she seemed less sensitive about where her pride was leading her. </p><p>With that, her hips started rocking once more, her movements much more enjoyable as she started to do her best to devour the entirety of my shaft. She failed, of course, but that didn’t blunt her enthusiasm. She deserved a reward, I decided. </p><p>[-680 Mana]</p><p>Of course, as she did her best to make my presence in, the pleasure started to get more and more overwhelming for her, her moans rising uninterrupted. So much that, her passionate rhythm started to stagger. </p><p>So, I brought my hands down, landing on her hips to help her maintain the beautiful rhythm she had started, every push widening her beautiful tightness. “Move faster, mistress,” I ordered, still emphasizing the last word to mock her for her daring to use me as a servant. </p><p>I was, as always, a vindictive bastard when the situation called. </p><p>That earned an angry glare, but nothing more, as she was busy moaning uninterrupted, pleasure long invaded her whole being. And her challenge to absorb all the mana I was providing only made it even more difficult to maintain control. </p><p>It was a good opportunity to examine her transformation process once more, I decided as I turned a part of my attention on the transformation that was going on in her body. I examined the layers and layers of construct she was building on her bones, slowly changing the nature of it. </p><p>After a couple of minutes, I decided to stop. Unfortunately, even with the lesson I had received from her, and with the assistance of my Biomancy, I wasn’t able to truly understand the nature of her trick, let alone create a viable copy for my own usage. </p><p>Whatever she was doing was either a special dragon ability, or something that required special training. Either way, I decided to shelve it for the moment, to be tested during the first feasible opportunity. </p><p>I turned my attention back to her reckless movement, enjoying her moans as she jumped up and down, doing her best to stuff her tiny pussy. With my hands on her hips, maintaining the pace, along with the tenseness of her slow approach earlier, it didn’t take long for her to climax explosively, tightening even further around me. </p><p>She collapsed against my chest, her breathing out of control, her desperate moans begging for rest. </p><p>Too bad that she didn’t earn the right to rest. </p><p>She failed to react as I grabbed her waist and twisted her, and she found her chest pressing against the softness of the bed once more. A soft murmur of comfort left her mouth, only to be interrupted halfway as she felt my hands grabbing her beautiful horns once more. </p><p>“What are you doing?” she barely managed to say between her labored gasps, still trying to throw off her latest orgasm. </p><p>“Continuing the massage, of course,” I said even as I pressed my hard shaft against her entrance once more. “Don’t tell me that you are too exhausted to handle it.” </p><p>“Of course, I’m not,” her answer came predictably, her pride ever-useful. “However—“ she tried to continue. Unfortunately, I would never learn what she intended to say, because I chose that moment to push forward, replacing her words with an urgent cry of pleasure. </p><p>Despite everything, her eagerness to enjoy another round was never in doubt, and she replied with a moan, even as I pulled her horns back, forcing her to bend into a very special shape even as I pinned her under me. </p><p>She tried to push her ass back toward me a few times, only to abandon that when she realized just how hard I intended to impale her. “Too hard,” she gasped. </p><p>“Why, mistress,” I said, once again mocking her even as I pulled one of my hands away from her horn to wrap around her hair, changing my hold into a painful pull, while using my free hand to slap her plump ass. “Don’t tell me that you, a great dragon, can’t handle a weak human?” </p><p>I loved her predictable her answer was. “I can handle anything you can dish out,” she gasped, even as her voice was strained. Since she was showing such kindness playing along, I decided to reward her with another flood of mana. </p><p>[-740 Mana]</p><p>As I picked up even more speed, I could feel that I was slowly getting toward an explosion of my own. The exquisite tightness and deafening moans of a sexy dragon were not easy to resist. </p><p>Of course, I had no intention of letting her succeed before I had thoroughly made her pay about her temerity to position herself as my superior. “Moan for me, mistress,” I ordered even as I spanked her ass again, hard enough to leave a red mark even with her physical resistance. </p><p>“I’ll make you pay,” she managed to growl. </p><p>“Oh, I’m looking forward to it, mistress,” I said even as I slapped her ass again, enjoying the way her plump flesh rippled. However, considering with all the strength and magic under her command, those words were the only thing she had used to dissuade me from it, I doubted she was hating the treatment as much as she tried to reflect. </p><p>I smirked as I started to enjoy the full benefits of my controlling position, slowing down and speeding up in surprise timings, increasing her pleasure even further, her body nothing but a toy under my command. </p><p>Another orgasm hit her, turning her moans into barely audible mewling as she tried to stay conscious. Even for a dragon, chain orgasms of explosive intensity were not that easy to handle. </p><p>For a moment, my gaze slipped toward her puckered hole, tempted to take her from there, but I decided against it for two reasons. First, she was already too far gone in pleasure. She was under the risk of collapsing immediately if I made such a radical move. </p><p>Second, dazed and filled with pleasure, it was the perfect time to interrogate her. </p><p>Without skipping even a beat, I leaned forward, my hands once again on her horns, pulling her back enough for her tits to dangle freely. “So, tell me about the deal between you and my boss,” I ordered. </p><p>Normally, I would have tried to be more careful in my interrogation, but at this point, she was far too gone to mislead me, maybe even understand the political significance of my question, that I wanted to learn about my ‘boss’. </p><p>“That upstart bird,” she managed to whisper between her moans as I didn’t stop my hips. Yet, despite that, she managed to convey the dismissal she was feeling. </p><p>“Yes,” I said, unable to hide my amusement. </p><p>“You shouldn’t work for that lowly bird, and instead work for me,” she managed to murmur dazedly. </p><p>“That’s a good offer,” I whispered suggestively. “And we know that you can keep this poor servant satisfied,”  I added, unable to suppress the temptation to mock her, which made her growl angrily for a second before pleasure melted her annoyance again. “But how can I work for someone I don’t even know the name of.” </p><p>“Janelor,” she responded immediately. “My name is Janelor.” </p><p>I chuckled. “It’s good to know, mistress. Now, why don’t you tell me exactly that weak bird wanted from you.” </p><p>“She wants me to save her from her arrogance, of course,” she managed to whisper between her moans, her dismissal clear. I did my best to listen, and not explode in amusement as she blamed someone else for being arrogant. </p><p>“How exactly?” I asked. </p><p>“She’s nothing but a lowly soldier of that annoyingly sanctimonious Host of Light, prancing around declaring their superior virtue, but the moment she found an opportunity to rise, she took it without blinking,” she said. </p><p>“You’re talking about the Divine Spark,” I guessed. </p><p>“Yes. I have no idea where she had found such a substantial piece of it, but she had wildly overestimated herself when she tried to absorb it,” she explained. </p><p>“Is there a special condition to absorb Divine Spark, or is it about her power,” I asked. </p><p>“Divine Spark is more trouble than its worth,” she declared, which, unfortunately, implied that she didn’t have deep knowledge. I doubted she would miss a chance to brag. “There’s a reason no dragon ever lowers themselves to absorb one.” </p><p>Interesting, I thought, though not exactly willing to dig deeper into her statement about dragons not deigning to absorb one, as there were too many probabilities, from a potential incompatibility to her being wrong. It wasn’t really important, not at this moment. </p><p>“So, she had overestimated herself, so what? Can’t someone help her?” </p><p>She managed to chuckle between her moans. “That’s the funny part, the one that could help her easily is her boss, but the moment she dared to absorb the Divine Spark of Light, she become a heretic.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured. “And she wants the help of your boss,”  I said. </p><p>“My friend! I have no superior,” the dragon growled angrily, quick to correct my assumption. I doubted that was the case, but once again, it was semantic that was not interesting to spend any time on. I had already learned what I needed from her. </p><p>“If you say so, mistress,” I said mockingly even as I sped up, the sound of flesh hitting flesh filling the room, mixing with her moans and my grunts, my grip around her horns as tight as her nether lips’ grip around my girth. </p><p>With my desperate ramming, it didn’t take long for her to reach another orgasm, but this time, I accompanied her in the direction, filling her with my cum and my mana as she exploded in ecstasy. </p><p>[-1685 Mana]</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes…” she moaned desperately as the pleasure and my power filled her directly, infusing her whole being. But this time, she failed to resist the call of exhaustion, slumping on the bed as I pulled out of her, my release drizzling out. </p><p>“Such a beautiful view,” I murmured as I quickly dressed, leaving her in her bed, my cum staining her, a great proof of my selfless efforts to keep my mistress happy. </p><p>Now, I needed to have a talk with the other mystical being who was under the impression that she was my boss. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 2890 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
