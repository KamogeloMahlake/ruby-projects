        <p>“Oh, really, how are you going to do that?” Aviada smirked as she looked at me, her eyes flashing with a provocative kind of anger, one that needed to be extinguished properly to remind her of the place she deserved. It seemed that the domination she employed on Carla had been enough for her to forget what she deserved. </p><p>Or, she was deliberately pushing the border to galvanize me into action. Not that any problem with it if that was the case. Fucking her into submission again was a rather pleasurable activity, after all.  </p><p>“Do you still need a demonstration?” I asked mockingly, but before she could answer, I lashed forward, not as fast as I could do, but still faster than she could react, and this time, I grabbed her shirt and used that to tie her hands, reinforcing its texture with magic as I did so. </p><p>[-23 Mana]</p><p>“Do you think that’ll hold me?” Aviada snorted in confidence, only to realize no matter how much effort she put, it was impossible for her to rip it off. </p><p>“I believe that it might work,” I answered smugly even as I grabbed her shoulder, preventing her from standing up. Of course, that little play wasn’t enough to break her desire to be the dominant one. She displayed her flexibility by managing to throw a kick from her position. </p><p>I grabbed it easily. </p><p>“Is that all you can do?” I asked smugly, which caused her anger to flare. “I can understand if you change your mind and ask for a reprieve. After all, how much can you handle as a weak little girl?” </p><p>“Never,” she countered swiftly, but her anger was unable to conceal her increasing desire. </p><p>“Really,” I said as I pushed her back and put her legs together, before using Carla’s discarded top to tie them up as well, effectively leaving her helpless. “Even if I decide to torture you?” </p><p>“Do your worst!” she challenged, her excitement impossible to hide. </p><p>“Really,” I said as I hovered over her. “Are you sure you can handle my worst?” </p><p>“Of course,” she murmured, but her eyes widened as she wiggled in her place. The reason, the little Biomancy trick I cast her moments ago, enhancing her sensitivity greatly while preventing her from climaxing. Not the first time I was employing a similar trick on her, but since Aviada was an exceptionally rebellious submissive, it wasn’t shocking that she had forgotten its implications. </p><p>But despite the impression her straightforward personality might give, she wasn’t stupid, her eyes widening in remembrance as I caressed her inner thigh gently, injecting her with unbelievable pleasure. “Oh, are you really sure you can handle my worst? It looks like you’re having second thoughts.” </p><p>“No!” she exclaimed, her tone sharp despite her expression disagreeing with the message. She might have realized her mistake, but she was far too prideful to admit defeat this early. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I leaned forward, letting my breath fall on her neck, which was rather unbearable with her increased sensitivity, making her tremble. “Domination is such an interesting concept,” I murmured gently even as my hand explored her inner thigh gently. “It’s not about strength or power, but control. A touch here, a caress there, and soon, it allows to unearth the true submissive in the heart of even the most willful fighter, don’t you agree?” </p><p>“I’m not submissive,” she rapidly answered. </p><p>I chuckled even as I let my hand climb up to her wetness. “Oh, really? Then, why are you so wet after being tied down, helpless and under my mercy?” </p><p>That triggered her rebellion once more, making her struggle to get out of her bonds, only to fail spectacularly. At this point, even a simple spell from me couldn’t be resolved with pure strength, especially without any leverage. Moreover, the more she twisted, the more her pleasure built up thanks to her enhanced sensitivity. Soon, she was helplessly moaning even as she struggled, the objective of her struggle changing, searching for the climax. </p><p>I just stood back, watching her naked body writhe, which was a spectacular view. The naked body of Carla, exhausted after the spectacular treatment she had just received, made the view even better. </p><p>It took a while for Aviada to notice my other trick. “You didn’t!” she gasped in horror. I just smirked. “You’re a monster,” she stammered in anger, her confidence replaced with horror. </p><p>“Didn’t you just tell me that you can handle my worst?” I said with a sigh. “Such an unreliable partner. Still, I’m a merciful man. You can just admit that you can’t handle it, and maybe beg for a while, and I’ll dispel the spell. Alright?” </p><p>“Not a chance,” she answered. “You can never take me down with magic!” Still, it was proof of our growing relationship that she was actually getting aroused by the application of magic rather than just being repulsed, despite her believing that magic was weakness. Though, maybe it was about me already proving my strength, leaving no doubt about who was stronger, therefore making her more receptive to some magical seasoning. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, and grabbed another piece of cloth, this time using it as a blindfold, which made her gasp in panic. It was a good sound on her. </p><p>Wrapped in complete darkness, her gasps of arousal were enhanced as I dragged my hand over her body, the sensation of arousal enhanced more than she could handle. </p><p>The naked, writhing body of Aviada was a delicious sight, tempting me to skip the treatment and take her directly, but I managed to keep myself contained, no matter how much her full breasts danced as she rocked her body while I caressed her tight stomach.  </p><p>“Any change of mind?” I asked even as I let my hands climb higher, caressing the underside of her perky tits. </p><p>“Never,” she gasped, but I could hear that her tone was getting weaker, more indecisive, flinching every time my breath fell on her skin. </p><p>“It’s hard to resist without seeing, is it?” I asked even as I flicked her nipple before raising my hand, only to caress her neck a second later. “Trying to resist without knowing where the hit is going to come, leaving you helpless…” This time, she didn’t even answer, just let out a desperate moan, signaling that her arousal was quickly going of control. </p><p>I maintained the assault for another minute, teasing her sensitive spots in a random order, making her moan helplessly while she writhed against her constraints, desperately trying to get rid of her blindfold, getting more and more aroused as the time went. </p><p>“Can you still handle our little game?” I whispered into her ear, enjoying the way her back arched the moment my breath fell on her neck, making her twitch helplessly. “Or are you going to surrender?” </p><p>“Surrender…” she murmured softly, barely audible. </p><p>“Sorry, it wasn’t clear, would you mind repeating it?” I asked, even as I caressed her tits gently once more, pushing her arousal even deeper. </p><p>“Please,” she uttered, louder. </p><p>“Please, what?” I countered. “Be more clear about what you want, sweetie.” </p><p>She didn’t appreciate my intentional obstinateness, but that wasn’t enough to actually change her mind, not when she was hanging on with the skin of her teeth, with her only hope to release the tension blocked magically. “Please, let me cum,” she begged. </p><p>“And, have you been a good girl, enough to deserve mercy?” </p><p>“Yes,” she gasped, only to receive a hard slap on her breast, leaving a pink mark as it exploded loudly. </p><p>“Really? Even after almost letting my secret slip several times, forcing me to intervene,” I said, like the way I had intervened was a great sacrifice and not something that amused me greatly. </p><p>“You can trust Carla-” she started, only to receive another spank. </p><p>“That doesn’t mean you can just decide it on your own,” I warned her even as I twisted her nipple, enjoying her resulting moans. “Your sin is grave, but you’re lucky that I’m feeling merciful. One little punishment, and I will be ready to forgive you.” </p><p>“Thank you,” she gasped. “Please let me cum.” </p><p>“After the punishment,” I reminded her. </p><p>“That wasn’t the punishment?” she asked, followed by a moan as I twisted her nipple. </p><p>“No, sweetie, that was just the setup,” I said even as I climbed on the bed. ”The punishment is just starting. Open your pretty mouth.” </p><p>“You can’t,” she started, which was exactly the opportunity I needed to push my shaft inside her mouth, but I stayed back to tease her back even more.</p><p>“Well, if you’re saying that you can’t handle Carla’s punishment-” I said mockingly, only for her to interrupt me. </p><p>“I can handle that, of course!” she stated. Her pride might allow her to be submissive to me due to her infuriation with my abilities, but the same didn’t apply to admitting to a weakness compared to her friend, even in significantly disadvantaged circumstances.</p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I grabbed her body and lifted her up, only to slam her against the wall, earning a moan of shocked pleasure, signaling that she was approaching the point of no return. But she had no one to but herself, paying the cost of her loose lips. </p><p>I didn’t bother kissing her, just pulled back a bit, and her trembling legs failed to carry her weight. I grabbed her tied hands and lifted them over her head even as I pushed my shaft against her lips, easily passing the first line of resistance created by her lips. </p><p>Keeping her hands up with one hand, I pushed my hips forward, knocking the entrance of her throat, earning a moan simultaneously. Meanwhile, my other hand was still exploring her body even if I had to reach down a little, squeezing her tantalizing tits. </p><p>She tried to mewl obediently, her combative instincts long disappeared under the torturous dominance of pleasure. That only made me hornier though. I started pushing forward viciously, getting savage satisfaction from her drunken moans that massaged my conveniently located shaft. </p><p>It felt good to have Aviada, one of the most unruly warriors in the school, and a veritable powerhouse, moaning under the dominance of my shaft helplessly. It was not without a benefit for her, of course, as I used the opportunity to deploy more and more mana into her mouth, leveraging the mana regeneration perk that was triggered earlier to increase the active count from two to three. </p><p>[-1542 Mana]</p><p>I looked down, enjoying her otherwise pale cheeks blushing further and further while her eyes lost their focus, to a point of unable to make eye contact. She even moaned when I pulled out to allow her to breathe, only to slap her cheek with my thickness, creating a delicious thumping sound. Miraculously, Aviada just mooned in response. Signaling that my delicious ploy of dominance was getting a bit too overwhelming. </p><p>It was certainly novel for her to accept whatever I was dishing without a complaint, obediently accepting it. Not wanting to waste such an opportunity, I guided it to her lips once more, this time to be gobbled with enthusiasm. Her mouth parted wide, allowing my invasion without the slightest resistance. </p><p>A groan escaped my mouth even as I pushed harder and harder, slipping a hand behind her head to prevent her head from hitting against the wall, while pulling her hair in the process. She accepted my presence deeper as I pushed, into her throat almost immediately. </p><p>Her eyes widened as her nose pressed against my skin, pushed to the limit, tears flowing out of her eyes. Despite that, her moans continued to escape —and continued to be suppressed by my shaft lodged deep in her throat. </p><p>Soon, she was choking, gagging, and gurgling at the same time, pushing her ability to resist to the limit. Which, admittedly, rather enjoyable to watch as well as to feel. With her wrists bound, she didn’t have any chance to resist, of course, but the fact that she was yet to make any move toward that was the proof of just how far she had sunk into the throes of pleasure. </p><p>All the while, I continued to use the opportunity to transfer mana, both to strengthen her soul space and to bequeath her more experience. </p><p>[-3316 Mana]</p><p>I enjoyed her warm mouth and tight throat for several more minutes before I decided to show mercy. “Punishment complete,” I said, enjoying the way her eyes widened even as I brushed her cheek gently, dispelling the spells on her, her bindings falling simultaneously with the spell that prevented her from climaxing. </p><p>Not that she was in a mood to pay attention to that, not when she was too distracted by the orgasm that hit her with all the strength of a rabid dragon. In a show of mercy, I pulled my shaft out of her, choosing to spray her face and her tits rather than forcing her to swallow, all the while, she trembled helplessly, the only reason she was able to stay upright was the presence of the cold wall behind her, preventing her from collapsing. </p><p>Still, impressively, she was physically capable enough not to collapse, though it was a near miss. I decided to give her an opportunity to catch her breath before starting another round, to help her level up with no ulterior motives. </p><p>We still had quite a bit of time until morning… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370	Mana: 3123  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [95/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>
