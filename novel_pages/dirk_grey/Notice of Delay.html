        <p>Hi Everyone, </p><p>I would like to apologize that this Friday's updates will be a few days late, because I'm suffering from a mild wrist injury that nevertheless makes using a keyboard a true ordeal. </p><p>I'm suffering it for the last few days, and I expect it to last a couple of more days, so if things go as expected, the chapters will be up Sunday (hopefully, as depending on my recovery speed, it might be Monday or Tuesday as well). </p><p>Sincerely</p><p>Dirk</p>
