        <p>Hello, my dear patrons, </p><p>This is an experimental 3D render I had put together for Nancy. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did while making it. If you guys enjoy it, I'll start adding them more -in more heated ways, of course. <em>So, if you liked it (or didn't) please like or comment. </em></p>
