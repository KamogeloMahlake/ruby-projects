        <p>Sarah was feeling self-conscious at the sudden request, while Naomi busied herself by smirking proudly, too distracted by her momentary victory on her friend to question Sarah’s sudden mood shift. </p><p>Exactly the emotion I wanted her to display, because as Sarah looked at her friend, her hesitancy was being replaced by frustrated anger with a great speed. </p><p>Of course, even with that anger, I had no doubt that, without yesterday’s adventure, she would have retreated in defeat. Yet, after that, she had developed a very skewed sense of what was acceptable and what was scandalous, and her anger worked excellently to blur those already-skewed lines. </p><p>“She deserves a better view,” Sarah said with a sudden passion as she stood up, took a step to the side, and sat down. </p><p>Directly onto my shaft. </p><p>Naomi looked down, surprised but not shocked, though it didn’t take long for me to understand the reason. Sarah kept her legs together, which hid the true nature of her move even as she once again enveloped the crown of my shaft as she slowly lowered herself, a beautiful grunt escaping her mouth. </p><p>“Not bad,” Naomi said, impressed, but not impressed enough to fall silent. </p><p>“Really,” Sarah gasped as she continued to go deeper. Then, she grabbed Naomi’s hair and pulled her close before finally letting her legs widen. “Do you think you can do it as well?” </p><p>“Y-you,” Naomi gasped, her confidence shattering completely as she finally realized how far her friend had gone. </p><p>Sarah’s vindictive smile was beautiful, almost as beautiful as the way she tightened around me as her hips started to rock. Yet, despite making her point, she didn’t let Naomi go away, but actually pulled her even closer. “You wanted to get a better view, right?” she murmured. </p><p>For a nerd, she was incredibly vindictive. </p><p>Naomi squeaked wordlessly once Sarah let her hair go. She tried to stand up even as she frantically tried to cover herself up, as if she just remembered she didn’t have a stitch of clothing on. </p><p>Before she could raise herself, I stopped her by wrapping my arm around her waist. “No need to hurry, sweetie,” I whispered as I leaned toward her, leaving a lingering kiss on her neck, which distracted her enough to make her forget her concerns. </p><p>And even as her shock slowly evaporated, she obeyed. She did so slowly, hesitantly, her gaze bouncing between our faces. Yet, not only did she stay in her seat, but also she lowered her arms, showing her nipples, standing to attention. </p><p>Sarah grunted in displeasure, clearly unhappy with the fact that I was still paying attention to her friend. “Maybe you two—“ she started, but that was all she could manage before I grabbed her hips and pulled her down. </p><p>Her protests died on her lips as she found herself impaled on my rod, her moan spectacular as my shaft tested her limits. Naomi looked at her, startled, only for her gaze to fall on me once she realized the extent of her friend’s success, her widened legs leaving no place to hide her progress. </p><p>“All of it,” Naomi gasped in shock while the object in question was busy scraping Sarah’s insides. </p><p>“You shouldn’t be surprised. Tenacity combined with repeated exercising. It’s the basis of all physical activity, after all.” </p><p>“Repeated exercising,” Naomi murmured vindictively at the mention that it wasn’t the first time. It wasn’t something that was particularly hard to deduce, of course, but mentioning it openly still had a weight of its own. </p><p>Sarah somehow managed to blush when Naomi looked at her with an inscrutable expression, finally feeling the absurdity of pushing her friend too much, but before she could say anything, I tightened my grip around her hips and pulled her once more, her tight hips squirming around the base of my shaft, her lips busy moaning desperately. </p><p> “She’s such a good friend, right?” I asked Naomi even as I started directing her hips. </p><p>“Oh, the best,” Naomi answered, her voice tense, though, amusingly, all her anger directed at her friend, leaving me free to enjoy the fruits of their little argument, just like the night before. “She’s doing her best to show there’s nothing to be afraid about taking that final step even though it’s a competition. Such a good friend.” </p><p>“No, you can’t!” Sarah gasped between her moans as she heard her friend declaring that she wanted to take a turn after her. </p><p>“Why not?” Naomi answered, trying to sound confident as she pushed her chest out aggressively, though, with her current lack of clothing, it was more erotic than aggressive. “I thought we were competing.” </p><p>Sarah’s expression of realization was beautiful, though as I started pushing her down even more aggressively, she was having trouble answering with the pleasure invading her body. She closed her eyes, and I loosened my grip, assuming she was preparing for a climax. </p><p>Yet, she surprised me by standing up suddenly, turning to face us, her hands on her hips challengingly. With her arousal dripping down and her legs trembling with pleasure, it wasn’t exactly an intimidating sight for me, but Naomi reacted differently. </p><p>Especially after Sarah spoke. “Go ahead, take your turn,” she said, her smugness apparent even with her quickened breathing. </p><p>Naomi froze under challenge, her gaze turning to my glistening shaft. “That…” she murmured. “That was in you. Entirely.” </p><p>“I know,” Sarah answered, satisfied with her achievement. I could see Naomi’s confidence trembling once more, about to retreat. I tried to find a way to encourage her without being too obvious, but Sarah’s move was too surprising for me to react. </p><p>And with all my blood gathered there, I wasn’t exactly in prime mental space. </p><p>“Or, you can do the smart thing and admit you can’t compete with me,” Sarah followed up, unable to resist the temptation of teasing her hesitating friend, once again showing she was her worst enemy in the little game we were conducting. </p><p>Because, the moment her dismissive declaration reached Naomi’s ears, she perked up, anger at Sarah’s words and the realization that she would lose after everything overwhelmed her earlier sensation. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t the only thing responsible. The attraction that was already there, and the build-up of pleasure that she developed during the extended foreplay played a role as well. </p><p>Even Sarah’s intense cries, the most excellent marketing material possible, played a role as well. </p><p>“Oh, what if I want to compete,” Naomi said as she stood up, standing in front of Sarah, whose confidence was quick to melt when coming face to face with her friend. </p><p>“If you can handle it,” Sarah said, trying to sound smug and confident, but failing to carry the mood once the atmosphere shifted. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Naomi murmured, and Sarah smirked, assuming that Naomi was retreating, but that was a mistake. Why would Naomi smirk naughtily if she was retreating? “Maybe I should see you practice a bit more,” Naomi said as she suddenly grabbed Sarah’s shoulders and pushed her down, directly onto my shaft. </p><p>I grabbed Sarah’s hips at the last moment for a little adjustment, preventing a painful accident. “No, not ready!” Sarah gasped as her eyes widened, but that was all she could do before she found herself impaled herself on my shaft once more. </p><p>“Oops,” Naomi whispered mockingly. “How clumsy of me?” </p><p>“Y-you bitch,” Sarah answered, her lips parting beautifully as she delivered that, followed by a deep moan as her body started trembling. Not expecting to be ambushed by her friend in such a direct manner, she wasn’t prepared for the invasion of pleasure, trembling badly. </p><p>I didn’t bother grabbing her hips to set the pacing, because Naomi was keeping her hands on her shoulder, pushing her down whenever Sarah tried to stand up. My shaft slammed deep inside her with each repeat, while Sarah moaned deeply. </p><p>“Come on, Sarah, you can do it, ten more repeats,” Naomi said, once again putting on her trainer persona. I wondered whether it was a reflexive reaction of her, allowing her to drift where she felt comfortable, or it was intentional to mock Sarah. </p><p>Either way, I wasn’t in a place to complain as Naomi pushed Sarah down, just like Sarah did earlier to force Naomi to deepthroat my presence mercilessly. </p><p>I had no problem with the way they were taking revenge. </p><p>“Tease her clit,” I ordered as I caught Naomi’s gaze, and much to my surprise, she didn’t delay even a second before she put her hand on Sarah’s clit, circling aggressively while her other hand still pushed Sarah down. </p><p>Under the combined assault of my shaft and Naomi’s fingers, not to mention the erotic nature of the unexpected position she found herself in, it didn’t take long for Sarah to finally start trembling hard, orgasm hitting her with the strength of an out-of-control truck, leaving her helpless as she gushed and moaned… </p><p>Only then did Naomi pull back, leaving Sarah to tremble on my lap helplessly, without distraction. </p><p>Under normal circumstances, I would have let Sarah catch her minute before repeating the same move, not satisfied without a climax. However, with a chocolate beauty waiting for me, it was much easier to put her next to me before standing up and looking down at Naomi, who suddenly realized making Sarah climax wasn’t the end. </p><p>“So, beautiful,” I whispered as I grabbed her waist. “Are you ready for it?”</p>
