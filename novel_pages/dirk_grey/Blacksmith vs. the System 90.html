        <p>“And, that’s the last of it. The dungeon is officially closed until further notice,” Eleanor said the moment she returned to my side, sealing the dungeon gate. </p><p>“Everything done?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, we evacuated every guild and the guards are on high alert, ordered to attack anyone that dares to breach without invitation. The only problem is that it’ll take at least a day for Maria to return,” Eleanor explained in quick order. </p><p>I nodded, admiring her efficiency. Merely an hour had passed since our close call, which was all she needed to put the dungeon on high alert and stop the operation. For someone who preferred direct action above anything else, her capacity to set up an organization was admirable. </p><p>I suspected it was Maria’s flighty attitude to such aspects that had forced her to learn. </p><p>“I’m still not sure about closing the dungeon,” Eleanor said. “We have handled the crisis well enough. Is it worth losing all that money just to trick them?” </p><p>“We have already discussed it. It’s better to let them believe they had managed to cause some significant damage, maybe even that one of those … whatever they were … was loose in the dungeon. At least, until Maria returns and can make a decision.” </p><p>“Fine,” Eleanor said. She didn’t look entirely convinced, but she assented. “But don’t forget your promise. First, you’re going to adjust this monstrosity into something more elegant,” she said as she displayed her new sword. </p><p>I made sure to hide my smile, amused by the ease with which she was convinced to follow what she believed to be a wasteful plan. I must have been underestimating the value of my new sword to a significant degree. “Let’s go,” I said. </p><p>Both of us were fast enough to ignore the presence of the weaker monsters, so I didn’t expect the trip to take that long. I was wrong. She killed any insect we came across, using vitality attacks, with a fascinated expression on her face. </p><p>It slowed our descent significantly, but I said nothing. The pleasure of watching a skill improve was unmatched even after doing that to more than half a dozen skills. For Eleanor, it was a new experience. I didn’t want to interrupt her, but after her third detour, I had to speak. “Come on, miss swords master, we are wasting time,” I warned her. </p><p>“No we’re not,” she said, her voice determined. </p><p>“Look, the faster we arrive at the fourth floor, the faster I can design you a sword that might give you a mana manipulation skill,” I said. “But, if you want to waste that opportunity, it’s your choice.” </p><p>“Wait, you can do that,” she said. </p><p>“Maybe,” I responded, leery to commit it fully. “I have several ideas in mind, but whether they will work immediately or not, I don’t know. We need to experiment a lot.” </p><p>“Like how you have been experimenting with Maria,” she said. For some reason, her tone was suspicious. Only when it was followed by a sudden realization, I understood where she was coming from. </p><p>”Yes. I might have slightly obfuscated how necessary those experiments were to help me repair the swords faster,” I said, avoiding her gaze. I had no problem with that decision itself, but admitting the act of lying was never comfortable.  </p><p>“You have a lot to atone for,” she said, trying to look stern, but her smile was hard to hide. She didn’t seem to care a lot about it, which didn’t surprise me. After all, it was that act of lying that saved her life just an hour ago. </p><p>“So … a dagger as well?” I countered. </p><p>Her smile slid away. “If you think you can get away with a mere dagger, you’re delusional. I need a full set of armor. Non-negotiable.” </p><p>“You drive a hard bargain,” I said, somehow maintaining a serious expression. “Now, let’s go. We have dungeon bosses to hunt.” </p><p>With that done, we started running full speed to the fourth floor. “So, you also use a spear,” she commented as we moved. </p><p>“It’s good to have a style that focuses on mobility and deflection,” I responded. “You might think to add that as an external skill, assuming you have an empty slot.” </p><p>“I do.” </p><p>“Good, “ I said, then paused. “Then, why didn’t you learn one? It wouldn’t be as strong as your main style, but even with all the advantages, an additional style can be helpful.” </p><p>“Mostly because of a lack of time. Focusing on my main skill was the more efficient approach. Anything below Rare is too useless, and developing a Rare skill requires months even with access to a fitting dungeon. At least, it was supposed to,” she corrected. </p><p>“Well, we just have to replicate it for you,” I said. “I have struggled with that a lot as well, but it’s not that difficult once one discovers the trick behind it. We can try it once we arrive at my base. I have a few Rare Breeze Spear samples. And, I still need some time to forge your armor.” She looked hopeful. “Not one based on my Epic skill, that needs two full days,” I corrected. “But, you still need an armor set that can resist the natural corrosion of the fifth floor.” </p><p>“Fine. I guess it’s a good way to utilize that downtime,” she admitted. </p><p>I smiled, happy to see that her obsession with improving her sword skills didn’t mean she refused a chance to diversify her abilities. And I knew that, with her Dexterity, her own variant of Breeze Spear would turn into a devastating weapon that could easily surpass mine. </p><p>Especially since she lacked a phobia that turned its biggest advantage useless.</p><p>We chatted even as we passed through another gate and arrived at the fourth floor, and a thicker mist surrounded us, making me glad for increased visibility. Though, not as much as it would have if it wasn’t for the fog that hung above the swamp, which was annoying. </p><p>“Disgusting place,” she growled even as her feet sank into the mud. “I was so glad when we discovered the corrosive effect would prevent us from exploring the place.” </p><p>“Understandable,” I said. “Wading through mud is not exactly my idea of a fun time either.” </p><p>“Yet, you decided to build your base here,” she said. </p><p>I shrugged. “Not because I love the environment,” I said. “But, as a Blacksmith who can forge equipment that can resist the corrosion of this place, its strategic value is far more important than the less-than-pleasant environment.” </p><p>“Fair. And, how the hell do you manage to find your path here? There’s nothing for wayfinding.” </p><p>“Here,” I said as I crouched, pushing the mud away to show her the rails I had buried. “I laid them before. My skills allow me to detect their presence.” </p><p>“You went through all that trouble just to find your path.” </p><p>“No, it helps to move the carts around,” I said. </p><p>“Carts, really?” she said even as we continued to run despite the mud. “Do you really need that much effort just to move a bunch of arrowheads around,” she asked. </p><p>“Well, no,” I said even as we continued to move. “But that’s not the only thing I move around. After all, I have a proper base here.” </p><p>“Calling a dinky little shack a base is a bit grandiose even for you, professor,” she teased. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, letting the discussion linger as we continued to move until we finally arrived at my base. The moment her vision range touched the edge of the trees, a gasp escaped her mouth. “Not bad for a dinky little shack, is it?” I asked smugly. </p><p>“Well …” she said as she gazed upon my base, impressed. Her reaction was understandable, as the structure rose from the swamp as a single, monolithic structure, surrounded by multiple blast furnaces and steam engines. And, around them, there were almost ten discrete rings of trees to keep the base safe from the monsters.  </p><p>It looked good, mostly because I had decided to put my excess of available metal to good use. Knowing that the fifth floor was too hostile to set up a permanent base — the persistent attacks from the boss monsters and air that put a vat of acid to shame was decisive enough — further incentivized me to put some more effort into my base. </p><p>Eleanor’s shock was a nice side benefit. </p><p>“I have to admit, it’s not as horrible as I imagined,” she responded, then smirked. “For a dingy little base, of course.” </p><p>I didn’t bother answering her even as I disappeared inside, and came out with two things. A modified weapon, halfway between a sword and a spear to help her switch between the skills, which I threw at her, handle first, and as she grabbed that, I threw a copy of Rare Breeze Spear skill. “I’m sure this will keep you busy for a while.” </p><p>“Explain how I am going to power-level the skill first,” she said. “And, what’s this abomination?” </p><p>I shrugged. “Simple,” I said as I raised my hand. She threw it back. “Just start treating it as a sword, and start channeling a vitality attack. Then, halfway in, switch to your spear skill, and complete that attack. Considering you’re using an Epic skill as a template, it should work.” </p><p>“That’s it?” she said. </p><p>“Yep, that’s it. Trivial,” I said. “Now, why don’t you play with it while I go and start working on your armor.” Seeing her enthusiasm, I had to quickly add a correction. “The temporary one.” </p><p>“Fine,” she growled playfully as she raised her hand, and the skill orb disappeared. She grunted as she closed her eyes, her discomfort clear. </p><p>I left to forge her armor. </p>
