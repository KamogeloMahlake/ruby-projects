        <p>I had enough time to finish my sandwich, change my clothes, and pour a glass of scotch for myself before Camilla’s arrival. When I heard the knock, I was sitting on my couch, wearing a pair of shorts and a loose t-shirt, already half-drained my glass. “The door is open, just come in,” I called as I shuffled in my seat, trying to get even more comfortable. I heard the door closing, followed by the distinctive click of the lock. Smart, I thought. Camilla had no mysteries about what awaited her here, and if her willingness to isolate herself was any indicator, she had no problem with it as well. Apparently, proving to her that I had the tools to tame her tormentor went a long way to earn her acceptance. </p><p>Despite that, it wasn’t hard to detect the hesitancy in her steps as she walked into the room, unsurprisingly, still wearing the same clothes she had been wearing in Megan’s room, equally successful in hiding her amazing figure in real life. It was good that I was prepared to address that horrible problem after greetings were out of the way. “How are you, my sweet assistant,” I asked while shook my glass softly, filling my nose with the sharp but delicious smell of high-quality scotch while the amber liquid danced in the glass in a circular motion. </p><p>“I’m well enough, professor,” she said obediently, only the slightest hitch in her tone as she stood straight, her wringing hands betraying her stress. That, and the way she avoided my gaze studiously. </p><p>“You should be,” I said with a smirk, unable to hide the signs of pride of a job well done. “Did you enjoy your gift?”</p><p>On her face, confusion battled as she tried to decide between admitting her enjoyment or trying to play it off, the former she only thought possible because she was unaware of my real-time video feed, giving me a prime view of her sudden bout of dominance. I hoped that she didn’t get too addicted to the experience, as rest of the night was going to be running under the theme of submissiveness instead. </p><p>After a lengthy panic, she simply nodded, assuming accurately that hiding her enjoyment served no purpose. “Excellent,” I said. “Is there anything that wasn’t for your enjoyment, or something we can add for the next session. Handcuffs? Or maybe you would like to drag our favorite redheaded beauty around campus in chains like a badly-behaved puppy.” The sudden excitement on her face at the last mention surprised me, and laughter escaped my lips. </p><p>“Do you think something like that is possible,” she asked, overwhelmed by her sudden burst of excitement enough to forget her caution. </p><p>“Maybe, but certainly not in anytime close,” I answered, slightly misleading her. Forcing Megan into a desperation enough to consider that wasn’t an impossibility, but it was unnecessarily risky. It would either break her fully, or cause her to lash out, and neither was ideal for long term success. “But let’s focus on the present for now. In particular, the payment for today’s little gift.” </p><p>I examined her face carefully, trying to get a sense of her mood after my demand. Her intensifying blush was not a surprise, but it wasn’t enough to hide the hint of excitement underneath. It made me quite happy, as it could have been revulsion or fear just as easily. It seemed that my luck truly recovered after that disastrous heist attempt. </p><p>I didn’t need to say anything before her hands grabbed the hem of her blouse, preparing to pull it off before I stopped her with a gesture. She stopped instantly, her expression confused, trying to understand if she had made a mistake or misunderstood my intentions. “You have new clothes waiting for you in the bathroom,” I told her. “Why don’t you be a doll and change into them before we move into the main event. Sooner you can get rid of those abominations that hide your beauty, the better.” </p><p>She froze for a moment before nodding, then turned her back to me, her steps flickering, indecisive. I could see her hands shaking as she tried to process my new order, afraid of what she was going to find waiting for her in the bathroom. An unnecessary fear, as there was no scary toy waiting for her there, only some alternative clothing that I picked up for her beautiful figure. </p><p>Contrary to my expectations, I hadn’t had to wait for long before she stepped out of the bathroom, clad in the gifts I had picked for her while I was shopping for Amelia’s gift. I said nothing, just watched hungrily as she slowly walked towards me. I took note of the subtle sway that was absent from her steps just moments ago, suggesting, despite her raging blush, she was enjoying the image change she had just gone through. </p><p>I waited until she stood in front of me to show my excitement. “Marvelous,” I exclaimed even as I made a show of dragging my gaze from bottom to top in agonizing slowness. Her feet were naked, discounting black fishnet socks I had picked for her, climbing up to the middle of her thighs, which had failed to do their task of covering her legs rather spectacularly. My gaze climbed upwards to meet with her plied skirt, red and black adding a splash of color to otherwise monochrome ensemble, which was straining to do its job to cover her bottom even when she was standing perfectly still, barely enough to hide the fact that whether she was also wearing the thong I had picked for her.</p><p>After the skirt, I had met with a large expanse of skin as I ‘carelessly’ forgot to pick a top for her to wear, leaving her thin, lacy, strapless bra as the only piece to protect the modesty of her voluptuous chest, a task that it was horribly failing due to the rather large size and the incredible perkiness of her breasts. All told, they were just one wrong move away from escaping their alluring prison. </p><p>I didn’t bother saying anything, just bent my raised finger inward, and she took a step towards me. She was about to add a second step when I raised my hand, stopped her, then my finger moved in an approximation of a circle. Despite her hesitance, she followed my command and twirled. She was slow in her turn, trying to prevent an accident, but it was a vain attempt. Her twirl,  even in its agonizing slowness, was enough to make her skirt rise, which was enough to reveal the answer of my earlier question about her thong, positively of course. And to make things even better, her thong was failing in its task of covering her body worse than her bra was doing. “Simply exquisite,” I murmured. Then, in a sudden display of mercy, I added. “You seem tired, why don’t you take a seat.” </p><p>She directed herself towards the empty space next to me until I patted my lap, informing her about my alternative views about what constituted an acceptable seat, and she changed her direction. Her blush intensified even further, but she didn’t delay while she took her new seat. She made an effort to stay away from the rather obvious tent in my shorts, courtesy of the amazing show she had been displaying. Which would not be borne, I decided as I sent a disappointed glare to her. She tried to avoid my gaze, but after a warning flick to her knee, she slid closer, directly above my length, earning a moan of satisfaction from me as her warmth infused me despite the layers of cloth that separated us. She was even more excited that her face suggested. </p><p>I decided to leverage our closeness further, and wrapped my arm around her naked midsection in a casual gesture. “So, tell me. What’s your first impression of your new clothing. Are they to your liking?” </p><p>She shuffled uncomfortably upon being put to spot like that, a move that only made my smile widen even further. She didn’t answer, so I put my finger to her spine, leveraging the convenience of her naked back. I dragged my up, causing her to shiver sexily. “Yes,” she murmured. “They are beautiful.” </p><p>“And would you like to walk outside like this,” I asked, even as my finger continued its journey towards the clasp of her bra. </p><p>“No!” she answered panickedly, trying to jump away from my lap, which my arm prevented. </p><p>“Calm down,” I said even as I patted her back gently. “Don’t worry, I have no intention of sharing you, even the beautiful vision of your body to this extent. You’re my assistant, after all.” I chuckled before continuing. “Still, tell me how do you feel while dressed in your new clothes.” </p><p>It took a while for her to answer, and it required some coaxing in the form of my finger, moving on the path that her spine created, causing her to shiver helplessly. She started squirming on my lap, which worked excellently to enhance the pleasure I was feeling. “It feels … good,” she murmured soon after. I wasn’t sure whether she was talking about the clothes, or the result of her squirming. Or maybe both.  </p><p>“Give me some details,” I said while I put my hand on her thigh, to the exact spot her fishnet socks came to an end. It was a casual gesture that would go unnoticed as habitual intimacy in a situation less sexually charged, but her subtle shiver left no doubt about whether she understood its full significance. </p><p>“It’s different,” she murmured, which turned into a moan halfway in as I dragged my hand upward her leg. “I felt naked, no worse than naked, signaling things that I shouldn’t be thinking about. I felt like a stripper.” A deep breath interrupted her explanation. “But then, that feeling started to excite me, like I enjoyed being a stripper. Is it wrong to feel that way…” </p><p>The question, taken in its face value, seemed deep, but the soft moan that followed all but admitted that she was just trying to rationalize her enjoyment. And I was quite happy to help with that aim. “Of course not,” I whispered as my hand disappeared under her skirt. “You’re just trying to find your true self, and there is nothing wrong with some experimentation with your looks.” My fingers found her bountiful booty, and she shivered. “Actually, since you liked them so much, maybe we should go shopping together tomorrow to pick a few more items, maybe something that would better fit your needs.” </p><p>She opened her mouth to answer, but it turned into a sharp gasp, shortly followed by a lingering moan when I used the opportunity to lean forward and plant a lingering kiss on her neck, followed by a soft nibble. Her hand found my neck, preparing to push me back in reflex. It seemed that her brief foray as a discount-dominatrix ingrained her with some unwelcome reflex. Normally I would have punished such a move harshly, but with Camilla’s fragile confidence, it would have harmed more than helping, forcing me to search for alternative options. </p><p>Luckily, with her current state of dress, I wasn’t exactly starved for options. With a swift move, I leaned down to catch the edge of her strapless bra with my teeth. Meanwhile, my fingers found the hook of her bra, rendering it useless in one smooth movement. So, when she pushed me back, she inadvertently became instrumental in getting rid of her bra, leaving her bountiful breasts bereft of any cover. “Excited much,” I said amusedly after I let her bra to drop to the ground. </p><p>“No-” she tried to say, trying to convince me that it had been a mistake. While it would have been fun to listen to her panicked explanation about how it was just a mistake, I had more interesting tasks for her beautiful lips, such as moaning with pleasure. To bring that to reality, I leaned forward and captured her nipple between my teeth, the slightest pressure enough to trigger a helpless gasp.</p><p>Of course, that was just a start. One of my hands moved to her other breasts, gently cupping her sensitive skin before she could raise a word in process, and sinking into her supple flesh proved enough to convert her gasp into a continuous chain of moans. Emboldened, I squeezed her breast, adding just the right amount of pain to her tone, something she enjoyed just as much if her squirming, too rhythmic to be an escape attempt. </p><p>My other hand was roaming freely over her body with her complete acceptance, and I was more than willing to test her limits. Considering I had been sucking her breasts rather enthusiastically, there was only one spot remaining that might convince her to put a resistance. My free hand, which was gently caressing her belly at the moment, started to slip lower. </p><p>A transition over the area that was covered by her skirt, my fingers were on her legs, enjoying the plumpness of her thighs. An instant later, my fingers reversed direction, taking the same route of arrival, but with one major difference, tunneling into the confines of her skirt rather than going above it. Soon, they were in the sweet spot between her legs, the coverage of her silky underwear might as well not exist in terms of limiting the sensation. </p><p>The rapid increase in her moans was not a surprise, luckily, she had enough presence of mind to modulate them just enough not to alarm the neighbors with the help of her hands, pressing against her lips to suppress the excess. And with my mouth occupied with the task of leaving a trail of hickeys over her breast, there was a distinct lack of speaking, which made the moment even better. </p><p> It didn’t take long for until her last fortress of resistance started to crumble, and soon, her surrender was complete, marked by the changing movement of her hips, adding a circular motion, exact opposite to the movements of my fingers, causing friction that enhanced her pleasure even further. With her resistance abandoned, her desire was replaced with an attempt to drive towards a climax as quickly as possible. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had no intention of giving her such a quick escape. She needed to earn her release. I pulled back without warning, leaving her to blink in confusion. “Stand up,” I ordered. She looked at me, still trying to process the sudden transformation. “Do I need to repeat my order?” I asked in a tone that could be categorized as menacing, and she jumped up to her feet, her chest tumbled impressively thanks to her sudden movement. </p><p>I could see a burst of panic dominating her demeanor as she tried to understand her mistake that led to a sudden shift. “Relax,” I said to her while I patted her leg comfortingly, though, in her aroused state, it was just another touch of enjoyment. “You have done nothing wrong. I just decided to call a stop to our little warm-up exercise. It’s finally the time for the main course.” </p><p>“Ma-main course,” she repeated, her nervousness painfully apparent once more, enough to momentarily drown her arousal. Luckily, her arousal was not far from the surface. </p><p>“Yes, the main course,” I said. “You didn’t think that we will be dry-humping all-night-long like high school students, did you? Now, be a good girl and remove my shorts.” </p><p>She was far too deep in our deal to ignore a direct order like it, not that I thought she actually wanted to do so with her arousal hidden under the surface. Still, her movements were slow and her hesitancy was clear as she leaned forward, each passing second bringing her amazing breasts closer to my face. Only thanks to my willpower I was able to pull myself back from sinking my teeth into them, to finally leave a hickey deep enough not to recover in a day. </p><p>Unaware of my thoughts, she was doing her best to avoid my gaze as her fingers hooked at the waist of my shorts, her grip very fragile. I raised my hips to allow her to pull uninterrupted. She met with another surprise when she pulled them down, instead of meeting with the view of my boxers like she had been expecting, her gaze was suddenly filled with a devouring view of my naked shaft. “So big,” she murmured dazedly as she paused, her eyes moving up and down as if she was trying to convince herself it wasn’t an illusion. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie,” I said, spurring her to panicked action once more. “We have a lot of things to do, and at this pace, we’ll be still on it at dusk.” Suitably warned, her movements quickened and she completed her task in a couple of seconds, leaving my lower half-naked. With that, there was only one barrier left between us and fun times. “Good, now, get rid of your thong. I want unrestricted access.” </p><p>She was even slower as her hands slid under her skirt, her legs crossed slightly in a poor attempt to hide her wetness. I let it slide, more interested in the way her underwear moved downward, barely slowed down by her fishnet, until it met with the ground. “Done,” she murmured. She stood up, her arms on the side, trusting her skirt to cover her slit, which it barely managed to do, and only when she was standing completely still. </p><p>“Now, take your seat,” I ordered, watching her face carefully for any sign of rebelliousness. On that, she managed to surprise me pleasantly and started moving with almost no delay. She sat on my lap, but carefully avoided sitting on my erection, which I allowed. I wanted to play with her a bit more before the final move. </p><p>I pushed her skirt out of the way with a negligent swipe and sank my fingers into her plump bottom, enjoying the shapely softness of her flesh in a roughness that contrasted with my earlier soft touches, but she was suitably aroused to not to make a big deal of it. I continued my aggressive massage for a while before pulling her close, and she suddenly found herself above my length, her wet lips leaving a delicious trail on it, from bottom to top. “Excellent,” I murmured, enjoying the sensation she had left in her tracks. </p><p>I watched her as she froze due to her new seating arrangement. It wasn’t the first time she was taking this particular seat, but apparently, that wasn’t enough to prevent a small panic attack she experienced. Luckily, that panic attack proved to be short-lived, and she started to move up and down over my shaft in her own volition, hesitant at first, but quickly picking up speed until she was dancing over my shaft up and down with an increasing fervor that burnt up her hesitation. </p><p>This time, it was me that had to struggle to keep my moans of appreciation in, as the last thing I needed was her to get a big head about her impact. Luckily, I had a better tool than my hands to use as a gag. I leaned down to latch her amazing breasts, simultaneously suppressing my need to moan rather loudly while creating the same need for her. </p><p>I was dying to ask her about how she was feeling, curious about how she would react when she was forced to commentate on the shameful actions she was conducting. I was willing to bet that she was going to blush adorably as she stammered, but failing to come up with a coherent explanation. But this time, I decided to forgo that in favor of examining her increasing rush of pleasure. I was too enthusiastic about the next step to actually delay in the current position. </p><p>Just like the previous times, all it took was a gesture to make her stop despite her obvious display of pleasure. “It’s time for the actual payment,” I said with a smirk. She looked at me questioningly, but didn’t actually ask for it. “You know what it is,” I commented, and she nodded in a surprising display of calmness despite her barely restrained excitement. At that moment, I was happy that Megan wasn’t into play with toys, which was the only reason Camilla’s virginity was intact, incidentally giving me an excellent opportunity to cement my position for her. </p><p>She took a deep breath, and nodded resolutely. In response, I pulled my hands away from her body. Grabbing her hips and impaling her would be very simple at this point, but I wanted her to surrender her virginity without direct involvement from my end. I want her to be completely aware of what was going on in there.  </p><p>She raised herself, and I prepared myself in anticipation, but instead of lowering herself, she reached for the clasp of her skirt, and pulled it loose. That surprised me. I was expecting her to rely on its cover as a psychological crutch, dispelling it like that took more confidence than I had thought she possessed. Still, it wasn’t worthy of a comment, so I focused on watching her instead. </p><p>I had been thinking that as she pushed through that monumental step, her submissiveness would be the main factor, but much to my surprise, there was hungry excitement that was dancing behind her eyes, stronger than any other emotions, suggesting that maybe I had been underestimating her. For how much, I was hungry to learn.  </p><p>She said nothing as she lowered herself on my shaft, her lower lips wrapping around my crown. I couldn’t help but moan in excitement as her warmth infused my skin. Her lips parted open, mirroring my pleasure, tempting me to catch them in a searing kiss that would blow her mind. But I kept back, not wanting to blur the significance of the moment. </p><p>I kept my gaze on her eyes as she slowly lowered herself. My crown disappeared between her wet lips. Her expression started to strain as her virgin hole tried to accommodate my girth, but that did nothing to dampen her anticipation, spiking as she moved deeper and deeper. In a primal part of herself, she understood that in a moment, everything was going to change… </p><p>She came to a sudden stop the moment I felt the presence of a barrier, cutting my way towards ecstasy. She looked at me questioningly, trying to process her situation one last time. Whatever she must be searching for, she found, because her resolution steeled as she pushed herself down, a soft gasp escaped her mouth as she surrendered her virginity. </p><p>Even more surprisingly, she didn’t stop her descent, and continued to devour my shaft until it was halfway in. There, she stopped, her physical limits preventing her from continuing. But she wasn’t nothing if she wasn’t stubborn. She pulled herself up quickly, and pushed herself down just as quick, causing a warm sensation of pleasure to spread over my shaft while she overcame her restrictions to push even deeper.  </p><p>Such a conviction deserved its reward, I decided as I leaned forward, capturing her lips in a heated kiss, catching her in surprise with my sudden intimacy. My tongue jumped to the fray a moment later, boosting her already burning flames of desire into a roaring inferno. Her lips were quick to reply, trying to follow my rhythm in an unfamiliar tango. </p><p>Her hips hadn’t lost much time before starting to move once again, up and down, hesitant at first, slowly picking up speed with each repeat as she started to get used to my presence, though her tightness was still phenomenal. She was clumsy, but her enthusiasm was more than enough to cover for it. </p><p>Soon, she was grinding on my lap with a reckless abandon, so I decided to give her another reward. My hands started to roam over her body, exploring her body, finding more and more sensitive spots. Then, one of my hands slid over her breasts, circling around her nipples to boost her arousal further. </p><p>With everything that had happened to her earlier, it wasn’t a big surprise when she suddenly stopped, her grinding replaced by quakes of an orgasm, big enough to push her towards the unconsciousness. </p><p>That wouldn’t do, I decided as I grabbed her hips to pin them in place, in a point suitably above my hips to allow the delivery of a consistent assault, in the same rhythm of a jackhammer, breaking her orgasmic haze. I kept the pace for a minute until I was on the edge as well. “Ready yourself,” I said with a self-satisfied tone, warning her of my impending release. </p><p>“Not inside!” she exclaimed, but she lacked the energy to actually pull away from my grip. I pulled her hips lower, depositing my full length inside her before I started spraying her insides. </p><p>There was a unique satisfaction in filling up a naive girl that was a virgin just moments ago, even her expression of horror enhancing my enjoyment. For a moment, I let the silence to stretch, while in her, I could feel my shaft coming back to life. “Don’t worry, I have a couple of after-night pills that would prevent any accident,” I said, consoling her about the risk.</p><p>“Really?” she asked, her fears lessened. </p><p>I nodded. “And since we solved that, there is nothing preventing us from truly celebrating your important milestone,” I said even as I gripped her waist, and threw her on the couch, her legs open invitingly…</p>
