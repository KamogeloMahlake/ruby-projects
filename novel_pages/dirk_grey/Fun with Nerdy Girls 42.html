        <p>The challenge of studying with Carrie didn’t reduce the slightest as I finished writing the first draft of my essay and passed it to her to give feedback and moved on to my next task, my physics homework. </p><p>It wasn’t that she didn’t help. She certainly did, whispering an accurate explanation whenever I got stuck in a question. And her explanations were impeccable, not only helping me to solve the question accurately, but also deepening my understanding of the topic, visibly improving my performance. </p><p>I didn’t instantly turn into a straight-A student, of course, but I had a feeling that, if she continued like that, the first year of college would be much smoother than I expected, allowing me to dedicate myself to my training fully rather than splitting my attention. </p><p>Though, I had another thought, one that I didn’t verbalize to her yet, fearing the implications of such a question. Maybe I should convince her to attend a college in the same city, or even the same college. After all, the college I was going to, in addition to having a competitive football team, was also good enough to be on the upper parts of the list of Ivy League colleges. </p><p>Technically, there were better schools for football I could go to, but that was the only one my father found acceptable, and since his reasons were good, I was unable to argue. He reasonably pointed out that, even for the best recruits, a professional career was only a possibility, and the school had an amazing business school I would attend simultaneously — the same one that my father had graduated from —  so that I would have a strong fallback option in case of failure.  </p><p>And as much as I wanted to be a professional player, I was aware that the odds were not on my side.  </p><p>Yet, as Carrie whispered some more important physics facts to my ear, I focused on the present and turned my attention to her. Carrie didn’t mention anything about her destination college, but I had a feeling that, a student of her caliber, she had already received her acceptance letter in the first recruitment round. </p><p>I ignored the topic as I let my pen dance on the paper as Carrie squeezed my shoulders once more while asking a question. “Do you have any other homework?” she asked. </p><p>“No, that’s the last of them,” I said. “Then, we can —“ I started, only to gasp as her fingers dug into my shoulders warningly. It wasn’t enough to leave a mark, but it was enough to silence me. </p><p>“Then we can do some free studying,” she whispered. “We need to make sure your algebra is up to par for the finals.” </p><p>Under normal circumstances, I would have rejected the idea of free study, especially after finishing three assignments in one sitting. But it was miraculous just how much my mind could be changed by the weight of a certain part of her anatomy pressing against my back, moving up and down… </p><p>“Whatever you planned for me, ma’am,” I whispered, doing my best to sound respectful, but it was impossible to restrain the heat in my tone, not with every time she lowered herself, a certain part of my anatomy doing its best to drill through my basketball shorts, denying their baggy nature. </p><p>As I was about to open the workbook, however, she pulled back, and after a slight shuffle, no doubt digging through her bag. I couldn’t help but turn to look at her, only to see her bending down fully, her skirt riding up to reveal her amazing thighs, looking particularly beautiful in red thigh-high stockings connected to her garter belt. </p><p>Even the edge of her delicious ass was peeking through, though, unfortunately, the skirt still managed to keep her core hidden, if barely.</p><p>Though, the sight of her perfect globes was more than enough to compensate for that lack. Her legs were just wide enough to give a perfect glimpse of her skin while her nipples stayed hidden behind the blocking of her legs. </p><p>An amazing sight, I decided as I returned to my work, not wanting her to notice I was ogling her, giving some respect to the persona she decided to display. </p><p>And since I had turned back, I didn’t realize the book she was carrying until it hit on the desk, thick enough to make an impressive thumping sound, a glance enough to show that it was actually a college-level book, and certainly not the first-year one. </p><p>‘Basics of Mathematical Proofs’, along with its leather-bound dark cover, didn’t give an easy impression. </p><p>I prepared to complain, as there were levels of studying that even Carrie couldn’t convince me — or so I thought until she plopped herself down to my lap, her naked back pressing against my chest. </p><p>It turned out that I could be convinced to study more complicated topics if the appropriate incentives were presented. “I know the topic seems complicated for you, and you think that it is unnecessary for a business major, but I had researched, and most of the stock market algorithms are actually based on real analysis principles. I’m sure having some knowledge would help you immensely.” </p><p>“Whatever you say, ma’am,” I whispered as I wrapped my hand around her waist, finally feeling the warmth of her skin under my fingertips. “I’m willing to learn whatever you’re willing to teach, as long as you explain,” I whispered. </p><p>Admittedly, a part of my willingness came from the opportunity to pay her back. A fact that didn’t take long for her to realize as my fingers moved up, brushing against the underside of her breasts, making her tremble softly. </p><p>“As long as you can help me decipher it,” I whispered again, leaving no doubt about what I had been planning. </p><p>“G-good,” she stammered, her earlier confidence quick to crack under the receiving side of the deal, especially with the arousal she experienced yesterday, hearing the stories of the amazing show her besties put together. </p><p>“The first thing about mathematical proofs is to create a representation of the concept if possible —,” she started, only to be interrupted by a moan as I squeezed her breasts, my fingers disappearing into her flesh. </p><p>“Sorry, what was that last part,” I said mockingly, couldn’t help but be amused at her reaction now that the aggression changed sides. </p><p>She turned just enough to send me an angry glare, though, considering her pouty lips were still parted as if begging for more, it wasn’t exactly a scary move. Yet, I let my fingers go down regardless. </p><p>I still wanted to torture her more before we moved to the main event… </p><p>And, as my aggressive interventions stopped for a moment, she continued her explanation about the art of proofs. To her credit, despite the complexity of the topic, she was explaining it incredibly well, good enough for me to develop a rudimentary understanding despite the distraction on my lap, slowly rocking. </p><p>Admittedly, that movement wasn’t entirely her fault. Just because I decided against overt didn’t mean that I stopped completely. I had long put my hands on her thighs, pushing and pulling to enhance the soft rocking of her hips even more, giving my extended erection the simulation it had been searching for. </p><p>As my indirect masturbation quickened, her poor, unsupported breasts joined the dance, jiggling and dancing in a way only her perfect breasts could achieve. </p><p>She started to let out gasps of pleasure, but it was the evidence of her academic integrity that she smoothly moved to the first sample proof she had prepared — simple from her perspective, but complicated from mine, explaining why somehow, real numbers and fractional numbers were different kinds of infinities. </p><p>It didn’t seem like something that would be useful in my career, certainly, but I didn’t poke that detail after all the effort Carrie put into her curriculum. </p><p>I would certainly be a better student if every class was delivered privately by an enthusiastic blonde that was suffering from a deficiency in her clothing. </p><p>However, as she finished her proof and moved on to the next one — a monstrous, eight-page mess that somehow proved real numbers existed. Though, as she went through her explanation quickly, line by line, my fingers climbed back to her breasts once more, though, this time, dancing gently around her nipples rather than squeezing aggressively. </p><p>As she had reached the third page of the proof, I had long lost the ability to follow her explanation, and that had little to do with the beautiful distraction on my lap. I simply couldn’t have followed her explanation, even under the best of circumstances. </p><p>The subject was simply too unfamiliar for me. </p><p>It was different for Carrie, whose explanation was slowly getting slower. Her enthusiasm was proof that she was familiar with the subject, but even with the familiarity and her impressive intellect, it was hard to accurately explain a complicated mathematical proof while my fingers conducted a distracting dance over her breasts.</p><p>“… and then, going back to line…” she delivered another line, only for it to fade halfway as she looked confused, clearly losing track of her words. “And then…” she repeated, hoping to find her track of thought, he gaze attentively. </p><p>She might even succeed if it wasn’t for my lips, pressing against her neck to steal a kiss. Instead, she moaned, losing the last hints of her explanation in the flood of pleasure. </p><p>“Such a disappointment,” I murmured as I grabbed her waist, and without a warning, pushed her on the desk, face first, her beautiful ass pointing upward, her deficient pencil skirt struggling to keep everything hidden, but no more successful than her latest attempt of tutoring. </p><p>“Wh-what are you going to do?” she stammered, trying to sound fearful, but the arousal in her tone was simply too dominant. </p><p>“Punish you, of course, so that you can learn to take your job more seriously.” </p>
