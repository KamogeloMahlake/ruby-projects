        <p>A cute cry escaped Carrie’s mouth as I wrapped my arms around her waist, only to use it as leverage to switch positions without even pulling out. Her gaze bounced between my face and the ceiling, unable to decide where to look, when her phone, which was sitting on the bedside table, chose that exact moment to ring. </p><p>“It’s Sarah,” I said as I passed it to her rather than declining the call. Her reaction was far too cute for me to do otherwise. However, I was entertained more than I expected when rather than rejecting the call, she pressed the little green icon on the screen. </p><p>“Carrie, where the hell are you?” reached Sarah’s voice from the other side of the phone. Her tone was sharp and domineering. “Your mom just called me to confirm whether we need anything in our little sleepover. Why don’t I know we’re having a sleepover?” </p><p>“S-sorry,” Carrie stammered even as a thick blush covered her body as she forced herself to speak as she processed our current situation. Naked, with my shaft still inside her, rapidly growing back to full size after my climax. “I forget to tell you about it.” </p><p>“That’s not the issue,” she answered, her tone still sharp, but with a protective instinct. “The important thing is, where are you?” </p><p>“I-” she tried to start, only to stammer for a moment, forcing her to start speaking. “I’m with Chad.” She managed to say. </p><p>“Again?” Sarah answered, her panic disappearing completely, replaced by exasperation, though her tone was still sharp. That seemed to be a part of her personality unrelated to the situation, as it wasn’t too different from her attitude when we studied in the library together for a small while. “Your crush on him was cute at first-” she tried to say, only to be interrupted by a shocked gasp of Carrie. </p><p>“Sarah!” she exclaimed. </p><p>“He’s not sitting next to you, is he?” Sarah answered. </p><p>“No,” Carrie answered with a trembling tone. Which, technically, was the truth. I wasn’t sitting next to her. I was hovering above her, with my considerable length hidden inside her wetness, making it harder for her to speak every passing second. </p><p>“Then there’s no problem talking about your little crush and your hopes of getting close to him by helping him study,” Sarah answered condescendingly. “You have to know you can’t get your first kiss by helping him finish his homework.” </p><p>“H-hey,” Carrie stammered. “That’s not what we’re doing.” </p><p>“So, you haven’t gone to his house to study,” Sarah said, her superior tone getting thicker, which was making Carrie blush more and more. I decided to add a little more challenge to my sexy blonde by starting to move, distracting her from her next words. </p><p>“Maybe-” Carrie started heatedly, seemingly angered enough to spill the beans, only to stop as she tried to contain a moan. </p><p>Her little break was enough for Sarah to jump back into the discussion. “Of course you went to do homework,” she commented in confidence. “Sweetie, I know he’s a touch better in shape than other nerdy boys, but that doesn’t mean he has any confidence. You at least need to hint him that you want to see a movie or get a nice dinner if you want to get a kiss before the school year ends,” she commented without bothering to hide her humor, clearly enjoying ribbing her friend. </p><p>“Makes sense, invite me to a date, and maybe you’ll manage to get a kiss,” I whispered softly enough for her phone not to pick while I once again pushed myself into her depths. Which was sufficiently distracting for Carrie, who stayed silent as she tried to contain her moans, while Sarah started to give many recommendations —and not for the first time if the speed she was going through the list was any indicator. </p><p>“That’s enough,” Carrie managed to say, but that took almost a minute to do so, her attention grabbed by the way I was sliding in and out slowly but steadily. “He might come in any moment, I need to go,” she said, unaware of the other implications of her words as she hurried to end the call. </p><p>“So, I might come in any moment,” I said mockingly even as I pushed inside her to remind them about her unintentional slip. “I hope you’re not calling me a quick-shot.” </p><p>“No! Not that! I didn’t-” she started panickedly, showing a potential to go for a long while as her shame drove her, so I chose to extinguish that particular one with another kiss. “Sorry about Sarah,” she said after I finally let her breathe, though I was slowly but repeatedly pushing inside her, keeping her wet but away from a climax. “She means well, but…”</p><p>“She’s a protective friend that doesn’t realize you grew up,” I completed her sentence. While I might be giving Carrie’s initiative more credit than it might deserve, considering the activity we were currently busy with, being generous wasn’t something anyone could fault me for. “But I’m sure you don’t want to waste time talking about Sarah’s misconceptions about your lack of initiative, right?” </p><p>“Right,” she murmured, blushing, which was immediately followed by a gasp as I pushed in her sharply.</p><p>“Excellent, then let’s have some fun,” I said even as my hips quickened. I put my hands on her body, softly caressing her sensitive spots in a way that contrasted greatly with my furious pumping. After all the time we wasted on extended foreplay, I knew exactly how to play her body like a musical instrument. I could use even the most casual touch to make her moan, and what I had been using was far from what could be classified as casual. </p><p>I was determined to make her first time a memorable event. </p><p>Playing with my shy, nerdy blonde was proving to be even more fun than I expected, however, as her hands started to caress my body in response, galvanized by Sarah’s call. I leaned down and pressed my lips against her neck, making her moan gently while I continued to impale her. Her back arched, taking a surprising initiative to grab my hair, pushing me harder against her skin. I couldn’t help but smirk in amusement as I witnessed her develop rougher habits immediately after her first time. I didn’t say anything though, as she was obviously enjoying it, and it would be a lie to say I disliked it. </p><p>Her moans intensified as I moved down. First, I nibbled her collarbone to make her gasp loudly. Then, I arrived at her gloriously round breasts, assaulting her sensitive nipples with my tongue and lips until her moans turned into an unbroken string, leaving her breathless. I chose that exact moment to pull out, leaving her gasping and panting in shock. “What happened?” she managed to ask, dazedly. </p><p>“It’s time to change position,” I reminded her. “Move on all fours, I want to see your beautiful ass while I take you.” She blushed, but that didn’t prevent her from following my direction and coming on all fours, her back arched erotically while her tits dangled down. I pressed my shaft against her entrance, sliding into her core without the slightest resistance. “How does it feel?” I asked even as I grabbed her hair, pulling it as hard as she had been moments ago. </p><p>“Amazing,” she answered as she pushed her hips back to force me even deeper into her. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I picked up speed, thrusting into her aggressively while her moans filled the room once again. “Someone is enjoying the treatment,” I commented mockingly even as my shaft exploded against her bottom again and again. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, followed by another loud cry as I pushed inside her. “This feels amazing, like I’m filled completely,” she followed. </p><p>“Better than the other position?” I asked, curious about the answer, though it was mostly about making her talk. It was fun to force her to talk while all she wanted to do was to moan. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she moaned, her voice once again showing its shy quality. Apparently, forcing her to talk about the pleasure she was feeling was much more difficult than asking her to give her body for those positions. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said. “Don’t you have any preference?” I added even as I pulled her hair back, making her gasp while the sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room. </p><p>“I don’t know, both are nice,” she managed to say. </p><p>“How about this?” I asked as I pulled back, only to leave the bed. I dragged her along as well, of course, until she found herself locked between the wall and my body, her beautiful blue eyes widened in shock. She rose to her toes as I pushed inside her, her tits dangling with the movement. Luckily, my body was more than enough to keep her in place as her feet left the ground and wrapped around my waist, giving me the chance to grab her tits aggressively, making her moan. Her face contorted with a beautiful mixture of shyness, desire, and surrender, tempting me to pump even more aggressively. </p><p>“It seems that you enjoy this one even more.” </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured, and raised her hands to cover her face, though that did nothing about the tightness of her legs around my waist. </p><p>“Don’t cover your face,” I ordered, rewarding her with a kiss when she pulled her hands away. “Enjoy the moment fully.” They weren’t the most insightful comment, but luckily, Carrie was too distracted by her upcoming orgasm to pay attention to the literary merits of my words. At this point, it was a small miracle that she was coherent enough to listen to my words and respond. </p><p>When I finally captured her lips again. It didn’t take long for her to finally climax. I just continued pumping into her, not giving her a moment to breathe. “It feels … so good,” she gasped dazedly, even when I started walking around the room, my hands digging into her ass to keep her in place. I walked toward the shower, leveraging the advantages of the empty house by walking around naked. But such an incredible moment had its costs, as I was rapidly closing into the point of climax. Giving her a nice creampie was tempting, but it wasn’t the only temptation. </p><p>I finally pulled out of her when we reached the shower, the hot water blasting with full strength, getting rid of our sweat. She collapsed on the floor, and I leveraged the perfect angle to cover her tits with my seed while she just moaned dazedly. Unfortunately, the hot water was quick to wash them away. “Open wide,” I ordered immediately, and she followed without a delay, obediently taking my shaft into her mouth, her tongue creating a delicious impact on my shaft… </p><p>She said nothing, just wrapped her lips around the entirety of my shaft, which was an easy job to do in its flaccid state. But under the assault from her warm mouth, assisted by her clumsy but enthusiastic tongue, it immediately started to grow, making it harder and harder for her to keep a hold. When it was halfway up, she surrendered and pulled back, but it continued its growth, large enough to press against her lips even after she pulled back, her head pressing against the shower wall. </p><p>“It’s too big,” she murmured. </p><p>“You’re not a quitter,” I answered. “You’re an overachiever, and I trust you,” I said, which was enough for her to wrap her lips around my shaft even as I groaned under the massage of the shower. </p><p>Being friends with a nerd was turning out to be significantly more fun than I had been expecting…</p>
