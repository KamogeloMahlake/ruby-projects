        <p>“That was a fun adventure,” I said even as I was about to slip to my side of the car, when Megan threw the cars to me. </p><p>From the way she drove, I knew that she had no problem driving herself, but looking at her face, I didn’t reject it. Clearly, she was another part of her revenge against her ex. </p><p>I didn’t try to give them back, as driving a delicious red convertible was hardly a chore. However, since she was pushing that much, I decided to push my luck. “So, do you want to give that lap dance now, or later?” </p><p>That earned an angry glare of her, but that didn’t affect her smile, nor made her shout. “Ah, the bet,”  she murmured, her smile gaining a dangerous quality. “May I interest you in exchange? Maybe I can pick the bill for your car repair.” </p><p>I was tempted, dangerously so, but ultimately, it was her tone that annoyed me. Like it was a given, that I was going to surrender just because she was willing to help me financially. That touched my pride, and I had a tendency to overreact when that happened. </p><p>Luckily for her, I actually liked her merciless nature, so rather than doing something more drastic, I decided to attack just back. I shrugged. “We can’t forget it altogether if you don’t think you can handle it,” I said, with a smirk that explained the teasing was intentional. </p><p>“Oh, you think I can’t handle it?” she said, her tone just enough to trigger my danger sense. </p><p>But just because she was being dangerous didn’t mean I was going to let her slip that victory. “I call it as I see it. We had a bet, and now that you lost, you don’t want to do what you promised. I’m just giving you the card you’re looking for.” </p><p>Her smile tightened, making my neck tingle. “Oh, you think like that,” she said even as she put her hand on my shoulder and pushed me on the driver’s seat. “I’ll show you how well I can handle it.” </p><p>Before I could even answer, I found her on my lap, her blonde hair spilling against my chest. Interesting, I thought even as she dared to do it, right in the middle of the party, where anyone could stumble on it. I wasn’t expecting her to get that committed proving me wrong. </p><p>Then, I noticed the glance she threw toward the party, with absolutely no hint of hesitation, and adjusted that train of thought. She was much more deliberate than I thought, and her objective clear. </p><p>If she was going to give a lap dance for a bet, she was going to use that to twist that knife even deeper into the reputation of her ex. </p><p>Her dance started with an interesting note. She leaned, whispering to my ear. “Try to touch me, and I break your finger.” </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I said, her angry growl giving it as much pleasure as the way her hips started to rub against my lap. </p><p>She moved according to the beat of the music blaring at the party. Her hands landed on my shoulders, her soft touch enough to earn my full attention, her movement steadily. </p><p>Which was another surprise. With her earlier reluctance, I would have expected her to do the sheer minimum, maybe a few pumps, before vacating my lap. Instead, she pressed her weight down, just enough to send shivers of pleasure through my body. </p><p>Her hips followed the rhythm of the music, getting faster and slower as needed. Her hands slipped into my hair, leaning down sensually like she was about to kiss me, her breath dancing over my lips, but she didn’t connect. </p><p>Meanwhile, I could see more than one person outside, pointing toward us, even taking some pictures, no doubt enhancing the already raging gossip landscape even further. </p><p>“We’ll have a lot of pictures of us running around,” I said. </p><p>“I know,” she answered even as she leaned back, arching her body to push her tits against my face. “Aren’t you a lucky bastard? It’ll help your manly reputation very much. Once our little game stops, you’re going to beat the cheerleaders with a stick  to get a moment of rest.”</p><p>I had several stick jokes I could make even as she danced on my lap, hardening a certain part of my body to resemble a stick, but there was something to be said about tasteless jokes, at least targeting the girl responsible for said hardening. No need to kill the mood. </p><p>“It’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make to help my newest friend get her revenge,” I said, not bothering to hide my sarcasm. </p><p>“Such a big sacrifice,” she commented just as the music picked up the rhythm, and her hips responded with a great rapid movement. Her hips undulated back to forth relentlessly, pushing me toward a climax much faster than I expected. </p><p>“Yes, such a big sacrifice,” I said.</p><p>Her hands traveled down, cupping my balls over my clothes with a surprising aggressiveness. “I hope that you’re smart enough to delay it until we break up officially,” she whispered, even though, for an outside observer, she was whispering like sweet nothings to my ear. </p><p>“I’m yours for the next week, sweetheart,” I answered with a chuckle, ironically, appreciating her threat. She was clearly coming from a well-off family, and she had seen my car as well. There were a lot more effective threats she could have tapped that were more convincing, but she stayed on the physical side of it.</p><p>Just like her not bothering to push the money aspect for our earlier bet, she kept the threats at the same playing level. </p><p>It was surprisingly considerate of her.  </p><p>Of course, that consideration didn’t mean that she wasn’t extremely vicious, because just as my body was starting to tremble in anticipation, the song changed once again, and she deposed my lap. “That’s enough, right,” she whispered smugly from the passenger seat. “Two songs for a lap dance.” </p><p>“Well played,” I said even as I started driving, earning a small cheer from the party, which, unsurprisingly, once again started by Thad, who definitely didn’t miss an opportunity to twist the knife any deeper. </p><p>“I don’t know what you mean,” Megan chuckled even as I started driving. </p><p>“Of course you don’t,” I said, making no comment on the way she had left a couple of buttons unlocked to extend the torture, just to keep my boxers uncomfortably tight. </p><p>Such a vindictive little vixen. </p><p>We drove silently for a while before I realized I forgot something important. “Do you mind if we drove to my car? I think I forgot the keys to my dorm there.” </p><p>“Sure,” she said even as she flicked down another button, revealing more of her lacy bra, and the amazing breasts barely hidden by them. “I don’t have anything to do.” </p><p>I chuckled as I pressed the gas pedal, showing her that she wasn’t the only one who knew how to drive. However, that didn’t mean much, not when we found ourselves in front of my car. </p><p>More accurately, remains of my car… </p><p>Someone had smashed it, and not just one window trying to see if they could hotwire it. Every single window was broken, the tires slashed. The hood was open, revealing the engine, or more accurately, the shambles of an engine, as every single pipe was broken, and most of the cables were cut. </p><p>“Give me a minute,” I said with a deadly silent tone when Megan tried to say something, and left the car, only for a noticeable smile to hit to my nose. They didn’t just ruin my car, but thoroughly ruined it, making sure it was a deliberate insult. </p><p>I said nothing, just made sure that I got a good glimpse of the car before turning back, not even bothering to pick the key. </p><p>I had no doubt who was responsible for it. </p><p>When I returned to my car, Megan looked at me with a solemn expression. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know they would go this far-“ she started, but before she could explain further, I raised my hand, silencing her. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said, keeping my voice soft. But if the way she flinched was any indicator, my tone missed the mark. </p><p>I just drove toward my dorm, my bone-white fingers white around the wheel. Megan said nothing even as we arrived at my dorm and I left the driver’s seat, leaving it for her. “I can make sure-“ she started, but I raised my hand to silence her. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I can handle my own revenge.” </p>
