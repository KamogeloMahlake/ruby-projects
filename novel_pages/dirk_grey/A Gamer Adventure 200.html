        <p>The smile bloomed on Marianne’s face as she found herself in a new position, one that signified the massage was over. </p><p>“About time,” she growled as she shifted in her place, trying to get comfortable. Titania said nothing, but that didn’t mean her answer was more subdued. Her lips were busy with letting out a delicious moan. </p><p>Understandable, as Marianne’s shuffle on top of her didn’t exactly help her to get calm after her spectacular climax. </p><p>I paused for a moment, enjoying the scene of their beautiful bodies rubbing against each other, especially the beautiful sight of their breasts pressing against each other, dominated by the weight of the moment. </p><p>Yet, Marianne didn’t seem to be happy about that pause. “Hurry up,” she whispered, gasping loudly as she did so. </p><p>“Such impatience,” I whispered even as I slapped her ass, enjoying the moan that escaped her mouth, particularly the way her flesh rippled. “Don’t worry, I’ll start working on you properly. But first, let’s make sure that our dear librarian doesn’t say anything. You know that I’m too shy to handle a sudden comment. What if she hurts my confidence.” </p><p>“Yes. You’re a walking embodiment of embarrassment, I’m sure you can’t handle a little comment,” Marianne said as she chuckled. </p><p>“Of course I am,” I said, even with the Subterfuge, barely managing to sound serious. “Now, start working on silencing her.” </p><p>“As you wish,” Marianne answered as she leaned down, showing that while she enjoyed the banter, she didn’t enjoy it as much as what she wanted to start. </p><p>“W-wait —“ Titania murmured panicked, but, with the closeness of their lips, that was all she was able to utter before Marianne’s lips landed on their target, burying the rest of her attempt rather efficiently. Marianne was more than enthusiastic as she launched her assault, enjoying the sweetness of Titania’s mouth. </p><p>Though, considering the way their tongue twirled with great practice, I couldn’t help but assume our after-battle celebration wasn’t the only time they had been practicing that particular move. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I twirled my fingers into Marianne’s soft blonde hair, giving just enough pull to extract a little gasp, but not enough to pull her back from the kiss. “You’re certainly benefiting from lots and lots of practice.” </p><p>Titania’s tongue stilled at the notification, but Marianne just continued to kiss. Seeing Marianne getting comfortable with some girl-on-girl action was not exactly a big revelation, not with how our little relationship started. </p><p>That didn’t mean that it was impossible to interrupt her, of course. There were several ways to do so, ranging in various difficulties and impacts. </p><p>I chose the most direct way and slid inside her, not that the simplicity meant the impact was limited. Already aroused from the show she had been watching, the sudden push triggered Marianne, resulting in a spectacular moan that forced her to pull back from the kiss. </p><p>One that she didn’t return, but Titania didn’t seem to mind, especially when Marianne started kissing her neck instead, occasionally alternating to light nibbles to trigger her pleasure even more. Titania didn’t respond, too busy moaning in pleasure. </p><p>And, keeping her included even gave me a little surprise reward. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>Luckily for Marianne, I was there to compensate for Titania’s lack of response. I grabbed her amazing hips, enjoying their tightness even as I created leverage, then started pushing my hips. </p><p>Which came with its own reward. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 76%]</p><p>As my hips started picking up speed, Marianne’s moans started to get more frequent, to the point of neglecting Titania’s neck, allowing her to finally get a handle of the haze of the pleasure. </p><p>I managed to catch her eyes when Marianne’s back arched after a particularly hard push. “She’s being too loud,” I said to Titania. “Why don’t you help her keep silent so her voice doesn’t alert any nearby beasts.” </p><p>As far as the excuses go, that was a rather lazy one, considering that three of us were not only capable enough to defeat a hostile army theoretically but literally had done so a few days ago, and no monster that could be found in the wild would have been a threat to us. </p><p>At least, not any monsters that would still need to depend on our voices to find us. </p><p>However, at the moment, with her mind blanked in pleasure, Titania lacked the mental alacrity to point out that fact. Not that she would have chosen to argue at that point even if she was in a better mental state, not with the rush she caught Marianne’s lips like she was just waiting for an excuse. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at Titania’s attitude, impressing me with her shyness. It seemed that her habit of authority was still not translating to the bedroom — or the other places where we experienced our fun. </p><p>I decided to help her a bit. “Marianne is moving too much, why don’t you help me with that as well by wrapping your beautiful legs around her waist so that she can slow down.” </p><p>Her embarrassment didn’t slow her response to direct order. Her legs, deceptively strong despite their thinness — a fact that I was intimately familiar with — wrapped around Marianne’s waist, slowing her wild rocking. </p><p>Marianne let out a surprised grunt that managed to escape Titania’s attempts to silence her, showing that she was not as intimately familiar with the strength hidden in her legs. Which would have suggested a lack of physical contact between them if it wasn’t for the familiarity of her kiss, but with that, the real reason was clear. </p><p>Titania had stayed passive enough to keep that as a secret during their little carnal games, to the point that she had never employed her full physical strength even for the purposes of fun.</p><p>What a waste, especially with such a soft beauty like Marianne that enjoyed the other side of the little games of domination. Not that seeing my blonde busty healer taking the dominant role for once wasn’t extremely entertaining. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 78%]</p><p>Under the double assault, Marianne’s companion progress was paying dividends rather rapidly. I decided to give a little reward as well, the kind that actually impacted her combat ability. </p><p>[-2310 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Tantric] </p><p>Her moan intensified as my mana invaded her body, but she didn’t bother to comment on the sudden rush of experience, far too familiar with the phenomenon to bother even wasting a second on that. </p><p>I smiled at the relative ease Tantric had gained another small improvement — though I was aware that there wouldn’t be a lot of people that would classify spending more than two thousand mana in a single burst as a trivial achievement. </p><p>I continued my urgent assault, but not in a steady manner. After all, with the great effort, she was showing, Titania had earned a more direct involvement. I pulled out Marianne — immediately replacing the resulting lack of attention with my fingers — only to slip right back into Titania, which changed their roles about who was responsible for silencing, and who was the one being silenced. </p><p>To their credit, their lips never parted even as alternated between them, lost in the pleasure of the moment. </p><p>It was a beautiful moment, I decided even as I tightened my grip around Marianne’s hair and pushed her down, forcing her to intensify their kiss even as I impaled her repeatedly from behind. </p><p>“I’m sure you didn’t work closely with the students, but as the head librarian, you need to learn how to take a firm hand with the students. You can’t just assume you can intimidate them,” I explained, even though I doubted Titania was in a state to process that explanation. </p><p>Marianne stiffened slightly, showing that she didn’t appreciate my push, but under my merciless pounding, she was unable to comment even before I added a light sprinkle of spanks to the mix. </p><p>With no words, the beautiful meadow we were enjoying was filled with moans, spanks, and cries of ecstasy, their attention split between my alternating assault and the attention of each other. </p><p>My hips continued to move in an endless rhythm, the growing pleasure allowing me to get more and more </p><p>I continued pushing my hips, wanting nothing more than to get lost in pleasure as deeply as the two beauties in front of me… </p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>Unfortunately, I had another task. </p><p>Understanding what was going on with the Companion Process. </p><p>After all, with my growing distrust of the System, it would be a silly thing to continue to rely on the System in such a fundamental aspect of my power. </p><p>And, in that area, there were several questions to answer. </p><p>Why did completions in Companion Process was rewarding me with incredible bursts of experience? Why it was allowing me to gather mana one at a speed that reached the point of impossible through perks? Why it was giving me incredible perks that were several times more useful than levels — even at the risk of being dangerously explosive? </p><p>And, most importantly… </p><p>Whether I could replicate it without the assistance of the System… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 33 Experience: 532660 / 561000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6732 / 6732 Mana: 6728 / 8250 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [102/110]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>
