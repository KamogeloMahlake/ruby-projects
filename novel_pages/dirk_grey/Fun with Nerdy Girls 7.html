        <p>A few seconds after she had made her decision, Carrie remembered that she was covered in cum, and beat a hasty retreat toward the shower. While following her was rather tempting, I instead moved to the bedroom, removing some of the more obvious mess, making the room as presentable as possible, before I went back to the corridor. </p><p>“I’ll be downstairs, watching TV,” I said to her even as the water blasted on the other side of the door. </p><p>“Umm, would you mind bringing my bag from my car, it’s on the backseat,” Carrie murmured. “I forgot to bring that up.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said, doing my best not to chuckle in a way she might hear. I was amused by the fact that she had brought an overnight bag for her, even after her revealing —extremely revealing in her standards— way she dressed. </p><p>Maybe that was the way of the nerdy girls, slow at first, but rather aggressive once their initial hesitancy was broken.  </p><p>“I’ll leave it at the bathroom door, so you can pick it up whenever you want,” I said, then I picked the bag up and left there, rejecting the temptation to browse its content, wanting to keep its contents as a surprise. After her earlier ensemble, I was curious what she had as a nightie, or whether she actually had any. Then, I stopped in my bedroom for a quick change before taking the stairs. </p><p>Downstairs, I put some game tape, repeating some of the more complicated plays while scribbling on a piece of paper, doing my best to analyze the schemes. For all the violence it contained, football was a complicated game, especially for a quarterback. </p><p>I lost myself in the study, until I heard a pleasant voice calling me from the upstairs. “I’m ready,” she said as she peeked from the corner, only her head visible, her blush ever-present, pulling her head away the moment I turned to look up, her blonde hair swaying at the motion. </p><p>I chuckled at her sudden shyness. Considering what we had done on —or more accurately, under— my desk, and the fact that we would be sharing a bed in a few moments, her display of shyness was patently ridiculous, but amusing nonetheless. </p><p>After turning off the TV and tidying up my game notes —with care much greater than I had paid to my homework— I climbed up the stairs, toward my bedroom. </p><p>Only to find it almost unrecognizable. Admittedly, there weren’t a lot of changes, but the lights were off, and a couple of scented candles were burning at strategic locations, giving the room a completely different aura. Of course, for this, the real role went to Carrie, sitting on the side of the bed with her eyes fixed on the floor, who had the honor of being the first girl to enter my new bedroom. </p><p>She was beautiful enough to take my breath. She was wearing a long, satin nightie with a lot of lace, faded crimson, and significantly out of fashion, reminding me of a sixties housewife, loose enough to hide her curves, no hint of cleavage, and almost long enough to cover her knees even when she was sitting, but paradoxically, it somehow worked better than the most revealing lingerie possible. Not because it was sexy, but it underlined the paradox of her innocence and her desire at the same time. </p><p>“You look beautiful,” I said even as I walked closer, caressing her cheek gently. When she looked up, I captured her lips in a soft, lingering kiss that made her moan helplessly. When I pulled back, her expression was flickering between shock and desire, giving me the confidence that if I pushed her down, there would be no resistance, and her compliant joining wasn’t too far away. </p><p>Instead, I passed her, and lay on the other side of the bed, slipping under the covers. “It’s getting late,” I said, making no attempt to hide my shit-eating grin. </p><p>She puffed with a cute display of momentary flare of anger, clearly not had enough of the kiss, but lacking the confidence to push for more. Still, she didn’t say anything as she slipped under the covers as well, snuggling under the covers, her body just at the right side for me to envelop as the small spoon. “Good night,” I whispered into her ear and kissed her cheek gently, and put my head on the pillow once more. </p><p>“Good night,” she replied, her voice barely above a trembling whisper, but her tone wasn’t trembling as badly as her body as she pressed her body against mine, strained with anticipation. After that, a warm silence filled the room, the flickers of the scented candles or the cinnamon smell weren’t exactly helpful in reducing the heat of the moment. Her body pressed against mine, enjoying our closeness. I hugged her waist, pulling her even closer, until my shaft was pressing against her plump bottom. </p><p>A minute passed, then two, then five, but the sleep proved elusive even for me… For Carrie, it was pure torture, of the sweetest kind. When the silence was stretching to fifteen, Carrie started shuffling in her place as if she was trying to bury herself deeper into my embrace, getting tenser with each passing second. Her hips moved, burying my shaft deeper into the delicious valley between her plump cheeks. </p><p>I was tempted enough to pull her nightie up and slide it between her naked cheeks, but I held back, feeling morbidly curious just how long she would be able to resist. Though, I wasn’t able to keep myself from cheating just a bit, caressing her stomach rhythmically whenever she moved, making it impossible for her to settle down her senses under the constant stream of low-level arousal. </p><p>Teasing her like this was amusing and erotic at the same time, which was a rare experience for me. My previous experience was geared toward the explosive side, so that even if the act itself took a long time thanks to my stamina, the events leading to that had always followed a predictable pattern, usually resolved in minutes of being alone with the cheerleader of the week. Teasing Carrie slowly while her arousal built up further and further was an interesting experience. </p><p>However, when we were nearing the half-hour mark, I was starting to question the wisdom of my decision, no matter how fun it was at the beginning. Teasing her was entertaining, but my erection —which was inevitable while her ass constantly wiggling against my crotch— was starting to become rather painful. I decided to give her a little push. “You know you don’t have to hold yourself back, right?” I whispered directly into her ear, my breath caressing her skin. </p><p>It turned out that Carrie was struggling even worse than I was, because that was all that she needed to pull out of my embrace and push me on my back with surprising enthusiasm and strength. Then, she climbed on top of me, sitting at my midsection, the coverslipping away as she moved. However, once she was there, she stalled. I gave her an encouraging smile, but said nothing, giving her time to process what she was feeling properly. </p><p>Despite her hesitancy, it didn’t take long for her lips to find mine once again, taking control of the kiss for the first time, her tongue invading my mouth, conveying her burning desire, her out of character passion telling just how much she had been affected by the extended absence. Just like I had expected, just hugging affected her much worse than it did affect me. </p><p>Soon, her fingers grabbed my hair painfully, squeezing helplessly as she ravaged my mouth with her tongue with the desperation of a traveler lost in a desert, finally taking the first sip of water. What she lacked in experience, she was more than able to make up with her enthusiasm.</p><p>Then, she proved to me that even then, I had been underestimating her enthusiasm, when her hands deserted my hair, only for them to end up around my shorts, pushing them down along with my boxers. “Someone is enthusiastic,” I murmured, fascinated by the expression of concentration on her face as she pulled away from the kiss, only to pull her nightie up, enough for my naked shaft to touch the hidden area underneath… </p><p>Only to receive another little surprise. Under her conservative nightwear, a rather important part was completely absent, her panties. I bit my lips, glad that I hadn’t discovered that particular detail earlier, as I doubted I could have resisted the temptation. </p><p>“Do you mind if I…” she murmured with a shyness even as she mounted me, trying to align herself with my erection. </p><p>“Of course not, but we need a condom-” I started, only for her to put her finger on my lips. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I started taking the pill,” she said, even as she blushed thick enough to be visible even with the flickering light of the candles, getting smaller and smaller, once again surprising me with the particularities of what she thought as more shameful. Apparently, birth control was more shameful than preparing to ride me bareback. </p><p>Not that I was complaining, of course. </p><p>I stayed silent while she took the last step to properly ride me the age-old honored position of the cowgirl, though I felt pity that her amazing tits were still hidden behind the cover of her nightie. I didn’t ask her to remove it yet, however, afraid of scaring her just as she was getting brave enough to take the last step on her own. She was visibly shaking in a way I might have mistaken for fear if it wasn’t for the aroused shine in her blue eyes, captivatingly bright.</p><p>Then, she closed her eyes like she was trying to gather courage before the big jump, and her warm frame started sinking deeper over my shaft, her silky smoothness enveloping me completely. She let out a small gasp as she sank herself lower faster than I expected, signaling her graduation from virginity with a delicious gasp that begged me to flip her and impale her mercilessly until she could utter nothing but moans of pleasure. </p><p>But then, she pulled my t-shirt off almost violently before putting her hands on my muscular chest, and I decided to give her a chance. Her eyes still closed, she started rocking her hips wildly, her enthusiasm quickly rising to compensate for her lack of experience, and doing it spectacularly. I waited until the last hints of pain disappeared from her face before I grabbed the hem of her nightie, and freed her of its oppressive coverage with a sharp pull, leaving her body deliciously naked for my attention. </p><p>“No,” she gasped in panic as she wrapped her arms around her breasts reflexively, which made me hold her shoulders to prevent her from collapsing. </p><p>“It’s a bit late to hide these from my view, sweetie,” I said even as I let my hands slide down until they disappeared in the depths of their perkiness, earning a moan in the process. “Don’t you feel trying to hide them at this point, not to mention you have nothing to hide, not with how spectacular they look?” </p><p>“You really think they are beautiful,” she murmured even as her hips started to move once more, but this time, I didn’t sense any hesitancy in her tone. This time, she was simply fishing for compliments rather than trying to assuage her internal doubts. </p><p>Not that I had any problems with paying a few extra compliments to the spectacularly sexy blonde currently riding me to the best of her ability after giving me her virginity just moments ago. “You’re a masterpiece, Carrie,” I said, enjoying the way she quickened at my words. “You’re the most beautiful girl in the school, and luckily, I was the one to discover that,” I added, followed by several more compliments, all firmly in the cheesy territory. </p><p>But if the movement of her hips —and her moans— were any indicator, she had no problem with the cheesiness of the compliments. Though, I had long learned that a thick cock and a muscular chest had a way of making cheesy compliments rather effective. </p><p>I sank deeper into heaven as her movements started to pick up speed, my grunts of pleasure mixing with her moans, her tits dangling beautifully in the prison of my palms with every shake, her silky wetness enveloping my presence deeper and deeper. </p><p>A chuckle escaped my mouth even as she sped up. </p><p>"What?" she murmured dazedly, her eyes open once more without making her hips stop. </p><p>"You’re just so beautiful,” I said sincerely even as I grabbed her hips, leading her to move even faster. “Seeing you naked in my bed, riding me with enthusiasm is a memorable spectacle.”</p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured shyly, but listening to the dance of her hips rather than her words looked like the better option. She decided to silence me the best way possible, leaning down until her lips closed over mine, her tongue burying itself into my mouth once more as her hips started gyrating. Then, she started to tighten in a final manner, putting every single nerve ending in my body to high alert, each thrust and every nibble pushing us steadily toward an explosion. </p><p>Then, her tightness turned into an inescapable prison as she started to shiver, triggering an explosion of my own, declaring an end of her first time as she collapsed against my chest powerlessly, but crying loud enough to make me glad we weren’t in an apartment. </p><p>Of course, the night was just beginning. I had allowed her to warm up, and the real event was about to start…</p>
