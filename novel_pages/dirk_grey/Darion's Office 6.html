        <title>Darion's Office 6</title>

    <body>
        <p>Sakura couldn’t help but feel excited as she walked back to the office, only to see her new coworker alone, without that bitch Janet insulting her.</p><p>She hated working here, but unfortunately, a small marketing agency was the best place she could find work while she was still a student. Now, she had graduated, but at the same time, her boss’ business grew as well. </p><p>“Hi, Darion, is Janet gone?” Sakura said as she smiled. </p><p>“She’s busy. Is everything okay?” he asked. Sakura would be lying if the way he smiled didn’t stir something in her. </p><p>“Not really. With the recent growth of the company, there’s a lot more work, and I didn’t sign up for that, you know,” she explained. “I just wanted a small company to build some credentials, but there’s more and more work, and that bitch is dumping everything on me,” she explained. </p><p>Then, stopped. </p><p>“Did you hear something?” she said as she glanced around, afraid Janet was there. Luckily, she was not. </p><p>“Don’t worry, no one else is here to speak,” Darion answered, his lips quirked, like he was making a joke. “Just continue.” </p><p>She didn’t know why it was exactly a joke, but she chose to chuckle along in case she missed it. </p><p>“It won’t be so bad if the salaries grew as well, but no, they are not giving anything. I’m barely making enough to pay for my room.” </p><p>“Sorry to hear. Why don’t you quit if things are so bad,” he said kindly, and Sakura found herself blushing. </p><p>“I would, but Mia’s reputation for vindictiveness is stopping me. I don’t want to get blacklisted. And not like I can afford to live without a salary.” </p><p>“Why don’t you get a part-time job.” </p><p>“Well, I don’t have time.” </p><p>Darion smiled even wider. “Luckily for you, I know a cafe with flexible hours looking for assistance. Would you be interested…”  </p><p>***</p><p>Janet hated the daze that covered her whole being as she followed his order and opened her lips, her throat filled with the presence of his new coworker. Again. On the same day. </p><p>To make things worse, he was chatting with that Asian whore casually, like she wasn’t even there to pay attention. She wanted to stop and punish him — but she was not adequately dressed for it.  </p><p>Not that it would have helped much, not with her body betraying her, listening to the rational part of her. A part that was getting dimmer with each second with her breathing impeded. She drifted to a  weird place, lost under the confusing feelings that invaded her body. </p><p>And, as she got lost in the pleasure, she lost the ability to reject the invasion of the shockingly thick member that was pressing against her throat, as dangerous as a siege, demanding entrance recklessly. She lost control as he established a foothold in her mouth, in the form of the head of his throbbing member… </p><p>She wanted to listen to what they were talking about, but focusing on their words, at least above trying to understand anything but Sakura’s casual bitching about the job, proved very difficult. </p><p>And, her attention disappeared more and more as he pushed forward, his great muscles turning into an inevitable conclusion as she got invaded, doing her best to stay silent while handling the greatest challenge of her life.</p><p>It was challenging. Not just physically, but mentally as well… She opened her mouth, helpless and gasping. Then, the first gag arrived as he pushed more, teasing the entrance of her throat. </p><p>She forced herself to suppress them as she heard Sakura questioning whether they were alone, but his crown slamming against the entrance of her throat hardly helped. Not when it smashed, again and again, forcing her to get used to the sensation once again. </p><p>A sensation that was pleasurable as much as it was challenging, she realized, shame wrapping around her to replace her missing clothes, breathing getting weaker and weaker… </p><p>“You can try massaging my balls, it will help it end quicker,” he commented, one that told her that their uninvited guest was finally gone. She stood up, anger flaring in her. “What the hell was that!” she gasped, still breathing hard. </p><p>To her shame, she realized her little flare of anger wasn’t working. Not even she took a step forward. Maybe it was about her expression, still showing her arousal.</p><p>Or maybe, it was the fact that she didn’t have a stitch on herself. </p><p>“Is this how you want to play?” he said with a smirk, one that sent shivers in her body. </p><p>“Do you think that I can’t…“ she started, doing her best to sound angry, even though he was correct, and she wanted to do something much more different than just accepting his invasion obediently. </p><p>Her body agreed, if the way her nipples rose in response.</p><p> “You can’t, not before I allow it,” he whispered, his tone making her shiver and tense at the same time. It proved to be the correct reaction, as she felt his arm hooking around her, and she felt her body twisting once again, with no hope of resisting his huge muscles. </p><p>His arm under her chin, and his shaft between her legs to lift her, it wasn’t like she wanted to resist in the first place. Even as that arm wrapped around her, she could feel her ability to deny his strength disappearing rapidly. </p><p>Maybe not too surprising, especially after what she had just experienced earlier, leaving her body with a constant flame.</p><p>“W-we will be caught,” she whispered, which was all she was able to say.  </p><p>“Such a high-maintenance bitch,” he whispered into her ear, which she would have argued against, but her attention was stolen by her own body, aching for more. “Better,” he whispered as they shift a bit. </p><p>Just where the printer would be in front of her, hiding what was going on for a moment. It was not particularly better, but she was unable to say anything. Not when she felt like she was lost in her mind as his great shaft slowly disappeared into her core, stealing her breath. </p><p>She leaned forward, her shoes making it much harder for her to balance, but rather than holding on to the printer, she chose to molest her own breasts. The pleasure was simply too intense to be rejected. </p><p>“You are having trouble standing, right?” Darion said with a chuckle. “Let me help!” </p><p>She wanted to reject that help, but once again, she found it very difficult to reject the grasp of his hands as he played with him like a toy, the invading pleasure turning the moment into a spectacular stretch… </p><p>***</p><p>“… maybe today wouldn’t be too boring,” Lily found herself murmuring as she found herself crouched in a corner of the office, watching the unexpected show she had stumbled upon. </p><p>That annoying secretary of her sister, being railed like a whore, in the middle of the office. “I always know you were a whore,” Lily muttered as she looked toward there. A good distraction, since her sister banned her from going to that weekend retreat…</p><p>For a moment, she thought nothing, just watching the show as she felt stirrings in her body. She was never the one to enjoy porn, but the show that was going in front of her was much more different. The grunts of that monster of a man that her sister hired, grunting in arousal even as he rammed into her again and again. </p><p>“I never thought her to be submissive,” Lily murmured as she watched Janet being lifted and skewered in the middle of the office, doing nothing but gasp in shock. </p><p>It was enough to make her glad about her sister’s decision to drag her back. Otherwise, how would she discover that the new employee was even more interesting than she had expected? </p><p>The perfect weapon to drive her sister crazy…</p>
