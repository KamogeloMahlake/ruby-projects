        <p>Looking at Sapphire’s wordless invitation, I was conflicted. </p><p>On one hand, I had already spent too much time dealing with her back in the cell. And while we had taken a lot of strategic decisions in the process — well, I ordered, and she accepted, but why focus on such unimportant details — I was still facing the looming presence of two mysterious enemies, both threatening to overwhelm and bury not only the Empire, but also the Dark Lands. Every single second was precious. </p><p>Yet, on the other hand, the sight of Sapphire, naked in a corridor that someone else could walk in, her legs still trembling after a spectacular evening, an incredible beauty was not something that could be ignored easily. </p><p>Even with the looming weight of the invasion. </p><p>A growl escaped my mouth as a sudden temptation hit me and I grabbed her arm, dragging her into her royal quarters harshly. </p><p>If she wanted my attention, she would get it. </p><p>With her balance ruined by her trembling legs, she would have toppled down with the slightest push, yet I pushed her hard when we arrived at one of the couches in her room, not even bothering to drag her to her bed. </p><p>Yet, as her back slammed against the seat, the only sound she made was an obedient moan, echoing beautifully in the well-decorated room. </p><p>For a moment, I stood motionless, my gaze glued to her, deliberately keeping my gaze blank and imposing — though my incredible erection was more than enough to fully show my appreciation. </p><p>Yet, as she stood silent, motionless except for her legs, widening to reveal her wet core, it was clear that my intimidating presence was working wonders on her arousal. The reddened marks on her body, particularly on her wrists, delivered by the chains around her wrists, and on her breasts, delivered by my aggressive mauling. </p><p>“Such a little obedient Queen,” I growled as I leaned forward, keeping my expression tight as I grabbed her hair, pulling her lips closer to my crotch as I positioned above her, pinning her under me. </p><p>Helpless, her lips widened to take my presence, unable to moan properly with the impediment blocking her mouth, an impediment soon moved to her throat, forcing her to let out a beautiful string of gags. “Come on, Sapphire,” I whispered, enjoying her soft gasp even as I put my hand on her breasts, adding new red marks to accompany the others. </p><p>When I pulled back to let her breathe, she shuffled it, resting her neck against the armrest, which allowed me to push even deeper into her throat without a fear. As I pushed, she raised her legs helplessly behind me, spreading wide and exposing her beauty even more. </p><p>When I pulled back after lengthy treatment, she was gasping desperately, trying to catch her breath, her physical limits catching up with her. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t give her the time she needed to recover before moving down a bit. Her eyes widened as I positioned between her legs, grabbing her thighs to create an even more favorable angle for an invasion. </p><p>Sapphire let out a gasp, followed by a deep moan as I impaled her once again.</p><p>Although I had been inside her just minutes ago, the new position gave an entirely different feeling, especially since I could push her down even harder, knowing that it wasn’t the hard, rough walls of the prison she was leaning against but the soft and expensive couch in her room worked much better to absorb the hits as I pushed deeper into her, new areas stretching in the depths of her core. </p><p>The sensation was truly incredible, as evidenced by the loudness of her moans as I started fucking her relentlessly, hard and fast, the word gentleness nowhere to be seen as my body slammed against hers over and over. </p><p>Her moans soon turned into grunts, the aggressiveness of the assault enough to break through her ability to exert even the slightest modicum of control over her voice, loud enough to hurt my poor ears. </p><p>However, a little pain was nothing compared to the glory of mercilessly dominating the Queen. It wasn’t the first time we were doing it, of course, nor it was the most spectacular place — that honor was a competition between the throne room and the treasury — but the fact that it was her own living quarters, the place that was supposed to be only for her, secure against any intrusion, gave the moment a unique feel. </p><p>Even more beautiful was her face, nothing but pleasure and pain as she did her best to take my assault without a complaint — not that it seemed to be a difficult challenge for her to abstain from complaining considering the intensity of her moans, occupying her mouth with a more priority task. </p><p>I lost myself in the incredible sensation as I started fucking her even more relentlessly, her breasts swaying under the rocking motion as her body moved back and forth, her back hitting against the armrest repeatedly thanks to the angle. </p><p>Her moans achieved the impossible, getting even louder as she immersed in the sensation, enjoying every single moment of being dominated. At that moment, she was not the Queen, nor she was an exotic dancer that enjoyed teasing men without giving the ultimate reward they searched for. </p><p>She was just a woman, enjoying the domination of her man without the slightest concern. </p><p>Her only active role was to spread her legs even wider, allowing me to push even deeper into her without the slightest obstruction, more like a magical hammer than a man, nailing repeatedly with the rhythmic power only magic could enable. </p><p>The incredible assault lasted for almost half an hour, mercilessly slamming without the slightest break, a miraculous feat that was only possible because I had cheated a little using magic, both to keep my body going, and to keep her wet. </p><p>That little magic certainly didn’t go to waste, not with the chain of climaxes that she had suffered during that period. Yet, even as I continued to drill her mercilessly, she managed to stay conscious despite her orgasms. </p><p>It wasn’t without a cost. Orgasms that left her a reddened, trembling mess, deliciously crying each second despite her cracking voice, mixing with my grunts as my hips slammed against her, fucking her incessantly.</p><p>I pulled back for a fleeting moment as I widened my legs, giving myself a better angle as I continued to slam into her, spreading her core even wider. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but feel mesmerized by her determination as my dick slammed in repeatedly, every slam making her gush more than a spring. Her lips continued to wrap tight around my girth as if they were reluctant to let them go even after the rough treatment that extended. </p><p>“It’s an honor to serve you, Your Majesty,” I said, under the situation a teasing tone not necessary to highlight the mocking undertone. </p><p>Not that she was in any condition to catch that, of course, not with the pleasure blanketing her mind think enough to prevent her from understanding my words in the first place. </p><p>"I'm cumming!" I murmured, finally unable to reject the desire presented by her body, each second a delicious addition. </p><p>She might have been dazed with pleasure, but she proved she wasn’t completely gone by reacting to my words. </p><p>Her reaction was to raise her legs up for a moment before bending them, wrapping them around my waist, trying to pull me deeper. And her twitching arms suggested that she wanted to wrap them around me as well, but my hands on her shoulder, still pinning her down, prevented that from being the case. </p><p>Moreover, it wasn’t a strong move. With her strength sapped by pleasure, the hold on her legs was soft, easy to break through… </p><p>Not that I wanted to do that. I just continued to fuck her mercilessly, enjoying that glorious last few seconds before a spectacular explosion. Soon, my hips started convulsing, each twitch of my shaft filling her insides with a fresh dose of my seed… </p><p>That finally proved too much for Sapphire. Her moans started to lose their luster as she closed her eyes, finally surrendering to the unconsciousness under the domination of pleasure. </p><p>“Such a good Queen,” I said, unable to hide my chuckle as I looked at her, admiring that, even when unconscious, she managed to provide an amazing show. </p><p>“You deserved a proper rest,” I murmured as I lifted her in a bridal hold and carried her to her bed — and after that, since I was there, I carefully updated the wards of her residence to avoid any-last minute disaster. </p><p>And, since I couldn’t trust her to remember everything after such a spectacular encounter, I made sure to leave a note for her, reminding her to contact Valkyrie the first thing after she woke up, and order her to travel to the capital secretly. </p><p>It would be nice to see a familiar face from the past…</p>
