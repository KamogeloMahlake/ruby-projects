        <p>Tara did nothing to resist as her new boss pushed her down. </p><p>It wasn’t the lack of leverage that stopped her … as with her powers, that was certainly not a problem. She just needed to tap into her strength and stretch her neck, and it would have solved it. </p><p>Likely breaking his arm in the process, a fact that he was very much aware of after her accidental reveal. </p><p>She did nothing … because, much to her shame, she liked it. </p><p>No, she loved it, accepting the treatment of being treated roughly, not even letting her take a breather. </p><p>“Beautiful work,” he whispered as her nose touched his skin, the compliment giving her even more pleasure than the treatment. </p><p>She still couldn’t believe that he didn’t send her off. She might be shy, but she was not stupid, and she knew the safest thing was to kick her out and send her identity to the villain whose henchmen attacked the bar. Yet, he stood by her, accepting her. </p><p>Something even her family wouldn’t have done if they knew the truth. She had watched her childhood friend get kicked out of her home because she had powers. </p><p>Yet, her new boss accepted her … wholeheartedly. Compared to that, the way he used her body was nothing. </p><p>Well, not nothing, she corrected herself, a blush of shame mixing the redness that was already covering her body. It was another positive aspect of the situation. </p><p>She had never done more than a few kisses before … no matter what she wanted. She lacked the courage to push for it, but enjoying it as her new boss ordered her to was much better. His hands landed on her breasts, mauling them aggressively, but the pain just enhanced her pleasure further. </p><p>That meant he stopped pushing down her head, but she was a good secretary, and a good secretary only needs to be shown once. She grabbed his legs as she pushed herself down, taking him deep into her throat again and again, his moans of pleasure as thrilling as his orders. </p><p>Up and down, repeatedly, as she did her best to make him cum. “That’s enough,” he suddenly called, and for a moment, she thought that she had made a mistake. As she pulled back, she was ready to apologize, but as she met his eyes, he was already patting his lap. </p><p>“Come here,” he ordered. “Let’s work on your other secretarial skills, like a lapdance.” </p><p>“Yes sir,” she whispered, the demeaning way he talked about her future tasks driving her pleasure even higher. She parted her legs and sat down, properly mounting his lap, his shaft squeezed between their bodies. </p><p>More forward than she thought herself to be capable, but his soft smile was enough to encourage her. “Very good,” he said as he grabbed her ass and pulled her closer, increasing the sensation even further. “Now, move your ass.” </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she said, following his request even as his hands climbed up, caressing along her spine. Somehow, the gentle and innocent touch drove her even crazier than the earlier treatment of her breasts. </p><p>She failed to control her face as the unexpected pleasure flooded her body, making her moan and tremble. Her eyes closed as she tried to process the foreign sensation, giving her a chance to recover. </p><p>Her new boss didn’t agree, as he used that chance to lean forward to start kissing her neck. They were short, almost fleeting, yet somehow searing her skin. </p><p>Well, she wasn’t complaining, even if they left her surprisingly short of breath as he slowly moved down to her collarbones. </p><p>“Don’t forget to move your hips,” he warned, underlining his words with a spank. She gasped, the sudden pain making her pleasure even more pronounced. </p><p>She moved back reflexively, only to stop immediately as his hand landed on the small of her back, enough to remind her about her situation. As his lips landed on her collarbones, she lost her ability to modulate her voice completely, her moans filling the room. </p><p>His hand slipping down once again to maul and caress her plump ass with a renewed aggressiveness certainly helped. Her hips started to move faster and faster, enjoying the way she pressed against her stomach.</p><p>She wanted to do even more things … but even at such a moment, she lacked the courage to move forward without his explicit permission. She abandoned herself to his touch. </p><p>His touch had suddenly dipped down to her wetness, caressing her cilt. The pleasure jolted her as she moved, but his hand stayed in place, caressing gently to show it was not an accident. Nowhere near one, even… </p><p>Her hips moved outside her control, but luckily, he managed to loosen his grip before she moved. Good timing. She wanted to say something about the possible danger, but one of his hands slipped back to her ass, stabilizing her movement, while the other continued to tease her wetness. </p><p>Incredible, but not as incredible as what followed. Before she could even get used to the amazing feeling, he slipped a finger inside, teaching her a new meaning of pleasure. She was having trouble believing that such a pleasure was possible. </p><p>Unable to contain herself, her hips started to move, allowing his finger to do even more work with less effort. She only stopped when his hand froze, afraid something was wrong. Yet, he was smiling. “Continue fucking yourself with my hand,” he ordered. </p><p>The sudden crass words hit her differently, but in the end, they were all kindling to her out-of-control arousal, filling her body to the next stage.</p><p>She moved back and forth with a growing desire and desperation, his finger enough to drive her crazy. Her pleasure rose higher and higher as she abandoned herself to the pleasure she was feeling.</p><p>“Now, give me a kiss, but don’t stop,” he ordered. She was more than happy to follow that order, leaning forward until her breasts were rubbing against his chest. He kept kissing her again and again while her hips danced … barely registering when he added a second finger. </p><p>She was aware that it was the last opportunity for her to pull back if she wanted to stop … but she didn’t want that. It was simply incomprehensible. </p><p>She moaned again and again, lost in pleasure … lost enough that she didn’t register the absence of his hand that had been on her ass earlier … until he managed to lead her hands to her back and wrapped them around her wrists. </p><p>It shouldn’t have mattered. After all, she didn’t even need to exert herself fully to free herself. </p><p>Yet, it felt even stronger than one of the mysterious weapons the villains used against the strength-type heroes. The reason was not a mystery. It was the gaze of her new boss, who was a handsome but rough man… Two details that she loved. </p><p>“Who said you to stop moving your ass,” he ordered, and she started moving once more, his fingers pushing her closer and closer toward climax. The skill he displayed as he kissed her again and again wasn’t making her any easier to resist. She breathed hard, repeatedly, occasionally moving back hard enough to touch the desk behind her. </p><p>Meanwhile, his hand started to wander on her body, treating her like a toy as he repeatedly slapped her ass, twisted her nipples, and caressed along her spine … she just gasped and moaned, some suppressed by his lips, the others radiating freely. </p><p>He started to get more aggressive as she got closer to her climax. Soon, his fingers started moving, the resulting pleasure far more intense than what she could gain with her own effort. She just surrendered herself to the pleasure. </p><p>Yet, that made him move even faster. With an expression of savage satisfaction that drove her even deeper into the pleasure, he added another finger, curled them, and invaded her thoroughly, like he was the one with the super strength, and she was a poor damsel. </p><p>She loved it. </p><p>As his fingers plunged into her depths with incredible precision, her face twisted in a perverse joy, her face glowing with pleasure until she found herself wondering how she managed not to flicker into the fire. </p><p>Her mouth opened for a final time as the pleasure hit her with an intensity that she never thought to be possible. She tried to contain them, yet her climax made that impossible, her whole body trembling. </p><p>She collapsed against his chest, his heartbeat feeling like a lullaby after his aggression, her hands still bound behind her. She could stay like that forever…</p><p>“Stand up,” he ordered. </p><p>Unless her boss wanted otherwise, of course. She immediately jumped up to her feet, ignoring both her trembling legs and her bound arms. </p><p>“Now, for the next step, I want you to take a position that’s worthy of a secretary,” he added. </p><p>Tara didn’t waste even a second before she lay against the desk, her naked ass turned toward him, ready for what he had in mind. </p><p>“Smart girl,” he whispered, which gave her even more pleasure than the earlier treatment. </p><p>Her new job was … excellent.</p>
