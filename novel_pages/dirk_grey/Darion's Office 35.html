        <p>Mia was not an easy woman to surprise. After all, she was a self-actualized woman who managed to build an incredible business that was rapidly becoming one of the most successful agencies in the state, not to mention beautiful and confident. </p><p>But, she felt that she had lost some of her famous control since she had decided to pull a pretty incredible prank to trick Madam Paisley about the process. All she needed was to claim Darion was her boyfriend, and let her have some fun. </p><p>And, it wasn’t like she was doing a disservice to Darion. Along with the money she planned to offer to him to play along, the situation also offered quite a bit of fun. She might have a taste for domination, but that didn’t change the fact that Madam Paisley was still drop-dead gorgeous. </p><p>Things had worked excellently during the sea show. Of course, Mia didn’t dare to get closer, and when she stopped swimming, Madam Paisley was already gone. But she got the deal, meaning she was satisfied. </p><p>If she was being honest, Mia liked the idea of Darion being dominated. It was a good revenge after the price he demanded. A price that was fun for her to pay … but that didn’t change the fact that it was humiliating. </p><p>However, her ability to stay calm was destroyed handily when the bathroom door opened, revealing Darion and Paisley, naked and hugging. It wasn’t their pornographic state that surprised Mia. It was what she assumed was happening when Darion followed her. The fact that they were using the staff bathroom was a bit confusing, but understandable from the perspective of looking for a private spot. </p><p>What truly surprised Mia was the nature of their state. Darion hugged Madam Paisley from behind, drilling repeatedly with a smirk on his face, while Madam Paisley wore an expression of pleasure of shame, one that implied that she had lost all control. </p><p>Mia could read that expression. It was the same expression Mia had after Darion left her office after their deal… </p><p>“Hi, honey. You don’t mind, do you?” Darion said, breaking the silence … well, silence if she discounted Paisley’s desperate moans. </p><p>“I … mind,” Mia said, stammering uncharacteristically. But, seeing Madam Paisley, the woman who left her mark on the business world was surprising. </p><p>“Of course. You’re my girlfriend, after all. It’s normal for you to be weak enough not to watch it, even if you’re the one who traded me away. Don’t you think so, Madam Paisley,” he said, his voice mocking. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she moaned, avoiding Mia’s gaze. </p><p>Mia would have left, but being called weak annoyed her … especially right after that whore Gina claimed the same. She said nothing, but caught his gaze, showing that she had no intention of leaving. </p><p>Also, if she were being honest to herself, watching Paisley being dominated even worse than herself felt good. </p><p>“Excellent, but let’s make you fit in,” Darion said. </p><p>“What—“ Mia said, but before she could even finish it, he reached and pulled her dress down. “Hey,” she continued. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie. You don’t want Madam Paisley to feel self-conscious, do you?” Darion said, like that was even a possibility with the way he was invading her from behind. Mia knew very well how effective it was to forget everything. </p><p>Mia looked at the mirror, realizing that she was in an incredibly disadvantageous position. Not physically, but mentally. If she were to have any hope of controlling the warped deal between them, getting away was the better idea. But staying had its benefits as well…</p><p>She turned her back, but before she could make a decision, Paisley coughed. A cough that sounded suspiciously like a coward. </p><p>“Of course, I’ll stay,” Mia said as she pushed her dress down. Paisley must have been dreaming if she thought she was still intimidating in her current state. “Now, let me help,” she said as she moved in front of Paisley’s naked body, ready to help. </p><p>Darion lifted Paisley’s leg, giving Mia even better access as she slid underneath, using both her tongue and her finger aggressively to trigger her moans, their desperate nature making her feel even more incredible. </p><p>“Come on, Paisley. Mia did the generous thing and shared with me. Why don’t you pay her back,” he said. </p><p>Mia stood up, and Paisley started licking her nipples, making her moan in desire. Paisley certainly knew how to use her tongue… With that, Mia abandoned herself to pleasure, cycling between poses, their pleasure lasting for almost an hour. </p><p>She was just glad that they weren’t caught.</p>
