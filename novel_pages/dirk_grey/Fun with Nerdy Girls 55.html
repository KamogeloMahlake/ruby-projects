        <p>I felt happy as I drove away from Irene’s house, leaving her very satisfied with our photo shoot. The same didn’t apply to our photographer, which was a pity. </p><p>Still, after her naughty tricks, she had certainly deserved punishment, and a night of suffering was a good punishment. </p><p>I drove a bit as I tried to decide what to do, but a message saved me from making such a decision. ‘I need help, save me,’ the message read, and it was from Carrie. </p><p>Luckily, she was smart enough to attach a photo of Sarah, taken subtly to show her words were an exaggeration, followed by a location notification. It looked like they were in a coffee shop. </p><p>Yet, Carrie managed to be naughty there as well. She took the photo from a low angle, one that showed that despite Sarah’s modest outfit — a blouse and a knee-length skirt — I would benefit from visiting.</p><p>Owing to her daring underwear selection, enough to prove she was still the most courageous one among their friends. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured even as I changed my route, curious of the exact nature of her problem. </p><p>My best guess, it was a follow-up of Sarah’s suspicious glares at the lunch table. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to cover the distance, and soon, I found myself at the destination. It was a beautiful coffee shop, one of those hidden gems in a side street that was hard to notice, not too crowded, and decorated nicely. </p><p>The perfect place to hold a study session when the library was particularly crowded, I noticed even as stepped down the bike, and looked inside. Carrie was sitting near the wall, with her books piled in front of her, most of them already open. </p><p>Sarah was sitting across her, her back toward the entrance, her movements animated as she gestured, while Carrie was slouched, finding it hard to answer her friend. </p><p>It didn’t surprise me. While Carrie could be downright vicious with the tricks she pulled behind the scenes, it did nothing for her meek personality, making it impossible for her to resist a direct assault. </p><p>Sarah didn’t have anything in front of her, nor she had a bag, giving me the impression that she had actually ambushed Carrie. </p><p>As I walked toward them, I made sure to stay silent, hearing her talk. Carrie noticed me, perking at my presence. The change was noticeable, but Sarah was too distracted by her verbal assault to notice it. “… so you’re saying that you don’t have any concerns about his visit to Irene, even if they are alone, changing between her collection of sexy costumes.” </p><p>I had no idea what Carrie would have said if I wasn’t there, but my presence encouraged her to give a naughtier response. “Of course not. She’s my friend just like you. Are you saying that I shouldn’t trust you either?” </p><p>Sarah flinched very noticeably. I might have called Carrie’s words merciless considering the nature of her actions, goading Sarah, but Sarah had taken enough actions to make that well-deserved. </p><p>I decided to alert myself to their presence. “Oh, what do we have here, the most beautiful girl in the town,” I said, as I walked around the table, leaned down, and captured Carrie in a searing kiss. </p><p>All before Sarah could even find words to comment on my presence. </p><p>Kissing Carrie was a weapon to distract Sarah, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t enjoyable. On the contrary, as I slipped my tongue into her mouth, teasing Sarah quickly took secondary importance — especially when Carrie proved daring enough to put her hand between my legs, leveraging the emptiness of the coffee shop. </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I noticed Sarah shuffling, her earlier feelings of guilt evaporating rapidly as she watched us kiss. </p><p>I put my hand on Carrie’s back, letting it trail down to cup her ass. With her back toward the wall, it was impossible for Sarah to see the exact location of my hand, but guessing the location based on my shoulder didn’t take a particularly impressive effort, especially since Sarah was familiar with my habits.</p><p>Intimately familiar. </p><p>I continued kissing Carrie as Sarah’s jealousy started to spike, wondering when she would intervene. </p><p>In the end, intervention came from an unexpected direction. A door opened, followed by a cough, making Carrie pull back as I turned toward the sound. “Sorry, Miss Warrick,” Carrie whispered shyly, her voice showing both familiarity and respect.  </p><p>And saw an impressive woman wearing an apron, walking away, her hips moving sexily even despite her clear attempt to hide them. A glance was enough to classify her as a particularly spectacular example of a MILF, yet her lack of an answer and quick steps showed she felt particularly self-conscious after the view she had stumbled on. </p><p>I said nothing as she went behind the counter, staying hidden while Carrie fixed herself. I sat next to her, and put my hand on her ass. “Chad, not with Miss Warrick here,” Carrie whispered shyly, but as I kept my hand on her ass, she didn’t try to push me away. </p><p>She wasn’t silent as she had hoped, as I noticed the woman flinching at Carrie’s words before using another door, this time behind the counter, to get away. </p><p>“No worries, she’s already gone,” I said with a chuckle. I was amused by her, just not as much as I was interested in reversing Sarah’s fun ambush. </p><p>“So, Sarah, I heard you talking about me,” I said. “But as you say, I’m here. Why don’t you repeat your fears about how naughty Casanova I had been when my presence is proof.” I smirked. </p><p>“Yes, she was being ridiculous,” Carrie said as she rested against my chest, her husky tone another sign of what I had been doing where Sarah couldn’t see. “It would have made sense to think about it if it was only Irene, but Ida is there as well.” </p><p>“Exactly, Sarah,” I chuckled as I caught her gaze, letting my smirk widen. “Unless you’re going to claim that I’m such an expert of seduction that I could seduce a girl right next to her friend without her friend noticing… Or even better, seduce two girls at the same time.” </p><p>Sarah froze, her anger flaring suddenly enough to silence her. Admittedly, her anger was not unjustified. </p><p>After all, my examples were chosen carefully, both applicable to her. </p><p>Pity, she couldn’t just say so to her friend.</p><p>“Exactly, I can’t imagine any girl that wouldn’t notice something like that,” Carrie said proudly. Too proudly even, far outside her usual attitude, exaggerated to annoy Sarah. I looked at her, curious why she asked such a question, but Carrie just shrugged. </p><p>It seemed that she wasn’t particularly concerned about Sarah noticing the truth of the situation. Maybe she was aware it was not a trick that she could maintain for long, certainly not when more and more of her friend group get involved, and wanted to tease her friend as much as possible before the truth was revealed. </p><p>Especially as another fun chain awaited us once the truth was revealed. Looking at her experience with Naomi, it wasn’t like Sarah was against some friendly challenges. </p><p>But the sudden flare of anger on her face showed that she had swallowed the bait whole rather than bothering to ask why Carrie would make such a pointed question. </p><p>A rare oversight for such a smart girl, one that I was more than happy to leverage. </p><p>I slipped my foot out of my shoe and brought it to her leg. Sarah flinched as our skin touched, alarmed enough to miss Carrie’s smirk — or the fact that why Carrie didn’t find the weird position of my leg suspicious. </p><p>She managed to suppress her flinch soon, but that wasn’t enough for her to change her focus to a different direction, not when I started caressing her inner thighs. “Sorry, I misspoke,” Sarah said soon, but it was just an excuse for her to lower her head down to hide her expression. </p><p>My foot was not my most agile limb, certainly, but my growing knowledge of Sarah’s beautiful body was more than enough to compensate for that deficiency. I danced upward, teasing every single sensitive spot I had discovered. </p><p>Carrie put her hand on my crotch, gently caressing my arousal, which returned to its raging state quickly after cutting its earlier adventure halfway. </p><p>Focused on that two, I had missed the approach of someone else, which was a cardinal sin to a quarterback. Luckily, in this case, it wasn’t punished by a painful tackle. “Who is your new friend, Carrie,” said a female voice. </p><p>I raised my head, and saw the same spectacular MILF with an apron looking at us from behind the counter… </p>
