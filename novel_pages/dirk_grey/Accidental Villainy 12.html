        <p>If I had any doubts about hiring Tara, they would have dispelled permanently as I woke up. She woke up before me. I barely remembered her leaving and coming back before going for a shower, and I remembered her bringing a suitcase with her. </p><p>Clearly, she went to her motel to move in permanently. Good for her to follow my order first thing in the morning. I could have woken up and joined her in the shower … but no matter how tempting the idea was, I chose to sleep more. </p><p>The last night had been exhausting in many ways, and I deserved an extra hour of sleep. Maybe two…</p><p>Unfortunately, Tara decided to take her role as my secretary seriously and woke me up. Fortunately, she had chosen a better method than shouting or poking me. Much better. </p><p>I woke up again to the warmth wrapping around my girth, and the moment I opened my eyes, I met with the beautiful view of her hair spilling against my stomach while she leaned over my midsection, wearing nothing but a towel, which turned increasingly useless as she moved up and down, her movement loosening it. </p><p>The best alarm clock imaginable. </p><p>I said nothing to signal her that I had woken up, enjoying the service. Her hair kept her face mostly covered, but whenever it moved slightly, it gave me a beautiful glimpse to enjoy. Her beauty was already beautiful, but the truly striking part was her smile, growing more and more intense as she worked along my length, showing me just how much she enjoyed it. </p><p>I never saw such an intense smile in any of my bed partners. It impressed and scared me at the same time with the promise it conveyed. I couldn’t help but imagine how she might have reacted if I tried to send her away. Even with my power, it was hard to guess… </p><p>Luckily, it was just an idle, theoretical question. Beautiful, sexy, obedient, and to top it all, with a very convenient power set. </p><p>I wasn’t stupid enough to turn away the best thing that happened to me since I had the misfortune of awakening my own powers. Or, considering my life, maybe my whole life. </p><p>Of course, I could have done with the confrontation with the henchmen of the Slasher, but even that was hardly her fault. They attacked, and I responded. She was just there to bail me out of a very painful stabbing injury. </p><p>As she pushed herself deep enough for me to feel the entrance of her throat, giving me another jolt of pleasure, I abandoned those pointless thoughts and focused on the present. She was clearly inexperienced, but she was proving to be an excellent student with the courage to push her limits while serving me. </p><p>It was nice to watch her slowly develop and improve as she explored her sexuality.  </p><p>Soon, she rose up, but that didn’t mean the pleasure was over. She wrapped her beautiful fingers around the base, moving up and down with a steady rhythm. Only problem. A bit tight. “Try to loosen your fingers a bit, my dear secretary,” I said. </p><p>“Y-you’re awake, sir,” she stammered, looking shocked. </p><p>I chuckled, entertained by her naivety. As if someone could actually sleep through the dance of her lips. “I am,” I said, and she made a move to pull back. I reached and grabbed her arm. “Did I tell you to stop?” I added. </p><p>Her eyes widened as my words hit her, but it was more of a mark of pleasure, tinged with just a touch of panic to add some spice. I didn’t need my powers to understand the depth of the desire that was awakened by my indirect order. </p><p>Her submissiveness was like a beautiful poem. </p><p>She grabbed my legs as she lowered herself, taking me into her mouth without the slightest delay, my length disappearing into her pretty mouth, even invading her throat. This time, I didn’t bother to keep down my moan, more than happy to show her she was working well. </p><p>After all, how could she improve if she didn’t know what she was doing well? </p><p>As the pleasure built up, I didn’t bother keeping myself back, and soon, exploded into her mouth. As much as I wanted to enjoy the feeling, I had a lot of work to bring the bar to a working state. </p><p>More importantly, I needed to go and see if I had a supervillain following me. </p><p>“Make sure to clean everything to perfection,” I said as she was busy swallowing my seed, and after caressing her cheek for one last time, I stood up and went for a shower. </p><p>Ignoring the desire to invite her into the shower had been another challenge … but I managed that. </p><p>I had a lot of work to do. </p><p>*** *** ***</p><p>I failed to suppress my desire to curse endlessly as I walked through the empty streets, pulling my hat lower. It was hard to do, when I had to walk for half an hour rather than taking a bus … but the major — or more likely, one of his underlings — decided to temporarily stop the bus service to my neighborhood.  </p><p>The official explanation said that it was due to a technical problem and that it would be continued soon, but I doubted if anyone believed it. </p><p>They just didn’t want to send any asset to the part of the city that had been just taken over by a new villain and give him an easy target to take hostage. </p><p>Of course, that would mean the Slasher would be targeting the residents to refill his coffers, straining the economy of the area even further. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly good news for me. The chances of success for my bar were already troubling without an effective economic embargo. The only positive thing was the money I managed to take from the henchmen, which should be able to keep me afloat for a few weeks. </p><p>And, if I could get a few customers in the process, even better. </p><p>Of course, that money hadn’t been free. It was the reason I was wearing a cap. If the unlikely thing happened and I met one of them, I wanted to stay hidden.  </p><p>It was also the reason for the gun in my belt. The worst case. </p><p>Ordinarily, the worst case would have been them attacking the bar while I was away and burning the place down, but I didn’t expect to happen. </p><p>For that, they needed to be stupid enough to reveal what had happened rather than taking the excuse I had granted to them with the alcohol trick, and then they needed to be brave enough to go and challenge a super with enhanced strength. </p><p>I had left Tara with express instructions. Keep the doors closed, and if anyone barges in, put on her mask and the thickest clothes she had before beating them visibly. The only exception was the Slasher. If he was the one who visited, Tara was under strict orders to abandon the bar and meet with me. </p><p>I cared about the bar, but not enough to pit Tara against an experienced villain. </p><p>“Fucking villains and their entitlement,” I murmured as I noticed a young man drawing the Slasher’s symbol on the wall — a bloodied knife — to mark the territory. I continued, shifting the bags in my hand — which had some new plates and glasses — expecting the streets to be empty. </p><p>However, as I moved forward, that changed. A few streets away from my bar, one of the warehouses had been seeing a lot of movement, with crates after crates being unloaded. The crates were marked as fresh produce … but I didn’t need my superpowers to realize they didn’t look like people who might care about fresh produce. </p><p>Unless their hands were trembling with the excitement of getting some oranges, and they were sweating desperately because they missed the taste of the apples. </p><p>A drug distribution center, just three blocks away from my bar. Like my job wasn’t challenging enough. </p><p>The worst thing, they didn’t even truly bother to conceal what they were trying to do, confident that the police wouldn’t take a step into the area now that it was under the direct control of a villain. </p><p>Not that I blamed them. Ultimately, the police had next to no power when it came to fighting against the crime. They were severely outclassed by the villains … and to make things even worse, they were legally prevented from employing heroes, or even cooperating. </p><p>To be fair, it was not a rule that came for no reason, but it didn’t change the fact that the independent guilds were far more important to protect safety than the government. </p><p>And, there was no chance for the guilds to come here to solve something as pedestrian as drugs. </p><p>No, we were on our own. </p><p>“Well, hopefully, it’s the kind of drugs that make people thirsty,” I murmured. The existence of such a place was dangerous. </p><p>But that didn’t change the fact that it solved my biggest problem. The lack of customers. </p><p>“It could have been worse,” I murmured as I walked away, ignoring the suspicious glares of the guards around the warehouse. </p>
