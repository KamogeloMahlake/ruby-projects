    <body>
        <p>I quickly went to my room and picked a towel and a change of clothes, and also a small piece of wire. The locks were not terribly complicated, especially the subpar ones that were used for inner doors. So, when I arrived at the bathroom, it took a couple of seconds for me to open it silently. </p><p>When I opened the door, I saw Eleanor in the bath, most of her body buried under the bubbles, but I managed to get a glimpse of her perfect tits before she buried herself in. “What the hell, Nathan,” she said in an angry whisper, barely holding her senses enough to remember not to shout. </p><p>“Sorry roomie, the door was unlocked, so I assumed it’s empty.”</p><p>“But I locked it…” she murmured, but her confused expression told me that she was revisiting that idea, probably blaming her anger for her mistake, not assuming my lockpicking abilities. Then, she continued in a sharper tone. “Anyway, as you can see, it’s busy.” </p><p>I closed the door, and locked it once again, but much to her shock, I stayed inside. “The shower is empty,” I said even as I moved forward. </p><p>“But-” she tried to start, but her expression was shocked. </p><p>“Come on, roomie, it’s not like it’s the first time we’re sharing a bathroom, or you seeing me naked” I answered. </p><p>“We were still in high school then,” she answered, but her voice trembled. </p><p>“The last time, I was twenty, and you were nineteen,” I countered, letting sharpness dominate my tone. She failed to answer, as my response reminded her of betrayal and abandonment, leaving me alone in a cold cell after I sacrificed my reputation for her. “Anyway, I’m sweaty, and I need a shower.” </p><p>She made a show of avoiding to look at me as I removed my shorts, revealing my shaft —with a respectable eight inches in size, and a corresponding thickness— rock hard thanks to the glimpse of her beautiful breasts, a sight that I had missed greatly. </p><p>“Would you mind closing your eyes so I can leave,” she said. Not expecting an intrusion, her bathrobe was on the other side of the room, meaning she had to walk naked to reach it. Something she clearly didn’t want to do.  </p><p>“Yes, I would mind,” I answered as I stepped into the shower, enjoying the warm blast of water, but kept my gaze on the bath. </p><p>She didn’t know how to answer my brazen reply, so she stayed in the bath, buried in the water, her eyes firmly closed. At first, at least. While I was busy with soaping my body, I saw her eyelids opening just a bit, enough to give her a perfect view of my body while still staying concealed. Unfortunately for her, I still remembered all her tells perfectly, including the way she stiffened when she concentrated on something. </p><p>Maintaining my full erection was easy. All I needed to was imagining what Eleanor looked like under the bubbles. Was she completely shaved or did she have a small, neatly groomed line that framed her entrance? Whether she was brave enough to suntan naked when she was alone like I had convinced her to once we were in a holiday together or whether she stained her perfect figure with a bikini line. I wanted to pull her out of the water to find out. Pity, it wasn’t time yet. </p><p>“How long is your shower,” she said exasperatedly. “You’re wasting water,” she added, like that excuse wasn’t completely transparent. </p><p>“I prefer a long, relaxing bath, but since the bath is occupied, I’m going to take a long shower,” I answered. “Unless you’re inviting me there, of course.” </p><p>“Dream on, bastard,” Eleanor murmured. </p><p>“Oh, I definitely will dream about it tonight,” I said, blatantly leering at her, which once again shocked her. I continued showering, but this time, she kept her eyes open. Maybe she was encouraged by my brazen acknowledgment that I would be masturbating for her memories tonight, maybe she was finally remembering the times we shared baths together, exploring each other. She opened her eyes, keeping them locked on my cock. </p><p>I continued showering, not reacting to her action. But the real fun started when I started to shampoo my hair. Believing that I was keeping my eyes closed, her hand started moving underneath the water, proving that despite years and decisions that separated us, she was still burning with a desire for my body. </p><p>I let the shampoo linger even as she bit her lips pointedly, watching as her face danced between expressions, giving the familiar signs of an impending orgasm as she bit her lips desperately, trying to keep herself from making a sound. I loved how beautiful she looked at the moment, and cursing the fact that it was too early to make a more aggressive moves.</p><p>Then the gods took mercy on my desperation, and a knock was heard at the door. “Honey, are you in,” called Devon. </p><p>Eleanor flinched badly, suddenly realizing that she in the bathroom with her supposed friend, in a position impossible to explain. She made a motion to me, begging for me to speak, absolving her, but I just smirked. I had no intention of letting go of this opportunity. “Yes,” she finally said desperately. </p><p>“Can I come in?” he asked.</p><p>“No!” she immediately cried, panicked.</p><p>Not knowing the circumstances, Devon chose to read that as anger. “I’m sorry, sweetie, I was out of line, please forgive me,” he started speaking. Eleanor, distracted by her husband’s speech, failed to notice that I turned the water off and sneaked toward her. Only when my hand dipped down the water, she realized what I was about to do. </p><p>“No!” Eleanor cried panickedly, this time not aiming Devon at all, but he chose to take it like that, unaware that her wife was being seduced by the guest that moved to their house hours ago behind the locked door of her own bathroom. </p><p>Devon started begging more emphatically, but I ignored it. “What are you doing?!” Eleanor whispered, shocked. </p><p>“Helping you finish what you started, like we did just before I took responsibility for the crime you committed, and you left me shamelessly,” I reminded her even as I dipped my fingers down. She pressed her legs together, but with arousal slowly rising, she lacked the power to keep them closed as my fingers started to caress her inner thigh. Her legs opened almost instinctively, and I pushed my fingers deeper. </p><p>“Are you crazy?” she whispered as my fingers found her labia, easily slipping inside her prepared entrance. “Get out of the bathroom and keep away from me!" she added, but followed by a soft moan, it wasn’t entirely effective. I loved this about her, no matter what she said, she was weak against pleasure, especially the kind I could give her. </p><p>“Honey, please,” Devon said, distracting her enough that I could push two fingers deep inside her, pumping mercilessly. “I’m not going to leave until you open the door.” </p><p>I made a note to send Devon a bottle of good scotch, as unknowingly, he was doing his best to surrender his wife to my tender mercies. While Devon droned on, occasionally broken by the half-assed replies Eleanor managed to cobble together as she moved toward orgasm between her silent gasps. </p><p>Soon, Eleanor started to shudder, reaching orgasm through my touch, for the first time in four years. I stopped for a moment, examining the sexy expression I had dreamed of for the last four years. It was finally the time. </p><p>While she tried to catch her breath, I pulled her from the bath, and let her lay on the cold, ceramic floor of the bathroom. She was perfectly mellow after explosive orgasm, her ass pointing upward, her entrance glistening with a mixture of bathwater and her own arousal, all the while her husband begged from outside. </p><p>My cock was throbbing, begging me to take the final step, the one I had been dreaming for the last four years since I lost her. But this time, things were different. I was different. I wasn’t doing to seduce her, or woo her. </p><p>I was going to tame her. </p><p>As she lay doubled over, trying to gasp for air after her orgasm, I pressed against her entrance, all the while her husband droned outside, still begging for her forgiveness.  </p><p>Eleanor wheezed exhaustedly. “No, please, don't do this,” she whispered. </p><p>"What's the matter, roomie?” I answered. “Don't you want to tease me, only to bail at the last possible time, abandoning me despite your promises?”</p><p>While she tried to come with an answer, I turned my attention to her body. For a moment, I let my eyes feast on her naked and wet body and its beautiful curves. Then, I grabbed her leg and forced them to part with brute strength, giving me a better look at the treasure between her smooth, long legs, giving me the perfect angle to plunder her riches. I was happy to note she was perfectly groomed, like she was prepared for my intrusion. </p><p>“Do you wax, or is it laser treatment?” I whispered smugly as I dragged my finger against her entrance, making her shiver helplessly. I trembled at joy at finally having her under my power after four years of separation. I let my fingers slide upward, caressing her flat stomach and delightfully cute bellybutton. </p><p>Then my fingers moved even further, meeting the sensation they had missed around her perky breasts, circling her pink areolae, perfect in size and shape, crowned by her stiff nipples, currently hard enough to cut diamond, suggesting that she wasn’t the only one aroused for the opportunity. </p><p>I finally had the opportunity to fix the mistake I made four years ago, I thought even as I brought my finger back, gently dipping into her pink entrance, enjoying the warmth. </p><p>“Oh, god, no…” she murmured. “Not this again, please!” she said, suddenly turning so that she was sitting on the floor, facing me, but my fingers were still inside. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said as I pulled my fingers and grabbed her nipples, twisting them hard enough that she yelped loudly. </p><p>“Is there something wrong, honey?” cried Devon from outside. “Should I break the door?” </p><p>“No!” Eleanor exclaimed, her face contorted with fear, clearly not willing to let her husband see the sight of her collapsed figure, still flushed after her latest orgasm. “I just stubbed my toe!”  </p><p>“Okay,” Devon said. </p><p>Meanwhile, I helped her to her feet, then before she could react, I pushed her against the door, with my body locking her in place, my shaft aligned at her entrance. “As I said, I’m not going to play with you anymore,” I whispered.  </p><p>When I pressed my shaft against her entrance, she tried to push me away, but her moves were weak, restricted by both the fear of her husband hearing what was going on, and her own arousal drowning her willpower. Even then, as my shaft considerably-sized shaft slowly pushed into her wet opening, she became frantic. It was obvious that she didn’t know what to say, or how to react. Her arousal was one thing, but also there was the presence of her husband, ready to be alerted at any moment. </p><p>“It can’t be happening,” she murmured in shock even as I pushed into her, finally giving myself the taste I had been missing for the last four years. </p><p>Meanwhile, her husband intruded once more. “Honey, please talk to me, I know I angered you, but I’m trying to apologize.” </p><p>“Devon-NN!” she said, trying to say something to her husband, only to devolve into a loud cry as I chose the opportunity to push deep into her. “I accept your apology, so go away,” she continued, gasping and moaning as I started impaling her rhythmically. </p><p>“I can hear you’re still angry,” Devon said, not even considering for a moment that his precious wife was being finally taken by their brand new guest. </p><p>“He’s a bit slow, isn’t he,” I murmured into her ear as I pushed even deeper into her, pushing her against the door, separated by inches from her husband. “You can’t believe how much I dreamed about this, honey, after you abandoned me without a warning, only to marry this useless sack of meat.” </p><p>“Nathan,” she whispered, her voice low enough not to pass through the wooden door, her disbelief clear in her tone. She obviously didn’t know what to say to stop me, maybe not sure whether she actually wanted to do so. She certainly didn’t bother to resist when I grabbed her arms and spread them forcefully, giving myself a perfect angle to take her. My heartbeat was crazy as I finally fulfilled the most important desire of my life… </p><p>“Please, no,” she suddenly whispered as I pushed deeper. “No, it’s too big!” she added, this time even louder. </p><p>“What’s going on in there, honey!” Devon suddenly asked. </p><p>Eleanor froze, and as much as I wanted to see her struggle, Devon’s presence was getting old. He had worked well to drive in the fact that I was taking her with the full knowledge of her marriage, but now, I wanted her to focus on me, not on hiding from her useless husband. “Tell him that you’re masturbating,” I whispered.</p><p>She somehow managed to look scandalized even with my shaft in her, pushing deeper and deeper, but that didn’t last long. She wasn’t in a mind space to come up with a better idea. “I’m masturbating because you left me hanging, now go away,” she shouted sharply. </p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want me to-” Devon started, trying to be seductive.</p><p>“No!” shouted Eleanor, probably helped by the sudden merciless push I made inside her, finally sheathing my full size, earning a loud cry.</p><p>“Okay, jeez, message received. I’ll eat out tonight, don’t wait up,” said Devon, followed by annoying stomping. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured into her ear, stopping my furious pumping for a moment, staying deep inside her to enjoy the sensation. “It seems that we’re alone tonight.” </p><p>“Nathan, please,” she gasped. </p><p>I pulled out, which earned a shocked gasp from her, though it was replaced when I suddenly grabbed a few towels and threw them on the floor, then pushed her on top of them. I wanted to take her in a way she couldn’t avoid my gaze, something she understood as well when I took the missionary position above her, ready to blast her mercilessly. </p><p>“I’m sorry what for what I have done,” she begged. “It was a mistake I had done in a panic. I was young then. I promise I’ll be nice and do anything you want, so please stop.” </p><p>“Oh, honey,” I said as I caressed her cheek gently, which contrasted greatly with the merciless way I impaled her once more. “You’re right about that, you’re going to do anything I want. You owe me for the last four years…” </p><p>“Please don't. Oh... no... you're too big..."</p><p>“I know,” I said smugly. “But now, we’re going to share something special.” As I pushed, I could feel her clenching around tightly, showing the betrayal of her body. </p><p>"Oh, god! No... Please. You're hurting me. Don't..." she said, but her moans disagreed with her words. </p><p>But she was really incredibly tight. I thought about comparing his dick size with Devon, but decided against. No need to spoil this historic moment with the mentions of that wet blanket. Still, I pushed deeper, enjoying the pressure as I slowly overcome her tight resistance. "Oh, honey. You taking me. Oh, god, you feel so good."</p><p>"Ow..oh god... no," Eleanor cried with pain and joy, the emotional anguish from feeling my shaft in her married pussy contrasting with the obvious pleasure she was getting. </p><p>“How do you feel, roomie. Is it worth making yourself wait for years to finally have a taste,” I asked even as I lowered, even more, my lips just inches away from hers? </p><p>“You-” she tried to say, but I chose that moment to kiss her. It wasn’t a soft kiss. No, it was a merciless assault that tried to convey the struggle I felt staying away from her, just because she got the cold feet. My tongue invaded her mouth mercilessly. She tried to stay passive, but her body still remembered the way we kissed, and the more the pleasure built, the harder for her to reject the call. Soon, her tongue joined, slow and hesitant… </p><p>“Why are you doing this?” she gasped after I pulled away from the kiss, but her moans contrasted with her anger. </p><p>I put my finger to her lips, silencing her. "Shush, be quiet, and stop pretending. You know this, I love you, enough to ruin my life, and you clearly still do as well. I’m going to make you mine, whatever the cost."</p><p>"No," she whimpered, but her body disagreed with her if the way she was pushing against my hips were any indicator. Her pussy was more honest than her lips, welcoming my hardness and coating my cock with her affectionate arousal, traitorously helping me to penetrate even deeper.</p><p>Her words disappeared, replaced by moans and gasps as my cock visited her unchartered depths, teaching her the true meaning of sex. I could have pushed even harder, of course, but I didn’t want to hurt her, I just wanted to teach her what she had been denying herself. We were going to have a lot of opportunities to really explore the possibilities, after all… </p><p>"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah," Eleanor moaned in concert as the towels under her shift. She tried to avoid my gaze, but I grabbed her chin and kept her from moving. </p><p>“Look at me!” I ordered even as I devoured the sight of her beautiful eyes, desperation, and arousal battling… "Look at me when I'm fucking you!"</p><p>She followed my order, keeping our eyes connected. </p><p>“Excellent, now cum for me!” </p><p>“No,” she immediately replied, like it was something under her control. I could already feel her wetness intensifying, accompanied by her tightening. </p><p>“Cum for me!” I repeated, and chose that moment for another kiss. This one was pure primal instinct, no complicated techniques, no plays of domination, just a primal kiss to convey the sense of loss I had felt. Her determination not to climax disappeared in an instant, and she started shuddering under me. </p><p>After dreaming of this moment for four years, it was simply too much for me to reject. I pushed deeper into her, and soon, I exploded into her, filling her to the brim. I knew that she was on the pill, but even if she wasn’t, it wouldn’t have stopped me, not after waiting for four years. </p><p>“No… no…” she murmured, but with her body rocking with orgasm, it didn’t really help. I pulled out after one last lingering kiss, and walked back to shower. </p><p>“Do you want to join me,” I offered, only to receive a frustrated growl. She grabbed her bathrobe and dashed away, leaving me alone in the bathroom. The fact that she left it with my seed seeping down her legs made the moment even sexier. </p><p>I chose to say nothing as she left… There was no harm for her to process it for a while. We would have many opportunities to discuss it, after all…</p>
