        <p>As I watched Princess Aria blush cutely but hesitantly after the practice kiss she delivered to the back of my hand, I knew that pushing Aria too much immediately had the risk of scaring her, therefore ruining my whole plan. Thus logic dictated that I needed to play it safe, making sure everything was perfect before slowly warming her up for the next step. </p><p>But I didn’t rise from being gutter trash to a Dark Lord without taking a few risks. </p><p>It was a mistake that brought a lot of people to their ruin. They waited and tinkered until everything was perfect, delaying, again and again, only to crash and burn spectacularly when an unexpected variable decided to take some of the risks that they deemed excessive, ruining their plans completely. More than once, I was that unexpected variable, hence my meteoric rise toward power. </p><p>Locked in a prison deemed unbreakable, betrayed by my allies, and tortured daily —at least, what they thought of as torture, though it didn’t even enter the top hundred worst thing list for me, I had more painful training sessions regularly— I was not in a position to play safe. </p><p>And, if I was being honest, watching Aria’s beautiful blue eyes shining with a pleasure that confused her triggered me, tempting me to stain her beauty with my fingerprints. </p><p>She gave me the perfect excuse to do so. “H-how was it?” she stammered silently after taking several deep breaths to gather her courage, a move that made her bosom rise visibly despite her conservative dress. </p><p>“Not bad for a beginner,” I answered, smiling just a bit to soften the blow. She flinched still, easily reading the meaning under my words, though they didn’t reflect my true feelings. She was quite good considering her lack of experience, certainly enough to blow the mind of an idiot like Lancelot. But I needed her desperately trying to get better, so I gave her a much weaker compliment, while doing my best to make her think that it was actually to console her. Her panicked expression told me that she reacted just as I wanted. </p><p>She really was too trusting…</p><p>“W-what can I do?” she asked. </p><p>“Hmm…” I murmured, making a show of thinking. “Try to move your lips with more intent,” I offered, followed by a few more technical pieces of advice that would elevate her kiss to the next level. She nodded through my explanation, her face stiff with concentration. She was an exemplary student. “Now, try again,” I ordered. </p><p>This time, as she leaned in, her blush was even thicker, clearly remembering the rush of pleasure she had felt. Still, she obeyed my directions without saying a word, and pressed her lips to the back of my hand. I let my magic infuse into her mouth immediately, gently caressing the edges of her lips before slipping in, ticking her tongue. </p><p>“Don’t break it,” I ordered when she started to pull back, and did her best to follow my directions as I gave her more and more orders, making her kiss slowly better. But the more important part was the space between my orders, where she had nothing to focus on but on the kiss she was delivering, her blush intensifying with each passing second.</p><p>Even then, the sudden moan that left her mouth shocked me as much as it did her. She flinched back, her face crimson. “Sorry,” she murmured as she made a motion of standing up, but I cut in. </p><p>“Sit down!” I ordered, letting my inner Dark Lord seep into my tone, not the Dark part that made people tremble in fear, or the part that massacred people in the blink of an eye. No, the part I used was the Lord, the one that didn’t give orders as much as predicting the future, because he knew that any words he uttered would be turned into reality by his followers.  When the Lord spoke, people listened. </p><p>Aria was no exception, staying in place without even realizing the reason for doing so. It was fatal for a ruler to act like that, no wonder Queen Sapphire was trying to find a Prince-Consort for her as soon as possible. As she currently was, she was completely unfit for ruling. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, this time with a warmer tone, but still channeling the Lord, the aspect that was signaling its subject that he was satisfied with her actions. “Now, this one was much better, especially on the lips part, but your tongue needs a bit of work.” I made a show of thinking before continuing. “Why don’t we try a different exercise?” </p><p>“Like what?” she asked, justifiably concerned. </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured, then raised my index and middle finger together. “Why don’t you slowly kiss them, treating them like a tongue so that I can get a better idea,” I offered. </p><p>“If you’re sure,” she murmured, looking around hesitantly, but when she saw my eyebrows furrowing, she moved immediately and wrapped her lips around my two fingers, her tongue beating against them. I had to bite my lips not to moan as her tongue brushed against my fingers, sending shivers across my body. There was something uniquely arousing in receiving such a personalized service from the princess of an Empire. </p><p>Even better, my fingers gave me a much better way to expel and control my magic. My magical access might be limited, but it was enough to flood her mouth and trigger her joy. She was clearly holding back, so I gave her another suggestion. “Try to moan occasionally, it should help you to act like you’re enjoying it. It’s an integral part of the experience.” </p><p>Her expression of relief was simply spectacular. Finally having the excuse she needed, she stopped holding back, and her soft moans reverberated through the room, while the trembling sensation they caused spread into my body from my fingers. I could feel my own arousal growing to the point that I was unable to keep my shaft under control, not that I tried to. </p><p>It was time for her to see the consequences of delivering a successful kiss. </p><p>Lost in the magically-enhanced pleasure of the faux-kiss she was delivering, her eyes were closed, so she missed my growing erection for a long time. I continued to offer the occasional recommendation, but the space between them got larger and larger. I stopped offering recommendations, and even then, she continued delivering her simulated kiss. Encouraged by her loss of concentration, I started dropping more and more mana into the small spell I used to enhance her pleasure, but it somehow got missed. </p><p>In her defense, she had bigger priorities. </p><p>I carefully watched as she shuffled in her place, and when she stopped doing that, her legs were suspiciously pressed together. That might be explained, but the following slow fidgeting was a different issue. It suspiciously looked like she was trying to rub her legs together to generate some sexy friction without being noticed. I wondered whether she was aware of it. </p><p>A pity that my magic was barely enough to tease her tongue. I would have liked to add some heat to her —likely-unconscious— attempts of indirect masturbation. Still, I didn’t let the lack of power bother me. Two days ago, I had nothing. Today, I had enough magic for simple tricks. That was progress, and it wasn’t something to worry about. </p><p>My thoughts on improving my power potential flew away when I noticed her growing arousal, making her suspiciously close to climax. I watched with excitement, curious whether she might accomplish it. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed when her eyes suddenly flew open and she pulled back, breathing hard in shock and the impact of impending arousal. </p><p>I would have cursed loudly if that wouldn’t have scared her more. Instead, I played along. “That was excellent progress for the day, you have followed my directions perfectly, correcting your mistakes. You’re a good student.”</p><p>“Thanks,” she muttered, still avoiding my gaze. </p><p>I thought about pushing her a bit more, but then I remembered the surprise that was awaiting her, one that she had managed to miss in her distracted state, and changed my mind. “How about we continue with our healing. It’s starting to hurt.” </p><p>“Of course,” she exclaimed, her relief now that we were in more familiar waters was clear. When she sat back in her chair, however, her eyes widened in shock. “W-what is that?” she stammered as she pointed at my erection, which was making a rather impressive tent through my loose prison clothes. </p><p>“You’re a healer, I don’t have to explain that to you,” I said, not bothering to hide my chuckle, which made her blush harder, but she didn’t jump away, so it was a win. “Well, think of it as the objective evidence of your kissing skills,” I added. </p><p>“Should we wait until…” she murmured, letting her voice drift away rather than completing her words. </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I answered, faking distress for a moment. “It’s going to stay like that for a while, because I can’t really handle it,” I said, making my hands into fists to remind her that my chains didn’t allow me to reach that far. </p><p>“Does it hurt?” she asked, unable to help it despite her blush. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said with a stiff tone, like I was trying to hide my pain from her. Her eyes widened, and I sighed. “It’s just uncomfortable. Think of it like a very noticeable itch you can’t scratch.” I was very tempted to mention similarities between her current state of unmet arousal and my struggle, but I refrained despite its amusement potential. However, the blush that suddenly appeared on her face suggested that she had made that connection, and possibly even overestimating its impact… </p><p>I wasn’t complaining. </p><p>“Is there anything I could do,” she murmured. </p><p>“There is, but I don’t really think you will,” I said, not bothering to hide my smirk, and her blush turned into a raging forest fire. </p><p>“Anyway, we need to continue to heal you,” she stammered rather rapidly as she put her hands on me and flooded me with healing energy. A rather uncontrolled burst of healing energy, I noted happily. It seemed that my erection worked wonders as a distraction, even better than her anger. While her gaze constantly slipped towards my tent despite her best effort to avoid it, I directed her excess magic toward the chains, slowly but steadily increasing my access. </p><p>The healing session lasted more than an hour, and she was even more jittery about my erection in the end than at the beginning, which was the reason I dreamed up several inventive scenarios where our roles were switched, and I was slowly educating her about the fun parts of being evil. I did that for two reasons. First, watching her like that was very amusing. </p><p>Second, maintaining her distraction. Casting healing magic through the interference of the magic-canceling bracelets was difficult in the first place without the added challenge of her shyness, giving me free-reign in manipulating the excess energy, finally damaging the magic-blocking chains enough to get me decent access to my magic. At first, thirty-five grains reached fifty, then a hundred, then five hundred, then thousands… The more access I got, the easier it became to damage it further. </p><p>Of course, thousands of grains sounded fancy, but only because I had such limited access before. It was still insignificant in the long run. I decided to classify my new capacity as one string. I could probably cast a magic missile, and if forced, an anemic fireball… Of course, the real opportunity lay in all the small tricks I could pull, including mental tricks that were more about control than power. </p><p>Not on Aria, though. She was too nice to deserve me messing directly with her mind. Indirectly, on the other hand… For the last half hour of the treatment, I was using my newly expanded abilities to slowly caress her skin magically, through a touch so soft that it could be easily mistaken for wind. It restricted me to the areas above her clothes, but it was a sacrifice I was willing to make, especially after discovering that her neck was rather sensitive, making her shiver whenever I touched it. </p><p>“That’s it for today,” she finally pulled back, breathing hard. “Well, that was harder than I expected,” she added, which I understood. Healing through the chains was a difficult task, and my constant drain to weaken the chains hardly helped. </p><p>“You’re a lifesaver,” I said, smiling widely. “Literally. I doubt anyone else could have done what you did through a magic-blocking effect.” </p><p>“There are a lot more accomplished healers,” she said, immediately refuting it modestly. “And it’s our fault you’re hurting in the first place.” </p><p>“Nonsense, it’s war, these things happen,” I said. “I would have waved my hand dismissively, but with the chains…” I added, then chuckled. </p><p>“Yeah,” she said as she stood up, but her eyes once again slid down to my tent, then jumped away just as rapidly. Since she went through so much trouble healing me, I decided to give her a little treat. </p><p>“Before you leave, do you mind giving me a check-up, just in case there’s some bleeding you missed magically.” </p><p>“The spell I used doesn’t work like that, but if it’s going to answer your concern,” she said, and leaned down to caress my ribs, also feeling my muscles, which were hardy enough to resist a month in prison… Definitely hardy enough to make her blush as she caressed them. </p><p>“Maybe you should remove my shirt,” I said. “In case there’s some internal bleeding or something?” I added, and she blushed, but since it was actually a good idea because of the rib injuries which she was unable to rely on her diagnostic spells to check, she couldn’t reject it. </p><p>Though, the way her hands flew over the buttons despite their trembling, I doubted she wanted to do so in any case. “Tell me if it hurts,” she said as she started dragging her fingers along my muscles, giving a more thorough examination than necessary, not that I was complaining. My only issue was the dress she was wearing, completely lacking in any kind of cleavage despite her excessive lean. </p><p>“My leg is still hurting,” I reminded her when she finally finished her examination, and was about to reach for my shirt to close it. </p><p>“Okay,” she said, a bit louder than necessary, but wasted no time reaching for the string that held my prison-pants on my waist. I raised my hips, and she pulled my pants down, only to reveal that my underwear was a bit thinner than she expected, even giving a blurry silhouette of my shaft. </p><p>She made a great show of not looking at it even as she gently grabbed my thigh, giving them a very thorough examination despite any lasting sign of danger. “Hmm… There’s a suspicious spot, I need more light,” she said and cast bright light magic. The fact that it appeared between me and my shaft, therefore creating a very clear silhouette of my shaft for her to watch was completely coincidental. </p><p>Surely… </p><p>I decided to cut to the chase. “You can touch it, you know…” I said. </p><p>“What!” she gasped as she jumped back, the light spell she cast disappearing in an instant, her face contorted with shock. </p><p>“Nothing to feel ashamed of, sweetie. It’s my fault that you have been subjected to my erection for a whole hour while you tried to heal me. That’s the least I can do,” I said, then smirked. “Think of it as a part of our training.” </p><p>“But…” she murmured. “What if…” she added, only to fade once more. “It would be a scandal,” she finally admitted. </p><p>“Only if people knew about it,” I explained rationally. “You won’t tell, and I won’t either, and even if I did, no one would believe me. We’re in a secure cell with no way recording. It’s completely safe if you’re feeling curious…” </p><p>“No!” she said loudly. “No, no, nooo…” she repeated, each repeat destroying her conviction quicker than I ever could, the last one escaping like a resigned breath. She started walking toward me. “You promise you won’t tell anyone?” she asked, vulnerable. </p><p>“I promise,” I said. “Dark Lord’s honor,” I added with a chuckle, which made her let out a nervous giggle as well. </p><p>Then, silence ruled the room as she wrapped her fingers around my shaft, her fingers unable to meet on the other side. “Are they all this big?” she asked, her eyes wide. “It’s supposed to go there, how?” </p><p>I was so tempted to offer a demonstration, but it was far too early. “I don’t know about other men, but it’s probably average, maybe even below average if what they say about men who seek power is true,” I added with a depreciating chuckle, despite fully knowing where it was falling on the spectrum. I was proud of my cock, it helped me seduce so many wives and daughters of my enemies, helping me solve issues bloodlessly thanks to a spy that would never be suspected… </p><p>“Impossible,” she gasped, squeezing harder, and I gasped. “Am I hurting you,” she asked. </p><p>“No, actually, that’s what I would have done to relieve myself if it wasn’t for my hands,” I said. “Now, I have to suffer that the whole day.” </p><p>She was smart enough to read the under-text, but naive enough to not realize it was a very obvious trap. Maybe not naive, but blinded by her own desire, which seemed to be a rather new emotion for her. “Maybe I can help you,” she said. </p><p>“You would?” I gasped happily, making a show of being surprised. </p><p>“Yes,” she replied shakily. “It’s not weird, is it?” she added, her tone lingering in a way that suggested I didn’t need to struggle much to convince her about the next step. The hook was in place, now it was time to reel her onto the shore… </p><p>“No, no,” I replied quickly to console her now that a handjob was on the line. “When you think about it, it's a part of your healer duties.” She nodded seriously, both of us aware of the level of nonsense I had just spouted, but she was far too curious —and no less aroused thanks to my meddling— to not take the chance. </p><p>I bit the inside of my cheek, just to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. After all, it was the only Princess of the Empire of Light, fiancee of the illustrious hero Lancelot, the most prestigious healer of the lands… And she was currently crouched in front of me, her fingers wrapped around my erection, squeezing slowly with an intense look of concentration on her face. Even after going through all the effort to arrange it, I struggled to believe that it was true. </p><p>“The most important thing about a handjob is to find the perfect amount of pressure,” I explained. “Too soft, and the impact will be limited, too hard, and it’ll just cause discomfort,” I explained, and she listened with rapt attention, slowly squeezing her hand while waiting for a sign from me. “That’s a bit too hard,” I warned, and she loosened her grip to a perfect degree. </p><p>“How about now?” she whispered, her eyes resolutely avoiding my eyes, but also had the sight of my shaft trapped between her fingers. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “But, keep your eyes on your job on hand, it’ll make you react better,” I explained. She followed my recommendation, but not without a thick blush covering her face. “You seem a bit uncomfortable, though. How about if you sit on my legs instead,” I offered, feeling comfortable enough to push for more. </p><p>A serious expression appeared on her face, but before she could say anything, a very distinctive clack of footsteps reached our ears, signaling another visitor. The panic that appeared on her face would have been amusing if her fumbling fingers as she tried to stuff my shaft back into my pants hadn’t risked my whole plan. </p><p>“Calm down and take a deep breath!” I ordered with the full might of my ruling persona. I was lucky that she responded to that rather than going even more catatonic. “Now, put my cock back into my pants, button up my shirt, and do your best to look exhausted. I’m going to act unconscious to make the situation even less suspicious,” I added rapidly. </p><p>Surprisingly, she nodded and followed my orders with a steady hand rather than falling into pieces. I closed my eyes, but I could still feel that she finished dressed me and already in the middle of the room when the door opened. </p><p>I wondered who our visitor was? </p>
