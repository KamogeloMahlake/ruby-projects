        <p>I waited until Aviada was reasonably aroused until I started pumping my mana inside her, triggering a flood of experience for her. </p><p>[-915 Mana]</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock, one that would have been suspicious even as she struggled under the growing throes of pleasure, but luckily, Carla was too focused on the location where our bodies were meeting with each other repeatedly to actually pay attention to Aviada’s face as she looked at me questioningly. </p><p>Luckily, she proved to be a touch wiser than I had given her a credit to, and kept her mouth shut when I sent her a warning glare. Or at least, that was what I assumed was the reason, but considering her personality, I feared that it was more about the growing pressure of her orgasm. Only a few seconds later she let out a string of moans, suggesting that her not blurting what happened might be more about the rush of pleasure than any genuine sense of trying to keep things hidden. </p><p>Just to be safe, I grabbed her discarded panties and stuffed her mouth, continuing to pump into her vigorously. </p><p>And with that, the risk carried by Aviada’s mouth was effectively disarmed, allowing me to focus on the other sexy martial goddess in the room, who was absentmindedly playing with her beautiful red hair as she watched us with a shocked expression, still having trouble believing what was going on. </p><p>I expected that state to last for a while, thinking what I should do, when she opened her mouth. “You look red,” she said mockingly as she looked at Aviada, earning a frustrated groan, but when Aviada tried to answer by removing her panties out of her mouth, I was quick to prevent it. But true to her personality, she tried to push her hand, making me continue to grab her hand. </p><p>“She’s a bit occupied,” I said calmly even as I continued to pump inside her, enjoying the way she tightened as I exerted direct physical control over her. It was interesting to see just how similar the magical star of the school, Cornelia, and one of the more infamous martial students, Aviada, was similar despite all their outward difference, creating an alliance of submission, requiring forceful suppression more than occasionally. The only thing that differed was their preferred mode, Aviada preferring direct applications of strength while Cornelia enjoyed fanciful indirect displays of casting, especially in terms of explosive spells. </p><p>“Why don’t you entertain me a bit, then,” Carla answered, looking at me directly, no matter how much her eyes stirred toward Aviada’s tits. </p><p>Her words, if taken at face value, were filled with innuendo. But at this point, I was rather good at reading women —especially when it came to the matters of intimacy— and her words lacked that kind of intent. It was just an automatic response. She was just saying what came to her mind directly. Of course, that didn’t mean I would actually let that slide. “If you wish so?” I answered in a tone laced with erotic intent. Considering I was fucking her best friend in front of her mercilessly, it wasn’t exactly hard emotion to exaggerate. “Any preferred method?” </p><p>It took a second for her to realize what I meant. “N-no,” she stammered before continuing with a sharper, panicked tone. “Not like that! How can you say that, while fucking Aviada? Have you no shame?” </p><p>“I clearly don’t,” I said with a mocking smirk. “Also do you think Aviada looks like she would mind if I buried my face between your glorious tits,” I said, letting my gaze dip down her bosom, which was rather visible thanks to her nightshirt. </p><p>“She might not, but I’m not a pervert,” Carla answered, which might have been more convincing if she hadn’t been watching me as I fucked Aviada passionately. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked, the mocking edge in my tone intensifying. “Is that why you have been watching us from a corner while playing with yourself like a horny little slut? Or is that why you’re still here even as I fuck poor little Aviada,” I said, using the opportunity to flood Aviada’s insides with my mana once more. </p><p>[-1318 Mana]</p><p>“N-no,” she managed to stammer, her eyes wide open, too distracted with her own arousal to react to my words, especially since she was clearly feeling quite aroused. “T-this is nonsense, I’m leaving!” she managed to exclaim a moment later, standing up to leave. </p><p>Though, after getting up to her feet, she continued to stand rather than moving toward the door, spending a couple of extra seconds watching us like she was trying to etch it to her memory. It was a fatal mistake, I decided even as I grabbed her arm and pulled her back on the bed. Though, considering her lack of panic despite the yelp that escaped, it was hard to say she didn’t want that mistake. </p><p>Her reaction was understandable. It might be a bit vain to say, but my looks were hard to match. Not only I was a spectacular physical specimen, but also I had more than fifty points of Charisma supporting me, giving me an extraordinary aura. Dominating such a spectacular beauty like Aviada while easily immobilizing her with one hand, just added another layer of attractiveness to a martial student like Carla. “Let me go,” she stammered, but her voice was lacking conviction, trembling weakly. </p><p>“Really, that’s what you want?” I asked mockingly. </p><p>“Yes…” she said after taking a deep breath, but despite her preparation, what escaped her mouth was a soft tremble, lacking any kind of conviction. She clearly said that just to play hard, her eyes glazing whenever it slid down, watching my hips as they continued to slam inside Aviada again and again. </p><p>Which was why she was surprised when I loosened my grip around her wrist. She looked at me, shocked, unhappy with the sudden change. “Is there a problem? I did what you asked?” </p><p>“Nothing…” she murmured, trying to process the sudden change, which wasn’t made any easier by Aviada’s muffled yet enthusiastic moans. </p><p>“Is that so?” I said even as I decided to finish our little game. I slipped my hand inside her pajama bottoms, which was already straining to cover her wide hips, dipping directly into her wetness, making her moan. “It seems that your body disagrees."</p><p>“What are you doing!” she exclaimed in shock before another moan interrupted her, but the movement of her body was much more telling. Rather than trying to pull back, she slid even closer, even widening her legs to give man easier access. </p><p>“What am I doing?” I said mockingly even as I slipped my fingers deeper without the slightest issue, making her gasp in shock. “I’m fingering you, just like you want, you dirty girl. Or are you going to say that you usually hang around people having sex with no ulterior motive?” </p><p>“B-but-” she tried to stammer an answer, her gaze falling on Aviada, realizing that it was rather presumptuous for me to finger another woman next to her. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said even as I decided to move forward in a more memorable manner, and ripped off her pajamas with a rough pull along with her panties, leaving her bottom bare. “It wouldn’t be the first threesome she experienced,” I added even as I slapped her ass, my other hand still around her wrists, preventing her from retaliating. </p><p>She opened her mouth to argue, but when my fingers returned to her entrance, she was quick to abandon those. “You don’t need to talk,” I said even as I let my fingers loose inside her, ramming furiously. “You clearly want this, you don’t have to be a coward. Just admit it.”</p><p>The first reaction came from Aviada, who finally managed to get rid of her makeshift gag. “Wait-” she tried to argue, only to be silenced by a stiff spank to her ass, even though it forced me to abandon Carla’s fingering for a moment. </p><p>“Don’t be rude! You don’t have a right to speak, not before you can free your hands,” I commented even as I let my hand return to Carla’s body, but this time, grabbing her lush red hair, pulling her into a searing kiss. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, the insult and the challenge were more than enough to silence Aviada, while my display of physical dominance tightened her even further, earning another moan. Her submissiveness was such a convenient trait. </p><p>I pushed my shaft deeper into Aviada’s tightness while my lips launched a surprise assault to Carla’s unprepared mouth, attaining victory immediately, my tongue ravaging it freely. She just obediently accepted my assault, her body aching for my touch. </p><p>With both of my hands occupied —one around Aviada’s wrists, the other wrapped around Carla’s hair— I couldn’t rip off her shirt. Luckily, with my magic, I didn’t need to. A simple air spell was enough to shred it into nothingness, earning a shocked gasp from Carla, who didn’t appreciate the rather risky display of my magical competence, unaware of the limits of my magical capabilities. But with my tongue still buried in her mouth, she didn’t have the chance to vocalize her argument, and it wasn’t clearly important enough to pull back to deliver it. </p><p>So, I continued to kiss her aggressively even as her gloriously large breasts, big enough to rival Marianne’s, pushed against my chest, the hardness of her nipples rather noticeable against my chest. </p><p>Enjoying the lips of beauty while the other one continuously tightened around my girth made it rather hard to resist my body’s desire to explode, so I did so, filling Aviada with my warm seed, triggering another climax of hers. As she collapsed, I finally pulled out of her and let her hands go, turning my full attention to Carla. </p><p>The muffled gasp she let out as my hand found her breasts, sinking into the depths of her supple flesh, was rather spectacular. Maybe it was her body type, maybe it was the advantage given by her stats, but her tits were spectacularly sexy. </p><p>Carla’s sensual moans made things even better as I continued to squeeze her breasts, enjoying their texture to my heart’s content. Said moans finally exploded without muffling when my lips trailed down, kissing down her neck, leaving aggressive hickeys behind. </p><p>She pressed her hips against my body, capturing my half-erect shaft between her thighs, though, in their embrace, it didn’t take long for it to return back to life, squeezed between her meaty embrace. </p><p>Even if I hadn’t been aroused before, the delicious gyration of her hips would have solved the problem, using her best advantage to a great effect. She might be a voyeur, but she had no problems in adapting my touch. And her juices slowly coating my already glistening shaft, it wasn’t hard to guess where things were going. </p><p>Then, Aviada reminded one important detail, that I had forgotten her presence. She reacted as violently as I had expected her to, replacing my hand around Carla’s hair, pulling her back with an aggressiveness that made her cry in pain. I was about to react to prevent violence when I realized Aviada’s aim, and relaxed. </p><p>Meanwhile, Carla found herself forced down her lips inches away from my shaft which was hardened thanks to her efforts. “Open wide, bitch,” Aviada gloated smugly even as she pressed Carla’s head forward. “Do you think you can mock me without a cost,” she added gleefully, but weirdly enough, her anger felt rather mischievous. Apparently, it counted as a friendly move in Aviada’s dictionary. </p><p>No doubt she had problems making friends, if that was the way she could treat her best friend. </p><p>Carla opened her mouth, whether trying to argue or asking for a reprieve I didn’t know, because Aviada didn’t miss a beat before pushing her head forward, clogging her mouth with my thickness…</p><p>Apparently, things were about to have an unexpected —but no means unwelcome— turn…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370	Mana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [95/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>
