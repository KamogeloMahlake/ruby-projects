        <p>"It’s not something I expected from you,” Sarah said after she followed me outside, her gaze noticing my bike. </p><p>“Did I give you the impression of a guy with a sensible hybrid car?” I asked. </p><p>“More like one of those boring electric bikes,” she retaliated. “At least when you’re at school,” she murmured under her breath, clearly aware that our private activities drew a completely different picture. </p><p>I chuckled at her words, but didn’t reply, recognizing a bait when I see one. Instead, I passed the spare helmet her, and took my seat. She looked hesitant, but that only cost her a few seconds before she took the seat behind me, her arms wrapping around my midsection. </p><p>She let out a beautiful breath as her arms wrapped around me, the pressure of her chest enough to show her underwear was as deficient as her top. </p><p>“Do I need to go slow, in case you’re afraid?” I asked. </p><p>Her answer was as predictable as the sunrise. “Of course not, I can handle all the speed you can handle.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I started driving, her arms loosely around my waist as I drove out of town. </p><p>Slow enough to actually hear her words. “Oh, you call this fast?” she chuckled. </p><p>I said nothing, and continued driving until we were out of the town, remembering a beautiful connecting road I had discovered with next to no traffic. </p><p>The perfect place to push her limits, the desire to do so intensifying with each offhand comment I was receiving from her. I didn’t say anything until we arrived on the road. “Why are we here?” she asked. </p><p>“To give you the speed you wanted, of course,” I said. </p><p>She didn’t answer. Or more accurately, she couldn’t answer, busy letting out a shocked cry as I pushed the engine to the limit, bursting into three-digit speeds in less than ten seconds. Her arms tightened around my chest hard, contrasting greatly with her earlier soft wrap even as I overtook the occasional vehicle on the road aggressively. </p><p>Yet, she wasn’t clear all negative about the speed I was displaying, as I could feel her hips moving slowly, a completely unnecessary move, but the best way to address her growing arousal on the way. </p><p>I drove fast, which was safer than the impression I gave. The biggest danger of a bike was being blindsided by an unknown car, and if there was one thing football taught me as a quarterback, it was to be aware of the surrounding entities. </p><p>A great skill to have when you have two-hundred-pound pure-muscle guys trying to take off your head. Compared to that, driving on an empty highway was much simpler. </p><p>Sarah was not aware of that little fact, getting tenser by the minute even with the arousal invading her body. Fear and arousal were an interesting combination. I might have slowed down, but with her string of barbs at the start, she deserved a punishment. </p><p>A punishment that lasted fifteen minutes before I felt it was finally about to pass playful and reach cruel. Yet, rather than stopping, I slowed down, and took a turn toward a dirt road. </p><p>She said nothing, but her arms relaxed around my body, which showed her approval. </p><p>It lasted only until we hit a particularly nasty section of road, aggressively bumpy. And just like that, her tenseness was back, but with a different flavor. “J-jerk,” she managed to gasp, smart enough to realize that it was intentional. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, realizing that it was intentional did nothing to reduce the impact, especially after our coffee shop adventure already priming her body to the limit. </p><p>“Hey, you’re the one that challenged me,” I said as I continued to drive, enjoying subjecting her to the side effects of our little adventure, vibrations traveling across her body with each bump. </p><p>She shuffled helplessly, trying to control her desire, but the only thing she managed to achieve was to enhance her pleasure. Even worse for her, after all the times we spent together, I was easily able to read her arousal, and adjust the number of bumps I targeted to maintain her on the edge.</p><p>It didn’t take long for her to realize I was playing with her, and she decided to cheat. One of her arms pulled away and slid between our bodies, with little doubt about what her fingers were up to. </p><p>I stopped immediately, braking hard enough to turn it into a short yet exciting slide. </p><p>“Why did you stop,” she asked even as I stepped down. </p><p>“To prevent you from cheating, of course,” I answered, letting my smirk widen. </p><p>“What cheating, I wasn’t cheating!” she declared, which neatly bypassed the issue that whether we actually agreed to a game for her to cheat. </p><p>Her competitiveness was useful as always. </p><p>“Why are your fingers glistening, then,” I said, enjoying her panic as she realized she was caught. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she murmured as she tightened her legs. </p><p>“You’re lucky that I’m a nice guy,” I said, which earned a huff of dismissal from her. Not entirely undeserved, I decided even as I ignored it. “So, I’ll forgive you, even give you the time to solve your issue before we drive back.”</p><p>“H-how dare you!” she growled in anger.  </p><p>“Suit yourself,” I said as I crossed my arms with a smirk. “But if you do so, I won’t allow you to play with yourself while driving. You have to keep your hands in front of me at all times. And I won’t  stop, no matter how much you beg.” </p><p>“Deal, let’s see who will be begging at the end of our journey,” she said. I took the seat once more, and her arms wrapped around my waist. </p><p>She didn’t even wait until we could speed up, her hands dropping down immediately to my budge, caressing up and down. Not a bad choice, if she couldn’t finish herself, she could always drag me to the cliff with her. </p><p>I chuckled as I picked up speed once more, the combination of bumps and speed working wonders in her mood. Her fingers responded in kind, unaware she was making a huge strategic mistake. </p><p>Whenever she was particularly close to climaxing, her fingers stiffened in anticipation. It acted as a warning, and used the opportunity to drive on the smoother side of the road, until she came down from the highest point. </p><p>Only to repeat again…</p><p>Alternating between smooth and bumpy, fast and slow, it didn’t take long for Sarah to feel frizzled, the way she was moving was the most excellent clue. </p><p>She started shuffling desperately, rubbing against the seat even as her breasts smashed against my back, as she went up and down to get some extra arousal, too rhythmic to be disguised as a search for a new position. </p><p>Pity driving a bike was too dangerous to just turn to get a glimpse of her. I would have loved to capture that familiar sense of arousal, enhanced even further by the sensation of danger she was dealing with. </p><p>She clearly enjoyed the danger, and all that it promised. </p><p>She didn’t forget the challenge in her pleasure as well, and, other than the occasional pause as she danced at the peak, her fingers worked hard to drive me crazy. </p><p>Pity that she picked her timing wrong for such a challenge. The fun fashion session with Umi and Irene was interrupted, but only after something that would empower me had happened. </p><p>It was fun, the kind I would enjoy stretching for hours, but I decided not to push too much. Not because I was a gentleman — as I was very definitively not, as I proved many times — but because it was getting dangerous. She was shifting and shuffling too much, and I was afraid of an accident. </p><p>No matter what, we were still on a bike. </p><p>Lost in the haze of pleasure, she was surprised when we stopped, and even more surprised when she looked around, and realized that we were at her house. </p><p>A nice concealed garden that was just lush enough to hide us from being noticed unless someone was looking very carefully. </p><p>“W-we are…” she muttered, her breathing out of control.  </p><p>“We are at our destination,” I said with a chuckle. “I hope you were happy with the trip.” </p><p>“Yes, very happy,” she answered as she removed the helmet, but avoided my gaze as she tried to conceal the most intense signs of her defeat. </p><p>Her frustrating, beautiful defeat. </p><p>“I won’t invite you inside,” she murmured in frustration before she turned to look at me. </p><p>“Perfect, as you wish,” I said with a shrug, showing that I had no problem with that. </p><p>Therefore depriving her of the challenge of taking the control of the situation. She wanted to leverage the familiar place to reassert her confidence, but I had no intention of letting her succeed. </p><p>Sarah was the kind of girl that would push for more and more if I gave her that sign of control, and I had no intention of letting her establish that precedence. </p><p>I enjoyed our current situation far too much. </p><p>“Are you … sure,” she whispered, but I just smirked at her, enjoying the fact that her pride was simply too intense to take that statement back. </p><p>“Oh, very sure,” I answered, my smile leaving no doubt about my intent. </p><p>“We’ll see,” she growled, and started walking toward the door, angry yet sexy at the same time, her hips swinging excessively as they called for me. </p><p>It was exaggerated and obvious, but neither of those prevented the moves from being incredibly effective. I was tempted, to the point of considering maybe the defeat was not too big of a problem. </p><p>Then, my angel decided to be my savior right at that moment. ‘Emergency photoshoot, fifteen minutes, don’t be late,’ the message read. Normally, I might have been annoyed by the uninvited visitors, but not them  — and not for the purpose they shared. </p><p>“See you tomorrow, and feel free to visit if you can’t handle defeat,” I said to Sarah, and after a wave, drove away.</p><p>Leaving a fuming beauty behind.</p>
