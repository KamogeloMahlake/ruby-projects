        <p>“Now, before we start the meeting…” Mia murmured as she looked at her newest employee, unable to prevent herself from shuffling in discomfort even as they left the garage behind. After all, the favor she was about to ask was not a comfortable one. </p><p>She was nervous, which was not a usual emotion for her.</p><p>“I thought you didn’t have time to waste,” he said, his smirk deep enough to annoy her. </p><p>She wanted to explode in anger, which was the usual way she dealt with uppity employees, but this time, she had to choose a different path. The nature of the emergency favor she had to ask left no chance otherwise. “We need to talk about the meeting first,” she said. “If you can handle it correctly, you’ll earn yourself two months of salary as a bonus … no, three months,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, it must be something illegal,” Darion said, his smirk beginning to annoy her. </p><p>“No, just a little misdirection,” Mia answered immediately. “I just received a surprise visit from one of the biggest clients of the city but … she’s  a bit peculiar.” </p><p>His smirk got even bigger. “Let me guess. You want me to seduce her. I have to tell you, it won’t work. As much as I want to make my … boss happy, I have standards.” </p><p>Mia didn’t like his tone. She liked the way his gaze danced on her even less. “No, that’s not it,” she started, but then, she paused. After all, it was more or less what she wanted. “Not exactly at least.” He didn’t say anything, and Mia explained hurriedly. “Madam Presley has some unique tastes,” she admitted. </p><p>“That’s strike two, boss,” he said, and Mia bristled once again, annoyed that she didn’t have the chance to truly break him into obedience. Her other employees could never dare to talk back to her like this. </p><p>“Not like that,” she admitted. “She likes to … steal what others have.” </p><p>“Oh, so I’m going to play your boyfriend.” </p><p>“Fiancee, actually,” Mia admitted. “I have mentioned that I have a fiancee, and she wants to meet with him.” </p><p>“Oh, naughty. As long as she’s beautiful, I have no problems with that boss. I’m a very willing worker.” </p><p>“I can imagine,” Mia answered tersely. “Just keep your mouth and act as a fiancee would, and a quick meeting later, you’ll have your bonus.” </p><p>She stood at the entrance of her office, looking at the huge doors she had designed to intimidate visitors, for once feeling the receiving end. She took a deep breath, trying to suppress her panic. </p><p>The sudden arm, wrapping around her shoulders didn’t help. “What are you doing?” she gasped. </p><p>“Making sure we look like newly engaged, of course. A little PDA would help sell it. Don’t tell me you can’t handle it.” </p><p>“Of course, I can handle it, you oaf. Just keep your role in mind!” she warned, and opened the door. </p><p>She found Madam Presley sitting on her seat, which annoyed her, but she did her best to ignore it. After all, she already knew her habit of stealing what others had, and her seat was what she wanted to start. </p><p>Just as she was about to take a step forward, Darion spoke. “I have to admit, she’s a pretty tasty piece of ass. I might even give you a discount.” </p><p>“Act like —“ Mia started, only to freeze when she felt his hand going where it wasn’t supposed to do. “What are you doing?” she whispered, trying to act normal. </p><p>“Acting like your fiancee, of course,” he said as he pushed her forward, closing the door behind them. His fingers delved deep into her ass aggressively. She barely kept down a desire to kill him. The smile on the face of her slutty client was the only thing that kept her down. </p><p>“Honey, maybe you should try to keep it down. We don’t want to disrespect dear Madam, right?” she said loudly. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about it,” Madam Presley answered. “It’s always good to see young lovers acting their love. Feel free to act how you want.” </p><p>“You see, honey, she’s happy for a freshly engaged couple,” Darion said, fueling her anger further. </p><p>Mia let out a fake giggle as she turned her back to her client and looked at Darion. “Act normal, or I kill you,” she whispered as she threw him the most annoyed glance she could muster, unhappy with just how much he was taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>Unfortunately, as she said so, she could see his patience draining. She just made a mistake. “Either play along or tell her the truth,” he whispered back, his voice sharp enough to make her shiver in fear. </p><p>“How lovely,” Madam Presley said, and Mia decided to play along. The sale was too important, and more importantly, there was a limit to what her new employee could do next to a client. He had to have a limit. Unfortunately, as she turned toward the desk, his fingers found her ass once more, squeezing even harder. She was sure there were at least a few red welts there. </p><p>“So, we need to discuss our deal. I’m thinking a national campaign, one that’ll last at least three months,” she started, and Mia found herself a genuine smile. A national campaign meant hundreds of thousands at a minimum, likely millions; and it would bring a lot of new clients as well. </p><p>She couldn’t miss that deal. </p><p>“Something we can handle,  easily,” Mia answered, doing her best to ignore his fingers as she tried to come up with the best pitch to convince her. </p><p>“Maybe we should take a seat while talking,” Darion cut them off. </p><p>“Good idea, honey,” Mia asked, ignoring the sudden desire to stab him. But sitting down would be nice. At least, she would get rid of his fingers on her ass. </p><p>Yet, just as she tried to move toward the empty seat, she felt his grip tighten, and before she could react, she found herself on his lap!</p><p>“Honey, you’re being too disrespectful to our important client,” Mia said, her words sharp and merciless. She would kill him for taking liberties with her to this degree. </p><p>Worst, she was about to lose her client! </p><p>“Nonsense, it’s good to see young love flourish,” Madam Presley said. “It makes me trust you more, actually. A marketer should be in touch with her feeling.” </p><p>“You see, my love. Let’s get in touch with your feelings,” he said as he changed her position, and she found herself with her jacket half open, and with his shaft buried right into her crack. “And, like this, you can talk with her easily, right?” </p><p>“Excellent idea, young man,” her client commented before she could say anything. Mia had to swallow as she saw her smirk. She was clearly taking their move as a show of their love, which probably made her eventual victory even tastier. </p><p>At least she believed her, Mia repeated, trying to ignore her humiliation. A humiliation that got more intense as his grip tightened around her legs and make her move back and forth, simulating a lap dance. “You’re very skilled, honey,” he whispered, which made her tremble even worse. Anger … and if she had to admit, also arousal. </p><p>Such a terrible situation, she thought repeatedly for the next ten minutes, doing her best to deliver the outline of a national campaign, ignoring the monster under her. </p><p>“An excellent summary, I think you got the job,” Madam Presley said as she stood up. </p><p>Mia gave her a genuine smile. “Really!” </p><p>“Yes,” she said as she walked closer, and leaned forward. “Of course, we need to sign the contract, but no need to make that a boring work event. Why don’t you two visit my private club, and we can make a fun event out of it,” she said. </p><p>“S-sounds good,” Mia found herself whispering, not expecting that closeness, her arousal not making it any easier. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she stood once more, but as she did so, her jacket opened, far too wide to be accidental, and revealed her chest, her bra doing very little to her breasts. </p><p>“Oh, very good indeed,” she heard Darion say. Madam Presley smirked, then walked away… </p><p>“G-goodbye,” Mia stammered as she jumped to her feet, with no intention of extending her unique situation. </p><p>She had an employee to kill.</p>
