        <p>I found Nancy in the bed, still naked, the cover pulled haphazardly to the half of her chest, barely hiding her perfect breasts. Her skin shone on the crisp covers, while her beautiful red hair sprawled over the bed, giving a much-needed contrast to make it a striking view. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the great shock in her beautiful green eyes while she furiously browsed her phone, I would have assumed it to be an intentional pose, tempting me for some early morning fun. </p><p>Albeit, knowing the source of her shock, I wasn’t exactly surprised. </p><p>“Impossible,” she gasped repeatedly as I closed the door and walked toward her at the cost of isolating us from the fun Penny and Laura might have in the other room. Watching them was fun, but it was a level of fun I could forgo to deal with business aspects with Nancy — especially considering the great financial implications it held. </p><p>“Why don’t you tell me what’s impossible, sweetie,” I said as I took a seat next to her. </p><p>She looked at me blankly, not even noticing that as she shuffled, the covers slipped down to reveal her beautiful breasts completely, still carrying the bruises from the last night’s adventure. “The sales number of my book, there has to be a mistake.” </p><p>“Really, why don’t you pass it to me so I can check it,” I said, and took her phone before she could even answer, checking the dashboard. </p><p>I had to admit, I actually had to count the number of digits to make sure I was seeing correctly. Based on the number of mentions, I was expecting four digits. Selling a couple thousand books was certainly a small measure of success, but doing so in less than twenty-four hours was impressive even with a huge marketing campaign. </p><p>Without that, it was a small miracle. </p><p>Yet, on the screen, I could see a large miracle, consisting of five whole digits, not exactly the low end as well. However, while I understood the enormity of the success, I was also sufficiently familiar enough with such numbers — though, until the moment exclusively for other’s businesses with no profit sharing — to hide my surprise. </p><p>Not to mention, my earlier browsing prepared me for the great success we would have on the book angle as well. Not to this level, certainly, but my shock was certainly not about the money I made. Even after selling in mid-five figures, it didn’t make as much money as the private photo sets I was selling. Still, the cut I would take was a nice boost. </p><p>“Yeah, a good start,” I said casually as I passed it back to her. </p><p>“S-start,” she gasped in shock as she looked at me, her eyes wide in shock. “What do you mean it’s a start? Forty thousand books —“ she tried to continue, only to be silenced as I pressed my hand on her lips. </p><p>“I know how to read, sweetheart, but that was my point, it’s just a start. It’s just the start of success.” </p><p>“But —“ she started, only to be silenced once more, this time by a flick to her nipple. </p><p>“Cut it out. This is just a start,” I said. “Didn’t I tell you that you will have success as long as you trust me,” I said, acting like I hadn’t been struggling to get a fraction of that money just days ago.</p><p>“I … see,” she murmured, still unable to process the financial implications of our great achievement.  </p><p>“We just need to decide the best way to use this as a starting point, to see whether we could reach a number that we can call successful.” </p><p>“N-nonsense,” she stammered in shock. “What is success if over forty thousand doesn’t qualify as one?” </p><p>I shrugged. “I’m not exactly a master of book publishing, but if it was a magazine, ten million yearly,” I said, throwing a deliberately aggressive number, one that was only possible for some of the more successful international magazines. “So, maybe we should aim for a million, for a start.” </p><p>I couldn’t help it. After the great success that completely changed my financial state, I was feeling rather ambitious. </p><p>“A m-million. T-to start,” she gasped, her beautiful green eyes even wider. “You’re crazy.” Yet, even as she declared that, I could see her believing my words. </p><p>It was good, as while I was being ambitious, I actually trusted to reach such a number, though it would mean investing most of the money we made back into marketing, maybe even forcing me to spend some extra from the money I was making from selling the bonus photo set. </p><p>After all, they were two businesses reinforcing each other. No harm in supporting it a bit more.</p><p> Especially since it would put Nancy deeper into my debt, which was always nice leverage to have over such a passionate model. Not that I would use to push her, but sometimes, it was enough to have the leverage.  </p><p>“Well, then it means you’re in the bed with a crazy person,” I said as I tugged her covers, revealing her naked body, showing that it wasn’t just a figurative statement. </p><p>She opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, my lips were over hers, capturing them in a searing kiss that would unbalance her further. </p><p>I had a smirk on my face as I pulled back. “Though, I’m certainly glad we signed the contract that clearly outlines my share and responsibilities,” I said, making her eyes widen. </p><p>“Oh, honey, don’t tell me you forgot that part, or think that I’m going to arrange a marketing campaign for free,” I whispered. “I’m not saying you’re not beautiful enough to make it worthwhile, but I have my professional needs. Don’t forget that I’m trying to build a business as well. I don’t intend to spend my life in Nicole’s basement, sweetheart.” </p><p>Nancy’s blush was spectacular, and any question she might have about a possible renegotiation of the deal died under my fingers. </p><p>I didn’t want to discuss it, but not like it was a bad deal. She certainly had more share than a publishing house would have given her, and there was no possibility of them actually giving her a campaign that was actually worthwhile. </p><p>“Don’t call me sweetheart,” she answered reflexively, though it might have been more effective if a moan didn’t follow it as my fingers slipped into her wetness. </p><p>“As you wish, honey,” I said, enjoying the familiar back and forth. “Now, let’s talk about the next stage of our marketing plan,” I said. </p><p>“Right now?” she asked as she glanced down, looking between her legs, where my fingers were dancing over her core, testing her intensifying wetness. </p><p>“What better time, we need to hurry up,” I answered, yet my finger slipped deeper inside, showing I had no intention of slowing down, and stopping was just impossible. </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” she asked. </p><p>“I have already found a model for the next stage, and we were going through the test session before you rudely interrupted,” I said, only for her to stiffen. </p><p>“The other room, here,” she said, a blush suddenly spreading on her face. </p><p>“Yes,” I said smugly as I caught her gaze. “Don’t tell me that you’re feeling shy.” </p><p>“Of course not,” her answer came predictably, showing that despite suffering under the same trick several times, her pride was still strong — though, it might also be about the fact that she wasn’t particularly against the ‘suffering’ she experienced as a result. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I let my fingers quicken while I leaned to kiss her neck, teasing one of her weaker spots, making her moan cutely, which was, without a doubt, loud enough to be heard from the other room. “Now, let’s talk about your tasks,” I added, but only after a minute later. </p><p>“You want me to…” she whispered, her blush intensifying while her voice disappeared. </p><p>“Such a dirty mind,” I interrupted her with a chuckle. “No, I don’t want you to come and molest her, you naughty minx,” I said. She blushed, but didn’t try to claim that she wasn’t trying to say that.</p><p>“What do you need?” she asked, but only after a minute, and three failed attempts as I continued working on her body, the amazing success she just experienced made it particularly easy to push her toward the climax this time. She was yet to arrive at that final destination, but only because I slowed down my fingers. </p><p>“You need to select a character from the book, one that’s fitting for a thin brunette with a lithe body,” I said. “And then, you’ll show your tailoring abilities to rapidly create a costume for the stuff that’s available in the room. Do you think you can handle it?” </p><p>“Well, we have a priestess that wears white,” she said as she glanced at the bedsheets.</p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I grabbed her shoulder and pushed her down, my fingers lashing out aggressively, helping her to take the last step, then pulled back after one last kiss, leaving her trembling on the bed. </p><p>“But wouldn’t they mind about the sheets? What if they make us pay back—“ she said, only for me to press my finger to her beautiful lips once more. </p><p>“Don’t forget that we have enough money, sweetie,” I said as I stood up. “You have thirty minutes,” I said with a chuckle and walked back, curious what the others had been doing in my absence.</p>
