        <p>Silence ruled the room, only interrupted by the clapping of my body against the warrior, drilling inside her aggressively. </p><p>Pity that the realization of her nature as a magical puppet reduced the pleasure I was receiving from her significantly. Luckily, not to the point of ruining it completely, especially after I had discovered a way to amplify their connection with the controller and enhance her pleasure. </p><p>It was possible only because there was no real distinction between her control and the feedback she received from them. She was able to reduce the impact somewhat, but blocking it completely was not an option. </p><p>And, I had already discovered the ability to interfere with that connection, increasing the feedback she was receiving despite her best attempts to muffle the connection. </p><p>It was not a move completely free of risk, and doing so was certainly different than my earlier actions, but finally penetrating the veil of mystery that surrounded her, I once again had the luxury of taking some calculated risks rather than playing save. </p><p>Albeit, the implication of her abilities was certainly interesting. On the one hand, they were certainly more impressive than I had expected. Creating both realistic puppets with their own levels and abilities had many potentials. Especially considering they could function as real people, to the point it actually tricked my detection capabilities. </p><p>Not to mention, tricking the System as well, as evidenced by the notification I received. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>Yet, the more I learned about her impressive abilities, the less threatening she become. The reason was twofold. The first part was the clear limitation of the clone ability. I doubted that she would miss using her fake skills in such an important situation if she had other options. </p><p>Certainly not when skills like healing would have solved most of her problems. </p><p>Ironically, that little problem wouldn’t have been a big drawback in combat. There were many spells that could be used to dull the sense of pain of the puppets, protecting the controller from the more unpleasant aspects of the deep connection. </p><p>The same didn’t apply to a seduction mission, especially not when the target was an expert mage. Using such a spell would be an excellent cause for suspicion. </p><p>It was completely redundant at this point, of course. The poor princess didn’t know her secrets were already exposed, making her struggle against the feedback from her puppets her warrior puppet a vain struggle. Not for nothing, of course, as her moans certainly helped me with my mood.  </p><p>Unaware of her situation, she continued struggling against the feedback. I didn’t bother pacing myself, neither in terms of my physical effort, nor in terms of enhancing the feedback. The monumental reveal about her attempted thievery in the headmistress’ office being discovered distracted her from focusing on why she started receiving such an intense flow of feedback. </p><p>That dilemma carried my thoughts to the second drawback of her abilities — thought that was less of a fundamental aspect, and more about her unique circumstances. </p><p>She was the only one that could use that ability. </p><p>Initially, I was reluctant to challenge her little group, because I was under impression that she had a small cadre of loyal followers, which, when combined with the ability to create fake skills and configure their stats based on the requirements of the situation, would have created an intimidating and dangerous challenge.  </p><p>Yet, the fact that she was handling a task as unglamorous as a seduction mission — to convince the target to forgive her when she tried to take revenge for her loss of control due to pleasure — strongly implied that no one else could replicate her ability. </p><p>Either the ability was unique to her, or she didn’t trust anyone. </p><p>It didn’t matter which was the case. Either way, it significantly degraded the dangerous potential she represented, making it viable for me to finally start poking into the mysteries that surrounded her. </p><p>And, there were a lot of mysteries that needed to be unraveled. Important questions. Why was she suddenly fighting with the other members of the royal family? Why did a faction of Eternals decide to support the other princes? How could she actually create fake skills and magical puppets realistic enough to actually trick the system? </p><p>Compared to that, the exact nature of the mission she wanted to send me to the capital, and the nature of the so-called keepsake were certainly a lesser mystery. </p><p>But the lesser nature of it didn’t make it any less important. </p><p>After all, one first needed to find where the yarn started before unraveling a mess. </p><p>“About the mission,” I reminded the princess through Delia, even as I grabbed her breast for contrast while the warrior continued to jump up and down. “Tell me why your princess is desperate enough to make two of her most loyal supporters whore themselves,” I said, then followed with a chuckle. “Not that you two seem to be minding,” I added when Delia echoed the moan of the warrior. </p><p>The pleasure echoing between the two was truly making a challenge for the princess to stay silent, her own moans echoing between her puppets — still under the impression that the isolation wards she created holding strong. </p><p>“It’s a personal mission, but one that was of utter importance to the princess,” Delia started, launching a detailed explanation about the challenges of the mission. </p><p>I had to admire the princess’ willpower and political acumen, as even with the constant distraction she was struggling under, she was able to deliver her expression perfectly, focusing on the tactical challenges of the mission more and more, doing her best to pull away me from the more important question. </p><p>Like, what was the item that she went all this trouble to acquire? Or whether the item carried any real importance in the first place, or the mission was there just to pull the headmistress into her political battle.</p><p>I didn’t ask those questions, giving her the impression that her distraction attempt was successful. I did so, because I wanted to show her that two beautiful women working together on me would work wonders to distract me. </p><p>I certainly wouldn’t mind a repeat the next time she wanted something, and there were other rewards to that. </p><p>[+3000 Experience]</p><p>As her explanation continued, I continued to ram into the beautiful entrance of the warrior while squeezing Delia’s breasts, their supple bodies creating an amazing view in front of me. As I continued that, I asked some operational questions to Delia, reinforcing the impression that I was lost in the operational details of the mission. </p><p>Convincing the princess that it was a viable method of tricking me into doing what she wanted was the superior choice. </p><p>With my growing understanding of her abilities, I finally had the courage to sneak into her residence, poking around to discover her secrets. I could use a more direct approach whenever I wanted, after all. </p><p>With that decision done, I turned my attention to the two magical constructs that were doing wonders allowing me to teach the princess the meaning of pleasure remotely. Still, I marveled at the expanse of flesh sprawled in front of me, drinking the alluring sight of the magical marvel in front of me. </p><p>As the princess’ explanation — through Delia — started to get more and more useless as she got lost in details, I focused my attention on the next challenge — that whether I could make the princess collapse through indirect pleasure. </p><p>For that aim, I cast a spell to make Delia float, and bring her above me, her legs on my shoulders, her core inches away from my lips. Once again, I dove into her delicious treasure, my tongue lashing out like a parched man stumbling across an oasis, enjoying her wetness. </p><p>Three sources of moans mixed — two puppets and the princess — into a beautiful symphony as I worked on my assault, my physical abilities targeting the puppets while my magical trickeries were busy enhancing the feedback those puppets were sent to the princess, creating a beautiful harmony. </p><p>Soon, the princess’ attempts to explain the mission stopped completely as she turned her full attention to handle the intense assault of pleasure for several uninterrupted minutes. </p><p>[+5000 Experience]</p><p>Yet, as I cycled through positions, I noticed one very important detail — through my constant connection with the mana string she was using to control the puppets. Her control was getting rougher and rougher, and while the intense pleasure that made it hard for her to think was a factor, I also started to see the more ordinary signs of exhaustion. </p><p>Managing two puppets at the same time was clearly an exhausting challenge for her. </p><p>That wasn’t enough to earn my mercy, not when she was ruthless enough to pull me in her political games — clearly hoping to plunge all Silver Spires into that endless pit — even as she continued to lose ground in other aspects.  </p><p>I continued to show her the extent of my carnal abilities as our bodies wrapped and danced, kisses merging into blowjobs, spanks, and chains leveraged aggressively, feeling curious when the princess would finally ask for an end. </p><p>She managed to resist for almost an hour, but before it ended, I received several other notifications. </p><p>[+27204 Experience]</p><p>[Level Up!] </p><p>[Grandmaster Tantric (113/140)]</p><p>[Warning! Divine Spark is depleted. Connect with more Divine Sparks to continue supporting the System of ———]</p><p>Leveling up was certainly nice, but the pleasure it generated was quickly countered by the other notification about lack of experience, especially since I had fed the System with Divine Spark several times, only for its effectiveness to lessen significantly with each repeat. </p><p>The system was getting greedier. </p><p>“I — I don’t think I can last for more,” Delia gasped as I filled her again. Interestingly, through the connection, I could feel that it was the princess who was on the edge of a collapse. The endless pleasure, combined with the strain of maintaining two puppets proved too much for her. </p><p>“That was a nice apology,” I said as I looked at her, enjoying the way the connection continued to flicker. I was tempted to tell her that it was still not enough to earn a proper apology, but with the System once again asking for Divine Spark I had no practical reason to extend it. </p><p>Also, I was afraid that the princess would just collapse if I pushed her more, which would have likely caused her magical puppets to stop working, which would force me to confront her. </p><p>I would rather do that on my own terms. </p><p>I smirked at the state of her exhaustion — felt through the connection with her puppets — even as I quickly fixed my clothing and walked toward the door. </p><p>“W-will you do the mission?” muttered Delia. </p><p>“Sure, why not,” I answered. “You certainly worked hard to earn that answer.” Just like that, despite her exhaustion, anger flared on her face, tempting me to push a bit more. </p><p>Instead, I left the room, leaving them alone… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>
