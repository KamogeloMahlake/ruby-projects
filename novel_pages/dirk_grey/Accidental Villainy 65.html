        <p>“Are you feeling comfortable?” I asked Emily as we walked through the mostly abandoned streets of the slums. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” Emily answered with a frustrated growl as she tugged her large work jacket. “When you said a disguise, it wasn’t what I expected. This jacket is so uncomfortable.” </p><p>“As uncomfortable as the fake beard?” I asked, earning a poke to my side. </p><p>“I hate you,” she growled. “Couldn’t I disguised as anything but a homeless old man?” she asked. “Is this about how much I spent in that lingerie shop?” She was referring to the large number of boxes that we purchased, costing me another six grand. </p><p>“No, I was very happy about buying those. I couldn’t wait until the pictures of them,” I said. Another honest response. I was glad for her shopping spree for multiple reasons. The simplest benefit was that, I would be the one that would ultimately enjoy them, so they were hardly gifts in the first place. It gave me another chance to show my generosity and appreciation, which was helpful. </p><p>Giving her another taste of glamour and ease of spending on an even minor villain was another bonus that I appreciated. </p><p>“Then, why the disguise?” she said. </p><p>“Because I don’t one anyone to notice you,” I explained. “And, homeless people are practically invisible in the slums.” It was not the first time I explained it, but I was patient, even though I looked around to make sure our disguises worked as intended. </p><p>I hadn’t been disguised as homeless before, but I had more flexibility when it came to changing my looks. First of all, I was a man, and not a beautiful woman, which meant people paid less attention to me, particularly in the seedier areas. Then, I had the benefit of my power, allowing me to quickly adjust my body language if necessary, which meant I could get away with simpler disguises. Emily, on the other hand, was liable to panic the moment we faced an obstacle. </p><p>Hence, the disguise of an old crazy man with a long beard, which had the added benefit of being easy to apply. A large hat, baggy jeans, a tattered jacket, and a fake beard, which could be put on or removed in a few seconds. </p><p>Soon, we entered the abandoned building. She looked around curiously but didn’t feel alarmed, which showed the extent of her trust in me. “Did you bring the cameras here?” she asked. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I answered as I led her toward the corner, and pointed at the dark tunnel. </p><p>“Oh, a secret tunnel, how exciting,” she muttered as she jumped in. I chuckled as I followed her, amused by her attempts to sway her hips to look attractive. Even her incredible beauty was helpless in her disguise. “You’re sure that no one will be there in the basement, right? No cameras either.” </p><p>“Yes, I made sure before leaving. I won’t let them learn your identity,” I ensured. </p><p>“Good,” she said, her voice naughtier than I expected. The reason, I learned soon after. </p><p>First, she pulled the beard and the cap, and threw both to me. Then, the jacket and the camisole followed, and my gaze widened. She had been wearing a red bra that I picked for her. A shelf bra that left her tits bare while supporting them from underneath. </p><p>I could have controlled my reaction, but it would have been rude when she had gone that far to pull a surprise for me. I gasped loudly. </p><p>Emily didn’t turn to look at me, which meant I was deprived of the biggest benefit of her new outfit. Her shoulders shook with an amused laughter. </p><p>“That’s unfair,” I said with a pouty voice. She chuckled, then followed with her next move. She removed her jeans, which were baggy enough that she could have done so without getting rid of her boots. I grabbed the discarded jeans as well, and focused on the view. </p><p>A blonde girl wearing nothing but old boots along with a sexy set of underwear, complete with stockings and a garter belt. It would have been comical if it wasn’t so erotic, the contrast between her environment and her pristine beauty doing wonders. </p><p>I continued watching her hips dance while she kept looking forward, each second giving me a deeper appreciation of her beauty, until we reached the basement that was filled with boxes. </p><p>“Wow, that’s a lot of stuff,” she said as she looked while she kept her arms around her chest at the large pile of concealed security cameras, motion sensors, pressure plates, and a plethora of other stuff, all surrounding a large, state of the art computer that cost me fifty grand to purchase. </p><p>I had purchased such a strong computer not to run the security Systems — which could have been done cheaper — but to give Emily a better toy to play with. Our previous experiments had shown that her power worked better with one strong computer rather than a multitude of weaker ones.</p><p>Of course, I had also installed the best software that was publicly available to obfuscate our connection. A tool she could use to dig around secrets safely. </p><p>Not to all of them, of course, but far more than she had been previously capable of. </p><p>“I told you it’s going to be a lot of work,” I said as I walked toward her. </p><p>“Still, why did you bother purchasing that many devices of different brands and functions? Isn’t it easier to put one big order?” </p><p>“It’s complicated. But as I spread them around, it’s inevitable that some people will discover them. I don’t want them to realize they belong to me.” It was more complicated than that, but for now, that explanation was enough. </p><p>“I see,” she answered, and didn’t ask any follow-up questions. After all, she didn’t care about the strategic nuances of villainous espionage. Her attention was already on the boxes that she was examining, and trying to look sexy as she did so. </p><p>“Why don’t you be a dear and help me unbox them,” she said. </p><p>I smirked. “Of course not. You’re the worker. I’m the supervisor. I need to watch you to make sure you don’t smuggle anything to your clothes,” I teased her, like she had anywhere to stuff them in the first place. </p><p>“Oh, how oppressive. Should I alert the villain union,” she said, her tone suspiciously like a moan as she teased me. However, even as she said that, she looked up, toward upstairs, where a sudden crunching sound had reached. </p><p>“What was that?” she asked. </p><p>“Just a steel block shattering,” I said. </p><p>She might be naive, but she wasn’t stupid and understood where I had been driving at. “Is that …” she started, then whispered even more softly. “The bouncer.” </p><p>“Yes, she’s the bodyguard they had sent. She likes to spend time breaking things. But don’t worry, she won’t come here. She doesn’t like the basement too much.” </p><p>Of course, Tara had no such problems. She was making noise on my express orders, an indirect reminder to Emily that, while I was nice to her, not everyone in the organization would be if she decided to spill secrets. A threat that was delivered without awakening any animosity in her. </p><p>Not a bad process. </p><p>“I see,” she said, her tone soft and trembling. If it wasn’t for my power, I might have assumed that it was just fear in her tone, but I caught excitement as well. </p><p>Perfect. It showed that, my extended ploy had an extended benefit. The adventure in the cafe where we confronted Eva the waitress, followed by the lingerie shopping, raised her mood to a distinctly amorous point. </p><p>And, now, when her body inevitably reacted to the threatening presence of Tara, her reaction was a jumble of fear and excitement. In a way, it reminded me of Daria’s mood. However, there was an important difference. </p><p>Daria was invulnerable, and danger was merely cosmetic to her. Emily had no such luxury. Yet, that didn’t prevent her from glancing at the door for a moment before she shivered, showing how excited she was getting. “Well, I should start working, then,” she whispered suggestively as her hands moved down, finally giving me a proper view of her breasts in the shelf bra. </p><p>Then, she turned her back, shaking her ass invitingly, which looked particularly fascinating when framed by the red garter belt. </p><p>Beautiful indeed. </p><p>“Is there no way I could convince you to help me directly…” she whispered as she leaned forward, pressing her breasts together with her arms while she shook her body gently.</p><p>“And, what would I get in return.” </p><p>“I would be so very grateful for your support,” she answered, her tone somehow managing to promise more than her revealing state. </p><p>“As long as I receive an advance payment,” I answered as I took a step forward. </p><p>But, at that point, another noise reached my ears. The ringing of a bell. It was once again Tara … but this time, it was not one for entertainment. She was informing me that we had an intruder. </p><p>It looked like my luck had finally run out. </p>
