        <p>“Yeah, let’s discuss strategy,” Coach Juana murmured, her voice even tenser than the rest of the team. I understood the source of her stress. She had been trying to get the opportunity to climb through the ranks, and the sudden depletion of the ranks finally gave her the opportunity. </p><p>She wasn’t fired despite being one of Coach Bill’s hires, but that didn’t surprise me. I had seen the effort Coach Spencer was putting to get into her pants, not dissuaded by her repeated rejections. </p><p>Actually, it was a good idea to keep someone competent like that on the team, making her work extra hard to prove herself. It would have helped him greatly to stabilize the defense, at least preventing it from collapsing. </p><p>And, since Coach Juana was just a conditioning coach, the promotion would be his achievement. </p><p>I didn’t give credit to Coach Spencer, who clearly lacked such awareness, and was more interested in just taking control. </p><p>“We are going to restrict ourselves in simple go routes and slants,” Coach Juana started as she glanced at the cornerbacks and the safeties, the positions normally responsible for defending the backside. “Have any of you played receiver before?” </p><p>Luckily, two of them raised their hands. “At high school,” they said. </p><p>“Good enough,” Coach Juana said as she pulled a paper in front of her, quickly drafting a few routes, and quickly explaining the role of each receiver. </p><p>I caught her eye and nodded subtly, showing my approval of her strategy, but I was careful not to actually declare it in a way that other players would notice. Her position was fragile enough, and it was better for them to think that she had control. </p><p>I would prefer her as the defensive coordinator, because she had the necessary attitude to push the players. Not to mention, she worked hard to help me since the first day. </p><p>And I always paid my debts. </p><p>There were some corrections that could be done, of course. She was smart, but her traits allowed me to process information in a way that was truly shocking. Still, I didn’t speak, because I could easily implement those changes during the game, which was the perk of playing the Quarterback. </p><p>“Now, the offensive line,” she said with a frown as she looked at the defensive linemen, which was a much bigger challenge. Drawing strategies for newbie receivers was not too difficult because the receiver had the initiative. They chose the attack lines, and the defensive players responded. </p><p>It was a gross simplification of the process, of course, as if it was that simple, football teams wouldn’t have more tactical personnel than the number of players on the field. In an actual match, the distribution of the receivers triggered the defense response, which forced the attackers to adjust, which then the defense responded again… </p><p>Our greatest advantage was the physical mismatch between our players and the practice squad, allowing us to use simple strategies. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same didn’t apply to the offensive line. They were tasked to defend the quarterback, and their situation was the exact opposite of the receivers. The defense chose how they would attack, and the offensive line needed to respond. </p><p>Even worse, they needed to make sure they coordinated with the others appropriately to make sure they left no gap, like who would be responsible for defending if a fifth or sixth defender blitzed, and how the rest would compensate. </p><p>“Maybe we should keep a tight end to support the line,” she murmured, showing she was concerned for my safety.</p><p>Considering the objective of the situation, understandable. </p><p>“No need,” I said with a wave of my hand. “I can handle the offensive line myself with last-second adjustments,” I said. “Ultimately, it’s the passing skills that will convince them, and we can’t reduce the number of receivers for extra protection.” </p><p>“How about running back,” she asked, and I turned to Marcus. </p><p>“Marcus would be the best. He’s quick, and he can double as another receiving threat. Would you mind playing it,” I said, earning a nod. I asked him, because I was planning to use him as a predominantly receiving threat, and he was quick enough to do so. </p><p>It was another risky choice, but Coach Juana limited herself to a tight look, not intervening with my decision. It was a risky decision, because running back was, like a tight end, often used for protection in case of a breakdown in the offensive line. </p><p>Since practice squad players would be determined to give up a show to gain Coach Spencer’s attention, giving up that protection would have been a terrible choice if I didn’t have my traits. </p><p>With them, it was another opportunity to farm some intent, especially since we had far more viewers than I had expected. </p><p>We turned our attention to the detailed tactics, quickly giving each player their tasks — which was much slower due to the lack of defensive personnel — when we heard the unwelcome voice. </p><p>“We shouldn’t keep the people waiting, people, let’s act,” said Kevin, the arrogance in his tone not surprising me the slightest. He was already confident in his skills — arrogant was the better term — before Coach Spencer chose to involve himself and skew the scales further. </p><p>Though, when I turned and saw Coach Spencer behind him, I was surprised. Not because of the intent, but of the dedication he was showing to alienate every single defensive player. I wondered whether he didn’t care if we lost, all the remaining players would be looking to transfer. </p><p>But regardless, his presence gave me a good opportunity. I was looking to create a scandal. </p><p>“Oh, let’s do it, I’m enthusiastic to teach Sunset College how a proper quarterback plays,” I said even as I walked closer. Then, I lowered my voice, to make sure no one else than those two could hear. “No matter how much the dumb and the dumber work hard to make everyone forget it, carried by the defense,” I said. </p><p>I could have used Intimidation against them, but I deliberately stayed away from that. Instead, I relied on Taunt, putting a mocking expression on my face.</p><p>It was super effective. </p><p>Their faces contorted in matching expressions of anger, making them look like brothers for a  moment. “What did you say?” growled Coach Spencer. </p><p>“I just wished for luck,” I said, much louder. “But if you are cowardly enough to use this as an excuse to cancel the bet, I can’t stop you. You’re the coach, after all.” Then, I chuckled. “For now, at least.” </p><p>Coach Spencer looked angry, and for a moment, I was sure that he would start swinging. Pity that he received help from Kevin at the last second as he leaned and whispered to his ear. </p><p>But that close call was enough to remind me of my other task, to create a scandal that Megan could push on social media, enough to get Coach Spencer fired. </p><p>Or at least, take an indefinite leave of absence. </p><p>“We’re starting in two minutes. The offense would go first, to kindly show you how it is done,” Coach Spencer growled, unable to suppress his juvenile anger as he turned back and walked away. </p><p>“Fun, right,” I said while the rest of the team exploded into laughter, familiar with my personality enough to guess what I had done, appreciating the shot. </p><p>We continued to discuss tactics as the offense took the field against the practice squad, quickly dismantling them even under Kevin’s control. Not too surprising, as not only they were doing it against the practice squad, but also they were doing it against a defensive squad that was running even weaker than normal. </p><p>Clearly not want to anger Coach Spencer. </p><p>Yet, as I watched them, a frown appeared on my face. There were a few faces that were unfamiliar to me. Two at the defensive line, two as cornerbacks, and one as a linebacker. </p><p>“Do you recognize those?” I asked Marcus as I pointed at them. </p><p>“No, but they must have been the newest recruits. The coach is pushing them to make the defense even weaker. I’m sure they won’t play against us,” Marcus said, but I frowned. </p><p>It was reasonable, but I didn’t believe that for one important reason. Their footwork was much better than I expected from last-minute replacements. Still, I didn’t bother following up with Marcus. </p><p>He was an experienced player, but he lacked the attitude to make him truly good. After all, there was a reason he wasn’t included in the list of players poached by Coach Bill. </p><p>Instead, I pulled out my phone and called Megan. “Make sure you record Coach Spencer continuously,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, why?” she asked. </p><p>“Because he’ll give you the scandal we’re looking for before we disperse,” I said, letting my smirk widen even as I watched the offense score in a long, beautiful pass. </p><p>If Spencer wanted to play dirty, I was more than happy to accommodate. </p>
