        <p>Due to some last minute changes in the next arc that affects the story, unfortunately I'm going to be <strong>a couple days late </strong>posting it. My sincere apologies for the delay. <em> I should be able to fix that in a couple of days, but, </em><em><strong>in the worst case</strong></em><em>, I'm going to post two chapters </em><em><strong>next Friday.</strong></em><em> </em></p>
