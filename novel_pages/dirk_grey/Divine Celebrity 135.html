        <p>When I arrived at the basketball stadium, Kim was yet to arrive. “Hey,” I said as I called her. </p><p>“Sorry about that, it took longer to get everything,,  but I’ll be there in a few minutes,” Kim answered. “Have you finished getting the approval for the commercial release? That was fast.” </p><p>I paused. “Was I supposed to?”  </p><p>“Didn’t Megan mention it?” she countered. </p><p>“Nope, she probably forget in all the excitement,” I answered.  </p><p>“Company lawyers didn’t mention it as well?” Kim countered. </p><p>I chuckled. “I see that I’m not the only one that missed some important briefing,” I said, followed by a quick breakdown of what happened, including the ‘lucky’ break we had received. </p><p>“Interesting,” Kim answered. “But that means there are some problems.” </p><p>“Like what?” I asked. </p><p>“Getting the approval for the commercial release of the photographs is quite a hurdle. There are a lot of approvals to be received, and school lawyers are obsessive about every single detail. Normally, their company lawyers are supposed to handle it,  but…” </p><p>“I wouldn’t worry about that,” I answered. “Just be here in five minutes and we can begin.” After she ended the call, I called another familiar name. “Hey, how’s my favorite coach doing?” I asked. </p><p>“Trying to conquer a mountain of paperwork,” Juana answered. “This place is a mess.”  </p><p>“Good, since you’re busy with it, adding one more shouldn’t be a problem?” </p><p>“What do you need?” she answered, her voice sharpening immediately. </p><p>“Nothing much. I just need the approval from your department that we can use my photos in commercial activities,” I said. </p><p>She sighed. “Just tell the company lawyers to contact our legal department. That’s why we have them,” she said, ready to end the call. </p><p>“Unfortunately, I’m working with a small company that’s also founded by a student, and we don’t have the time to find a lawyer. So we’re hoping that the department will handle everything.” </p><p>“That’s not how it works,” she answered.</p><p>I chuckled. “As you wish, but it would mean I won’t be able to visit the basketball team and annoy the coaching team as you wanted. I don’t think I’ll have the time, not with all the legal documents I have to fill…” </p><p>“You’re annoying as always,” she growled. “I’ll make sure the legal department handles both. But, you have to make sure the head coach of the basketball team is distracted enough not to make too much trouble. It’s even better if he can skip tonight’s meeting.”  </p><p>“I can do that, but that’ll cost you extra,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“What else do you want?” she asked. </p><p>“A selfie of your beauty,” I answered. </p><p>“You’re truly shameless,” she growled in anger and the call ended. But, despite the anger, I recognized something in her tone, so, I wasn’t surprised when my phone was buzzed. </p><p>It was a photo of hers. She was on her desk, with her breasts pressing against the desk as she leaned forward. The pressure would have created a beautiful cleavage if she hadn’t already unbuttoned her shirt and gotten rid of her shirt, revealing her amazing tits for my gaze. </p><p>Yet, she was still wearing her blazer, which added to her allure. </p><p> Her face didn’t show in the picture, but the beautiful dusky hue of her skin left no doubt about her identity. I had spent too much time with her naked self to mistake her. And, even if that was not enough evidence, I could still see several hickeys that had been left during our previous encounter, functioning as her unique, beautiful ID. </p><p>‘Satisfied?’ she texted. </p><p>‘For now,’ I answered, which earned an angry emoji from her. I leaned against the car, waiting for Kim to arrive. But, before she could do so, someone else approached me first. A Middle-Eastern beauty. “Hi, Terry,” she murmured as she looked at me with a big blush. “Or, should I call you coach?” </p><p>If it wasn’t for my Divine enhancements, I might have had trouble recognizing her. Considering that the only time I met with her was at a party, with flashing lights making her look very different than the only other time I had seen her, I doubted she could blame me.  </p><p>“Hey,” I said with a smile. </p><p>She responded with a disappointed frown. “You don’t remember me,” she commented sadly. </p><p>I chuckled as I took a step forward, grabbed her hand, and brought it to my lips, enjoying her blush. “Oh, how could I forget my beautiful rook, who had gone all that trouble to dress for me,” I said, telling her that I remembered her very well. </p><p>She was a part of the celebration after our first monumental victory, one that allowed us to push for more. She was the one that dressed as a rook … and not wrongly. She certainly had the assets to justify it. </p><p>“But you don’t remember my name,” she complained, but it was far more different than her previous statement, playful and cottequish rather than angry. </p><p>I smirked as I took half a step forward, cutting into her personal space. It would have been classified as an aggressive move, but she leaned forward to cut the distance even more, showing she didn’t mind it. “Unfortunately, that’s not my fault,” I whispered throatily. </p><p>She shivered. “How so,” she whispered back, no less throaty.</p><p>“If you think back, you never paused to grant me your beautiful name…” I said as my gaze dipped down, looking down at her shirt. It wasn’t particularly revealing, but from my angle, I could still see a lot. “Instead, you were busy showing me some other beautiful stuff.” </p><p>She paused for a moment as the memories assaulted her, her blush spreading. “At least you remember them,” she whispered. “Otherwise, you might have shattered my fragile confidence.” </p><p>Though, she leaned forward a bit more as she said that, pressing her body against mine. I might have stopped her — to make the situation a bit more fun rather than anything else — but I was distracted by something else. </p><p>An echo … one that coming from her. For a moment, I panicked — thought didn’t give any outward sign — thinking that she could also use magic, but then, I realized it was not that. </p><p>It was something similar to Intent, yet stronger … it felt soft and fuzzy, yet boiling at the same time. </p><p>It was lust…</p><p>Or, more accurately, the Domain of Lust. </p><p>Even as I put my hand on her waist — far lower than it would have been appropriate, but considering everything else we had done together, not too shocking — I felt the sensation get even more intense. I couldn’t help but wonder why I felt that, and why I hadn’t felt it before. </p><p>Especially since I had such an explosive encounter with my beautiful coach — and her enjoyment of our naked dance was obvious — and Megan — whose desire for my body was not hidden, but she deliberately suppressed it nonetheless for her pride — but didn’t feel the same type of control. </p><p>No, there was something different with the situation, one that I needed to experiment with a little more. My hand slipped a bit more, cupping her ass … her desire for more intensified immediately, something I could read easily. </p><p>“Oh, I see that the gossip about you dumping that whore Megan is not wrong,” she whispered throatily, showing once again just how fast Megan had been working. I doubted that she claimed she had been dumped, but the cheerleader in front of me clearly wanted to use that opportunity to deliver a small dig. </p><p>That, I didn’t care much. I was more interested in the flicker of Lust I could feel in her. I had expected it to get more intense as I responded to her flirting, especially since I could see just how much she appreciated it. Her desire was clear. </p><p>Yet, the flicker I could feel got dimmer rather than getting stronger. </p><p>Curious, I leaned forward, and she reached to meet the kiss, enthusiastic, but the moment our lips touched, the special flicker of Lust I could feel from her disappeared. Interesting, I thought as my tongue invaded her mouth. </p><p>Only to be interrupted by an angry cry. “Miriam! What’s going on!” shouted a voice. I turned, only to see a tall figure rushing toward me. And, when I said tall, I meant it.  He was around six-seven, muscular, and from the speed he rushed forward, quite fast. </p><p>Miriam took a panicked speed back. “Hello, sweetie,” she said, with very little panic in her tone. “Terry was just asking me how to get into the gym, but I said it’s only for the basketball players.” </p><p>The boy calmed down as the girl whose name I finally learned obfuscated the satiation. “That’s good, sweetie,” he said, his anger toward her disappearing, showing he wasn’t exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer. </p><p>Anger was back on his face as he positioned his body between me and his girlfriend, and he poked me in the chest. “If I see you near my girl…” he started.</p><p>I could have easily solved the problem, either by confirming her story or slamming him to the ground … but feeling the flicker of Lust alive in her once more, I decided to do neither. Why bother missing such a great opportunity.</p><p>“A good threat, but how about we solve it in the basketball field, winner takes her,” I declared, curious whether it was just an unmet desire. Yet, that seemed not to be the case, as I felt the flicker in her go off once more even if her face contorted with pride and desire. </p><p>“That’s absurd—“ he started. </p><p>“If you’re afraid to play basketball against a football player?” I commented.</p><p>“I’m not afraid,” he immediately responded. “Deal!” Then, it clicked with him. “Honey, I’m sorry, I know that—“ he started. </p><p>Miriam met his gaze with a smile. “Oh, sweetie, don’t worry about it. I love your passion to fight for me, just demolish him,” she whispered, but didn’t neglect to wink at me, clearly happy that a duel would be fought for her. Then, she dragged his boyfriend away before it turned into a fistfight, leaving me back. </p><p>Her hips dancing far too aggressively not to be a show for me. </p>
