The tusks were currently red from the heat. It looked like a pig demon from hell. It was the boss of this area whom we had been planning to hunt for the last few days.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a long standing quest for hunting any bosses in the area.</p><p><br></p><p>From what we learned, the boss of an area always respawns after a certain period of time. For example the boar which I had hunted for my Hunter Advancement Quest or the wolf which Veena and I had hunted while on our way to Llyne had both respawned after fifteen days.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t know if other monster bosses also respawned at the same time or if they are different but we intended to find out and hunt them on the day they respawned.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, according to Shiroe, some big guilds in his previous game monopolised the boss areas by not letting anyone go there to keep control on the drops from them. This helped their guilds to grow at a fast speed as well as gave them a monopoly on the items obtained from it.</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked him if he wanted to do that but he had denied it as that would just push the non guild members against us. What we intended to do was wipe out all the bosses around Llyne until any other team was capable of fighting a T5 Monster.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time they get there, we would be well set to go off to other areas with stronger monsters already.</p><p><br></p><p>Star was not far behind as two arrows quickly shot, one piercing through its eyes and the other on its leg, making it limp weakly.</p><p><br></p><p>I couched slightly and jumped for the overhead strike, using Heavy Strike.</p><p><br></p><p>The ground beneath its feet within two metres radius cracked with my strike as the boar crumbled on its knees. I didn’t stop the attack and used Double Strike and Swift Strike back to back to inflict more damage on it as quickly as I could before backing away.</p><p><br></p><p>The beast was strong, perhaps the strongest we had fought after the Goblin Chieftain although that monster was half dead due to the previous attacks and also poisoned.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as I was a few metres away from it, a huge fireball crashed on the boar. The beast let out a loud shriek which disoriented me a little.</p><p><br></p><p>Dizzy Status.</p><p><br></p><p>Reduced accuracy by 60% and speed by 40% for the skill duration.</p><p><br></p><p>To cover for me, an Earth Wall appeared before me while I stepped back slightly to clear my head.</p><p><br></p><p>The status effect lasted twelve seconds and in that time, Shiroe and Star kept the beast contained. I could have used the Reversed Cursed Technique to get rid of it but decided not to as it would be better to save it for when my health was low and other emergencies.</p><p><br></p><p>My head cleared at the same time as the Earth Wall before me was crushed by the beast and I raised my shield and braced up for the crash.</p><p><br></p><p>The wall had slowed the monster to a certain extent and I was able to push it back and used another Skill, Focused Strike.</p><p><br></p><p>The strike targeted it directly on its eyes and the beast howled.</p><p><br></p><p>Star took this opportunity to send in a barrage of arrows at it again.</p><p><br></p><p>We slowly chipped away at its health over the next fifteen minutes before that beast finally fell.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn….are T5 Monsters really this strong?” Star asked as he looked at the drops in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was a T5 Boss. Obviously it will be strong. A normal T5 Monster would have been done in 2 minutes at best.” Shiroe said as he checked the drops while we checked the notifications.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a level up, I noticed as I checked the other notifications.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, it’s congratulating us for the first kill of the boss. Do you think we would get first kill bonuses for every boss we kill?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“First kill?” I scrolled the notifications and indeed, it said first kill. “I didn’t get these when hunting those bosses for my hunter exams. Is this a new feature?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Has to be. Check out the loot.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>We went ahead and did.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Skill Book, yes. Flame Charge. Guess this will be for Arty too.” Shiroe said as he tossed the book at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the Skill and shook my head. “It’s good but I have enough skills for now. Let’s keep this for our other frontliners.” I really had a whole slew of skills.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need more as I wanted to concentrate on my current skills and level them up first.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the guys shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, you’re currently our only frontliner so it’s your decision.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and we soon collected everything we could and started heading back to town.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, that debuff was unexpected. It was even an area debuff and could have been troublesome for us. We really need to get our hands on that healer.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Veena said she would talk to Elaine. We can see if she wants to be our healer or not.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, she did? That’s good then. We would be able to act far better with a healer and supporter around.” Shiroe said thoughtfully.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, how is your new equipment working, Star?” I asked. “Is it up to your expectations?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah….that old man can really make good stuff. This set feels far less restrictive than my old one and yet has better stats. Thanks for the raw materials though.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t sweat it. You are part of the team now. You being strong will only help us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, today’s drops were good. We can probably earn a hefty sum if we sell the horn and the tusks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It dropped three tusks and one horn. I wasn’t expecting that many.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We even got one hundred and twenty thousand exp in total. That’s busted. I gained two levels in my Ranger Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was probably because of the first kill bonus.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we should totally clear out all the bosses in the area and get their first kill bonuses.” Star said. “This shit is great for quickly levelling up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Next time perhaps we should include Veena or she would be left behind too much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. She has been working too hard these days to gather funds.” Shiroe also nodded. “Alright, I will ask around and plan about the other bosses. We can try hunting two or three more before going for our next expedition.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’d be for the best.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, we should get some furniture for the Guild. I am tired of sleeping in a sleeping bag even inside the guild room.” Star said. “I miss sleeping on a proper bed, dammit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We were actually planning to buy another building as the guild hostels and rent them out to Guild members before this entire Sabaody thing came up. That was the reason we didn’t buy any beds for the Guild rooms. But sure, we should get one for each of you.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am fine. I got a tailor to make me something like a Japanese futon which I am used to sleeping in. I don’t need a bed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As you wish….although I feel most comfortable when sleeping on a bed.” Star shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, a bed is more comfortable for me too.” I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“See! That’s what I am talking about. By the way Arty….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the deal between you and Veena?” Star suddenly threw the bomb.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? What do you mean by ‘deal’?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Relation. I mean are you two an item?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe, although didn’t speak anything, looked at me with a curious look.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, we don’t have anything like that going on between us.” I denied.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t lying. There really wasn’t anything serious going on between <a href="https://us….at" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">us….at</a> least by devil terms.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way I was going to tell them that I was sleeping with her every night.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! I was pretty sure you two were a couple or something. You always have this….chemistry between the both of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” I asked, surprised at the sudden revelation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if I am being honest, I thought that too. She did call you her partner the first time we met.” Shiroe shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“And your face when that Dwain guy insulted <a href="https://her….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">her….it</a> was scary.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah….Dwain….that idiot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, we are good friends. Very good friends. We have been through some serious shit together and we have been together since then but….we don’t have anything like that between us. Moreover, isn’t it common sense to get angry when your friend is insulted?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….can’t argue with that. After all, I was annoyed at that bastard too.” He shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about some other things as we travelled.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching Llyne, both Star and Shiroe went ahead to buy a bed for Star while I went back towards my home’s direction.</p><p><br></p><p>What came next was not something I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“You two….entered the game to go after her?” She asked, stunned at the reveal but the girl was already too intoxicated and fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>“Elaine, Elaine!” She tried waking up the girl but to no avail. She was already in deep sleep by now.</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a sigh and picked up the girl and carried her to Arthas’ room and let her sleep there.</p><p><br></p><p>The bed was pretty unused as Arthas slept with her in her room so it wouldn’t be a problem to let her sleep here.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, she couldn’t let the drunk and unconscious girl sleep in the living room.</p><p><br></p><p>She returned to the living room and her mind tried to process the information.</p><p><br></p><p>She said that they had entered the game to go after her….which meant they entered the game later than the rest. So there was a high chance that she might know what was going on in the outside world, especially the supernatural side of things.</p><p><br></p><p>There were many things she wanted to ask her.</p><p><br></p><p>How much time had passed?</p><p><br>Who were the people involved in this whole mess?</p><p><br></p><p>What were the people outside doing and why couldn’t they bring out the people from this game?</p><p><br></p><p>Because she was sure that if there was a way, they would have tried it rather than entering the game to rescue her lover’s little sister.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the door of the room once more and then shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that she heard a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>A look from the window told her who it was outside the door.</p><p><br></p><p>She opened the door to see Arthas.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at her for a moment and opened his mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened? You look worried.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“They entered the game later? There are still players entering the game?” I asked, absolutely stunned at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>The information was quite unexpected.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only Veena’s guess about Elaine turned out to be true and she was a magician, she was no ordinary magician either but rather someone quite famous.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were here to save someone.” She clarified.  </p><p><br></p><p>“Save whom?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Her lover’s sister.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And she’s here alone?”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena shook her head. “Both her lover and she entered the game to save his little sister, someone she took care of as their maid. Although, now that I think of it, she said ‘we’ so maybe someone else might have accompanied them too, I am not sure. We will have to ask her when she wakes up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know anything about them? I mean their identities?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Her lover is the heir or rather former heir of the Pendragon family, Arthur Pendragon and his sister is Le Fay Pendragon, someone who entered the game on the first day.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br>Arthur Pendragon….wasn’t he the member of the Khaos Brigade?</p><p><br></p><p>His sister was inside this game?</p><p><br></p><p>Did this mean that the rest of the Vali Team were here too….and that’s if they were the members of the Vali Team in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>….damn, this world is messed up, isn’t it?</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and spoke. “Well, there is nothing we can do worrying about it right now. We just need to wait for her to get up tomorrow. We can hear her story then. Who knows, she might be speaking something odd due to being intoxicated. You did say she was blabbering, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Yes. It’s just that….her words caught me off guard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. I know how worried you are about the outside world. Trying to find some hope at this time is not something unexpected.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, such wise words.” She smiled again….and she was back.</p><p><br></p><p>I returned her smile. “Alright, I will get cleaned too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will serve your dinner.”</p><p><br></p><p>She had her dinner earlier with Elaine and had bought food from the inn today.</p><p><br></p><p>Elaine was sleeping in my room….not that I was using that bed nowadays so we went to Veena’s room as usual.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, how was your day? Did the hunt go well? You guys were planning on raiding an area boss, right?” She asked as she sat on a chair and stretched herself. She must be tired from all the work.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Yes. It went better than I was expecting. We took down the boar and found something interesting too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Turns out that from now on, we get the first kill bonus for the bosses.”</p><p><br></p><p>“First kill?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The first team to kill the boss in the game gets extra experience and maybe even greater drop rates.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….that sounds reasonable. After all, other teams can face the enemy prepared after learning of your exploits. It reduces the danger for them considerably so you ought to be paid more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes….and that’s why we have decided to take care of all the bosses around Llyne and the nearby towns before anyone else. Other players are barely near our levels and it will be a while before they can come anywhere near the levels needed to hunt the bosses, especially the T5 ones. We can take all the first Kill Bonuses. We even got a Skill Book drop today, something which Shiroe thinks happened only because of the first kill bonus or the drop rates would have been abysmal. The experience gains were also great. You should join us next time or you might fall behind in levels.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I see. Alright, I will join you guys. When do you plan for the next hunt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shiroe is collecting information about the next boss while Star will scout the area. We will plan for the attack after that, so three days probably.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you need some poisons for the hunt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe, we need to wait for more information?”  I shrugged. </p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly remembering something, I smiled and told her about what Star and Shiroe thought about us.</p><p><br></p><p>The reaction was as I had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>She chuckled at the words. “Well, they weren’t that far off, are they?” She smirked, making my eyes widen slightly before she added. “After all, we do live in the same house and even sleep together every night.”</p><p><br></p><p>It took me only a fraction of second to realise that she was teasing me again and I rolled my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She then got up and yawned. “Hmm….I smell like mead. Ah, I was busy with all the information about Elaine and didn’t get the chance to take a bath. Let me take one now.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and laid down.</p><p><br></p><p>What I wasn’t expecting was her going to her cupboard and bringing out her towel before letting her gown fall without any warning.</p><p><br></p><p>My mouth opened slightly at the sight of her clad in only her underwear.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wearing a black bra and panties. It was nothing fancy as we were in the mediaeval ages but that was not enough to hide her beauty</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, I stared longer than usual and when I looked up, I saw her with a victorious smirk on her face but this time I wasn’t able to roll my eyes and play it off.</p><p><br></p><p>Our eyes met and then she looked down to my crotch and I realised that I was sporting a massive hardon.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly adjusted my position and covered myself while she just smiled and then stretched one last time, making her underwear cling to her body and her curves twisting hypnotically with her movements. With that done, she slowly wrapped her towel around her body and sashayed out.</p><p><br></p><p>When she was gone I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding in.</p><p><br></p><p>She….wow.</p><p><br></p><p>I really had no words.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what did this woman want?</p><p><br></p><p>On one hand I was aroused and at the same time the knowledge of her true identity brought me out of my stupor.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what was this woman thinking?</p><p><br></p><p>Was she coming onto me or….was this just another one of her games?</p><p><br></p><p>I could never tell with her.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the same woman who kept poison with her till only recently.</p><p><br></p><p>Again, remembering what I did about DxD, the devil race, especially the Gremory family had a very weird sense of privacy.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Rias had no problems with being naked….so it could probably be a normal thing for her?</p><p><br></p><p>She did say that Devils had a very different sense of privacy from humans.</p><p><br></p><p>The words of Star and Shiroe from this evening came to my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>No….I shouldn’t rush anything and spoil the current thing we have going on between us.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, there was Elaine in the house….</p><p><br></p><p>Ughh….I need to clear my head.</p><p><br></p><p>So I closed my eyes and took deep breaths and calmed myself down.</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened after some time and I opened my eyes to see Veena enter the room and close the door behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wrapped in the same towel but this time, unlike when she went out, she wasn’t wearing her underwear as I could see half her ass peeking out of the towel.</p><p><br></p><p>Her hair was still wet and I couldn’t pry my eyes off of her figure. She went to the cupboard and what happened next made me open my mouth wide in shock. She bent slightly as she picked up her clothes in the lower shelves as the towel went up, giving me an open view of her ass with the light hints of lower lips.</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled out a new pair of underwear and straightened before putting on a pair of violet panties. She however didn’t stop to wear her bra or gown, instead she removed her towel and dried her hair and looked back, giving me a full view of her breasts.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me….more than a few seconds to pry my gaze away from that scene and I looked up at her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“What, like what you saw?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem very surprised. I did tell you that devils have a very different sense of privacy. Now that you know about me, I can be more open about it. Although if you mind, I can hold back….I just take from your expression that you have no problems with this either?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….I….well, I….what?”</p><p><br></p><p>She chuckled. “Oh come on, I thought you said you asked me if I was available? Well I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>My mouth opened at her words as my mind raced back to yesterday’s conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>I had shrugged….just shrugged….did she take it as me propositioning her?</p><p><br></p><p>She realised that I was processing the information she had thrown on me so she gave me some time as she came to the bed and took her position, still half naked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, this feels much better. I could never get used to sleeping with clothes.” She said as she laid down.</p><p><br></p><p>….like mother, like daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this where Rias had gotten her habit of sleeping naked from?</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The sight in front of me was absolutely stunning to look at.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it must be the resistance I had developed to her antics over the months that I was able to collect my senses soon enough and after processing everything she had said, I looked at her and asked seriously to clear things.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you serious?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Oh yes. Sleeping with clothes always seems very restrictive, not to mention the marks they leave on your skin. Sleeping without any clothes feels far more free and unrestricted, especially after a bath.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I mean….serious about this….whole thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>She stared at me, directly into my eyes. “While devils do have a more open minded attitude towards nudity, I don’t show my skin to anyone I don’t approve of and like.”</p><p><br></p><p>I realised that my words could be interpreted in a different way and apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry, I didn’t mean that. What I mean was….if you want a serious relationship?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, and what do you want?” She asked, casually.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you want this….then yes, I would like a serious relationship. I….don’t know how devils do things but….I have lived my life with a certain set of values and I don’t think I would be comfortable with something like this so suddenly. I am sorry if that’s not what you have in mind.” I slowly put my thoughts into words.</p><p><br></p><p>While I didn’t have any problem with this relationship, I didn’t want it to be a casual fling. I guess I am just that sort of guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I can understand that. Yes, it would be too much to just give up what you are all of a sudden. I take it that you want our relationship to be exclusive as in me not having any other men in my life while we are together?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>This part was non negotiable.</p><p><br></p><p>She shrugged. “I don’t see why not. I have been in a relationship with my husband my entire life with no other men. I don’t see why this would be any different. Although you have to make one compromise for me too.” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Compromise?” I asked, a slight frown on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled. “While I will not take any other male lovers, you….have to take some other female lovers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?!” I was totally caught off guard at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“I told you earlier, didn’t I, that my husband had a harem of his own?” She asked and I nodded, not understanding where she was going with this. “Well, I was the one who managed it as the lady of the house. In my thousand years, I have experienced plenty of female lovers as well. If I cannot have male lovers, I can agree to that….but you have to compromise as well. Get some more female lovers. The choice of partners will be yours. I wouldn’t mind spending some time with them either….oh, looks like you agree as well.” She smirked looking down and I realised a moment later that she was looking at my crotch where I was sporting a rock hard erection.</p><p><br></p><p>And who could blame me?</p><p><br></p><p>This woman….this gorgeous woman, was half naked, only in her panties on my bed and was asking me to get more girls as lovers….</p><p><br></p><p>I could almost see the scenes of women surrounding me with Venelana between them.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only the experiences of both my lives stopping me from jumping her right at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you serious?” I was barely able to utter those words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. I know exactly what I am asking for. Don’t you think both sides have to compromise on something?”</p><p><br></p><p>How was this a compromise?</p><p><br></p><p>It was obviously a win-win scenario for me?</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Alright. I agree.”</p><p><br></p><p>She held my hand and pulled me to her. “Then come on, here. You look like you are in pain already.”</p><p><br></p><p>I fell on her breasts and felt the soft goodness on my face, only this time the feeling was far more pronounced as there were no clothes dampening the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, since things have come this far, it would be stupid of me to hold back now.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands slipped downwards and wrapped around her waist. Her skin was cool due to the bath she had taken. I looked up.</p><p><br></p><p>No words were said but she leaned and I covered the rest of the distance and took her lips for mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Her lips were soft and with slight probing, they parted and I felt her tongue touch my lip. In the next instant, my own lips parted and met her tongue halfway as my hands came upwards and reached her breasts as I felt her soft mountains on my palm, giving it a soft squeeze. She moaned into my mouth and I left her hand travelling down from my thigh, reaching further down and grabbing my length from the top of my shorts, gently stroking it.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt jolts of pleasure as her hands moved slowly but with a firm grip on my length.</p><p><br></p><p>We broke the kiss and she looked down. “We should get this off. You look like you will suffocate if you wear this any longer. Lay down and let me help you out.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was not in a condition to deny it and lay on my back and relaxed as she crawled between my legs, her breasts laying on my thighs and her face directly over my erection. I could feel her warm breath on my length even with clothes on. She untied the string of my shorts and pulled them down.</p><p><br></p><p>My length sprang up, hitting her in the face, her eyes widening at the action. “Oh my!” She exclaimed before taking a look at me. “This is….bigger than I was expecting, especially the girth.” And then she rubbed her cheeks on it. “Hmm, the smell is nice too.” Finally done with it, she placed a kiss on my tip. </p><p><br></p><p>“Aghh.” I groaned in pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up and slowly tucked her hair behind her ear and kissed the tip again before giving it a small lick.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath at the stimulation.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it just my imagination or was I incredibly sensitive?</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I remembered, I was not this sensitive. Then again, it could be because this was my first sexual encounter in this life and….I haven’t had a release in months….</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts could go any further as a warm feeling enveloped my tip and let out a groan of pleasure and looked at Veena who was staring back at me, directly into my eyes as she slowly enveloped more of my length, all the while her tongue worked on my tip.</p><p><br></p><p>She bobbed her head slowly and increased her speed over time and I felt a rush of pleasure run down my spine.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s not like I had no experience….well, at least in my previous life. I have had a few girlfriends in my previous life and had been intimate with them too but this….Veena was far above any of them had been.</p><p><br></p><p>The centuries, perhaps millenia long experience was showing as she worked my shaft, her cheeks vacuuming as she pulled back with a popping sound.</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my fist as the pain from my fingernails biting my skin helped me control myself from spilling all my seeds over her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She however wasn’t done yet as she kissed the tip once more before bringing out her tongue and giving my whole length a long lick, going down till she reached my balls. She took one of them into her mouth and sucked on it before leaving it and going to the other one and then alternated between them.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes, enjoying her ministrations. One of my hands inadvertently went to the back of her head and took a hold of her hair. Realising what I was doing, I quickly opened my eyes and looked at her and I saw her smirk.</p><p><br></p><p>She left my balls and took my tip into her mouth again and nodded at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood what she meant and my cock twitched in her mouth. I gripped her hair tighter and pushed her down on my length.</p><p><br></p><p>She went along and slowly I increased the force, pushing her more and more on my cock. It was as if she didn’t have any gag effects at all….or maybe she had trained herself not to gag anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Her drool covered my entire length and the scene of her usually calm and composed face, going down on my length and drooling on me, the sheer sense of domination and lust mixed with the intense pleasure was too much for me to hold back any longer as I finally erupted inside her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands pressed her head down on my length and she didn’t push back either, instead gripping my waist, pulling me further into her throat where I released rope after rope of semen till I collapsed back on our bed once more, breathing heavily.</p><p><br></p><p>I let go of her head and she too pulled back and gulped down everything, some semen dripping slowly from the corner of her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, you were really pent up, weren’t you?” She said as she wiped it with her finger and sucked on the finger before licking her lips while looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene was so erotic that it brought me back to life almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Or rather you are even now.” She completed as she eyed my hardening length.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sorry if I was too rough.” I managed to utter as I regained my senses after the climax.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing I can’t handle, dear. In fact, I enjoy it when my partner takes control more. You shouldn’t apologise. Be more confident. Trust me, women like more confident men.” She said as she stroked my length once more.</p><p><br></p><p>I held her hand. “Let me….do something for you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>A smile bloomed on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why thank you. I won’t lie but I am quite excited myself. It’s been several years since I have had a man.” She said while kissing me in my neck and laying on the bed, her legs spread. I understood her meaning and got between her legs, her violet panties right before my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was her words which made me raise my eyebrows. “Several years? I thought your husband and you were together till recently.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh but we haven’t been intimate with each other for almost a decade. Previously it was to have another child to take on the heirship of the Gremory House after my eldest became the current Lucifer. After the birth of my daughter, eighteen, almost nineteen years ago, the times we had been intimate dwindled a lot as that responsibility was gone from our shoulders. He had his harem and as for me, I was searching for someone I could connect with rather than have a small fling. This would have obviously come after my daughter got married and we revealed the information about us parting ways to everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A decade?!” I exclaimed, making her giggle.</p><p><br></p><p>“A decade without a man….I did have some dalliances with the women of my husband’s harem. We are good friends and have been intimate with each other before so it wasn’t something new to anyone really.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well in that case, I can only give it my all and hope I do not disappoint you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I doubt that.” She encouraged me as she slid her panties to the side and traced her slit to show me her wetness. “I got this wet from just the kiss and sucking you off. I doubt I would last that long. Moreover, this body….seems more sensitive for some reason.” She said rubbing her slit a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>I gulped at the sight and slowly lowered myself between her legs as her musky smell assaulted my nose. Moving her hand, I got a closer look of her pussy.</p><p><br></p><p>She had a small, trimmed bush on top, below which pink lips of flesh opened like the petals of some flower. They were currently glistening with arousal and looked delectable, as if inviting me to eat her up.</p><p><br></p><p>And I did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>I dove directly into her, giving her a soft kiss on her pussy first and then started with a long lick of her slit.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Hhmmm</em>.” She moaned and I continued as her taste assaulted my tongue. Her hand came on top of my head as she caressed my hair, softly drawing circles on my head.</p><p><br></p><p>She tasted….delicious.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this game making this up or did she actually feel and taste like this?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t waste my time in thoughts and continued licking as my fingers searched and found her clit, hidden behind a hood of skin and pinched it slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahhhh!....yes.” Her fingers gripped my hair at the sudden stimulation, not enough to cause pain but fueling my lust even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I licked up to her clit and took it in my mouth and licked it before rolling it between my fingers. Her moans increased more as did her grip on my hair as she pushed me into her crotch more.</p><p><br></p><p>She was even wetter and my finger found her hole and pushed a finger inside.</p><p><br></p><p>It was hot and tight like entering, her slopping wetness being the only reason I was even able to push myself inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Her insides gripped my finger tightly and her folds caressed me as I pulled back my finger, as if refusing to let me go.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Hmm yes</em>, right there. Go on, don’t stop.”</p><p><br></p><p>I followed her instructions and worked my finger into her narrow canal and when it became easier to move, I added one more finger inside. Her moans grew louder.</p><p><br></p><p>I increased the speed of my hands and after just a minute or so, her grip on my hair tightened and she pushed me further into her pussy as a loud, throaty moan erupted from her. Her body arched and jolted as she came directly on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….she’s a squirter….I love it.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t stop however and continued my fingering till she was completely done with her orgasm and then looked at her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She had a glassy look in her eyes, her mouth opened slightly and a look of intense satisfaction on her face. It took her a few moments to recover from her climax and when she did, she looked at me, coming forward and holding my cock and pulling me forward by it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t sit there in a daze. Come in, I don’t think I can hold back any longer. Give yourself to me.” She said as she rubbed my tip on her slit, her eyes closing as she relished in the pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave her a peck on her lips before taking control of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>My cock was already wet again, covered in her own liquids and so, when I pushed in, I was able to enter her a bit. Her pussy tried to prevent my entry due to her tightness but neither of us wanted to back away and I pushed more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghhh….soo big….mmph.” She half cried, half moaned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” I asked, worried that she was getting hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t stop.” She almost growled, as her legs wrapped around me, trying to pull me in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, as you wish.” If that's what she wished, then I won’t hold back either.</p><p><br></p><p>I leaned in and took a hold of her waist and pushed in, harder, not stopping this time due to her cries. Her pussy was gripping me like a vice as I inched forward bit by bit before I was completely bottomed inside her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhhh….yesss~ I have missed this feeling for so long.” She moaned, her head leaning back as she relished in the feeling of me inside her.</p><p><br></p><p>I let her have her time and get used to my length before pulling back and shoving it in all at once, eliciting another loud moan from her.</p><p><br></p><p>Her hands gripped my hand which were holding her waist tightly, her nails piercing my skin as I began to fuck her with long, hard strokes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm ahhh, yes….just like that. Faster. Go faster.” She spoke between her moans and I obliged.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my hands left her waist and grabbed her breast and rolled her nipples between my thumb and index finger while the other one went to her clit, flicking and teasing it.</p><p><br></p><p>Her body shuddered and her pussy tightened once more as she came for the second time tonight.</p><p><br></p><p>I however wasn’t done and kept on thrusting, slowly increasing my pace.</p><p><br></p><p>Sounds of flesh slapping flesh echoed throughout the room as her moans sounded to me like music.</p><p><br></p><p>A few more minutes later, I felt my climax approaching too and gripped her breasts tightly and started pounding into her with reckless abandon.</p><p><br></p><p>Later on, I would remember this and be glad that we couldn’t hurt any other player within the cities and other safe areas or this would have probably seriously hurt her.</p><p><br></p><p>But since this was not the case here, I bottomed out inside her, shooting rope after rope of my semen inside her as she too shuddered, coming for the third time tonight.</p><p><br></p><p>I collapsed on top of her and kissed her neck languidly as she breathed hard, her hands caressing my back as if praising me for my performance tonight.</p><p><br></p><p>“T-that was….amazing.” I breathed out into her ears.</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-yess, yes it was….ah, but I hope you are not done yet. I have a decade-long thirst to quench and you are going to accompany me till the end.” She whispered in my ear.</p><p><br></p><p>The result….I became hard inside her once more.</p><p><br></p><p>My stats were nothing to scoff about.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s what I am talking about.” She smiled before her legs wrapped around my waist and I began moving again.</p><p><br></p><p>I came three more times that night while she came five more times before she let me go. Our entire bed was wet and the entire room smelled of sex.</p><p><br></p><p>It was without a doubt, the best night I have had since entering the game.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up the next morning and felt a weight on my chest and saw a mop of brown hair in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The next thing which assaulted my senses was the musky smell of the entire room and the memories of the last night flashed in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>We had been going at it until dawn and looking at the window, it seemed as if we were late getting up.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s a good thing today we didn’t have any hunts scheduled as Shiroe was going to collect information about the next bosses.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, I should probably get up.</p><p><br></p><p>Elaine is still in the other room.</p><p><br></p><p>My moving woke Veena up and she looked up at me groggily. “Hmm, is it morning already?” She asked while getting up and stretching her body.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s probably afternoon.” I replied while looking at her figure again.</p><p><br></p><p>Even after last night’s….events, just the scene of her stretching made my already hard morning wood even harder.</p><p><br></p><p>She also noticed it and chuckled. “Oh my, excited so early in the morning?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you blame me?” I asked with a smile of my own. “I am beside such a stunning woman. It would be odd if I wasn’t like this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My my, did you get a Silver Tongue after last night?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I could always show you if you want. You did seem to enjoy my tongue quite a lot last night.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my! As delightful as that sounds, I guess we are already late for our duties. Moreover, I don’t think our guest would appreciate being kept waiting while we indulged in pleasure.”</p><p><br></p><p>A serious look came to my face as I remembered the thing about Elaine.</p><p><br>We wanted to ask her about the information on the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh don’t look so disappointed. We still have tonight. You don’t think I was done with just one night, do you?” She said as she leaned me and kissed me.</p><p><br></p><p>My hand slipped around her and my tongue reached her lips which she opened, inviting me within.</p><p><br></p><p>We separated after a minute or two.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, good morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>We cleaned up and got dressed before leaving the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside, Elaine was waiting too.</p><p><br></p><p>She was sober right now and looked slightly tense so she probably remembered what had happened yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning, Elaine.” Veena wished. “My apologies. We were tired last night and slept late today. Please give me half an hour to make myself presentable.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl bowed primly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas, please give her company till then.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and looked at the girl while Veena walked towards the bath.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl also looked at me and hesitated before opening her mouth. “Guild Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Call me Arthas. This is my home. I prefer not to bring my work to my home.” I said, quoting my father.</p><p><br></p><p>Both mother and he made it a point to keep their work outside the home and concentrate on the family, something I was quite glad about.</p><p><br></p><p>She hesitated and nodded and a period of silence fell over the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I made anhmm effort to break the silence from my side.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….Veena tells me that you are a magician, I mean in the real world. Is that true?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a bit interested in her as I didn’t know anything about her apart from the fact that Arthur Pendragon had run away from his home so that he could be with her. It was only from Veena’s words that I found out that she was apparently some big deal in the Magical World too.</p><p><br></p><p>She opened her mouth, hesitating slightly before nodding.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I am new to this as Veena only told me about this recently so I am just a bit curious about everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I was a part of the Golden Dawn Magician Organisation before my services with the Pendragon family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Pendragon Family? The same one with Arthur Pendragon?” I asked, pretending to be surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “That’s amazing. My mother named me after Arthur Pendragon too. Oh, my real name is Arthur Strauss. Mom was always interested in stories of the myths.” I said, trying to break the ice.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not a lie either and somehow my plot seemed to work too.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw a look of interest in her eyes but she was still a bit hesitant.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later, I understood why she was like that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, by the way, I have slightly muted emotions so if you feel the difference in my words and expressions, I apologise.” I said and a look of realisation appeared on her face.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://“No….no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“No….no</a>, I am sorry. I didn’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. Most people take it as me being too serious or just plain rude so it’s better to clarify things beforehand to spare everyone the awkwardness later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, an odd expression came to her face as she looked at me carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthur Strauss….Strauss….if I am not prying too much, may I ask where you are from? I mean in the real world?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Zurich, Switzerland.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me for a moment. “Are you perhaps related to George Strauss of the Strauss Industries?”</p><p><br></p><p>This took me by surprise and I replied with a nod. “Do you know my dad?”<br><br></p><p>She nodded. “Mr. George and his wife, Mrs. Emilia has been a patron of the Golden Dawn Organisation for years. Before them, it was his father, your grandfather, Mr. Marcus Strauss.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!” My dad was a magician? And mom too?</p><p><br></p><p>She seemed to realise my confusion and spoke before I could say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Patrons don’t necessarily mean being Magicians themselves. Golden Dawn and many other such organisations have patrons, people who give them donations for various things but mainly protection.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me, protection?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and explained. “Yes, protection. You realise that in the supernatural world, it is very easy for even a normal human magician to hypnotise and take over any industry?”</p><p><br></p><p>I froze at the implications of her words.</p><p><br></p><p>I had never thought about all this before but it did make sense.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, even Devils and Fallen Angels had businesses in the human world so there were obviously other races and supernatural factions with similar businesses in the human world.</p><p><br></p><p>And where there is business, there is competition and fighting. In such cases, anyone from the supernatural side could easily control any rich person and easily drain them completely. They would be able to do nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>She explained further and her words were in accordance with my guesses.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure there are unsaid laws against such things but there is no concrete body to enforce this and again….they are unsaid laws. Nothing is concrete. To prevent such things, most big businesses have contracts with the Supernatural side of the world. They provide them funds for research and in return receive protection from such cases. In many cases, they are also the ones who help the Supernatural factions clear out news of the sightings of the supernatural world if such an incident happens and keep a lid on things so it is a cooperation of mutual benefit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So….”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. While your family has been associated with the Golden Dawn for several generations, there have been no magicians in your family. They have always maintained a strictly business relationship with the Golden Dawn.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then how do you know about them? I don’t think you would remember the names of everyone who supports Golden Dawn?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously not. I only remember you because I remember George Strauss searching for ways to cure his son’s muted emotions. He wanted to check if there was any supernatural involvement in it and if you were in any kind of danger.” She smiled at me. “You have very good parents.”</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my mouth at the sudden revelations. “I….I do.”</p><p><br></p><p>It really warmed my heart to have such parents in this new life.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….they would have been happy to see my improvement in all this time.” A look of determination came to my eyes. “I guess I just have to complete this game and go out to meet them.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me again and nodded. “Yes. We will complete this game for sure and reunite with our precious people.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this time Veena came out of the bath, all changed up.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see you two are getting along well. Good. Since you have already gotten acquainted, we can get to the serious talks once again.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href="https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Soul Art Online’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, finally the time has come which many were waiting for.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arthas bagged the devil milf.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apart from that, I tried to build up the background a bit with the information about Arthas’ parents.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Next chapter, we will see the reactions of everyone to the things going on outside.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>
