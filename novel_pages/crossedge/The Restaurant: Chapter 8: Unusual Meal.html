        <p><strong>Isekai Restaurant</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 8: Unusual Meal</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>___________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man, completely surprised by his question.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>He grinned widely. “What kind of woman is your type?” He grinned as he threw his jacket aside. “If I don’t like your answer, I will beat your ass. By the way, I like tall women with a big ass.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>So I didn’t hear it wrong?</p><p><br></p><p>Who asks this kind of question at the beginning of the battle?</p><p><br></p><p>Is this some kind of trigger for his Curse Technique?</p><p><br></p><p>“I….guess I like cute girls.” I answered unsurely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? What kind of answer is that? Everyone likes cute girls. I mean what kind of body type do you like?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, so he’s one of those.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t really have any specific preferences as long as they have good personalities.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How boring! A person’s fetish describes everything about them. You Silas….are also disappointing.” He shouted and I looked at Gojo-san with a questioning look.</p><p><br></p><p>Was there something wrong with his head?</p><p><br></p><p>The guy just smiled and shrugged and the next second, I caught sight of a fist from the corner of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised my hand and was barely able to block the attack which sent me flying into some boxes on the side of the room.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Megumi -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He winced as he remembered the same thing happening back then. The musclehead didn’t stop there. He rushed to the boxes and picked Silas by the leg and smashed him against the wall and threw him towards the other end of the battlefield before almost teleporting there and punching him in the face, making him crash in the training dummies.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei. You said they were new students. That’s a bit too much for newbies.” He told sensei who was still looking at the fight with a smile on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah? Megumi-kun, are you worried about your Kouhai? That’s so adorable.”</p><p><br></p><p>He felt a vein bulge in his head and looked away.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole trip, in fact this whole place was suspicious from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, things had hardly been normal since the whole Shibuya incident.</p><p><br></p><p>First they find that Nobara and Nanami-sensei were dead while Gojo-sensei was sealed off and Principal Masamichi was declared a rogue.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the whole incident with the barriers over the country breaking and then Gojo-sensei reappearing and the higher ups….disappearing.</p><p><br></p><p>And after all that, not only Nobara appears, even Nanami-sensei turns out to be alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobara had told them about the new students but she was prohibited from telling them about the exact details.</p><p><br></p><p>She however seemed a bit hesitant about all this.</p><p><br></p><p>For this reason, they were all looking forward to this visit a lot to see what kind of students were taken in as the new first years.</p><p><br></p><p>But who would have thought that there would be such a story behind all this?</p><p><br></p><p>Other worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Students from a different world.</p><p><br></p><p>A literal fucking dragon was serving them noodles.</p><p><br></p><p>Could this day get any weirder….and turns out that it could.</p><p><br></p><p>That kid….Naruto….his Cursed Energy….was unreal….Like it had to be some kind of illusion. There was no way that was real….</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, when he remembered the incident of the barrier breaking over Japan, he reigned his thoughts in.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it related to this place?</p><p><br></p><p>Well, obviously it had to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this place some kind of cursed site which released all that cursed energy on being awakened? But that’s not how things worked!</p><p><br></p><p>Megumi was having a hard time processing everything and now this.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Todo stopped after a while and looked at the debris of the training dummy.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the other two new students.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto looked a bit worried but it was the girl who gave him dangerous vibes. She was looking at Todo with almost dead eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei….I think that's too much. He hasn't even fought back the entire time.” Yuji said, suddenly attracting their attention to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. I guess that's true. It won't do if he doesn't fight back. Let's fix that.” He nodded and shouted towards the debris. “Silas-kun. In a spar you have to fight back. We are not doing turn by turn fighting like before!”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The debris moved and the guy got up….almost uninjured.</p><p><br></p><p>He rubbed the side of his face, looking astonished as if not believing it himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry. I just got an overall upgrade yesterday and I am not used to my current strength yet. I think I more or less have an idea now.” He apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>Why are you apologising, dude? You were the one getting beaten up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha that’s more like it. Come on!” Todo shouted, excited for the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy drew a knife from the sheath.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked like a….kitchen knife.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that a cursed tool?” Maki asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that is….we don’t exactly know. It was originally a sword and when we tried to craft it, its shape changed on its own and took the shape of a knife.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That is a holy sword made by a God to kill dragons.” The dragon girl, Tohru said.</p><p><br></p><p>“A God?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. That sword was the one God Loki used to attack me. Boss kept it. It probably responded to the wish of the user and changed into the shape they wanted to change it to.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked back at Silas and he moved the knife. “Chop.”</p><p><br></p><p>Aoi Todo dodged instinctively but….nothing happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone looked confused at Silas but he didn’t stop and kept making moves. Todo kept on moving but….absolutely nothing happened no matter how much he attacked…. Until Todo got tired of dodging and tried attacking him.</p><p><br></p><p>In that very instant, his entire body was riddled with cuts and he was thrown into the side of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was!” He looked at Gojo-sensei. “Is he also?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. He is different. His technique is….far more dangerous than Sukuna’s.” Gojo-sensei smiled looking at Yuji. “He can attack anything he wants to attack and completely bypass anything that he wishes to….absolutely anything. In simple words his attacks only hurt what he wants to hurt and ignore the existence of any kind of defense….even my Limitless Technique. You just cannot defend against it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....you have got to be kidding me.”</p><p><br></p><p>They thought the fight was completed and Todo lost but the guy got up, rubbing the blood on his wounds. “That was it! Come….let’s fight, Silas!”</p><p><br></p><p>Silas took a stance this time and swung his knife far faster than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Todo suddenly clapped.</p><p><br></p><p>And the next second he was replaced by the debris behind Silas and punched silas from behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas reacted faster this time and defended with his knife and was pushed back a few steps. Todo pushed on with his attack, not allowing Silas any chance to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>That guy’s Cursed technique was very troublesome. He was dodging and targeting Silas at the same time. That said, even that was restrained as any and all attacks of Silas were harmless for anyone but Todo.</p><p><br></p><p>They soon noticed something, the more they fought, the less Todo was able to injure him.</p><p><br></p><p>“He knows martial arts.” Maki-senpai said and they looked at the teachers.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s been learning Martial Arts at the dojo of Naruto’s grandfather for the last two months or so.”</p><p><br></p><p>The fight continued and after almost an hour or so, Silas was actually keeping up with Todo who was continuously attacking from every direction.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, if the boss were to use magic, the entire fight would have been over in a second.” The dragon girl complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Magic, you say?” Gojo-sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Boss has recently learned Water and Ice Magic from his friends. He hasn’t used any of it yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….I guess he wants to learn using his innate technique first and that’s why he’s been avoiding using anything else.” Nanami-sensei said.</p><p><br></p><p>The two sides clashed one last time before they separated.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s more like it, Silas!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I have learned a lot. Let’s get serious now, shall we?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yeahhhh.”</p><p><br></p><p>Silas swung his knife and Todo moved his hands to clap….only for his hands to get encased in ice all of a sudden. His technique was interrupted and Silas’ attack hit him, making a deep gash on his chest and throwing him against the wall, making him lose consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s match. Silas wins.” Gojo-sensei shouted. “Shoko-chan, please take care of Todo-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>In that time, Silas had walked back to others and Sakura was checking him for any wounds.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am fine, Sakura. I was just adjusting myself so as to not overdo things. I am still not used to my new strength.” Silas reassured.</p><p><br></p><p>Megumi looked at the man incredulously. He was taking that beating to….learn to hold back?</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, boss could have cut apart his soul with that first hit if he wanted to. Obviously he was holding back.” The dragon girl taunted.</p><p><br></p><p>Cut souls?</p><p><br></p><p>Could he really target anything?</p><p><br></p><p>“That magic thing was really amazing.” Yuji said excitedly. “How did you do it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….froze the water in the air.” He answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow….that’s crazy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now finally, the final match. It’s Yuta vs Sakura-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Best of luck, Sakura-chan. Do your best.” Silas wished and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. Kick his ass, Sakura-nee-chan.” Naruto cheered and she brushed his head with a smile as she walked to the field.</p><p><br></p><p>The two sides took their places.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Keep this clean. Start.”</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as the words fell, Yuta-senpai’s cursed spirit appeared in front of him almost instinctively as if to protect him. That <a href="https://said….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">said….it</a> didn’t move.</p><p><br></p><p>No matter what Yuta-senpai tried, it just didn’t move, completely refusing to listen to his orders.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl on the other side was just staring at them. She hadn’t attacked, or even released the slightest bit of Cursed Energy from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rika, what’s the matter?” Yuta-senpai asked, confused but seeing no response from her, he turned towards Sakura. “Is this your Cursed technique? Controlling or stopping other Cursed Spirits?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They all looked at the teachers who didn’t answer anything and were looking at the fight in an unblinking manner.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I will fight by myself.” He drew his sword and dashed towards Sakura to attack but before he could swing his sword, he paused.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://No….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">No….it</a> looked like he was frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Sweat began to form on his face as he dropped his sword and crumbled to his knees, beginning to take heavy breaths.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yuta! What happened?” Maki-senpai shouted but he didn’t respond.</p><p><br></p><p>Then….under the stunned eyes of everyone, even Rika….kneeled, bowing its head in front of Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after what seemed like hours but had only been moments, Yuta-senpai spoke very softly. “I give up.”</p><p><br></p><p>At the next instant, Rika disappeared and Yuta-senpai looked as if he could breathe normally again.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s match. Sakura-chan wins.” Gojo-sensei announced and the girl in question bowed politely and walked back behind Silas and checked him for </p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here? Sensei, what did she do?” Maki-senpai asked, agitatedly.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Nanami-sensei who answered, wiping his sweat.</p><p><br></p><p>“She….overwhelmed him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” Yuji asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“What he means is that Yuta was scared out of his mind. Such a thing can happen when you meet someone far stronger than you.” Gojo-sensei clarified.</p><p><br></p><p>“B-b-but that’s impossible. This is Yuta we are talking about.” Maki-senpai refuted.</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s why he was able to keep his consciousness. Had it been any of you, you would have lost your consciousness or had a stroke.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But sensei, how did she do it? We couldn’t even feel anything. I mean she wasn’t realsing any cursed energy either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s true but that’s because you all suck at sensing Cursed Energy. Yuta on the other hand is connected with Rika and has an excellent grasp of Cursed Energy sensing. If you don’t understand, you can ask Sukuna about his feelings.” Gojo-sensei smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sukuna?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yuji kept quiet for a second, likely communicating with Sukuna, after which he spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not saying anything. In fact, he is not cursing as usual. He is just quiet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha so he does recognise it too.” Gojo-sensei laughed. “The difference in their levels.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We came back to the shop and I went ahead to take a bath.</p><p><br></p><p>That fight had left my clothes destroyed but it was enlightening.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t been in a fight like this as most of my fights had been over in single hits.</p><p><br></p><p>Todo however was strong and fast. He was able to adapt to my technique with a single look. To be honest, I could have stopped him easily if I used magic but if I did that, it would be hard to learn about my Innate Cursed technique.</p><p><br></p><p>This spar was very necessary because of this reason.</p><p><br></p><p>I did however test out my new technique.</p><p><br></p><p>Sage.</p><p><br></p><p>It was extremely useful.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the course of fighting, I could analyse my opponent’s fighting style completely and predict where he was about to come and attack.</p><p><br></p><p>It was because of this that I was able to react to Todo’s attacks so quickly and then adapt to his fighting style.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still a far cry from Rimuru’s Great Sage but a very welcome addition.</p><p><br></p><p>The skill basically allowed me to think at very fast speeds and increased my rate of learning and understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Thought Acceleration and Comprehension Boost was always good.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only that, even my healing had become faster.</p><p><br></p><p>The wounds I had received from the fight already seemed a bit lighter.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked down the stairs and heard the students talking happily with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh, so you like tall girls. I see. Take this, Sexy Jutsu, tall girl version.” I heard Naruto’s voice and then two shouts of cheering.</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-y-you are my new brother!” I heard Todo’s voice just before loud smacks were heard.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, reaching the Restaurant, I saw Naruto, Todo and Yuji sitting on the ground holding their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop teaching the kid bad things!” I heard another shout there.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl, Maki, seemed to be fuming while standing behind them while Miu was continuously apologising to the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>I could already guess what had happened here.</p><p><br></p><p>With a sigh, I went towards where Sakura was sitting with Shoko-san.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko-san checked on me. “Hmm, your wounds are already healing.” She said before observing it a bit more and then looked at Sakura. “Here. This is how we use the Reverse Curse Technique for healing.” With that, she used her technique and I could see my wounds disappear at a visible rate. “At complete mastery, one can even regrow lost limbs and internal organs….even during a fight. A good example of this would be Gojo who continuously uses this technique to heal his brain which gets continuously fried up due to the stress of keeping his Limitless Technique active at all times.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get it?” She asked when the healing was done.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” I asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, this is how the Reverse Cursed Technique is done. You go like this and then change it into this and there, it’s all done.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked towards the others and Gojo-san was laughing while Nanami-sensei just massaged his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shoko is a natural at this technique. She….is also very bad at explaining.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh! I am not bad at explaining. It’s just common sense.” She complained. “You guys didn’t get it?” She turned towards us and asked. “Go on and try it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura turned towards me and put her hands up over another cut on my cheek and I felt the sting disappear completely. I touched the place and sure enough, the wound was done.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Sakura, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>She learned it from that?</p><p><br></p><p>“See, Sakura-chan understood. You all are just dumb.” She scoffed at the rest who were all looking at Sakura, dumbfounded.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to see it again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you do it once more, please?” I asked and she nodded and I went and sat down on one of the chairs and pulled up the sleeves of my shirt, showing them more cuts.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura sat beside me and proceeded to heal all the injuries on my right hand.</p><p><br></p><p>While she was doing this, I decided to use my last untested skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Chef.</p><p><br></p><p>Analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw her Cursed Energy flow from two sources. One from her brain and the other from her stomach and intertwining together to produce and energy, completely different from any of the sources.</p><p><br></p><p>This energy was then used to heal the wounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Sage helped me understand the process while Sakura was healing me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks Sakura. I think I get it now. Let me try once for myself.” I said and controlled my Cursed Energy in the same way. Magic Manipulation helped a bit with it.</p><p><br></p><p>The two energies intertwined together and the new type of energy formed which I then applied on my left hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, the wounds were healing slowly. It was regenerating the flesh in my wounds and in just a few seconds, every small cut in my arm was healed.</p><p><br></p><p>I was looking at my arm in wonder when I suddenly realised that the entire place had become quiet so I looked around. Everyone was staring at me dumbfoundedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you just?” Nanami-sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Yes. It’s actually quite easy once you know what you are doing.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. No it’s not. We all know the theory but it’s very hard to do it in practice. Sakura, I can understand but how did you do it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I used my new magic to analyse the whole technique and then copied the flow of Cursed Energy to imitate the process. It worked.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Magic?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s something I got yesterday. It can analyse different phenomena. This is actually the first time I have used it so I didn’t know much about it either.”</p><p><br></p><p>They asked me some more questions and about what exactly I had analysed while giving me their own explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>The basic explanation was that the reverse cursed technique processes negative energy into positive energy by taking two sources of cursed energy and multiplying them by one another. As a result, the energy that destroys becomes energy that creates, and negative energy becomes positive.</p><p><br></p><p>This positive energy is then used for various purposes but most commonly for healing. It is also extremely dangerous when used against Cursed Spirits which are composed entirely of Cursed or Negative Energy. When attacked with Positive Energy, they tend to disintegrate the Cursed Spirits entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>It was however not that easy to use.</p><p><br></p><p>The Multiplication part was extremely hard, even for prodigies like Gojo-san who only got it on the verge of death in a fight. The healing part is also easier if the user heals themselves but they are not able to heal others as efficiently.</p><p><br></p><p>As Nanami-sensei said, Shoko-san really was a natural at this.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have a question.” Miu, who was listening to us, asked from the side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?” Shoko-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, you all can heal and even regrow flesh then….umm….why don’t you completely heal….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maki and Todo?” Shoko-san completed.</p><p><br></p><p>Miu apologised or rather was about to apologise to them but they waved it off.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s because cursed wounds cannot be healed completely. Maki was burned by the flames of a Special Grade Curse and Todo also got the injuries similarly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….I am sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” I asked, taken aback.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly remembered something and went to my room and came back with the bottle of potion Rimuru had given me. This thing was also very good at healing so I wonder if this will work.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this? Some kind of drink?” Shoko-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a cup and poured some in it and then looked at Maki. “This is something my friend gave me. It’s a healing potion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Like in the RPGs?” Yuji asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kinda similar. I want to see if this will work for your injuries. Would you like to try?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the cup unsurely. “What do I need to do, drink this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can drink this or apply this to your wounds. Let’s try applying first and see if it works.” I suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>She took some drops of the potion in her hand and applied it over her burn marks and in front of the surprised eyes of everyone, the wounds started healing.</p><p><br></p><p>Her skin returned to normal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Try drinking it.” I suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded, now confident and drank the entire thing in one gulp.</p><p><br></p><p>The change was instant.</p><p><br></p><p>Her burnt skin was slowly transformed into a healthy one. The change began on her face and then spread to her whole body slowly and in just a few seconds, she was completely healed.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at her hands and then at her reflection and I could see that her eyes were slightly moist.</p><p><br></p><p>Her friends cheered for her.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Aoi but he raised his hand directly. “No! This scar is my mark of honour. Also I think it looks cool.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Good luck with that.” I gave the guy a thumb’s up.</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei however did use the potion and for the first time I saw the burn marks under the sleeves of his shirts and the side of his body.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….</p><p><br></p><p>I was reminded again how dangerous this profession was.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say, how much of this potion can you get from your friend?” Shoko-san asked me, taking a look at the potion.</p><p><br></p><p>“That….I don’t know. He just gave me a jug full. I didn’t ask for much as I didn’t have any need for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can we talk to this friend of yours? Maybe buy some of this potion from him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will talk to him and see what he wants.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That would be greatly helpful.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere was very happy at the moment so we partied after that.</p><p><br></p><p>I found something else during this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maki-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Call me Maki.” She interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then, Maki. I….cannot sense any Cursed Energy from you.” I asked about something which had been confusing me for a long time now.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s because I don’t have any.” She answered with a shrug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t have any cursed energy or rather next to none. In fact, I need these glasses to even see spirits.” She then went on to explain about her Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zenin Clan were one of the three biggest clans of Sorcerers in Japan along with the Gojo Clan and the Kamo Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>There was however a very big problem with the family. The Zenin clan values powerful cursed techniques above all else and rejects their own family members if they don't deem their power acceptable.</p><p><br></p><p>Those idiots had even rejected Megumi’s father, Toji Zenin because he was born with no Cursed Energy, even when that guy was the one who had brought Gojo-san, the strongest sorcerer in the world, closest to death.</p><p><br></p><p>Maki also left the clan to become a sorcerer as a way to spite the other members of her clan. The Clan also didn’t back down. They have actively prevented her promotion all this time so she was still a Grade 4 Sorcerer despite being much stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole story left me feeling extremely bad for some reason. I couldn’t understand their thinking at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maki.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you mind if I check you and see if I can do something? Even if I can't, I have other friends, I am sure there are others who can. Also, so what if you can’t use Cursed Techniques? You could use other kinds of magic. There are onmyoji as well as other such humans in this world as well. Who knows, maybe normal people can learn such things too. I will try finding out about them.”</p><p><br></p><p>She laughed. “Aren’t you a sweet guy? Alright, here.” She offered me her hand and I took it, using Chef to analyse her body.</p><p><br></p><p>This analysis took far longer than the Reverse Curse Technique analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Others were attracted by our discussion and stayed on the side, watching without interrupting our work.</p><p><br></p><p>After almost an hour or so, I left her hand and looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find something?” She asked, with a hint of expectation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe. I….let me explain.” I said and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko-san had somehow arranged for a notebook and a pen and was actually taking notes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have two kinds of….how should I describe it….chains on you.” I did my best to describe what I could figure out. She looked confused and I continued further</p><p><br></p><p>“One of those is preventing your body from having any Cursed Energy, like literally but instead it is boosting your physical capabilities.”</p><p><br></p><p>A look of realisation came to her face and she nodded. “That’s probably the Heavenly Restriction. It’s an anomaly of sorts.” She explained briefly.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s almost the same.” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Almost?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, almost. You see, the second chain….that’s not exactly a Heavenly Restriction or whatever you call it. That one is….a connection or sorts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Connection?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm and it is due to that connection….that your Heavenly Restriction….is actually weakened.”<br><br>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You cannot use your full power due to that other chain.” I explained and she was left stunned in place.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point Yuji went still for a while after which he raised his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Yuji.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….he….Sukuna says he knows what’s wrong with her.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly all of them were in an alert position.</p><p><br></p><p>“What does it want?” Gojo-san asked casually.</p><p><br></p><p>“He says he wants to see what we do about it. This is the first time he has heard about anyone being able to see what he is seeing in Maki-senpai.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Curiosity. I see. Why not? Amuse yourself.” Gojo-san shrugged noncommittally.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be serious, Gojo.” Nanami-sensei complained loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? What’s the problem?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t know….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t worry Nanami-kun. I am….still the strongest.” He smirked, making Nanami-sensei quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“We would need assurance that his words are true.” Shoko-san interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuji became quiet for a moment and then nodded. “He is willing to make a binding vow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next moment, Yuji made a binding vow with Sukuna who then appeared as an extra mouth on the side of his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“The girl is being dragged down by her twin.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Twins are born with connected fates. If one is lazy, the other becomes stagnant. She might not have Cursed Energy….but her twin does….which is also considered to be her own energy and thus the Heavenly Restriction is not being enforced completely….due to a technicality. In fact, her Heavenly Restriction is probably the reason why she has such low cursed energy. It is due to their connection.Hahahaha it’s rarer than those clowns in a circus. Aren’t you all so strong? Let’s see what you can do about that?” He laughed after which Yuji frowned and pushed it back.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…..”</p><p><br></p><p>Maki looked extremely sad about the whole situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know about the situation between her and her twin but I had my doubts that they were not good.</p><p><br></p><p>“So it’s all that girl’s fault?” Nobara asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko-san looked serious too. “That means, for her to completely gain her power….Mai Zenin….has to die.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let it go. Thanks for your help today, Silas. But it looks like I just have to work harder to become stronger.” She shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if nothing, it’s good research material.” Shoko-san also said.</p><p><br></p><p>“That bastard Sukuna probably knew this and that’s why he told us this, to drive a wedge between us.” Yuji cursed.</p><p><br></p><p>They were all down when I decided to give it a try.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….” I started and they all looked at me again. “Maybe….and I make no promises….just maybe….I can do something about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, no thanks. Mai not be the best person out there but we don’t kill normal people.” Nobara said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Who said anything about killing her?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think….I might be able to….cut off that connection between Maki and her twin.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s impossible. That’s not just something one can cut. It’s fate.” Maki denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“And? I haven’t tried so how would I know? Let’s see it like this, if I am successful, we win. If not, nothing bad happens and I know my limit.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>After some deliberation, we decided to go through with it.</p><p><br></p><p>I drew my knife once more. This time however, I was using my Chef Skill to imbue the Knife.</p><p><br></p><p>It shone with a bright silver light and changed into the cleaver form as I began to think about what I wanted to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Cut the chain, cut the chain, just cut the damn chain and make her independent.</p><p><br></p><p>I concentrated and waved the knife.</p><p><br></p><p>In the very next second, I felt a large part of my power drain off of me and I fell to my knees.</p><p><br></p><p>Maki on the other hand collapsed too.</p><p><br></p><p>The teachers both ran to check up on us.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am alright, just exhausted. Check on her.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko-san did just that and verified that she was fine.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, her body seemed to be getting stronger according to Shoko-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahahaha. You really are awesome, Silas-kun. Did you just cut through fate? Oh, I can’t wait to see the look on the faces of those stuck up Zenin.” Gojo-san laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Maki woke up after some time and looked at herself in amazement.</p><p><br></p><p>She repeatedly thanked me and was about to go out and test her abilities but was stopped by Shoko-san who wanted to monitor her over the entire day to see if there were any other new changes.</p><p><br></p><p>After the party, Nanami-sensei came to Sakura and I. “You have already learned most of the things I could teach you. In fact, with your talents, I would be dragging you back if I were to keep being your teacher. To learn further, you should ask Gojo. He is currently one of the only four Special Grade Sorcerers in the world and would be the best guy to teach you about Domain Expansion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Domain Expansion?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Domain Expansion is an advanced barrier technique and is considered the pinnacle of Jujutsu sorcery. It constructs the user's innate domain inside a barrier infused with their innate cursed technique. Within a domain expansion, the user's cursed techniques are improved and any that are activated are guaranteed to hit. There are very few people who can use this technique and whoever can do so has their name firmly on the top of the Jujutsu Society. This is the last step you two need to take and Gojo would be the best person to teach you this.”</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed a few more things and even talked to Gojo-san who was very excited about the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>He said that he was planning to go on a hunt for some Cursed Spirits and it might take him some time so he decided to teach us before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>At the party, I got to know them better.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuji was….well he was like Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>Todo was weird.</p><p><br></p><p>Megumi seemed the sanest one among them all. Actually, Yuta was cool too.</p><p><br></p><p>He was still scared of Sakura however but that eased over the course of the party.</p><p><br></p><p>Panda and the Salmon guy were also cool, although pranksters.</p><p><br></p><p>They all got along well with Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, when it was time to leave, I gave Shoko-san half the jug of healing potion and despite my repeated denials, she sent over millions of yen to my account.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to mind this, Silas-kun. Shoko would totally swindle the other Sorcerers for far more with this.” Gojo-san laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Goodbye, Silas, Sakura-chan, Naruto. See you guys again soon.” Yuji waved.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes! Let’s meet again, brother.” Todo shook hands with Naruto with tears in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>….yeah, this guy was weird.</p><p><br></p><p>Megumi nodded towards us and Yuta shook hands with each one of us before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am looking forward to the next meeting. Thank you for showing me the difference between our strengths, Sakura-san. I will work hard to catch up.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maki also waited beside him and bowed to me. “I….thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled back. “I was just doing what I could. After all, friends help each other, don’t they?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked taken aback at my reply and then nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>They all went outside and I was about to close the door again when Yuji returned quickly. “Silas, I think I left my purse back there.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said and I looked back at the seat and his purse was indeed there.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked it up and went outside and was about to give it to him when his expression changed completely into that of horror. He moved quickly and put his hand on my face. I felt him forcing something into my mouth and forcing me to eat it.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as that thing went down my throat, I felt a surge in power.</p><p><br></p><p>It was nothing like the time Rimuru had named me but still quite large. Even with the Sage, it took me a second or so to realise what had happened.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://Yuji….no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yuji….no</a>, Sukuna….had tried to force his soul in my body….and was eaten.</p><p><br></p><p>It was unbelievable but then I remember that I <em>was</em> a demon and demons <em>did</em> eat souls.</p><p><br></p><p>But I didn’t have enough time to ponder over it as barely a second later, he was smashed in the side of the Restaurant and Sakura had grabbed him with her shadows, her Cursed Energy raging and threatening to swallow everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru was also half transformed, her hands changed into claws, blazing as she was about to punch Yuji’s head into a barbequed meat pulp.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait!” I shouted, stopping her quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone came running back quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened here?” Nanami-sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I went to Yuji who looked like he had lost his consciousness. His hand had one finger missing.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was still on my side, not moving one bit. She still had Yuji on a chokehold against the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let him go, Sakura and step back Tohru. He….wasn’t in control. It was probably Sukuna.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! What did Sukuna do?” Nanami-sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“He….well, he force fed me his finger.” I accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright? Can you control yourself?” He asked, becoming completely pale at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….about that….well you see….”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, Silas? This is not the time to talk in circles.” He scolded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well you see, Sukuna….he’s gone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….I….think….I ate his soul?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” He asked, not understanding what he was hearing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, like you know what I am right?” I asked and he nodded. “I ate or rather….<em>he</em> fed me his finger….his soul and it got digested. He’s gone.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san removed his blindfold and looked closely at me. “Well, I’ll be damned….hahahaha. The King of Curses….dies by becoming poop. That’s the best end I can imagine for him. I wonder how everyone will react when they find out. Do you think we can use this as an advertisement? We turn Cursed Spirits to poop.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You are disgusting!” I deadpanned, suddenly feeling sick in the stomach due to his words.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t say anything and checked on Yuji, confirming that the guy was now truly free of the cursed spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>The teachers didn’t want to say much so Nanami-sensei took the students back to the school while Shoko-san and Gojo-san stayed back and checked up on Yuji and healed him.</p><p><br></p><p>After he woke up, he repeatedly apologised to me but I didn’t blame him.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had no control over himself at that moment so what could I even say?</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way….you….technically exorcised Sukuna on your own so….maybe you should get certified as a Jujutsu Sorcerer too. Actually, all of you can easily become certified Jujutsu Sorcerers. I will talk to Sensei about this.” Shoko-san said before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>It was sudden but Nanami-sensei had already taught us about the grades of Jujutsu Sorcerers so we decided to give it a try.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, the day ended and I slumped down on my couch.</p><p><br></p><p>That thing actually scared me.</p><p><br></p><p>I know I was strong enough to dodge that or even fend him off but I was not alert enough and he was able to take advantage of that.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura sat near me the whole time. She seemed like she had been pretty shaken by the incident too.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru calmed down pretty easily when she realised what had happened. In fact, she had actually laughed at Sukuna and then got annoyed that I didn’t taste her tail but ate that finger.</p><p><br></p><p>….I seriously don’t understand what goes on in that head of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll leave for the day, boss.” Tohru said and was about to leave when I suddenly remembered something and stopped her before she could close the door to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait a second, Tohru.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>I went to the kitchen and packed the leftovers from today’s party and went out and gave it to Tohru. “Here, we got a lot of leftovers today. Have something to eat back at home.”</p><p><br></p><p>She took my hand in hers and laughed. “Hehehehe thank you boss. You are the best.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t butter me up. Get going.” I patted her head and she left while I came back inside and sat with Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>We were indeed quite late so I got up too. “Let’s rest for today, Sakura.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up at me and I saw her eyes were looking a bit like before….on that day.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat down in front of her and took her hand in mine. “I am fine, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But….I could have stopp….”</p><p><br></p><p>“And so could I. I could have stopped him or even broken his skull or frozen him into a popsicle before he could even twitch his finger. But I was caught off guard. Mistakes happen, Sakura. You don’t need to blame yourself for it.” I reassured her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing else….or I will get angry.”</p><p><br></p><p>She became quiet instantly. I let out a sigh and went closer to her and pulled her into a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t resist either and I caressed her back softly for a few minutes after which I pulled back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go. You must be tired too. I know I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and we retired for the night.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up to the sound of my alarm the next day and washed up before going down.</p><p><br></p><p>Down there, I was met with an unexpected scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was already there and she was talking to Lavinia, the girl who had been unconscious for the last two days. She looked like she had recovered, although she was very quiet, almost depressed.</p><p><br></p><p>They noticed my entry and looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked a bit pale due to the incident and not eating anything while she was unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san, you are up.” Sakura got up but I signalled her to sit down and looked at the other girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavinia, right?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you feeling alright? You are not hurt, are you?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “Thank you for saving my life. I….caused a lot of trouble for you all. I am extremely sorry for that.” She bowed and apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. You….had your own problems to deal with. Most of us would have been caught off guard in your situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her face fell down at the mention of the incident so I quickly diverted the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“You must be hungry after so long. I will quickly cook up something good for everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura followed me to the kitchen and helped me prepare the food and I whipped up something light for all of us.</p><p><br></p><p>After the meal, her face regained some colour and we talked about various things.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was a magician working for the Grauzaberer Magician Organisation and was here to investigate the trails of another Magician Organisation called the Wizards of Oz, who were….well, all of us had seen how they were….batshit crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wizards of Oz had four castles in the cardinal directions centred around the Emerald Castle in the middle. Each of these places led the organisation and that woman was one of them, Augusta, the Witch of the East and from the blabberings of the woman, we found out that Lavinia’s former mentor was another one of them, Glenda, the Witch of the South.</p><p><br></p><p>Glenda had picked Lavinia up when she was a kid after she had started seeing her NotPokem….I mean Sacred Gear which other normal people couldn’t see and thus thought her to be mad.</p><p><br></p><p>She raised her and then left her at the Grauzaberer Magician Organisation, from where the Wizards of Oz had formerly originated. There Lavinia later found that Glenda was killed by Augusta….or as we know now, it was just a way for her to get rid of her. Glenda just wanted to study her Sacred Gear and sent her away when she was done.</p><p><br></p><p>While she was telling us her story, Tohru had arrived and she too listened to the story quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura for one was very understanding, having been through a similar….or rather far worse situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I was even feeling guilty asking her to wait till she could sign the magical contract to not reveal all our identities….but she didn’t deny it. In fact, she very calmly accepted it and decided to stay with us till Zeref was back.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura and Tohru went outside to do some shopping and I was left in the shop with Lavinia and started preparing for the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I made some small talk with Lavinia, trying to cheer her up.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly there was a knock on the door of the Restaurant and the door opened, revealing a little girl with white-lavender hair in ponytails and blue eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wearing a white capelet with a fur collar, a pink blouse, a white frilly skirt, and pink doll shoes. Her hair was tied into pigtails, each adorned with three dark blue beads.</p><p><br></p><p>The most prominent things about her though were the two horns and a small tail.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dragon?</p><p><br></p><p>Was she someone related to Tohru?</p><p><br></p><p>I called her in and offered her a seat which she took without any words. She just kept staring at me so I decided to start the conversation myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, are you here for Tohru? What’s your name?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl just stared at me quietly while Lavinia was looking at her curiously now.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, she took a small breath and opened her mouth. “Break up with Lady Tohru.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....huh?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Maki Zenin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She was outside the Kyoto Jujutsu High to check up on Mai.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-sensei had accompanied her to this place and so did Shoko-san as she was curious and taking notes to complete her research.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night, they had returned and the first thing which everyone did….was admit Yuji to the hospital. Yeah, the last incident with Sukuna was beyond everyone’s imagination and what came afterwards was even more so.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas….he was a….</p><p><br></p><p>That part had left all of them shocked but soon after, Gojo-sensei as well as the rest had made it clear that he was still a student of the Tokyo Jujutsu High. They calmed down pretty soon though when remembering what the guy had done.</p><p><br></p><p>What came next was exactly this….testing the extent of her new abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>They tested her new physical capabilities and found out that her reflexes, strength, endurance and speed had increased by leaps and bounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-sensei had compared her current physical capabilities to Toji Zenin’s.</p><p><br></p><p>After this, they decided to check out Mai’s situation as they both were likely connected with the same chain and they wanted to see the changes in her.</p><p><br></p><p>Todo had gone ahead of them.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few minutes, she sensed something and looked in a direction to see Mai coming out with Kasumi Miwa and Todo. Behind them were Utahime Iori and Principal Gakuganji.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, it looks like there has been changes on this side too.” Gojo-sensei whispered as he looked at them.</p><p><br></p><p>Before she could ask anything, they were already there and Gojo-sensei greeted them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Old man Gakuganji, you are looking good. How is the position of the Higher up on the board treating you?” He asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Maki’s eyes twitched. It wasn’t much of a secret about what had happened with them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you here?” He asked directly, not even mentioning that incident.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, didn’t Todo-kun tell you anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He said you wanted to meet Mai Zenin.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, not me necessarily. Maki here wanted to meet her little sister and Shoko wanted to check up on her too.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at her and she noticed the principal’s eyes widened slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did you do it?” He asked the teachers who just smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha it started with me wanting to eat Manju yesterday….” And he started blabbering whatever nonsense he could.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, if you don’t want to tell then so be it. I just wanted to know because of the changes in Mai since yesterday. Come inside, we will talk about it there.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were led inside the campus of Kyoto Jujutsu High and Shoko-san checked up on Mai who was still staring at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cursed Energy has increased several times the previous amount and the body is stable. There are no anomalies.” She reported finally and Maki breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Mai looked at her and spoke. “What did you do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….broke the chains.” She answered and left it there. “Now you don’t have to be dragged down by me.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was indeed one of her motivations when she heard that her Heavenly Restriction could be the cause of Mai’s low cursed energy; it gave her the last push she needed to make the final decision.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dragged down? What do you mean dragged down? I wasn’t dragged down by anyone. As if you could even do that. You are….you are….weak!” Mai lashed out.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t answer and Mai gritted her teeth and left the room angrily and she let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“That….family reunions are always lovely.” Gojo-sensei smiled and she clenched her fist, wanting to punch him in the face as that wouldn’t do anything for her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, we are here for something important. Here is a letter of Recommendation from First Grade Sorcerers Nanami Kento and Atsuya Kusakabe for the promotion of Kigisaki Nobara to a Second Grade Sorcerer and Yuji Itadori, Megumi Fushiguro and Maki Zenin into First Grade Sorcerers.” Her head snapped in his direction but he didn’t pay any attention.</p><p><br></p><p>He kept an envelope in front of Principal Gakuganji and then took out another envelope. “And this is a recommendation from First Grade Sorcerer Atsuya Kusakabe, Special Grade Sorcerer Yuta Okotsu and Special Grade Sorcerer Gojo Satoru recommending Naruto Furinji as a Grade Three Sorcerer and Silas Evans and Sakura Matou as First Grade Sorcerers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? I haven’t heard these names before.” The Principal picked up the letters and looked at them. “Eight years? You are putting an eight year old in a Grade Three Sorcerer Position?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Old Man….Naruto-kun is my brother. He might be young but he is a man….I will not hear anyone say anything bad about him.” Todo said seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what about the other two? I haven’t even heard of their names.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mah mah, they are our new students. Don’t worry they can do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not the point. They are completely ungraded. How can I put their names for a Grade 1 Sorcerer Promotion directly?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Because it would be a waste to make them go through all that nonsense. Silas and Sakura….they are beyond Grade 1. If you have any doubts you can ask Aoi Todo and I can bring them on later for you to see for yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas….he might be a boring guy but he is strong. He defeated me fair and square….while holding back.” Todo interrupted again, “As for Sakura….she….is on a different level completely.” He whispered blankly.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Maki got shivers when she remembered the Cursed Energy she had released when she had incapacitated Yuji.</p><p><br></p><p>That power….</p><p><br></p><p>Todo continued. “She defeated Yuta Okotsu….without making a single attack.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The Principal tried to say something but no words came out of his mouth and he finally let out a sigh. “Nothing good comes when you show your face here.” He scolded Gojo-sensei. “Sigh….I will see what I can about them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks, old man.” Gojo-sensei gave him a thumbs up.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile Shoko-san and Utahime Iori from Kyoto Jujutsu High.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here….try this.” She passed over a small vial of the potion to Utahime.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you really sure?” Utahime looked at the vial unsurely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Absolutely.
