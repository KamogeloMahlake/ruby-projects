        <p><strong>Isekai Restaurant </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 16: Naruto and Kanna’s Day Out</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>___________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My hands worked on the vegetables as I looked outside at Milim and Saitama playing video games. Rimuru and Ainz were working on deciding which Manga we were going to sell in our new publishing house.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was working, the door opened and Tohru entered followed by two other people.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them was a handsome young man with straight waist-length or hip-length black hair that was in a loose ponytail at the end with bangs covering his right eye, red eyes. He was wearing butler attire, a mail coach cravat tie and small glasses on the bridge of his nose. He had a gloomy look on his face as he looked around with a frown.</p><p><br></p><p>I was however not looking at him but the last person who came in… damn, those have to be fake.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a tall, fair-skinned woman with an hourglass figure and large breasts. She had long, wavy blonde hair which took on a turquoise and green colour at the ends. She had heterochromia, where one iris has a different coloration from the other. Her left eye was navy blue on the outside and yellow on the inside, with a green, slit pupil. Her right eye was green on the outside with designs and black on the inside with a yellow, slit pupil. She had horns like Tohru but no tail.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this the place you were talking about, Tohru?” She asked, looking around cluelessly.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why but I felt major Lavy energy from her.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an instinct but my instinct’s are quite spot on these days. Must be an Archdaemon thing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. It’s great, isn’t it?” Tohru replied happily, showing them a seat nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>The other guy however stopped and looked at the rest of the people in the Restaurant. “Humans, demons and even undead… should I just kill them first?”</p><p><br></p><p>…suddenly a dozen eyes were pointed towards him from all directions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fafnir! No fighting anyone. This is the place I work at. I told you already that Silas-san is my boss and these are my boss’ friends.” She then looked at the rest, especially Milim and bowed deeply. “I am sorry for my friend. He isn’t used to being around people much.”</p><p><br></p><p>Milim just huffed and turned back to the game in her hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru came to me. “These are my friends, boss. I decided to show them around before the party.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and looked at the guy called Fafnir. Isn’t that name kinda famous? “Will they be alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, don’t worry. Fafnir is just a bit awkward around people. He mostly stays in his cave to protect his treasures.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, a shut-in dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, take their orders.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two people… dragons, ordered me to make anything I wanted and I began working on their orders before Tohru served them.</p><p><br></p><p>By then, Fafnir was watching Milim and Saitama play games while the other woman was looking at them with a smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you Tohru’s boss?” The latter asked me when I came out, having completed the orders. “A Demon…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. My name is Silas. I am the owner of this Restaurant. Tohru works for me.” I introduced myself with a polite bow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, how polite. This is the first time I have seen a demon be so polite in all my years. I mean sure some were polite before too but they were usually faking or mocking others… but none of them run a Restaurant.”</p><p><br></p><p>I controlled my lips from twitching at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, my name is Quetzalcoatl by the way but my friends call me Locoa.”</p><p><br>Quetzalcoatl?!</p><p><br></p><p>Isn’t that the creature from the Aztec myths?</p><p><br></p><p>I had seen a documentary about the Aztec myths a long time ago and remembered the name. I think it was a dragon or serpent of some kind. I tried to remember and sure enough it came to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quetzalcoatl, the Winged Serpent.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you have heard of me?” She asked, interested.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Yes. There are myths of Quetzalcoatl in my world too. I think there was even a Fafnir in the Norse Mythology.” I said, making the other dragon look at me with narrowed eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your world?” She asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Tohru. “You didn’t tell them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… I forgot.” She said, sticking out her tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>She then went on to explain about the place to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Other worlds, outside our own? I mean I had heard about such a thing from the Gods but none of us knew how to get there. This is really amazing. Are the rest of the guests from other worlds too?” She asked, looking round. </p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Boss is from a world with Gods, Demons and Dragons like our own. Lavy is from that world too. Sakura is from a different world. Rimuru and Milim are from different worlds too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No wonder there are people from so many races here and all seem quite different from the ones I know. I mean I have never seen a slime as strong as this and… are you a dragon, miss?” She asked Milim.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I am a dragonoid.” Milim answered with a puff of her chest.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Dragonoid?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Born from a True Dragon and a human.” She answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“A True Dragon! That’s…” Her mouth opened up in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, we can talk afterwards. First try the food. Boss is the best chef I have ever seen. Try it before it gets cold.” Tohru urged them, successfully diverting their attention and they each took a bite of the food and paused.</p><p><br></p><p>A bright smile lit up the face of Lucoa while Fafnir just looked frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my… this is indeed one of the best foods I have eaten.” Lucoa praised while Fafnir… Fafnir was eating without caring about anything else. “What kind of dish is this?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is a Dragon Cherry Pie. These are made from Dragon Cherries, a special variety of cherries which dragons love. Tohru likes this.  I didn’t know what kind of food you liked so I made this for everyone. Is it to your tastes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is. I have never heard of Dragon Cherries. Is it from some other world?” She asked as she took another bite of the food.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s from the world of one of my customers.” I answered.</p><p><br></p><p>The two dragons started eating and suddenly Milim spoke up. “Hey Sil, one pie for me too.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her… drooling and shook my head. Really, Milim was a glutton.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately I had anticipated this already and made extra for her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha you are the best. Are you sure you don’t want to be my personal chef?” She asked, between her bites.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, I’ll pass.”</p><p><br></p><p>She pouted at the reply.</p><p><br></p><p>After they finished the meal, Lucoa talked to everyone about their worlds while Fafnir was looking at the members playing games.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked quite interested so I picked up a console I used and handed it to him. “Here, you can join them too. Rimuru, help Fafnir out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kay.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere reverted back to the usual calm one as guests started coming in once more and I got busy with work once again.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like this, it was evening. By now, things had changed completely. Fafnir was playing games… or at least trying his best.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru was a very patient teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>He however left when Shizuka-san came in.</p><p><br></p><p>It was friday and she had a day off tomorrow and as usual she was here to drink.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I observed Lucoa looking at her… or rather the alcohol but hesitating so I went ahead and offered her a bottle of emerald wine and I understood soon enough why she was hesitating.</p><p><br></p><p>“And that bitch, she had the gall to say that I was nearing my thirties and too old for marriage. Am I old, Lucoa? Hah, am I old?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my… that’s a horrible thing to say. Thirty is practically a newborn in dragon years.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right… that racist bitch!”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>Shizuka-san found out about Lucoa and was actually interested in getting to know her, what’s with her being a famous mythical being… or an alternate version of that.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing led to another and they started drinking with each other and things became like this.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, none of what they said made sense anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru was trying his best to support her.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side…</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, hit him, hit him hard.” Milim cheered on as Fafnir was bashing a mini boss with his character. “You are getting good at this.”</p><p><br></p><p>Fafnir was busy playing games and going from a victory dance to gamer’s rage from one second to another.</p><p><br></p><p>Oddly enough, they seemed to have integrated quite well in the group.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that Miu suddenly came to the Restaurant looking around worriedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san, Tohru-chan, have any one of you seen Naruto and Kanna?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? No… they were here but they went back in the morning if I remember correctly. Why? Are they not back home yet?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No… we haven’t seen any of them since morning. First we thought that they had gone somewhere to play around but they didn’t come back for their lunch and now they are late for their snacks too. They never miss their food… Grandpa and the rest are searching outside while I came to check for them here.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked extremely worried. It was then that Milim suddenly spoke up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, those two were sneaking around and left the Restaurant when no one was paying attention.”</p><p><br></p><p>…What?</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly thought of the places they could go.</p><p><br></p><p>“They have either gone to Miu’s world, Tohru’s world or Naruto’s world because they only have permission to enter these worlds.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanna was not in our world.we would have sensed her if she was there.” Tohru said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa and the rest are searching for them in my world so that only leaves… Naruto's world.”</p><p><br></p><p>A frown appeared on our faces remembering how he was treated there.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Is there something wrong with his world?” Lucoa asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let's say… Naruto wasn't treated well in that place.” I said and Tohru was frowning too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Boss, let me go there. I can search for them easily.” Tohru asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure? Should I go with you too? We don't know how big that place is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don't worry. I can take care of it, Boss.” She patted her chest quite confidently.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, I can help too. My Universal Detection can easily find them anywhere.” Milim stood up and volunteered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Milim.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umu, leave it to me. This much is easy.” She puffed up her chest too.</p><p><br></p><p>And now I was worried for a whole other reason.</p><p><br></p><p>While Naruto’s village didn’t treat him well, I was still hesitant about unleashing a Chaos Dragon and a Dragonoid Demon Lords on their heads. After all, one person can hardly represent the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that the situation was just too dire for me to care right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then. Be careful. Don’t start a fight, okay. Remember, if there is any big trouble, call for us. We will be there in a moment.” I told them seriously. “Just don’t cause too much trouble, okay?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, Boss. But boss, what if they attack us first?” She asked, making me pause.</p><p><br>“Then you are free to do as you wish.” I don’t know how strong those ninjas are but if they were able to trap something like the kyuubi inside Naruto, they might be quite strong. Holding back against them could actually harm Tohru.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kay.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, I opened the door to the ninja village Naruto lived in and they left to search for him and Kanna.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Naruto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They were flying over Konoha’s training ground, Kanna-chan carrying him as they headed for Ichiraku Ramen when he spotted someone practising in one of the training grounds.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanna-chan, wait for a moment. I want to meet someone.” He called out. “Drop me there.” He pointed towards the training ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>She did just that and he landed right in the middle of the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The last person having sensed his presence jumped away from them and drew a kunai from his pouch but stopped when he recognised him.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s up, teme.” He smiled at Sasuke. “Training hard, I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke’s eyes widened at the sight of him. “Naruto… where did you disappear to?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I was out doing special training. I have become a lot stronger and could totally kick your ass now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke frowned. “Hmph… did you fall somewhere and hit your head, dobe? You beating me? Dream on.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! You wanna fight, hah! Come on, I will take you on.” He took a stance.</p><p><br></p><p>“If that’s what you wish for. I can always show you why I am the best in the class and you are the deadlast.” Sasuke took the taijutsu stance too.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was a long time ago. I can totally kick your ass now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, show him, Naruto.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and who is she? Got yourself another loser friend, dobe?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Her name is Kanna Kamui and she is not a loser.” He protested.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna nodded too. “Who is this duckbutt, Naruto?”</p><p><br></p><p>...</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“Duckbutt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, his hair looks like a duck’s butt.”</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto looked… he looked closer… and it indeed did.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha it does. It really does look like a duck’s butt.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke looked embarrassed and shouted. “Enough talk. Let’s see who the real loser is.”</p><p><br></p><p>They rushed towards each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the last time however, he could easily see Sasuke’s moves and react to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke’s taijutsu was different from his, but grandpa had taught him well.</p><p><br></p><p>Understand the rhythm and anticipate their moves. He did just that and found himself matching and then easily overpowering Sasuke. He noticed that he was physically stronger and faster than Sasuke already. In fact, he wasn’t even using his Cursed Energy to reinforce his attacks and was still outpacing Sasuke easily. </p><p><br></p><p>With one last punch to the gut, he sent Sasuke sliding down the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I told you, didn’t I. I can totally wipe the floor with you now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke got up, angry this time. “It’s not over yet. This is not a mock taijutsu match but a real fight.” He drew a kunai and a few shuriken.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto narrowed his eyes and looked at Kanna. “Can I have my tanto, Kanna-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm.” Kanna nodded and pulled out his tanto from somewhere. They had packed some weapons when they had come here and Kanna-chan had stored everything with her magic.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a mission after all. How could they go out without any weapons?</p><p><br></p><p>He drew the tanto and faced Sasuke. During his time at the Ryozanpaku dojo, Shigure nee-chan had taught him a lot about Bukijutsu. She was even better than Iruka-sensei at teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto personally chose a tanto because he had seen Nanami-sensei using a sword and Silas nii-san used knives and swords too and they looked cool.</p><p><br></p><p>They clashed again, this time with kunai and tanto. The clash sent sparks between the weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them clashed several times. Naruto actually took time to understand the rhythm again instead of using his speed and strength to overpower him.</p><p><br></p><p>Once that was done, the result was the same as the taijutsu fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke’s kunai was sent flying in the air and he had his tanto on his neck.</p><p><br></p><p>“My win, teme.” He grinned as he put his tanto back into the sheathe and offered a hand to him. “We are going to eat ramen at Ichiraku’s. Wanna come with us?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He got up and dusted his clothes. “Hmph… I need to train. My nii-san will teach me a new jutsu and then I will totally beat you up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah… well, I got a nee-chan and a nii-san too. They are very strong too. In fact, I will ask him to teach me some cool stuff too.” He argued back.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas nii-san could teach him some awesome magic. That was even cooler than ninjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph… as if some random guy could match my nii-san.” Sasuke snorted rudely.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you know? Sil-nii-san is super strong. He could totally wipe the floor with your nii-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You take that back!”</p><p><br></p><p>“No way!”</p><p><br></p><p>And thus they began arguing… until he heard Kanna’s voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto, I’m hungry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Kanna-chan, this teme is saying that Sil nii-san would lose against his brother. Sil nii-san could totally kick his ass dattebayo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Sil has become stronger. He will win.”</p><p><br></p><p>“See. Kanna-chan knows it too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are both dumb.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you say!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I said you are dumb.”</p><p><br></p><p>And once more they were arguing before he felt Kanna-chan pick him up and fly in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanna-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m hungry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… okay.” he looked down at Sasuke who was looking at him with wide open eyes. “See you later, teme. And Sil nii-san would totally win.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, Kanna used her stealth magic again and they flew towards Ichiraku Ramen once more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sasuke -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>What the hell had the dobe been doing all these months?</p><p><br></p><p>How did he get so strong?</p><p><br></p><p>And who was that girl with wings?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it some kind of ninjutsu?</p><p><br></p><p>While thinking about these, he returned home.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t joking when he said that nii-san would train with him today. Itachi had been busy with missions and had only returned last night and had promised to train with him today.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in mind, he reached home.</p><p><br></p><p>His mother was the one who opened the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sasuke… how did you get dirty?” She asked, looking at the state of his clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his shoes and entered his house.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside, his father was sitting with Itachi.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was training.” He replied before taking a seat nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you training with someone? You don’t usually get this roughed up.” His mother asked, making him embarrassed when remembering what he had faced just a while ago.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I met a… classmate.” He nodded shyly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those look like bruises from a fight. Were you sparring with them? Is there someone in your class who can bruise you in a spar?” His father asked, his tone disappointed.</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke bowed his head, ashamed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s train later on today, Sasuke.” Itachi offered and he looked at his brother with a smile and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, go and get cleaned up first. It’s almost time for lunch. You can train after that.” Mother interrupted them and sent him for a bath.</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke hurried and took a bath and returned back for lunch.</p><p><br></p><p>He started to quickly eat so that he could go out and train with his nii-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eat slowly, Sasuke. The food is not running anywhere.” His mother chided and he slowed down.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how did you get that bruise?” His father asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He paused. “It was… in a taijutsu fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… did you drop your guard against the opponent? Such arrogance can become the undoing of even the greatest shinobi.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...yes father.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you win?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you win the fight? I can understand if you exchanged that bruise for a win.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… didn’t.” He replied embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You lost?” Itachi asked, surprised. “I didn’t know there was someone in your class who could match you in taijutsu. Can you tell me about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… he was stronger and faster and he somehow seemed to be anticipating all my moves. Even when we used weapons, he matched me and then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fighting an opponent with greater strength and speed can be difficult. You shouldn’t lose your cool and try to find a weakness. In a fight, you only need one good hit to win so calmly wait for your opportunity.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there something else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He… he wasn’t using his speed or strength to fight. He was actually holding back. Somehow he already knew what I was going to do, almost as if he had a sharingan. But he isn’t even an Uchiha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need a sharingan to anticipate your opponent’s moves, Sasuke. The Sharingan is a tool which can help you get stronger but it’s not the only way. Any experienced shinobi can predict your moves in a battle.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, I didn’t expect there to be such a kid in your class. What’s his name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… he isn’t in our class per say… or at least not anymore. He suddenly left the academy one day.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? What’s his name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto Uzumaki.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the whole room became silent. His parents and brother stopped eating and then suddenly his father turned towards him. “Where… where did you see him, Sasuke? Where is he now?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sasuke was taken aback by the intensity of the question and wasn’t able to reply for a moment when he felt a hand on his back.</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to be afraid, Sasuke. You are not in any trouble. Just answer the question. It’s very important. Where did you see, Naruto Uzumaki?”</p><p><br></p><p>“In… the training ground near the river where we practise shurikenjutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>“When?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, around an hour ago.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was he alone?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No… there was a girl with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Girl? How did she look? Describe her in detail.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She looked around our age. She had white-lavender hair and blue eyes. She was wearing a pink dress and…”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She could fly…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She could make wings appear on her back and fly. She took Naruto away when they were leaving.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did they go? Did you see the direction they left?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… umm, I… they invited me for ramen. I think they went to the Ichiraku Ramen to eat something.” He replied after thinking back again.</p><p><br></p><p>His father and brother exchanged looks and the former spoke. “Itachi, go and inform the Hokage. I will bring Sasuke with me and follow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes father.”</p><p><br></p><p>Itachi immediately got up and disappeared in a shunshin while his father got up too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get ready, Sasuke.”</p><p><br></p><p>While still confused about everything, Sasuke got up and started getting ready.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Jiraiya -</strong><br><br></p><p>He was in the Hokage’s building, about to enter the Hokage’s office when he saw Itachi Uchiha heading towards the building.</p><p><br></p><p>“Itachi, you look like you are in a hurry. Did you just return from a mission?” He asked, trying to make small talk with him. The condition with the Uchiha has been deteriorating. The sudden presence of Tsunade and him was holding them back for now and Sensei had talked with Fugaku Uchiha to ease the tensions but to no avail. </p><p><br></p><p>After investigating for the past few weeks, to some extent, he understood their anger too. The Uchiha clan was put in a bad condition and even when it was not explicitly said, they were indeed discriminated against at some level.</p><p><br></p><p>They were indeed one of the two clans who had made this village and yet, they had time and time again produced strong shinobi, becoming the backbone of Konoha’s military might and yet… in all this time, after Kagami Uchiha, not a single person had even come close to the central power or management of the village.</p><p><br></p><p>The first two Hokages were Senju, the third was chosen by a Senju and even in the last election, Minato was the same, the student of the Third Hokage’s student. While he would always say Minato was the best choice, the worst part was Fugaku Uchiha not even getting a mention. Orochimaru did but Fugaku didn’t. The Uchiha were very offended by this, especially after their contributions on the battlefield.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uchiha Clan, a clan famed for their fire jutsu and dojutsu, were sent to fight Kirigakure, a village famous for water jutsu and hidden mist jutsu which can block dojutsu. The decision was stupid. He had called for it to be changed but Sensei had made an excuse that they had no other people.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hyuga were still there, the Inuzuka and Aburame were still there. Each of these clans would have been far better equipped against those opponents and yet, the Uchiha were the only ones sent… and they didn’t complain and even completed their duties loyally. And yet…</p><p><br></p><p>Minato had been trying to ease the tensions with the Uchiha, especially since Obito was also one… but even that was not possible after Obito’s death and Kakashi getting the Sharingan.</p><p><br></p><p>Laying a hand on the kekkei genkai of a clan was absolutely forbidden. Just look at the extent the Hyuga Clan goes to protect their eyes… and yet they were more or less strong-armed into leaving their sharingan with Kakashi.</p><p><br></p><p>All these things had been bubbling and everyone knew this. So when the Kyuubi attack happened, everyone’s doubt went to the Uchiha, especially with the sharingan visible in the Kyubi’s eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything had only gone down the drain all of a sudden and the strongest clan in the village was sent to the outskirts of the village.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing came out in the investigations and yet the damage was already done.</p><p><br></p><p>Come to think of it, all this was just as much the village management’s fault… and now they were paying the price for it.</p><p><br></p><p>They had come to a position where a war could start at any time. He could only sigh when he thought about this.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this really the village he had worked for?</p><p><br></p><p>Just what has sensei been doing all these years?</p><p><br></p><p>Itachi looked in a hurry but stopped when he saw him. “Jiraiya-sama. It’s urgent. I need to talk to the Hokage soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, something the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy struggled and he nodded, understanding how missions were. “Let’s go. I was going to sensei either way.”</p><p><br></p><p>They rushed to the Hokage’s office where the Hokage was in a discussion with his two advisors.</p><p><br></p><p>He knocked on the door but there was no reply. There were arguments going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Even from outside, he could hear a few things.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am telling you Hiruzen, there is no proof about Danzo being involved in any of this. Right now things are tense. We need him and his roots to stabilise the village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I have already told you, my decision is final. I will not be hearing any of this. Now, if you don’t have anything else to report… leave. I am very busy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiruzen, you…”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya was also done with his eavesdropping and a voice came from inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both Itachi and he entered the room. The eyes of the advisors narrowed at the sight of Itachi… sigh… and they wondered how things went so far.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, Jiraiya?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, Itachi has something urgent. I can report after that.” He looked at the guy and smiled. The guy looked like he was on fire somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensei looked towards Itachi who quickly got on one knee. “Naruto Uzumaki has been sighted in the village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in the room called in one voice and before he knew it, he was grabbing Itachi with both his shoulders. “Where is he?”</p><p><br>“Jiraiya, calm down. Itachi explain.” Sensei ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Itachi nodded and explained everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto sparring with Sasuke Uchiha and then flying away with a white haired girl… with wings…</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure they are at Ichiraku’s?” Sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not. I came here directly to inform you. My father and Sasuke will be coming here to talk to you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, I am leaving to check.” He said and sensei got up too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am coming too. Itachi, ask your father and brother to wait here when they arrive.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that both of them left at their fastest speed.</p><p><br></p><p>Reaching Ichiraku wasn’t that long after.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, as soon as they reached the door, they heard a loud laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not going to lose to you, Kanna-chan, not in eating ramen dattebayo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm… talk less, eat more.” Another voice sounded and the next second, he was already inside the restaurant following sensei.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, sitting on two chairs, eating ramen were two kids. One of them has the same blonde hair and blue eyes as Minato while the other with white hair and a strange dress.</p><p><br></p><p>The restaurant owner recognised them and stood up, greeting them. “Hokage-sama, Jiraiya-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded at them while sensei directly went towards the children.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto!”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya observed from the back.</p><p><br></p><p>As much as he wanted to go and meet him, he didn’t even know the boy. It could scare him away.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked at them as a look of recognition flashed in his eyes as he saw sensei, even a look of happiness and then… came rage. In the end, he just turned his head back towards the bowl of ramen and concentrated on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensei frowned and sat beside him. “Naruto, where have you been all this time? You were not at your home and you didn’t even go to the academy? Everyone was worried about you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto however just pouted and kept eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, Naruto? Why are you not saying anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy stopped and looked back. “Oh? And why should I?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Because I want to know. We were all worried about you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the rage on the boy’s face became obvious. “Oh, so it matters when you want to know things? When you are worried? What about when I was worried? What about when I asked you who my parents were?…”</p><p><br></p><p>The statement froze both of them while the boy continued.</p><p><br>“You knew it. You knew who my father was… who my parents were and yet you didn’t tell me. Do you know how much I thought about them? The people of the village always said that my parents never wanted a monster like me so they abandoned me. That my parents never loved me… and you knew they were wrong… you knew everything and still didn’t say anything!” The boy had tears in his eyes and fists clenched hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya couldn’t tell if it was just his feeling or not but the atmosphere around them chilled slightly… and the source of this feeling… it was coming from Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto… who… who told you that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My parents… they left their energies… chakra… whatever… inside me… I met them. I know everything. I know who my parents are and even why everyone is afraid of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened at the reveal of the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>Many thoughts ran through his head in that instant.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it true? Or was someone using genjutsu on him to feed him the wrong information? If so then who was behind all this?</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto, it’s not like that. Come with me. We will talk in my office.” Sensei went forward to calm him down but the boy stepped back.</p><p><br></p><p>“No! I don’t want to talk to any of you! Go away! Go away! Go away!” Suddenly a huge burst of energy pushed them away and something which Jiraiya never imagined he would ever see again appeared in front of their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Golden Chains appeared and threw sensei outside the ramen shop.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya stepped forward to defend against any following attack but the kunai in his hand fell down and his jaws hung open when he saw the figure from whom the chains were originating.</p><p><br></p><p>The figure was monstrous, like some kind of evil spirit that could chill the hearts of people and yet… she stood protectively in front of Naruto and if there was any leftover doubt in his mind, it was cleared by the blood red hair flowing on her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“K-kushina…” The name came out of his mouth almost unconsciously.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that his years of training came back to him as the hair on the back of his neck stood at the feeling of danger and he dove back, almost too close for a figure to slash down with a kunai. Strands of his hair fell in front of his widened eyes as he recognised the figure… the flash of yellow that had appeared in front of his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>He watched in frozen shock at the… almost demonic figure with the same sunny blonde hair on his head, holding a bone line dagger in a hauntingly similar stance protectively in front of the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>The killing intent the two figures were exuding was making even him experience chills just by standing in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop owner and his daughter looked pale at the sight of the two.</p><p><br></p><p>They were thinking about what to do when the white haired girl got up from her seat and walked casually to his side and smacked his head lightly. “Calm down, stupid Naruto. You’re scaring the shopkeeper. I want more ramen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ow… I… I am sorry, Kanna-chan.” Naruto apologised before looking at the two figures in front of him. “It’s okay, mom, dad. I am not in danger. I was just… angry. You can rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>To their utter surprise, the figures slowly faded away.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto then went on to apologise to the shop owner and his daughter and then looked at the white haired girl, Kanna. “Let’s go. We are getting late.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto. Let me explain everything. It’s not what you think.” Sensei went forward but stayed a few feet away from him, not risking what had just happened.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t want to talk to you. I am just here to take a picture of my parents and I will leave after that.” The boy answered curtly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have their pictures. In fact, I have all their belongings too. Your father wanted those to be given to you when you were older. Come with me. Let me explain everything first. You can take whatever you want after that.” Sensei tried to explain.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid however just narrowed his eyes at his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not lying, kid. Your parents’ belongings are indeed with him. At least hear him out once. Your friend can also come along if you want.” Jiraiya also went ahead and added carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid looked at the girl who nodded. “Let’s go. They are weak. If they try something, I will beat them up.” She patted her chest confidently.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene made Jiraiya smile even with all the crap that was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure, Kanna-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay then.” He then looked at them and nodded. He created a shadow clone to take care of the situation there while his original body left with the rest of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>They turned towards the Hokage building and the white haired girl grew wings and picked Naruto up, following them, leaving a stunned audience around.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>They entered the hokage’s office through the window and Naruto and the girl landed behind them as her wings shrunk back into her back.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya watched in awe and couldn’t help but ask. “What kind of jutsu is that?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked at him oddly and it was Naruto who answered. “Kanna-chan is a dragon. Those are her real wings. She hides them when she is in human form.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>And as if to smack that fact into their heads, the girl grew horns and a tail too.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya watched closely and indeed they were growing out of her body.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she a summoning beast?</p><p><br></p><p>He had once heard Orochimaru say that the snakes in the Ryuichi Cave could take the form of humans too.</p><p><br></p><p>But Dragons?</p><p><br></p><p>Did Dragons even exist?</p><p><br></p><p>He had never heard of any such summoning beast. Not even the toads of Mt. Myoboku knew of them.</p><p><br></p><p>And had he somehow reverse summoned himself in the summoning land of dragons? There was an example of this already… Jiraiya himself had done something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>It would also match up with his increased growth. From what he had known Naruto wasn’t exactly good in his classes and yet he had apparently effortlessly defeated the top student of his class after returning. So the training he was getting there must have been good.</p><p><br></p><p>He exchanged a look with sense who was listening to the conversation from the side and asked further.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… were you living with her… I mean dragons?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy narrowed his eyes suspiciously at him. Geez, just how much did sensei mess up.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya raised his hand quickly, trying to calm them down. “No need to get mad. I am just curious. I have never heard of any dragons before and wanted to know more about them. Where do they live? I have travelled all over the world but this is my first time seeing one.”</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto was about to speak but the girl stopped him and turned towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why should I tell you? What’s in it for us?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Finding a clue, Jiraiya dove in. “Oh, and what is it that you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>A glint passed by the girl’s eyes. “That bunshin thing you did back there… teach that to Naruto.” She asked and suddenly Naruto also had a look of realisation on his face and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bunshin… you mean the Kage Bunshin?” He asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, the Kage Bunshin… tell me how to use it and I will tell you where the dragons live.” Naruto nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well kid, it’s not an easy technique. It might take you a lot of time to learn that.” He answered, pretending to think.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you would need to complete your academy too. It's a jutsu only ninjas can learn. And didn't you want to be the Hokage, Naruto?” Sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The question however had the opposite effect to what he was expecting. The frown on the boy's face returned with full force.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t want to be Hokage or even a ninja. I will become a Legendary Master like Gramps.”</p><p><br>Just what had those dragons been teaching him?</p><p><br></p><p>“But Naruto… your father… he was the fourth Hokage.  He was a great man who gave up his life to protect the village. Don’t you want to become like him?” Sensei asked, the worry in his voice, easy to recognise.</p><p><br></p><p>“And my father would also have wanted me to grow up properly and yet, I was thrown out of the orphanage, mocked and shunned by everyone.” The words were like a punch to their guts. “My parents gave up their lives to protect me, so that I can live a better life and I don’t think being a ninja is that life for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who told you that, Naruto? Just who took you away from Konoha.” Sensei asked, his voice agitated slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>And as if to make things worse, the door opened and his two advisors entered… with the man he didn’t want to see in tow.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him, Tsunade, Fugaku Uchiha and his sons also entered.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya noticed the tension in the air between the two groups and the looks they threw at each other.</p><p><br>“Danzo… what are you doing here? I remember saying that you were not allowed anywhere outside your quarters.” Sensei asked in a warning tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“The boy has been found. I am here to prove that I wasn’t involved in any of this.” Danzo replied, unbothered. “But the more important question is where has he been all this time and how was he taken away? You do understand that letting such a significant military asset to the village get lost is your responsibility.”</p><p><br>“You do not… need to teach me what my responsibility is. I still haven’t permitted you to come out of your house arrest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not, Hiruzen.” Koharu complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enough! You will keep quiet. That’s an order.” Sensei shouted, taking all of them by surprise. It was a side of sensei they had rarely seen before.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, someone else was getting annoyed by the whole situation too.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto was the one who broke the silence. “Old man, I have waited long enough. When will you give me the pictures of my parents? I need to go back home.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is your home, Naruto. Don’t you want to know about your parents? Jiraiya here, was your father’s sensei. He can tell you everything about them and even teach you ninjutsu like him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes kid. Didn’t you want to learn the Kage Bunshin justu? I can  teach you that. In fact, your friend can join too. I am a summoner too and I know a lot about summoning beasts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t want any of that. I don’t want to be a ninja. I am going to be a Legendary Master dattebayo. I told you that already. Now, are you going to give me the pictures of my parents or not?”</p><p><br></p><p>The words brought out several reactions from the rest of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>“What does he mean by that, Hiruzen? You didn’t tell him… how could you? Do you have any idea what would happen if he spreads the identity…”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what is this about going back home? Where exactly is he going?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Letting a strategic resource of the village getaway is absolutely unacceptable.”</p><p><br></p><p>The situation was getting completely out of control as sensei and his advisors delved into an argument.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto also seemed done with everything and looked at the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems they were lying to us again, Kanna-chan. Let’s go. We can find their pictures later.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl however pointed towards a picture on the wall. “There… a picture of your dad.” Naruto looked back in surprise and his eyes lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yeah.” He jumped towards the wall and removed Minato’s picture from there. “Now only the picture of my mom is left. We can totally find it by ourselves. You are awesome, Kanna-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>The simple statement however brought several reactions, especially from the Uchiha who were staring wide eyed at the kid.</p><p><br>Aghh… this is turning into such a mess.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Let’s go.” The girl walked towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where exactly are you going?” Sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Home.” Naruto replied as the girl sprouted wings and took hold of them and were about to fly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop, Naruto!” Sensei commanded and several anbu surrounded them in an instant, closing their exit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei!” he called out but sensei raised his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Calm down, Jiraiya. He is just angry right now. We need to explain things to him first and know where he found everything from. Till then they need to be kept here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, let us go.” Naruto shouted while the white haired girl also let him down on the ground and glared at the anbu, almost as if preparing to attack when something happened which took them all by surprise once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Golden Chains erupted from Naruto’s back and pushed all the anbu away.</p><p><br></p><p>Few of them were thrown against the wall and the rest dodged, regaining their footing and drawing their weapons, surrounding him.</p><p><br></p><p>Those were… Kushina’s Adamantine Sealing Chains…</p><p><br></p><p>The tense atmosphere was broken by a new voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here?”</p><p><br></p><p>They all looked towards the window where a girl was standing. She had long blonde hair with flaming orange tips and red-orange eyes with dilated pupils and was wearing a long blue dress over a white shirt and a hair band. The most surprising thing about here however were the horns and the green lizard-like tail poking out of the dress.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind her was another girl. This one appeared much younger in age. She had pink hair tied up in a twin tails, and was floating in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto-kun, Kanna, what is going on here? Why did you two run away without informing anyone? Do you have any idea how much everyone is worried?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm sorry. I… we just came here to get the pictures of my mom and dad. I got one and need one more and when we were returning they stopped us.” He pointed towards the anbu surrounding them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensei stepped forward. “Are you one of the contracted dragons of Naruto? I have never heard of any dragons. Where do you all live?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked at him with narrowed eyes. “Dragons live in the world of dragons. Now, why are you stopping them from returning home?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“This place is Naruto’s home. He needs to spend time here too. I can understand that you want him to train in your arts but he needs to bond with the people of the village too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We already know what kind of home this village was to Naruto-kun.” She replied with narrowed eyes. “This place… has not treated Naruto-kun well and we will not stand by and watch that. He will not be staying here anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p> He just looked at the girl and spoke again. “I am sorry. It seems there has been some kind of misunderstanding here but we can talk and solve that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No need.” The girl stepped towards the anbu and Danzo stepped between them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and who are you to decide that? The boy is a property of this village and will be going nowhere. Anbu, capture them.” Danzo ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is no one’s property.” Jiraiya shouted back.</p><p><br>“He is, as every jinchuriki, a strategic weapon of the village. Remember your place as a ninja of Konoha, Jiraiya. This is not time to let your emotions run wild.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl stopped at the words and Jiraiya noticed the rage in the girl’s eyes at the statement, her fists clenched but she didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards sensei and to his surprise the old man didn’t move but instead looked at the girl and spoke. “I am sorry but I cannot let you take Naruto away. He needs to stay here, in his home as his parents wanted. If you want to insist, I will have to use force to stop you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can try your best.” She replied and stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the signal and one of the anbu attacked her with a drawn kunai. The girl didn’t stop and the kunai struck her directly in her forehead… only to shatter into pieces. The girl however instead of getting angry, smiled… a smile which sent shivers down Jiraiya’s spine. All his instincts screamed at him to run away or he would die.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl, no, the dragon spoke again. “The boss told me not to start any fights while I was here and I was only allowed to fight if I was attacked. This… counts as an attack, doesn’t it?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the next moment Jiraiya knew why his instincts were going haywire as an unholy amount of power seeped out from the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in the room froze.</p><p><br></p><p>This power… it was like the Kyubi… no… It was probably worse…</p><p><br></p><p>Her figure blurred and all the anbu were thrown out of the hokage tower, their bodies ripping holes in the walls on their way out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kanna, take Naruto-kun and go back. I will return in a few minutes.” She snapped a finger and a tear in space appeared near them.</p><p><br></p><p>The white haired girl nodded and took Naruto and jumped directly into the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>Danzo however attacked them with his Vacuum Sphere jutsu but the other girl who had been floating outside the window suddenly appeared between them and the attacks struck her… doing no damage.</p><p><br></p><p>“Catch them. Don’t let them escape!” Danzo shouted and everyone jumped into action.</p><p><br></p><p>The tear in space however closed and only two girls remained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Capture them! Don’t let them get away.” Sensei ordered and even Jiraiya joined them, even if he didn’t agree with their way of doing things.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are we having a fight, Tohru-chan? Hey, are we having a fight? Uwahahahaha these people want to fight us but they are so weak. Hey, do you think if we beat them up, Sil would be happy and then we can get extra desserts after dinner?”</p><p><br></p><p>“…well, the boss considers Naruto-kun his adopted brother so he would definitely not mind if we beat them up.” The girl answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Then for my extra dragon cherry pudding… get beaten up.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya had no idea what was happening but he had a feeling that things had just gone from bad to worse.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href="https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter took a lot out of me, always something or the other coming up and delaying the work.</strong></p><p><strong><br>I know it ended on a cliff but trust me… for once, this was unplanned.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was hoping to complete the whole fight in the chapter but then as I wrote, I realised that I wouldn’t even be able to start the fight properly at the rate and had to end here.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So Konoha is… how to say this… fucked.
