        <p><strong>Isekai Restaurant. </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 4: Curses, Dragons and Demons, Oh My!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I served the orders of the people in the Restaurant as we waited for the return of Gojo-san and Kisuke-san.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere had a sense of seriousness which was felt by everyone but not addressed by anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the only ones chilling out were Shoko-san and Nanami-sensei.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was looking at her feet, not even trying to meet anyone’s eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She was feeling guilty for everything.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was noticed by others too.</p><p><br></p><p>I put a hand on her shoulder. “You shouldn’t feel guilty for them, Sakura. I… don’t like resorting to violence… but… sometimes… some people… are better off not existing.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said as I felt disgust well up inside me at the thought of the people who did those things to Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t think of this as hurting them….think of it as saving the lives of several others who could have been their victims.” Shoko-san comforted her as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“While the principle of the Ryozanpaku dojo is to never kill and I will follow that till I die, there is a saying you should remember in these situations. ‘The World goes to hell when good people do nothing.’ If we knew about that criminal and did not do anything to prevent them from acting again, it would be the same as supporting them in their crimes. You shouldn’t blame yourself, Jou-chan. You did the right thing.” Hayato-san said.</p><p><br></p><p>With enough support from everyone, her mood improved considerably.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how things were going on Gojo-san’s side.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satoru Gojo -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He walked down the path created by his previous attack.</p><p><br></p><p>It was his first time in a different world and… it felt quite enlightening.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite the similar places, the same country, he couldn’t sense the random curses which inhabited his world.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing which even came close to being a curse was right at the end of the path he was walking towards.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t boring however.</p><p><br></p><p>The energy he could sense from the other end of the town… it made him excited.</p><p><br></p><p>It however wasn't the time to check that part out yet.</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling which he was getting in front of him….was repulsive.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what kind of curse was it?</p><p><br></p><p>He soon found out when he reached the place.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a pit full of worms.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the middle of that was an emancipated body of what looked like a ghoul.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, those badly made zombies from the old horror movies.</p><p><br></p><p>Because there was no way that thing looked anywhere even close to a human.</p><p><br></p><p>“Jeez, and I thought that old guy back at school was ancient. But I guess you feel quite similar to him so it doesn’t matter although in an evil twin manner. I always wonder how it would feel to blow off Tengen-sama but I guess I will have to make do with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you, insolent curr…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Pest control. We heard there was a worm infestation in this place and now it seems that it was true. Look at you, you fat disgusting worm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You….”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t let the old monster speak as he blasted his head.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack wasn’t resisted in the slightest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that was unexpected. I expected more.”</p><p><br></p><p>And right at that moment, several worms flew out from the pits and attacked him.</p><p><br></p><p>They obviously didn’t reach near him and he looked at the place where the man’s headless body was standing.</p><p><br></p><p>It was recovering… no, it was getting replaced by worms.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you <em>are</em> a monster. Great. Now Nanami and Yaya-sensei won’t bother me with their glares. But still, you can heal with the help of these worms, so… I will have to try. Let’s get this done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lapse: Blue.”</p><p><br></p><p>He created an orb of negative cursed energy right above the worm pit, attracting everything around the area with worms and crushing it.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster sent several spells to attack him but he just dodged them easily.</p><p><br></p><p>This was after all a new world and he didn’t want to risk getting hit by something which his power couldn’t stop.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster wasn’t expecting it and let out a scream like some evil spirit as he sent the sphere of energy high up in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, the finishing touches.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Reversal: Red.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s a perfect hit.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacks merged midair in a purple hue, erasing everything in the surroundings.</p><p><br></p><p>“Remote Hollow Purple. Wow, that actually worked.”</p><p><br></p><p>He heard a whistling sound behind him and turned back to see Kisuke walking out but suddenly stopped and pointed towards a piece of rubble.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hado Number four, Byakurai.”</p><p><br></p><p>White lightning burst out from his hand, tore through the rubble and he heard a shrill sound.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! It was hiding there? I thought I had taken care of all of those.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke walked there and picked it up, looking closely at it. “This one contained a larger part of the soul, second only to the main one, implanted near Sakura-chan’s heart. A good research material.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, he’s not dead?” He asked, looking at Kisuke dissecting the worm directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn’t call this living but yes, he is <em>technically</em> still alive. Although that could end anytime I want. Just give me a minute to check if there was something different about this one.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, doctors were crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he was thinking this, the ground in front of him slowly morphed into the form of that old monster.</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t die?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“How fascinating? It seems that the main worm was responsible for commanding this figure.” Kisuke said, looking at the figure in front of him. “A puppet of sorts. How long will it be able to command it? Where is it getting all that energy from? So many things, so little time.” He suddenly turned towards him. “Gojo-kun, would you mind assisting me with a small experiment?”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow looking at the mad scientist in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh don’t be suspicious. I just want to test the limits and methods of this old guy. All you need to do is beat him thoroughly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well if that’s the case….” He cracked his knuckles. “I did promise Shoko to make this painful. He can feel pain, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>In reply Kisuke turned back. “One of the things I intend to figure out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha great.”</p><p><br></p><p>By then the old monster had recovered and he walked forward.</p><p><br></p><p>He really wanted to vent for a while now.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The customers in the shop had mostly left with only a few people left.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama was getting more depressed with his increased hair fall problem. The guy had become half bald already at such a young age.</p><p><br></p><p>He could barely show emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>The only times when he seemed actually happy was when he was eating.</p><p><br></p><p>With the absence of Mikami and Suzuki, my food was the happiest part of his life.</p><p>‘</p><p>Seriously, even I was missing those two.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what the hell happened to them?</p><p><br></p><p>“So you are planning to increase your training?” Nanami-sensei asked me, breaking me out from my reverie.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“May I ask why?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….feel I am not strong enough.” Even in the case of Sakura, I could barely do anything but stand aside and watch.</p><p><br></p><p>It felt so frustrating to be so helpless.</p><p><br></p><p>And now Gojo-san and Kisuke-san are out fixing the problem, a fight I had picked….while I sat here, doing nothing, just waiting for them.</p><p><br></p><p>I was attached to a place which was basically in between who knows how many worlds. There are bound to be people who wouldn’t be as peaceful as my previous customers, like Sakura’s brother….Although there was the System to protect me inside the Restaurant, I couldn’t allow myself to be weak.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know I’m not from a Jujutsu background or even from that world and I am starting my training very late. And on top of that I’m not even naturally talented. Even Naruto-kun, a kid, has more power than me, so….I want to work hard so that I can help my friends when they need it.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei was looking oddly at me, making me embarrassed. </p><p><br></p><p>Damn, I must have sounded like those hot blooded shonen protagonists right now with that cringy speech.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas….Naruto-kun is a unique case. Not everyone can be like him. You shouldn’t compare yourself with him. That said, you are plenty strong yourself. Very strong even but all that potential can only come out through more hard work. Don’t worry, I will increase your lessons.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Sensei.” I bowed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Nanami Kento -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the boy bowing in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously….just how in the nine hells did he get the idea that <em>he</em> was weak??</p><p><br></p><p>If he was weak then the entire Jujutsu world was worthless.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he didn’t tell the boy about his exact position in the world to not inflate his ego. He was still young and insane amounts of Cursed Energy wouldn’t matter if he cannot control it. Overconfidence when fighting Curses can be one’s greatest enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>He still reassured the kid.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto Uzumaki was a unique case.</p><p><br></p><p>Two vengeful spirits and whatever that Nine Tailed fox inside him was….such a case was rarer than Six Eyes and Limitless coming together.</p><p><br></p><p>Comparing such an anomaly to himself and saying that he was weak was seriously the dumbest thing he had heard in a while.</p><p><br></p><p>To give him an example, he thought of an idea.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that Sakura-kun also wants to become a Jujutsu Sorcerer. If that’s the case then let’s awaken her Cursed Energy till Gojo and the rest are back.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the girl who was sitting at the nearby table with Shoko and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>They followed him outside as he opened a door.</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami still felt awe when he looked at the sight of his own world outside.</p><p><br></p><p>A Path to different worlds…. </p><p><br></p><p>Shaking his head and clearing his thoughts, he walked out and brought out a cursed tool, a knife from his bag pack.</p><p><br></p><p>He always kept several cursed tools with himself when coming to teach Silas.</p><p><br></p><p>Offering the knife to the girl, he asked her to concentrate on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko and Silas stood a few steps behind, near the door of the Restaurant while Sakura walked a few steps forward, towards the centre of the area.</p><p><br></p><p>They had sealed off this entire underground subway area after the whole Shinjiku debacle after having some discussions with the Government.</p><p><br></p><p>No one was allowed inside and it was even considered haunted.</p><p><br></p><p>On top of that Gojo, Masamichi-sensei and he, all three had covered the place in barriers from top to bottom to isolate this place from the rest of the world after Naruto’s awakening when his barrier almost broke trying to keep the energy from being felt outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, this place was almost as secure as the holding cells at Tokyo Jujutsu High’s Holding Cells.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the girl, he felt bad for her so much that he didn’t even argue with Gojo’s rule breaking this time.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl had obviously gone through a lot and Shoko was correct in saying that such people almost never got to return back to their normal life.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead, giving her the power to protect her would be a much more useful support.</p><p><br></p><p>And due to the things she had experienced, she would be more predisposed to awakening Cursed Energy than others.</p><p><br></p><p>That said….people like Silas Evans and Naruto Uzumaki were exceptions.</p><p><br></p><p>Not everyone can be like them.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe seeing a more….normal Sorcerer would help bring perspective back to Silas.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he thought this, all the hair on his body stood up as he felt an extreme sense of danger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get bac!…..” His words couldn’t be completed as he was blown away by a tornado of Cursed Energy.</p><p><br></p><p>His body crashed on the wall of the building as he felt the barrier around the place shatter almost immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of him, Sakura was surrounded by dense shadows, forming a pillar of cursed energy which was rising into the sky.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://This….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">This….it</a> was beyond anything he had felt before.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, even Naruto’s Nine Tailed Fox didn’t feel like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Such power and the….rawness of this power made him slam on the ground, almost losing consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>From the corner of his eyes, he looked at Silas who was channelling his Cursed Energy to keep himself from kneeling.</p><p><br></p><p>The energy was still rising and then the shadows expanded from the pillar, seeping out of the building.</p><p><br></p><p>Such insane Cursed Energy was like a magnet for low level curses. They were being drawn to the place like a moth to flame.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked in horror as within a minute, hundreds of spirits were surrounding the place but when they tried to come to close, they were completely crushed by the power or simply dragged into the shadows and destroyed as they rose up again as shadows and attacked other curses, tearing and devouring them.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what in the world was she?</p><p><br></p><p>He tried to focus, releasing his vow to get an extra boost in his cursed power to get up and stop her when he heard a voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura, calm down.” Silas shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>He was about to ask him to stay back but before he could say anything, the cursed energy wrecking the entire place disappeared as if it were a dream.</p><p><br></p><p>The pillar of shadow disappeared slowly as Sakura’s form appeared within.</p><p><br></p><p>He almost couldn’t feel any cursed energy inside her.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Silas and slowly walked towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>They boy quickly went towards her and hugged her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” Silas then turned towards him. “Was there something wrong with the Knife, Nanami-sensei? And where did those monsters come from?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami felt his vision fade as he fell unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I felt Sakura tremble slightly in my arms. “Did I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“You did nothing wrong. There was probably something wrong with the Knife. The same happened with me where I cracked the sword. Don’t worry about it. In fact I haven’t seen that kind of Cursed Energy in anyone. Even Naruto didn’t have this kind of power.  You are awesome Sakura. I am sure you will be a great Jujutsu Sorcerer. Let’s get back quickly. There are more monsters coming here and Nanami-sensei seems to have fainted. This place is unsafe.”</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly picked up Nanami-sensei in one arm and led them back to the Restaurant to see Shoko-san inside.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at us in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?” She asked, quickly coming and checking up on him.</p><p><br></p><p>“There was something wrong with the knife and an accident happened. Monsters swarmed the area and Nanami-sensei fainted. Sakura destroyed several of them and we returned quickly.”</p><p><br></p><p>As I relayed the information, she used her Reversed Curse Technique on him.</p><p><br></p><p>“There was a mild concussion at the back of his head. I healed him. Let him rest for a while and let’s wait for Gojo and the rest to arrive. It might have been an ambush outside.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san seemed to have said something about there being a fight in that area a while back.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Nanami-sensei and then at Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>Her power was mind blowing. Far above Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>I was having trouble even standing in her presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, it was understandable as Naruto was still a kid while she was double his age.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only normal that her power would be higher.</p><p><br></p><p>In comparison, my own power….</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei was probably trying to console me earlier.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, both Naruto and Sakura were from supernatural worlds while my own world seemed normal….except me.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only normal that they would have more power.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet there were people stronger than her in her world….</p><p><br></p><p>So I would have to train harder.</p><p><br></p><p>Which reminds me that I have to start martial arts lessons with the Ryozanpaku masters too.</p><p><br></p><p>By then Nanami-sensei had woken up but didn’t say anything about the incident. He reassured Sakura that it was not her fault and just said that Gojo-san might be the best teacher for Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san and Kisuke-san came a few hours later, looking quite happy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it done?” Shoko-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. That old guy was more of a curse than human anymore. Actually, he was quite a lot like Tengen-sama, old, shrivelled and almost a monster.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gojo!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Chill out. Anyways, he’s dead now. Kisuke found him and we cleared everything related to him. The guy had a lot of stuff.” He looked at Kisuke-san who continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Books on new kinds of magic, tools, even personal notes on several things. I will leave all of this for Sakura-chan here although I would like to temporarily borrow a few books to study if she doesn’t mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>She easily agreed. In fact, she didn’t even seem to care. Right now, she seemed more relieved than anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So….what’s up? You all look worried?” Gojo-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….actually while you all were away, we had Sakura awaken her Cursed Energy….and well, there was an accident of sorts.”</p><p><br></p><p>He merely raised an eyebrow and looked at Nanami-sensei who kept quiet for a second and then spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is….exceptionally talented.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! That’s quite a praise from you. So….what are you sulking about Nanami-kun?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The barrier outside shattered when she awakened and a lot of curses were attracted. I think we should go out and clear those first.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“The barrier….shattered.” Gojo-san looked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” Nanami-sensei nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahahaha that’s great.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san began to laugh loudly and then looked at Sakura, giving her a thumbs up, making the girl look embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great job. Also don’t worry about the curses outside. I will take care of them. In fact, Silas, you haven’t experienced any combat yet, right? Come on. This will be a great experience.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm Gojo-san….there were hundreds of those monsters. Sakura’s power took care of most of them but there were still a few left. Maybe we should wait here until they are gone?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. We will be fine. After all….I am the strongest.”</p><p><br></p><p>….this guy….he was quite cocky.</p><p><br></p><p>Although from what I have heard, he did have the ability to call himself as such.</p><p><br></p><p>The strongest sorcerer, Gojo Satoru.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, Shoko, teach Sakura-chan some theory while we take Silas out to clear the area.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you mind if I tag along? I have been quite curious about these curses.” Kisuke-san tagged along.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was standing face to face with a grotesque monster, the size of a small car.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster had tentacles and was green in colour. It crawled towards me, faster than I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly dove towards the side and slashed with the dagger in my hand, cutting off the tentacles.</p><p><br></p><p>It let out a shriek and the rest of his tentacles came towards me and I attacked with my knife in return, using the technique I was most comfortable with.</p><p><br></p><p>My chopping techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened without me even realising, due to my habit.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I realised, all of its tentacles were chopped into pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>It retreated quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>I however didn’t back down as I kicked the ground, directly stabbing the knife into its giant single eye.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster crumbled apart.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath as I felt my heart pounding in my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>I did it.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, I was outside my Restaurant, fighting the curses which had gathered due to the breaking of the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei, Kisuke-san and Gojo-san were watching over me from a distance and would intervene if I was in any danger.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t get much time as another curse jumped towards me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kisuke -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“These curses….how are they born?”</p><p><br></p><p>“From the negative thoughts and emotions of humans.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. They remind me a lot of hollows.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hollows?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Evil Spirits, basically souls of the dead who have had regrets and linger over and get corrupted. They eat souls to sustain themselves and are extremely dangerous.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Some curses do that too so they might have similarities. Even powerful sorcerers can become curses under certain circumstances.”</p><p><br></p><p>He questioned them as he looked over the owner fight against what was said to be low level curses.</p><p><br></p><p>He could feel the energy which they called Cursed Energy and from what he felt, the owner was very rough in his control although he seemed to be improving very quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….what exactly happened?” Gojo asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura….her <a href="https://power….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">power….it</a> was beyond anything I had ever experienced. I couldn’t even stand in her presence.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.” Gojo merely raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t understand Gojo. It was unreal. Even Naruto with all his power seemed almost like a kid in front of her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, I believe you. I can’t sense the barrier over Japan right now. It’s damaged severely and the place it was damaged….is right above us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Explain about her power.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They seemed to be shadows of some kind, similar to the Zenin’s Shadow Manipulation. She could also kill and devour Curses using her Shadows and….raise them as familiars, similar to….”</p><p><br></p><p>“....Suguru’s power.”</p><p><br></p><p>They became quiet at the mention of the name and he felt a special history behind that name.</p><p><br></p><p>“Her shadows spread over the entire space….and it seemed as if her power was rising every time a curse was devoured.” Nanami continued to explain.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see, that also explains why I am feeling so few curses around the area. It seems that Sakura-chan gobbled up most of them. Although….with the damaged barrier, things are going to change a bit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They would have detected us too and soon people will be coming here to investigate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If her power was as great as you said, I doubt they would come here so quickly. But yes, there will be scouts.”</p><p><br></p><p>They again became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“But how can someone have that kind of power? It was almost as if….as if she were some kind of a God. The God of all Curses. I felt as if I should kneel in front of her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She was experimented on by that creep. Who knows what he did? That guy was apparently several hundred years old. We will have to look more into it to understand the reason.” Gojo said, not taking his eyes off Silas who was now fighting more comfortably with curses.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke decided to throw in his two cents.</p><p><br></p><p>“It could have something to do with the worms implanted into her. I will look into it. Maybe his notes had something about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Kisuke.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. I am getting a lot out of it too.”</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://“Well….in" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Well….in</a> that case, let’s wrap things here too. Silas has fought enough for today.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, Gojo disappeared from the place, appearing beside Silas who was being attacked by a curse and with a single raised finger, a red light burst out, destroying the monster and all the lands behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke paid attention to the man because his strength was nothing to scoff about.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in Seireitei, someone like him would be a captain.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe it will give him an idea about the power levels of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gojo-san!” Silas looked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well done. Now, step back. I will take care of this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But….there are hundreds of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>There were….but from what Kisuke had sensed, they were barely at low level hollows strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Against someone like Gojo….yes, he will be fine.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, that was the case.</p><p><br></p><p>In less than a minute, all those curses were torn apart and there was not even a scratch on him.</p><p><br></p><p>There were so many interesting things in other worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>A week had passed since that incident.</p><p><br></p><p>My life was back to normal again. Well, as normal as the life of the owner of an Interdimensional Restaurant could get.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was integrating well in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>We haven't gone back to her world since then and neither did anyone come from that world.</p><p><br></p><p>And in a way that was for the best.</p><p><br></p><p>We enjoyed this time of peace and quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>Our training was going well.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was apparently some kind of genius when it came to Cursed Techniques and Naruto was learning well too although he did have some problems due to his enormous Cursed Energy reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>I on the other hand was getting good at control.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Nanami-sensei, at this rate, I would soon find out my Innate Cursed techniques if I had any.</p><p><br></p><p>Other than that, I trained with the Ryozanpaku masters sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>I still remembered the scene of Gojo-san ripping every curse in the area with his bare hands.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Between Heaven and Earth, I alone am the Honoured One.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>The sheer arrogance in those worlds and yet when knowing what he could do, it didn’t seem out of place somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura worked as a waitress for the Restaurant and this had reduced a lot of my workload.</p><p><br></p><p>There were some new customers in the Restaurant, a soft spoken calligrapher and a student called Cid Kagenou.</p><p><br></p><p>He really enjoyed the Japanese cuisine the last time he came to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently he had just joined an academy for Knights.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, he was from another magic based world.</p><p><br></p><p>But unlike others, Cid was more interested in my food than other worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been getting better at cooking and with more customers coming in, there were several new dishes I could experiment with.</p><p><br></p><p>The higher level dishes even had the ability to increase the strength of people who ate them but I would need to level up the Restaurant before being able to cook them.</p><p><br></p><p>I finished the last order.</p><p><br></p><p>The customers had been served, so I went and sat down beside him after finishing cooking.</p><p><br></p><p>“So how is school going for you, Cid?” I asked, starting the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san. School is the same old. I am not in the higher classes so the workload is a bit less but it’s still hard for me.” he rubbed the back of his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“You just got in. I am sure that as long as you work hard, you can get promoted to higher classes easily.” I reassured her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I hope so too.” he smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“On that note, how is your martial arts training going on Silas-kun?” Bang-san asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am just getting started. The masters at Ryozanpaku are good but I haven’t been able to give much time to it due to my schedule.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, training is hard dattebayo.” Naruto took a moment to pick himself from the bowl of ramen and threw in his two cents.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not easy to become a Legendary Master, brat.” Hayato-san chided, making the kid nod.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am still going to become a Legendary Master. Believe it!” With that said, he dove back to his food.</p><p><br></p><p>Regardless of his words, Naruto trained very hard and the Ryozanpaku masters were extremely impressed with his persistence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hayato has been telling me that you have good potential. You could try your hand at being a Hero when you get stronger.” Bang-san laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha no no. I will pass. I like my current job.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Too bad.”</p><p><br></p><p>As we were talking with each other, the door to the Restaurant opened and someone entered.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a beautiful girl with long blonde hair with flaming orange tips and red-orange eyes with dilated pupils, and a buxom figure.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wearing a maid costume like those in Maid Cafes I had seen in Akihabara.</p><p><br></p><p>She walked and stopped right in front of us and looked at Naruto as she bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for saving my life. I will be eternally grateful to you for this.” She then turned towards me, leaving the others even more confused. “And thank you for giving me food. It was the best thing I have ever tasted.” She bowed again and there was even a bit of drool on the corner of her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….excuse me, but….who are you?” Naruto asked the question which all of us wanted to know the answer to.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I see. You cannot recognise me in this form. Changing to my true form might be inconvenient in this closed space so I will introduce myself. My name is Tohru and I am a Chaos Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>She closed her eyes as two deer-like horns popped out on her head and a large green tail came out of her skirt.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am the dragon you saved a while ago and gave food to.”</p><p><br></p><p>We found our mouths opening and closing at the sight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, so cool. Is that the transformation jutsu?” Naruto jumped from his place and looked at her in interest.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is indeed a Transformation Magic.” She nodded. “Naruto-kun is so smart.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ehehehehe.” The kid laughed as he rubbed the back of his head.</p><p><br></p><p>By then some of us had recovered from our shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you actually a dragon?” Miu asked, making the dragon girl look at her with an unkind gaze. “Umm, I am Naruto’s elder sister.”</p><p><br></p><p>The gaze turned immediately into a friendly one. “Yes. I am a Chaos Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>….Yeah….the name didn’t sound dangerous at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you like to eat something?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, can I?” Drool appeared at the corner of her mouth but she shook her head. “No no. I came here to repay the favour, how can I ask for more.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her stomach growled.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You can join us for a meal and talk.” I invited.</p><p><br></p><p>After some persuasion she agreed as I went inside to cook while keeping an ear at the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>I served her some meat like the last time and we watched as she swallowed the whole thing in one bite.</p><p><br></p><p>….she was really a dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after she finished eating, Hayato-san asked. “So, what do you want to do, Miss Tohru?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….would like to serve Naruto-kun to repay my debt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Hayato-san and even Naruto tried to persuade her that there was no need for such a thing but she was stubborn.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end, they accepted her as a helping hand at the Dojo. As for repaying me, she would work here part time as a waitress.</p><p><br></p><p>I take it back, my life just became weirder.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t get it? How do I figure out my Innate Technique? Do I even have one?” I asked, frustrated.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a month since the dragon maid joined our Restaurant staff and things have become quite interesting since then.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru is….unique to say the least.</p><p><br></p><p>She lacked the common sense of humans and did some odd things like….cleaning the plates with her tongue or….cooking her own tail which she detoxified….</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the fact that she doesn’t care about other people as long as their names are not Naruto Uzumaki or Silas Evans. She does maintain a very amiable behaviour around people close to us.</p><p><br></p><p>As for others, she saw them as if they were lesser than dirt.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to take time and teach her about customer service and how to act like a proper waitress.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura helped and for some reason I get the feeling that Tohru was shit scared of Sakura. She never spoke about it so I didn’t pry either.</p><p><br></p><p>And coming to Sakura….the girl was a genius in Jujutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>She could use almost any kind of Cursed Techniques at a glance.</p><p><br></p><p>Her power was using Shadows but the scariest part of the power was to devour curses. By doing so, she couldn’t just summon them later on as Shikigami but also get an increase in power.</p><p><br></p><p>They tested her and both her power and skills were enough to qualify her as a Special Class from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing which she didn’t know was Domain Expansion because that was something she needed to figure out by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she wasn’t interested in fighting and was more interested in the Reversed Curse Techniques of Shoko-san.</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to heal and help others out of their pain.</p><p><br></p><p>I personally think that goal was beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, she was waiting for me to catch up and till then, she studied the books Kisuke-san had….borrowed from her home.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Naruto had awakened the same type of chains as one of the Spirits haunting him. They could seal the Cursed Energy of others and could even bypass cursed techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, both of them were some kind of cheat existences.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, here I was….trying to figure out if I had any Innate Techniques of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto, Sakura and you are from three different worlds. From what Kisuke and Shoko have found, Sakura’s and Naruto’s worlds had bloodline specific magic while we don’t even know if yours had magic of any kind. So they might be more….predisposed to awaken their Innate Techniques. As for you, maybe it will manifest in a while as your body gets used to the Cursed Energy you have. No need to get frustrated. There are still a lot of things you can do without Innate Techniques.” Nanami-sensei explained.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. He was right.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was just getting frustrated due to not making any progress.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe you need a break. You are making very good progress in your control. I will ask Gojo to take over and teach you how to use a Simple Domain if possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Domain?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I personally think you can do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? I am not much of a combatant though. I wanted to learn Magic for protection. Maybe something like the Reverse Cursed technique would be good for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Reverse Curse Technique is not something I am proficient in. You will have to ask Gojo or Shoko for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how is your Martial Arts training going?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s good. The masters are happy with my progress.” They actually were. With the combined effect of my special food and their training, I was getting decently strong.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should train. The situation outside is a bit complicated. The number of curses has started increasing drastically, so much so that Gojo has to work out almost full time to keep them in check. And the worst part is that all of them seem to be attracted to this area. We are keeping a guard outside so you don’t need to worry. We expect the barrier over the country to be repaired soon and the number of curses will be reduced.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked out a bit and then he left.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma and the Masters came and I went back to prepare their orders.</p><p><br></p><p>Kensei was instructing Touma while he was practising his punches.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I heard a smashing sound of someone hitting on the wall and overturning the tables and quickly came out.</p><p><br></p><p>People were surrounding a black haired guy who was slumped against the wall. He was wearing a weird black and golden coloured robe with a white shawl-like cover and looked like a scholar from the middle ages.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma was already on his knees, apologising to the guy while Hayato checked up on him.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy on the other hand probably had a broken jaw or something and was bleeding from his mouth as he looked at the blood on his hand in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a short moment to know what had happened. Touma, who was practising his punches, was hit by Kensei on his knees to correct his posture. He slipped and punched the guy who had just entered the shop, sending him flying and crashing into the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I’m not healing?” The guy looked in shock as if he couldn’t believe it. He checked it again and a few more times before I saw some tears in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Saitama, get the first aid kit. It’s on the second floor. Check the storeroom.” I instructed as I helped the guy stand up and tried to take him to a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>He however got up and went straight to Touma. I saw Kensei tense up slightly but what happened next stunned all of us out of our minds. He bowed down and thanked Touma.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. You have done me the greatest favour of my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama who had returned with the First Aid Kit whispered into my ears. “Is he, you know… one of those masochist weirdos?”</p><p><br></p><p>… The worst part was that I had no idea what to say.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry, I didn’t mean to hit you, Mr?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Zeref. My name is Zeref Dragneel. You don’t have to feel bad.I don’t know how you did it but you have helped me and for that, I will be eternally grateful.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this point all of us were confused. The guy sensed it and explained to us.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was cursed. You just somehow broke my curse. Please don’t feel bad about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ohhh.</p><p><br></p><p>Ohhhh. That made sense. Touma’s power negation actually removed his curse.</p><p><br></p><p>And being a budding expert on curses, I enquired about his story.</p><p><br></p><p>The people around were shocked for a moment before they gathered around the new guy Zeref to know his story.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref Dragneel explained a bit about himself.</p><p><br></p><p>His family was killed in a dragon attack when he was still a kid. Both his parents and a younger brother died.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Tohru shifting awkwardly in her place at the mention of the incident.</p><p><br></p><p>When he grew up, he learned magic and started researching ways to bring back the dead and invented a type of magic which broke some laws.</p><p><br></p><p>This caused him to get cursed by the God of Death.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a chill down my spine.</p><p><br></p><p>To be cursed by a God….seriously….</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that his world was far more dangerous than the ones I knew of.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, I felt pity for the man.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref seemed like a very kind person.</p><p><br></p><p>Losing his entire family might be a shock for anyone and this guy was just trying to get back his family.</p><p><br></p><p>While trying to break taboos is bad, this kind of curse was just too cruel.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially for someone like Zeref, who wanted to live a peaceful life, that kind of a curse….was probably the worst thing which could happen to him.</p><p><br></p><p>And it wasn’t even the worst part yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to the deaths the curse had caused, he was regarded a Black Wizard and shunned by the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And then, after over hundreds of years of living a lonely life, he gets a lover and even she was afflicted by the same curse due to using some magic to save a friend of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly felt annoyed at the God.</p><p><br></p><p>This explained why he was so grateful to have the curse removed from him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Zeref, I don’t know how it worked but if you want, I can help your lover too. My power is to negate the powers of those I touch. I can try using this and see if it works.” Touma offered. “I still don’t know the exact range of my powers so I can’t say anything for sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man’s eyes widened slightly and he nodded. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. While not much, I have been studying about purifying curses too. I don’t know if we can do anything against a curse from a God but I assure you that we will do our best.” I reassured the guy too.</p><p><br></p><p>He bowed deeply at us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I cannot thank you all enough for the favour you have done me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere soon became calmer as we all settled down. </p><p><br></p><p>I served the guy some food to celebrate him being free of the curse which had hounded him for years….probably centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that really scared me. I thought that the kid messed up.” Kensei laughed and we joined in awkwardly while I gave Touma some water.</p><p><br></p><p>The other customers explained to Zeref about the shop while I took a seat nearby to hear the stories.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still I didn’t expect this kind of place to exist. A restaurant connecting several worlds and that too run by a demon. In my world, Demons are mostly cruel and lean towards destruction and chaos. So to see one who is this <a href="https://different….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">different….it</a> is really a surprise.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Say what?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Yaga Masamichi -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He stood in front of the higher ups from the Jujutsu High however, today, the situation had changed.</p><p><br></p><p>Back then, he was expecting an execution due to the mess at Shibuya and Gojo getting sealed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not a secret how much these bastards wanted to get their hands on his techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, they had even announced his house arrest and that was the main reason why he had to run away with Gojo.</p><p><br></p><p>But ever since the day Sakura had awakened….</p><p><br></p><p>He still felt chills recalling the incident.</p><p><br></p><p>Who would have thought that the girl they had helped would be <em>that</em> strong? Even from so far away, he could feel the enormous Cursed Energy of that girl.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the fact that her awakening and casually releasing her Cursed Energy had almost shattered the entire countrywide barrier over Japan was a terrifying thought.</p><p><br></p><p>And she could control curses and even become stronger, not to mention her incredible talent which surpassed even Yuta.</p><p><br></p><p>They had all devoted all their efforts to find out the reason behind it, and with some help from Kisuke Urahara, the man from a different world, they found some clues in the notes of the madman whom Gojo had killed.</p><p><br></p><p>The history of the Matou or rather Makiri family and that monster Zouken….</p><p><br></p><p>How Sakura was actually adopted and had the Matou blood forced on her, of all the atrocities she had to go through for the twisted pleasure and goals of that madman, the Grail Wars and finally about the corrupted grail manifesting the spirit of a real God.</p><p><br></p><p>A God.</p><p><br></p><p>Those madmen actually tried to mess with the spirit of an actual God and not just any God but the King of Daemons who bore the six billion curses of the world,  the source of All the World's Evil, Angra Mainyu.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a twenty finger Sukuna felt tame.</p><p><br></p><p>There was however a ray of hope which was Sakura’s ability to control it.</p><p><br></p><p>They had hypothesised several things and found out that the whole reason for this was based in the Matou trait of Absorption.</p><p><br></p><p>Although they had removed most if not all of the tainted grail from her, the girl’s body had absorbed the power and coming to their world and awakening her Cursed Energy was the final trigger for the insane event.</p><p><br></p><p>In all, it was several, almost impossible facts coming together to work in just the right way to give the girl her powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo had verified that she was not being possessed and the fact that she practically followed every word of the shop owner Silas, they considered her safe.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one of the reasons why they were investing so much effort to train her to control her powers.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past month and half, no one had gone there to check the source of that power.</p><p><br></p><p>They were too busy fending off the curses which had started increasing at an unbelievable rate. For now, they had decided to put aside their scheming and work together to get through this crisis.</p><p><br></p><p>Many were of the belief that some old Curse had ascended but the fact that the power was not felt after made people confused.</p><p><br></p><p>That, coupled with Gojo’s return and specifically guarding the area had deterred these people from taking any action against him and the students.</p><p><br></p><p>And Satoru took this opportunity to lay out some conditions for his continued services since they had already declared him as a Curse User before. So if they wanted his help, they must pay the price.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has that brat gone crazy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who does he think he is?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think that the Jujutsu world will bow to your wishes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are colluding with him too?”</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, there was commotion at the demand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arrest this man!” Someone commanded.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh inwardly.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, a voice sounded in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, I told you Sensei. There was no use. I should have directly erased them back then. Even when under such a condition, they still think more of themselves than the rest of the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gojo Satoru! Are you rebelling?” One of them shouted, being at the end of their wits.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rebelling? Hahahahahaha that’s the funniest thing I have heard in such a long time.”</p><p><br></p><p>Satoru faced them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rebelling against whom? You people?” He walked towards them. “Who exactly are you people? Just a bunch of living fossils too far beyond their expiry date.” He mocked. “Oh yes. I remember.You people are the higher ups of the Jujutsu community. So scary. But then again, I am a Curse User, right? So we are enemies. Why are we even arguing then? Let’s get this over with.” he turned back. “Will you be staying, Sensei?”</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh and walked out and a moment later, blasts occurred inside the room and Satoru walked out.</p><p><br></p><p>“The trash has been cleaned. Please choose some proper ones next time. I recommend you and old man Gakuganji.” With that said, he just disappeared from the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, several of the students came rushing at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and walked forward to take control of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude - Sukuna’s Isekai Adventures -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He threw one of the books aside in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>Useless.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything left here was useless.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe the only good thing was in the underground….the black mud which attracted him like nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>Even just touching the mud made his power increase by a bit but the increase was not stable.</p><p><br></p><p>So he tried to research more about what it was but there wasn’t anything left in this accursed place that could tell him.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, the boy was somehow binding himself onto his soul. Was it his Innate Technique?</p><p><br></p><p>If this goes on, he will have a harder time controlling him in the future. Even now, the resistance by the boy increases.</p><p><br></p><p>He needed to find a safer body to explore this world.</p><p><br></p><p>A whole new world.</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t help but smile.</p><p><br></p><p>What a discovery.</p><p><br></p><p>And that Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>The owner of that place….he could travel to all these worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, he had a plan. The ideal vessel for his soul….the Restaurant owner, Silas.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad that place was protected by Satoru Gojo right now and the current him was not in a state to fight him or he would have slaughtered everyone of them when he had spied them destroying his fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>But now, with his fingers destroyed, he needed to find other ways to strengthen himself from this world before he could attempt such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Until then, he couldn’t go near that place. Not to mention, there were lots of dangers in this world as well.</p><p><br></p><p>He could sense that enormous aura on the other side of the town.</p><p><br></p><p>So, what should he do?</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the black mud in front of him and then with a smile, stabbed his heart, plucking and throwing it out.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy inside his mind started to shout in panic at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Appearing in the shared mindscape, he smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shut up and listen to me if you want a way to live.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of the ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zouken was toyed with by both Gojo and Kisuke.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A fitting death according to me for such a guy.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sakura awakens and the JJK world is in chaos.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Gojo finally decided to take things into his own hands.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And so did Sukuna.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Silas is still trying to figure out what his Innate Cursed technique is.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On the other hand, Zeref is here and Silas’ life is going to get turned upside down.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The dragon maid is also in the house.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And amidst all this, Shadow-sama blends in as usual.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The story is picking up pace finally.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see what is happening in other words next.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Look forward to the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>
