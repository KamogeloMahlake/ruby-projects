        <p><strong>My Isekai Rom-com Life is weird!!!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 1: New Life, New Job</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- ??? -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In my previous life, I had often wondered how getting isekai’d would feel if it ever happened to me. Would it be the same as being summoned to another world to fight a Demon King or something?</p><p><br></p><p>All that cliche about joining the adventurer’s guild, building a party and fighting some world ending danger….yeah, the thought turned me off.</p><p><br></p><p>Man, if I wanted a next life, I wanted something where I could relax or chill. I had no intention of risking my life as those isekai protagonists.</p><p><br></p><p>Why should I go and fight their battles for them?</p><p><br></p><p>They should go and do that themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the only thing which appealed to me in those stories was the harem part. I mean, I was a normal guy after all.</p><p><br></p><p>The reality however is that isekai is….extremely boring.</p><p><br></p><p>At least my Isekai Adventures was not one which could be made into a novel.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, I didn’t even have any of the so-called cheat powers which were the staple of the Isekai anime troupes.</p><p><br></p><p>I did have the memories of my previous life so I guess it was not all bad.</p><p><br></p><p>It did help me stay ahead of most of the people of my age and excel at anything I tried. I couldn’t call my life very great but it wasn’t bad either. If anything it was the prime example of average.</p><p><br></p><p>I was born in a lower middle class family with loving parents. They have supported me by sending me to study in a big city despite having financial difficulties of their own which is more than I was expecting. For this I am and will be eternally grateful to them.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I wasn’t even sure that this world was different from my own because the places in this world were all the same, similar history as well.</p><p><br></p><p>My only clue was the people with different colours of hair and eyes which looked to be straight out of some anime.</p><p><br></p><p>In my last life, I was a businessman dealing mainly with stocks and while that life brought me money, it also distanced me away from my friends and family due to my busy schedule. In the end, when I was suffering from terminal cancer in a hospital, the only people who even came to visit me were my parents.</p><p><br></p><p>None of those so-called friends or business partners showed up for me.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, my dad who was just a simple teacher had his students visit him regularly even when he had retired. They talked and laughed with him and shared their achievements with him whenever they had time.</p><p><br></p><p>Back then I had often rolled my eyes at such things. My thoughts being that only money helped in the end but I was wrong. I didn’t want to experience such a life ever again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was during those times that I watched anime and manga to spend my time, taking some time to spend on myself and my family and I won’t lie, despite my inevitable end coming near, those were some of the most peaceful days of my life.</p><p><br></p><p>My experience with the stocks and the possible future knowledge helped me earn quite a bit on the side so I decided to follow my father’s example and became….a teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what brought me to this place.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the gates of the posh looking building that was the Kuoh Academy, in a small town near Tokyo.</p><p><br></p><p>The town was quiet and peaceful and the school was offering a well paying job so I accepted it.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and saw the students, mainly girls staring at me as I walked towards the school building.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, nine out of ten students were girls.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuoh Academy had turned co-ed this year after being a girls school for years and so the numbers were understandable. In fact, I was one of the first male teachers to be recruited here.</p><p><br></p><p>The funny thing was that I could see the blushes on the faces of the girls as they giggled and talked among themselves while spying looks at me.</p><p><br></p><p>….teenagers.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, their behaviour was also understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>I was my age. In fact, I was only a few years older than some of these girls at twenty one years of age.</p><p><br></p><p>My experiences and knowledge of my previous life helped me complete my studies very quickly. For this reason, I was far younger than any other teacher in this school. Many of these girls could mistake me for a senior if I were to wear their school uniform.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, where is the Principal’s Office?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and spotted a girl in glasses. She had long black hair and a no nonsense look on her face. Perhaps the most eye-catching thing about her were her eyes. Heterochromia, quite a rare trait.</p><p><br></p><p>But the thing which had attracted me was the badge on her chest. The vice president of the Student Council.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?” I called out to her.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was a bit surprised by my call and looked at me. “Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Could you please point me in the direction of the Principal’s office?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Are you new to this school? A transfer student?” She asked, making me chuckle.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked confused so I answered her question.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am indeed new to this school but I am not a student. My name is Takashi Furukawa and I am a new teacher in this school. This is my first day.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened and she quickly bowed. “My apologies, Furukawa-Sensei.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t mind. Now, could you please show me the way?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Let me lead you, I am going to the Student Council room in the same direction.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Miss….?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsubaki, Shinra Tsubaki.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Shinra then.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl led me towards the Student Council room while I questioned her about some things about the school and the girl herself.</p><p><br></p><p>I came to know that she was a second year student who was elected as the Vice President of the Kuoh Academy by the student’s votes, a great achievement. Student Council President and Vice President were generally elected from among the third years. In fact even the President was a second year student. I guess they must be quite famous. And from the looks and frequent greetings of the students towards the girl and even some of the stink eyed looks thrown towards me from the male students, I could tell that my guess was not that far off the mark.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that she was quite well liked by everyone in the school.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the Principal’s office soon enough.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Miss Shinra.” I nodded towards the girl who bowed towards me formally.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, well mannered girl. Nice.</p><p><br></p><p>Minutes later, I was having a meeting with the Principal who was impressed with my academic achievements and was more than glad to have me as a teacher in the school. He welcomed me and gave me a run down of my duties and even personally brought me to introduce me to the rest of the teachers.</p><p><br></p><p>It turned out that the previous teacher had to leave for a different country after marriage and the post was vacant.</p><p><br></p><p>That would explain the urgent hiring, I guess.</p><p><br></p><p>The school had a Middle School part attached to it but I was assigned to teach in the High School classes.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus started my life as a Teacher in Kuoh Academy.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope I can relax and work here.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes twitched as I looked at the one in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry, I think I misheard you. Could you repeat that again?” I asked, truly doubting her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will you please go out with me?” The girl repeated again, unbothered by my question but I could see the blush on her face. She was embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how did it come to this?</p><p><br></p><p>I mean sure I had received a love letter a day ago but for someone to come out and say it to my face like this was astonishing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Gremory, if you are being forced by someone to do this, you can tell me. I will help you out. But if this is a game of dare or something similar, I will treat this time as a joke and request that you do not make a habit of this.” I replied in a calm and collected tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“No! I am not being forced by anyone nor is this a game. I am asking you out because I l-like you.” She replied blushing.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. While I am flattered by your feelings towards me, I will have to politely decline your request. I am sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her mouth opened in shock as if it was really that shocking for a teacher to reject romantic advances from a student.</p><p><br></p><p>Alright, I will accept that she was beautiful. Actually screw that, she was downright gorgeous, especially the crimson hair framing her perfect face and a figure which was completely beyond her years. Let me repeat, Rias Gremory was drop dead gorgeous. I could see why she was the most famous girl in the school, one of the so-called four great Onee-sama’s of the school, a title which I couldn’t for the life of me wrap my head around.</p><p><br></p><p>But a relationship between teacher and a student was frowned upon by society and was completely forbidden in most places too.</p><p><br></p><p>I have no intention of pushing my nose in such a mess.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rias Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She felt her face burning from embarrassment as she hurried back to the Old School Building and locked herself in her room and screamed in her pillow, letting out all her embarrassment. She could still feel her ears get hot when she recalled the incident from minutes ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank Satans, there was no one else around due to the barrier she had set or she wouldn’t be able to show her face around the school for a few days.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ughhh, it better be worth it.” She raised and a virtual screen appeared in front of her eyes. Written on the screen was the quest.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorial Quest: Baby Steps</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Every long journey begins with baby steps. To get into someone’s heart you have to state your intention first. </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Objective: Ask your teacher, Takashi Furukawa out on a date.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bonus Objective: Have him accept.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Demonic Power doubled, Basic Answers</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bonus Reward: +5 Levels in the Power of Destruction</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Failure: Become known as Switch Princess(Boob Princess), End of the World.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: No magic affecting the mind should be used on the target.

The same one from all those manga, novels and anime she had seen and read. What were the chances?</p><p><br></p><p>For a moment nothing happened and she was disappointed but before she could think of anything else, she felt a change in her body.</p><p><br></p><p>Her Demonic Power surged uncontrollably and it kept on rising before stopping after a certain point.</p><p><br></p><p>Stunned, she checked her state to find that her demonic power had indeed doubled.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is….real?” A whisper came out of her lips because even when the proof was right in front of her, she was finding it hard to believe.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t know anything which could increase someone’s demonic power like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Her mind went back to how all this had started, two days ago.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Flashback -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She had woken up to see a screen in front of her eyes and thought she was still sleeping and all of it was probably a dream of some kind.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Do you want to have the power to change your fate?”</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Yes/No”</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In her sleepy state, she clicked the yes option and closed her eyes again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only when her eyes opened after some time and the screen had not disappeared that she was completely roused from her sleepy state and stared at the screen in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Welcome, Rias Gremory</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations on gaining a chance to change your fate.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Was someone using magic on her while she was asleep?</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly used several spells to check herself and even tried to dispel the magic but to no avail.</p><p><br></p><p>Every check showed a negative result.</p><p><br></p><p>A pit grew in her stomach and she hurried out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Akeno! Where are you?” She called out her best friend and queen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, what is it?” Akeno asked, coming out of her room.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you see this? She tried to speak but couldn’t. Her body would just not move at her command. It terrified her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://“Umm….no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Umm….no</a>. I….was just wondering if you have any contracts today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. In fact I do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, well, good luck on that.” She quickly replied and returned back to her room.</p><p><br></p><p>Back inside her room, she tried to understand the situation properly.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of Akeno, she couldn’t utter a word when she tried to speak about the screen but was free to speak when she was talking about something else.</p><p><br></p><p>She suddenly got an idea and got a pen and a paper and tried to write about the screen on the paper and sure enough her hands refused to move.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of magic is this?</p><p><br></p><p>That day she skipped school and tried everything she could to understand this….whatever it was.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the day she had come to the conclusion that this was like no other type of magic she had seen or heard about. She couldn’t find a single clue about it even in the DevilNet. Was it even magic?</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, out of every option, she tried to explore the screen to find out more.</p><p><br></p><p>The layout of the entire thing was quite simple. In fact, it was similar to a game.</p><p><br></p><p>First there was the status page in which information about her was given.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Rias Gremory</strong></p><p><strong>Rank: Tier 4</strong></p><p><strong>Skills: Power of Destruction (Lv. 32), Devil Magic(Lv. 29), Mind Magic(Lv. 29),....</strong></p><p><strong>Quests</strong></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Level 32 Power of Destruction?</p><p><br></p><p>How were these powers scaled?</p><p><br></p><p>What did Tier 4 mean?</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately there were no answers.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as she was thinking this, a new screen appeared in front of her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorial Quest: Baby Steps</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Every long journey begins with baby steps.

Please work harder.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Takashi -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I reached home, still wondering about the incident with Rias Gremory.</p><p><br></p><p>Two months had passed since I had joined this school and my time till now had been smooth sailing.</p><p><br></p><p>The students here were well behaved and actually took their studies seriously. Kuoh Academy was actually one of the premiere institutes of the country so this much was expected. Perhaps the only thing which embarrassed me a bit were the looks the girls threw me sometimes. Dammit, I looked too young.</p><p><br></p><p>For this reason, I started growing a beard to look a bit older but this only made them fawn even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, these girls are too horny for their own good sometimes. That said, they had never come out and done something like this</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head, shaking off these thoughts. “Maybe, it was just them playing some kind of game?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, I couldn’t think of any other reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, what to eat tonight?” I sighed, facing a much bigger problem than some teenage girl confessing her feelings to me. What to cook for dinner?</p><p><br></p><p>I, despite the experiences of both my lives, have always sucked at cooking.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I did try to learn something to cook for myself but the salt and pepper always rebelled in my hands and fire always urged me to try my fire bending skills on it….and I, being the weak mortal that I am, gave in to those feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>And what can I say, the few pieces of chicken legs never stood a chance against my peerless fire bending skills and got reduced to ashes.</p><p><br>Sigh….such is the loneliness of the strong. Fated to forever live a life where they cannot enjoy a meal made by their own hands….except cereal. Boiling milk was no problem.</p><p><br></p><p>But cereal for dinner was not something I could eat.</p><p><br></p><p>I was new to this place so I hadn’t hired any maids to cook. I guess I will have to go out and eat. I couldn’t stand eating instant ramen another day.</p><p><br></p><p>With that in mind, I put on my coat and left my house.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Kuoh was a very quiet place, away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo and yet not isolated so there were amenities of all types available nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around the place and found a small restaurant nearby and had my dinner there.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the time, I decided to go out for a walk to look around the place and know where everything was.</p><p><br></p><p>Deciding to rest for a while in the park before going back, I heard something nearby and turned to the side to see a black cat sitting on the bench and staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey there. Are you out for a walk after dinner too?” I joked, slowly going forward to pat its head. To my surprise, the cat didn’t shy away and actually enjoyed the ministrations.</p><p><br></p><p>The cat’s reactions made me smile as she tried to paw at my hand when I tried tickling her. I guess I was always a cat person after all.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked the cat up and brought her to my lap, playing with her. “Such a good girl, aren’t you?” Is she domesticated?</p><p><br></p><p>Because with how relaxed she was with me, she didn’t seem to be a wild cat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get lost?” But then again, there are no collars on her.</p><p><br></p><p>The cat was however not interested in any of this and just pawed at my hands, still busy with playing.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if you have nowhere to go, would you like to come with me?” I asked and the cat suddenly stopped and stared at me, her golden eyes staring into mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Wait….she understood?</p><p><br></p><p>Was this really a stray cat and not domesticated?</p><p><br></p><p>Eh, in any case, I will just return her in case I find anyone searching for her.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a chance that something might happen to her if I left her alone outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good then. Come with me. I have milk and cookies. Oh God, that sounds so wrong.” I laughed at my own joke.</p><p><br></p><p>The cat seemed to laugh in my arms too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you like my joke? Sigh, such a good girl. Not many seem to appreciate my sense of humour. Alright come, let’s get you home for a bath and some food.”</p><p><br></p><p>I carried the cat and walked back towards my home. On the way, I made sure to pick up something for her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, what do I call you? Hmm, let me think. Okay, how about Yoruichi?” I suddenly remembered the figure of one of my favourite anime characters from my previous life.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nyaa~”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yoruichi is one of my favourite anime characters. She was actually a Shinigami and could turn into a cat….” And with that I walked back home talking to her all the way.</p><p><br></p><p>Looks like I won’t be living alone in my home anymore.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuroka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the figure sleeping in front of her and considered what to do next.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything started when a screen appeared in front of her all of a sudden few days ago.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you want power to change your fate?” It had asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She had considered it a joke or some kind from that Monkey Bikou and agreed to it and that’s how she was stuck in all this mess.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorial Quest - Baby Steps</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

The meal was good and she was tired from all the emotional stress due to this System.</p><p><br></p><p>She dismissed the barrier and went back to the room to take her nap on the pillow which was set aside for her.

Here’s the food for lunch. I will try to get back early. Till then, stay safe.” I went closer and kissed her head. “By the way, I think this house might be haunted. I might have heard a girl’s moans last night….or maybe it’s the neighbours being loud. See ya.”</p><p><br></p><p>The cat pawed playfully at my face because of the joke and I laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Having someone to live with me is not bad.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“And then we need to add the two roots to get the answer. Does anyone have any doubts till this point?” I turned around and asked the class.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a look over the class, I looked at the students copying the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>I even spotted some girls throwing me looks as usual but by now I had grown used to these. It was just that when I looked at a familiar redhead, she lowered her head blushing.</p><p><br></p><p>Man….this was awkward.</p><p><br></p><p>Teaching the girl who asked me out on a date yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>At least she hadn’t done anything like that today.</p><p><br></p><p>The bell rang and the time for the class was over.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the lunch break and I remembered that I had forgotten to buy a bento today. Getting things ready for Yoru-chan took more time than I had realised, finally leaving me in a hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I have to wait till school is over.</p><p><br></p><p>The other teachers were eating in the staff room and I didn’t want to feel awkward as the only one not eating so I decided to take a walk around the school. Maybe the library would be a good place.</p><p><br></p><p>With this in mind, I went to the library.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuoh Academy Library was huge and yet had a tranquil atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>There were not many people in the library at that time either as most of them were out to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up a book and within moments was lost in reading.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, I sensed someone sitting in front of me and looked up.</p><p><br></p><p>Purple eyes stared back at me.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a moment to realise who the girl smiling at me was.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno Himejima, the second most famous girl in this school. Actually, hold on a moment, who makes these rankings again?</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t they have anything better to do?</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara sensei, why are you sitting alone in the library? Aren’t you eating your lunch?” She asked me with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Himejima, right. I am not alone in the library….” I started speaking but realised midway that others had left the library when I wasn’t paying attention so I changed my statement in between. “You are here too.”</p><p><br></p><p>She giggled at my statement. “That’s true I guess. By the way, are you not eating lunch?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I….didn’t have the time to get lunch in a hurry today. I will eat something later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s no good, you know. Taking care of your health is important. After all, I know many people who would be very sad if their favourite teacher gets ill. You know what? Here, I cooked extra today. Please share some with me.” She said as she opened a bento box on the table. When did she bring out the bento box without me realising?</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for your offer, Miss Himejima but I couldn’t possibly….” I tried denying but by then she had already separated some for me and if I were honest….the food looked delicious. It was probably the best looking meal I had seen since leaving home for work.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently my stomach agreed too as it made a gurgling sound at the sight of the food.</p><p><br></p><p>This made the girl in front of me giggle and I couldn’t help but blush at the untimely rebellion of my stomach. In my defence, the food looked awesome.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then don’t mind if I take a bite.” I thanked her and picked up the chopsticks and took a bite of the food. “Oh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How is it? Did you like it, Sensei?” She asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is amazing.” I took another bite.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? I am pleased that you like my cooking.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait what! You cooked this?” I asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, was this girl a genius chef or did I just suck that bad at cooking?</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I cook my bento myself.” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….you are seriously talented, Miss Himejima. This is probably the second best cooking I have eaten in my whole life.” I praised.</p><p><br></p><p>“What only second? Who is the first then? Your girlfriend?” She teased.</p><p><br></p><p>“I rolled my eyes. “Interested in those things already? Then again, I guess you are at that age now. But for your answer, no. My favourite cook is my mother.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. You are very close to your Okaa-sama, Sensei?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. She has always supported me in my dreams. I would be an ungrateful twerp if I didn’t like them.” I replied as I took another bite of the food. “This is seriously good. You would make your future husband a lucky man, Miss Himejima.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara ara.” She laughed with a hand on her cheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>I finished half of her food without realising while we talked when another person entered the room.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked back and it was Akeno who spoke. “Rias!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Akeno and….sensei?” She asked surprised and then looked around the room. “What are you doing here, Akeno?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I saw sensei reading alone in the library and decided to talk to him. Turns out that sensei didn’t have his lunch today so I offered him some of mine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei didn’t have lunch?” She asked, suddenly looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….I didn’t have time to buy something today.” I answered awkwardly. The incident from yesterday came to the forefront of my mind again.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried not to let it bother me as the girl sat down in front of me, beside Akeno and put up a bento box on the table. “Then sensei, please have some of mine too. I was offered some cookies from some juniors and I don’t think I will be able to eat everything.” She opened the box and slid it towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>This box, while not even close to Akeno’s bento, was also good.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, I was already eating one student’s lunch so it would be awkward if I rejected hers….thinking of this, I, a bit hesitantly took a bite of her food.</p><p><br></p><p>As I ate the food, I saw the girl’s face brighten up.</p><p><br></p><p>Ignore it.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls talked to me for a while and it was almost the end of the lunch break so we decided to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way back, I heard some commotion and saw a group of students chasing three boys with shinai in their hands.</p><p><br></p><p>What the hell?!</p><p><br></p><p>Are they fighting on school premises?</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly ran there to see what was going on and the two girls followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls had the three boys surrounded between them and it looked like they were going to give them the beating of their lifetime.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here?” I asked, stopping the girls from attacking as they looked towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Furukawa-Sensei!”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the brown haired girl. “Murayama, correct? What is going on here? What are you girls doing? Why are you attacking these boys?” I asked, seriously. This was the first time I had encountered this kind of behaviour in this school.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered these students.</p><p><br></p><p>They were mostly first years.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, these….these perverts were peeping at us in the changing room.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!” I was taken aback at the accusation and looked at the three boys who were scared shit at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked. These kinds of allegations were quite serious. It was better to confirm it before taking action.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sensei. It’s not the first time either. This year alone, it’s the sixth time we have caught them doing so. Who knows how many times they have escaped without being caught.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....hah!” I was actually stunned and at a loss of words. “Sixth time?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you girls complain to the teachers?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We told the Student Council and they said they would take care of the matter but these three always return back to their usual behaviour. They are infamous in the school as the Perverted Trio.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a vein bulge on my forehead at the words of the girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Don’t worry. Let me take care of them. Also, I understand the anger and frustration of you all for the breach of your privacy but please, resorting to violence is not the way society works. Don’t degrade yourself for this.” I reassured them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sensei.” The girls looked a bit reluctant but still moved back.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked in front of the boys and I realised that one of them was not looking at me even as I stood in front of him and was instead staring behind me. It took me a moment to realise that he was looking at Rias and Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p>“Boobs.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Did this guy….just say what I think he did?</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the reaction of the girls, especially as Rias crossed her arms a bit defensively while the rest looked at them as if they were lower than bugs, it seems that I was not mishearing things.</p><p><br></p><p>This confirms it. These guys….they are really the culprits.</p><p><br></p><p>I moved slightly, standing right in front of the two girls, covering them from his gaze and looked at the enraged students.</p><p><br></p><p>“I promise that I will take care of this matter. You all are here to learn with the peace of your mind. If you don’t feel protected here, it’s the fault of us teachers. I will definitely give you all a satisfactory answer.” I reassured them again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Sensei.”</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards both Rias and Akeno. “Thank you for today but I have to take care of this matter first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please take your time, sensei.” They nodded and moved aside. </p><p><br></p><p>Finally looking at the three guys, I ordered in a cold tone. “<em>Follow me</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>The first place I led them was to the Teacher’s office and asked around if any of the teacher’s knew about the whole mess they had been creating.</p><p><br></p><p>It turns out that the teacher’s didn’t know everything and had left everything to the Student Council because the Student Council President had reassured them that she could take care of this matter….which seemed utterly stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>As this was not even the first offence, I had their parents called over to the school and personally had them suspended for a month.</p><p><br></p><p>Even their parents seemed to have given up.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt kinda sorry for them but then again, if they couldn’t even teach their kids basic manners, then some fault for it lies in them as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Next up, I called for one of the staff to help fix the place where the fools were peeping from. Seriously, how was there a hole in the wall and if so, why does no one fix it?</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, when everything was done, it was time to deal with the Student Council.</p><p><br></p><p>I was seriously pissed at these brats.</p><p><br></p><p>I knocked at the door of the Student Council Room and the door was opened by the girl who had shown me to the Principal’s office on my first day. Tsubaki Shinra.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is Miss Shitori in there? I have something to talk to her about.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, yes. Please come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The office looked like a teacher’s room. In fact, it was actually better than the teacher’s room. What even was the work of the Student Council for them to need something like this at their disposal?</p><p><br></p><p>But let’s not get off topic.</p><p><br></p><p>The students in the room stood up and greeted me and I nodded back.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have had a very tiring day today so let’s get straight to the point, Miss Shitori. What did the Student Council do to deal with the case of the three first year boys who were caught peeping on the girls of the Kendo Club?”</p><p><br></p><p>They were taken aback by my question but answered nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were punished by extra duty after school.” She answered, straightening her glasses, something which was unnecessary as it was already perfectly in place.</p><p><br></p><p>“I assume that was the first time you encountered this problem. While a bit light, I accept your reasoning. Then what about the next four times?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br>“What did you do the next four times they were caught doing the same. I was informed that the students had complained to the Student Council. Did you get the complaints or were they lying?” I asked, staring at her, looking for any hints of lies.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were punished accordingly.” She said after some time.</p><p><br></p><p>“‘Accordingly’ is a very flexible word, Miss Shitori. It varies from person to person. I would like to know the exact details of their punishment because if they were not bothered to correct their behaviour, it was evident that your methods didn’t work. Did you inform the teachers about this?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….took permission from the teachers and they allowed me to deal with the matter.” She defended.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many times?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was only told that you informed them once. Only once were they told that such a thing had happened on the school premises. I think you misunderstood something. When he gave you the permission to deal with this matter, it was only for that once. Then what of the next four times. Why did you not inform the teachers of this matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I assure you….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Assurances don’t run the school, Miss Shitori. Actions do. I have heard some good things about you from the teachers so I will give you this advice. You are here to learn, so learn. If something is beyond your capabilities, ask the person in charge to deal with it. Knowing when to pull back is also a skill necessary in management. In this case, you, by not going to the required authority on time, the problem which could have been solved much earlier lasted longer. Tell me, are you perhaps friends with the boys?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I had thought of several reasons why the incidents were never reported and this was one of the top ones.</p><p><br></p><p>“Furukawa-sensei, are you insinuating that I am covering for the boys?” She asked hotly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yes. Look at it from my position and tell me if that doesn’t sound probable?” I asked. “Or if you have any better reason, give me one?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t want to escalate the matter to not affect the reputation of the school and ruin the lives of those boys.” She replied, angry at the accusation but this reply just made the vein in my head throb even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and tried to control my temper and was finding it extremely hard to do so. “Tell me something, Miss Shitori….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”<br><br></p><p>“Are you stupid!” I bursted out. They were taken aback at my outburst but I didn’t give them any chances of taking back and went on.</p><p><br></p><p>“You think covering for those fools is saving the reputation of the school?! Peeping is a crime punishable by law in this country, do you know that?” I asked and saw her mouth opening but she closed it again. “Well, do you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then pray tell me, what would happen if these same students got the impression that their behaviour was not that serious, and started doing this outside the school and got caught? Or would those girls chasing and beating other students in broad daylight be a good thing? Would that bring great laurels to the school’s reputation?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her mouth opened like a fish and was about to reply but I raised my hand and shut her up.</p><p><br></p><p>“And pray tell me this, if the problem continues like it has been, do you think the girls of the Kendo Club or any others who were the victims of their crimes are just going to keep quiet? That they won’t complain to their parents and the word that Kuoh Academy has a deplorable security for girls won’t spread? There are so many things wrong with your reasoning that I could stand here all day and lecture you and we still won’t be done.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath calming myself down.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was told by some teachers that you are planning to open a school of your own and wanted to learn management by the means of this position. Well, if this is your attitude then you would perhaps make for a great businesswoman but I promise you that you would be an incredibly shitty educator.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei!”<br><br></p><p>“What, Miss Shitori? Am I wrong?” I challenged and she actually backed down. “You were selected by the votes of the students of this school, correct?” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“They selected you because they trusted you enough to protect them and help maintain a safe environment for them to learn. But here you are completely ignoring the very students who put their faith in you….to do whatever it is that you were doing. You did nothing to solve their problems. Hell, you all probably didn’t even investigate this matter. Those three were peeping through a hole in the changing room….all six times from the same place. The least you could have done was get someone to get it fixed.
