        <p><strong>Chapter 28</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 28: Project Regicide (Part -3)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The silence in the room was deafening.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later, Rizevim realised what he did and his eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p>He was completely quiet as the gears of his brain turned.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he started laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t a condescending laugh or even a sarcastic one but rather he was actually laughing happily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha.” He laughed crazily. “I see, I see. So that’s how it was hahahahaha. To think that you… Hahahaha. Well played indeed.” He walked towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Merlin, Gretel, Ingvild.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, my King.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If he takes another step forward… kill him.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahahaha it seems you have learned jokes in the afterlife. Do you really think <em>they</em> can stop me?”</p><p><br></p><p>His question was answered when the combined auras of all three fell on him.</p><p><br></p><p>While still a bit behind the madman himself, they could very well take an arm off him should any of them go all out. All three of them… could kill any devil alive at this point.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire dimension shook as I created a barrier around me, protecting Lilith in my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>A frown appeared on his face as he realised their strengths.</p><p><br></p><p>Right at this moment another aura burst in the midst.</p><p><br></p><p>I glanced towards the source.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will have to request that you all cease from fighting in this place. There is too much evidence and unrelated people here.” To his credit, even in this situation, he didn’t have any change of expressions. His voice was firm and there was not one hint of fear in his voice. Worthy of a Satan.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad today I will get what I want.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned my eyes to look at Rizevim who understood the situation was not in his favour.</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled and raised hands in a mock surrender. “So scary. Everyone is getting serious but I see that you are not in the mood for a reunion right now. I will leave you to Mother. Let’s have fun the next time we meet. Oh who am I kidding, we’re totally going to have a <em>blast</em>.” He laughed again before turning around and walking out but not before throwing a look at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him quietly as he walked away.</p><p><br></p><p>Every fibre of my being wanted to tear him apart with my bare hands right now but today was not the day for it. Everyone had worked very hard to make our current plan a success. I will not let it get wasted due to a moment of impulsiveness.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked out of the place too, me carrying Lilith in my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>As I brought her out of the mansion, I found myself staring at a massive crowd in front of me. The entire sky was full as was the ground as far as eyes could see.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils of all shapes and sizes, of all classes had gathered in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>In the lead were the heads of almost every house among the Pillars, some standing while others kneeled just as I stepped out.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene looked completely unreal.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that the ones who were knocked out by Merlin and the others were all removed while my people, over twenty thousand devils, had gathered on the right side under the command of several of my immediate team members.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the years, we had gathered a decent amount of soldiers. After all, two hands can’t do the work of a thousand.</p><p><br></p><p>Among this, around fifty thousand were devils and thirty thousand were other species. We were the smallest group among the Abrahmic factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Old Satan faction which was just above us in terms of numbers had around six times more people than us.</p><p><br></p><p>But what we missed in quantity, we made up for in terms of quality.</p><p><br></p><p>Each and every one of these twenty thousand soldiers were….high class at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>This level of strength put us above even the Fallen Angels and almost on part with the current Devil government.</p><p><br></p><p>But all of this could be changed in just an instant.</p><p><br></p><p>All I needed to do was… show my face once in front of the underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t lie to Sirzechs when I said that the current government was a sinking ship.</p><p><br></p><p>The people of the underworld wanted another option but they didn’t have any.</p><p><br></p><p>And the Old Satan faction… were never the representatives of the original Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the main reasons the people of the underworld chose the current government was because the original Satans had passed away and their descendants wanted to continue the war which would have led to the extinction of the devil race.</p><p><br></p><p>But all of that changes when a true Satan gets involved.</p><p><br></p><p>And right now was a similar situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I however didn’t address them but turned towards Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is Zekram?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is being detained for investigations.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Where?” I repeated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Goetia Prison. Asmodeus Territory.” he answered after a pause.</p><p><br></p><p>“Merlin… let’s go to the Goetia Prison.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief as he started to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>She was expecting him to appear but not at that time.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, it would have been a catastrophe if Rizevim had taken Lilith away.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she didn’t know why… he seemed completely different from what they had seen a few hours ago.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if she was watching a completely different person and the only thing common between them was their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the crowd in front of her, not even fathoming how messed up the situation was. First they find Lilith was alive and captured under the Bael estate and now a Lucifer look alike walks through the front door.</p><p><br></p><p>But what happened next was even more surprising. She didn’t think she would ever see a day when someone so blatantly threatened Rizevim and forced him to retreat.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, maybe it was not an empty threat either. With the power each of his subordinates were throwing out, they could have ripped Rizevim apart… only the entire Bael Territory and a few surrounding territories would have been erased from the face of the Underworld as well.</p><p><br></p><p>At least the younger Lucifer seemed more amicable and they could negotiate some terms with him.</p><p><br></p><p>However all her hopes were dashed as Ajuka stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Ajuka who interrupted them. "Zekram bael is still being investigated. We cannot allow anyone to meet him."</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way they could fight a war in these conditions. With the amount of things which were revealed today, if a fight starts….there would be another Civil War for sure.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to the deeds of the Great King faction and Zekram, people were incensed at them but also the current government and the Satans for not stopping them in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>And if the literal miniature version of Lucifer were to get angry at this time…</p><p><br></p><p>Surely as expected, the crowd started roaring at this. Thousands of auras rose up at the same time representing all their moods.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost every Pillar House was among the crowd not to mention the thousands of devils who had come with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Each one of them was High Class or above. How in the seven heavens were they hiding such a force? </p><p><br></p><p>She was about to go forward to calm down the matter when Damien raised his hand and… the entire crowd stopped, their auras restrained.</p><p><br></p><p>Her words were swallowed back.</p><p><br></p><p>Even as prepared as she was, she felt a shiver run down her spine at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>As a child, she was told a lot about the Satans, the powers they had, the people they commanded, how they had laid the foundation of the Devil race from the start.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially the creator of their race. Her parents talked about him even centuries after his death with utter respect.</p><p><br></p><p>He might be the embodiment of all the world’s evil for the rest of the world but for them, he was the equivalent of what the Father of Angels was to Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>And today… she was able to see this with her own eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, she had expected something like this before but… even in her wildest dream she didn’t imagine it would be something like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as she was going to go forward and diffuse the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien looked back at Ajuka, looking utterly calm.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked towards the sky as dark clouds started rolling over the skies as crimson red lightning thundered all over the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>The worst part was that she didn’t sense any kind of magical power causing this phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if the Underworld itself was raging at the insult to its king.</p><p><br></p><p>The young man in front of her was giving her the feeling similar to what Sirzechs gives off in his True Form. It was an instinctual fear of death when looking at something overwhelmingly stronger than oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>But unlike Sirzechs who transformed into a mass of mindless destruction, this one’s essence was control….and majesty.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like someone was compressing an entire ocean into a drop of water, waiting to unleash all that at a moment's notice. The amount of power which makes one realise how small they actually were.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….and who will stop me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere chilled.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium quickly went ahead and explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t wish to fight or stop you. We are just trying to keep the matter from getting any worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>Damien looked at him with a slightly unamused expression on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you again?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I am the one chosen by the council to represent the Underworld as the current Asmodeus.” He replied, carefully choosing the words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….good for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards the crowd and questioned loudly. “Who is the one investigating Zekram Bael?”</p><p><br></p><p>She took advantage of the situation and stepped forward. “We are not trying to protect Zekram by any means. Please try to understand that we don’t want this to result in a war. It’s just that too much information was brought to light today. We just want to make sure we don’t miss anything as well as address everything he might have done. This is just the standard procedure.”</p><p><br></p><p>He just looked at her with the same bone chilling blue eyes and no expressions.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was not my question.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>It took her a second to realise what he had asked. “I am the one who was assigned the investigation of the crimes of Zekram Bael." She answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“You speak of standard procedures… Was a standard procedure followed when Cleria Belial was accused? If I remember correctly, the charges against her were similar, treachery… although, I don’t think there was any real evidence suggesting anything else except her relationship with a priest. I believe the job of investigating such an accusation is the responsibility of the one sitting on the throne?” he questioned and she winced.</p><p><br></p><p>Another one of Zekram’s actions.</p><p><br></p><p>“And before you try to blame it on Zekram or those involved in it, do remember that you all were also among the ones who had a say in it. A situation like hers could happen due to many reasons. Maybe she was trying to get information out of the priest or maybe she was just seducing the wielder of the Ame no Murakumo to the devil side, making him a member of her peerage. I believe some of the others here have members from the Church and the Fallen Angels… so why was standard procedure not followed for her? Tell me something… if it had been your little sister instead of Cleria Belial… would the standard procedure have been followed?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at all the Satans present, daring anyone to talk. She held her tongue when Sona was brought up.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are trying…”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you have tried enough. Now… just stand on the side and watch how it’s done.” he cut her off.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards the crowd. "But you are right about a single thing… Zekram is not just my criminal. So, in two hours there will be a public trial for Zekram Bael in The Lucifer's castle… I will personally be the judge."</p><p><br></p><p>She froze but he was not done. He looked towards the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>"If anyone has a problem, come forward."</p><p><br></p><p>She turned towards the crowd but not a single person moved.</p><p><br></p><p>There was someone who was going to step forward however.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>He has always been stubborn in a weird sort of way… however, before he could say anything, a hand fell on his shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the owner of the hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs?</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him were a few other people.</p><p><br></p><p>Chysis Gremory and a Twin tailed girl with Crimson hair similar to his but she didn't recognise her. The girl however was just looking towards Damien with fearful eyes, almost shivering lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly went forward and kneeled in front of him, not even daring to look up anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the ones behind him that made her pause.</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana Gremory?</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t she dead?</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Falbium who was looking at Damien with a heavy gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy in question then turned towards the twin tailed girl.</p><p><br></p><p>"I want Zekram there. Drag him there if you have to. Any questions?"</p><p><br></p><p>"N-n-none, my King."</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>With his words said, he walked forward, Lilith still in his arms.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd parted as he walked, several of the older devils, the same ones who were arrogant in front of them, kneeled, in front of him, not even daring to look up.</p><p><br></p><p>His subordinates followed behind him as Gretel Lucifuge stepped forward and a grey mist spread out from his body, covering everyone who followed. It took her a moment to realise what it was.</p><p><br></p><p>Dimension Lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Another Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how many of those did they have?</p><p><br></p><p>And Dimension Lost on her?</p><p><br></p><p>She was already nearly a Super Devil and to give a Longinus to her with her already crazy Space magic….</p><p><br></p><p>This was a level where she would be able to match even Sirzechs and Ajuka easily.</p><p><br></p><p>She suddenly had a dangerous premonition.</p><p><br></p><p>Did all of them have Sacred Gears?</p><p><br></p><p>Because this would be the fourth or fifth Longinus they have.</p><p><br></p><p>And then an even scarier thought came to her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Did he also…?</p><p><br></p><p>She looked towards the man in the lead as they walked into the mist in horror.</p><p><br></p><p>A few moments later, he and his subordinates all disappeared with the mist as the crowd erupted.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Sirzechs who shook his head and signalled them to walk somewhere private first.</p><p><br></p><p>Their peerages stayed behind to address the crowd while they went back inside.</p><p><br></p><p>She first went and gave Venelana a light hug. She was still confused but Venelana was a close friend to her family and has been like a family member to her since her childhood. Seeing her dead body had been tough for her too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, what is going on? Not that I am unhappy about it but how? I am pretty sure Lady Gremory was…  And who is she?” At last she pointed towards the girl with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka didn’t say anything but just watched from the side.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is… Runeas Gremory, my ancestor.”</p><p><br></p><p>Runeas?</p><p><br></p><p>The first Gremory?</p><p><br></p><p>Another one of the old ones?</p><p><br></p><p>But there were far more important things to consider right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“And Damien? What’s the deal with Damien Lucifer? Is he roleplaying as Lucifer to take advantage of the situation and take power? His attitude was…”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs face took on a complicated expression.</p><p><br></p><p>The answer came from somewhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mind your words, girl. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” Runeas Gremory snapped at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall was taken aback at the intensity of her words.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Sirzechs questioningly.</p><p><br></p><p>He answered nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien… is a reincarnation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Reincarnation? But who exactl…” Her words paused in between as she realised the meaning of the words… and a few seconds later the implications of the meaning and a chill ran down her spine.</p><p><br></p><p>At that point, only one word escaped her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fuck!”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the expressions of his friends. To be honest, he was not sure his own was any better when he figured everything out.</p><p><br></p><p>His mother’s death….had hit him harder than he ever thought it would. Perhaps the only reason he was able to hold his sanity was because Lord Bael was not in front of him and his family surrounded him at the moment and him changing into his True Form would have become a danger for them.</p><p><br></p><p>After Damien’s claim and the… miracle he had performed, really, there were no other words for what he did, he too had been stunned beyond disbelief.</p><p><br></p><p>As he collected himself, over the next few minutes, just as Damien had said, he tried to remember everything about him and sure enough a few things became obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>He had always insisted that he never lied… and that he was ‘The Devil’. In fact, he had almost rubbed it in everyone’s face and yet… the thought was so out of the way, it never even came to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure? But how can it be?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ancestor went to meet him to get his help and he said things only Lucifer knew. But I wanted to confirm his words so first I called someone who had been in contact with Damien the whole time… Azazel.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Flashback -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He waited with bated breath as the call connected. At this point, he didn’t even know what he was thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>The things which had happened in the last half an hour had made him question everything he had known yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien was Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>Not the descendant but the actual Lucifer himself.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew for sure that he was created by the Old Satan faction from the blood of the two previous Satans but this…</p><p><br></p><p>The call connected and Azazel's voice sounded from the other end of the Magic Circle.</p><p><br></p><p>"I think you should be concentrating on the affairs around you rather than calling me at such a time, Sirzechs."</p><p><br></p><p>"This is a very important matter, Azazel."</p><p><br></p><p>"That it is. And I assume you are asking about Damien and Rizevim?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Yes. Damien is…"</p><p><br></p><p>"I think you are forgetting that he is an ally of ours. What makes you think I will give away his information?"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>"Not to mention, it wouldn't change a thing even if I did." </p><p><br></p><p>"It's a matter of life and death for my race, Azazel. I am not asking you for anything you don't want to say. But just confirm one thing for me. Is Damien actually Lucifer?"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>"Just how in Father's name do you all screw up this much? The guy wanted to live a life of peace for once. *<em>Sigh</em>*."</p><p><br></p><p>"We didn't know anything."</p><p><br></p><p>"But you <em>are</em> the leader and thus you <em>have</em> to take responsibility for this. For Damien, I sincerely hope you won't do anything to make him go back to being that monster again, because if you do….I might not make this a matter of the Grigori for the sake of my people….but I will certainly make it personal. As for the information, you should ask Odin. I won't tell you anything beyond this."</p><p><br></p><p>"... I see. Thank you."</p><p><br></p><p>"What did he say, Sirzechs?" His father asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn't answer but made the next call to Odin and asked the same question.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next half an hour, he talked to him and found out the real identity of Damien Lucifer. Odin didn’t tell him anything about his faction or even his powers but just about his identity because the old Godking had noticed the fact that he never hid anything.</p><p><br></p><p>But even after all that, he still made one more call….this time to someone who wouldn't want Lucifer to return more than anyone else….Michael.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Flashback Ends –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>"Did Michael confirm it?” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason he called Michael was also because he couldn’t lie. That’s why the conversation with him was enlightening.</p><p><br></p><p>“He denied speaking on the topic at all. The only thing he said was that ‘Lucifer never lied.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So… either they all are lying or… the fools from the Old Satan Faction tried to create a clone of the Devil and ended up creating the perfect vessel for him to reincarnate in instead. But how is that even possible? Devil souls don’t reincarnate. That’s what we have been learning so far. They just disappear.” Serafall questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“But Lucifer wasn’t always a Devil.” Ajuka spoke for the first time since the conversation started. “And even the way he became one is unknown… so, we don’t know how things would have worked out for him. Although, there <em>is</em> a non-zero chance that they are just playing a game with us but that chance is too low for us to take any risk.”</p><p><br></p><p>He thought about it. “We will see what he does. Remember, our main goal is the safety and peace of the Underworld and the Devil race. Anything else is secondary. Our actions will only be based on that. If he tries to start another war, we will confront him. Till then…”</p><p><br></p><p>The words were left unsaid but it was clear to everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“But why are they not here yet? He said he will be coming to Lucifer's castle.” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who answered this was his Ancestor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because this… is not Lucifer's castle. The actual Lucifer’s castle is in Lilith… not this place. It’s the place where the seventy two Pillars and the Extra Devil clans were created. This place might have things similar to the old one, even a throne but it’s… just an imitation. He is not the kind of guy to settle for an imitation.”</p><p><br></p><p>A look of realisation seemed to dawn on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Runeas Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She walked down the dungeon stairs to the room where Zekram was being kept.</p><p><br></p><p>When she was awakened by Chysis, she was not expecting such a big mess.</p><p><br></p><p>He was keeping Lilith?</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, it was a bit odd considering how careful he was whenever trying to pull one of his schemes but this was still too big to matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially with <em>him</em> being back.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit. How could she have known it was not some fifteen sixteen year old brat and instead the actual devil. Especially with what Chysis had told her about the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>She had messed up badly.</p><p><br></p><p>To think she would offer the position of Satan Lucifer… to Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>If this had been back when the rest of the Pillar Devils were alive, she would have been erased before she could even clarify things out. And if by some Satanic miracle she managed to clear things up, she would still have been punished… just like Leviathan had punished her.</p><p><br></p><p>A fact known by only the original Satans. Not even the other Pillars knew of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the words spoken when they were first created. Those were the things not even the other Satans knew. Only Lucifer and Lilith knew.</p><p><br></p><p>But she didn’t need those to identify him. She knew the moment he started talking.</p><p><br></p><p>His presence… it was nigh impossible to copy.</p><p><br></p><p>So, if Zekram was involved even slightly, which she didn't doubt he was… it was going to be very bad for him.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the only silver lining in all this is that <em>He</em> was the only one who could stop the situation from going to an all out war or stop Rizevim as he did.</p><p><br></p><p>Chysis opened the door of the place for her to enter.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room, Zekram was sitting with his eyes closed. His demonic power was sealed so that he couldn’t escape the room.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his eyes when he heard the sound of the door opening.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you come to watch me fall, Runeas?” He questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I already missed that.”</p><p><br></p><p>He rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t ask him anything. They would get the answer anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what is it going to be? Hold me responsible for everything? Used as a sacrifice, a scapegoat to divert the attention and calm down the people?” He spoke. </p><p><br></p><p>“Oh stop playing a victim in this situation Zekram. They might not know but I do. Even if all of those things were not done by you, most of them certainly were, But that doesn’t matter now does it. You committed the very last thing you should have. Lilith…”</p><p><br></p><p>He kept his mouth shut, not speaking anything.</p><p><br></p><p>She scoffed. “If you are worried that we are broadcasting this, don’t be. We don’t need any confession from you. You cannot fall any lower. All that’s left today is for you to be judged.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And who is going to be judging me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will be judged by Satan Lucifer.” Chysis answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha Satan Lucifer. Fancying himself Lucifer now is he, Sirzechs, that half pint brat?”</p><p><br></p><p>None of them answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… the allure of power finally did him in too.”</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled him out, Chysis following close behind them.</p><p><br></p><p>Up the stairs, Zeoticus was waiting for them with Venelana.</p><p><br></p><p>They exchanged glances to Zekram and his eyes paused at the woman for a few moments. “You might call yourself a Gremory as much as you want but you will always be a Bael. My blood.”</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana didn’t show any change of expressions. She merely looked back at the man with an eerily calm gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>Death… could cause people to change.</p><p><br></p><p>Her thoughts went to <em>him</em>. Did he change too?</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Zekram and shook her head. Not that it would matter. No matter whether he changes or not, the actions taken by Zekram had crossed the line.</p><p><br></p><p>Without any other words she teleported them out to the city of Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p>They appeared among the familiar ruins of the old Lilith. The city had been destroyed in the Great War and repaired once, only to get completely razed down in the Civil War.</p><p><br></p><p>It was decided to make the new city at a different location. The public reason was to preserve the site of the first Lucifer’s castle, to show that the new Satans were just paying homage to them and not exactly replacing them.</p><p><br></p><p>The actual reason was because this place brought back the memories of two devastating wars.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus, just a few years later, this entire city had become a ghost town. No one lived here, and the only people who came here were the occasional first generation Devils, who cleaned and maintained the place to hold on to the memories of their younger age and comrades.</p><p><br></p><p>But today was different.</p><p><br></p><p>Today… the whole place was filled with people as far as eyes could see.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the grounds and skies were covered by devils wherever one looked.</p><p><br></p><p>They walked towards Lucifer's castle. The crowd grew loud, thousands of auras spiking at the sight of Zekram but none of them attacked even when they passed by them.</p><p><br></p><p>Near the castle, Sirzechs stood to receive them. At this time, Zekram spoke once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Going all out with the symbolism? Judging me from Lucifer's seat, do you think this relic of the past would change anything? This city died with Lucifer. Just like he cannot come back from death, just sitting on Lucifer’s throne won’t make you The Devil.”</p><p><br>Even now, he had the tone of a man who had things under his control. She really wondered what the source of his confidence is.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he simply to deny the allegations as a terrorist act? Did he think that would work? Or was he planning to use someone as a scapegoat?</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs however just turned towards him calmly and replied with an even tone. “I know.”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd parted, making a way as they neared the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs stopped as they got to the place where a girl stood and signalled to her that they had reached the place.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl brought out a document. “Zekram Bael. Read this and sign.”</p><p><br></p><p>He merely glanced at the document.</p><p><br></p><p>“It states that you wish to continue with the trial and will answer every question you are asked as long as you are in this room and you will do so truthfully.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man signed it with a scoff and threw aside the document. “Let’s get this farce over with.” He said to Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid it’s not me who will be your judge today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” He asked, looking confused for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>She however didn’t give him any chance to gather his thoughts as she caught a hold of Zekram’s hand, making the man confused before she kicked his knee, making the man crash into the ground with a growl of pain.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at her stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was ordered to drag you in. I cannot afford to mess up anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>Without giving him any chance to speak, she dragged him inside the room.</p><p><br></p><p>After over a thousand years, she entered the oddly familiar. The majestic walls of the hall were fractured in many places, the roof had been destroyed, leaving the place open to the elements. The only reason it was not a pile of dead and decaying mess was because of the barriers kept over it to preserve it.</p><p><br></p><p>But despite all this, the atmosphere inside the room didn’t change one bit.</p><p><br></p><p>On either side of the room were two rows of chairs, each containing thirty six chairs, a total of seventy two chairs.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them were filled with the current Pillar Heads. The Gremory chair was still empty, probably left for her.</p><p><br></p><p>At the head of the hall, just below the throne were six chairs, each for the six houses of Lucifer. Currently only three of them were full, the Lucifuge girl taking the seat. The other two were the ones she didn’t know but from their looks, they seemed to be a Satanachia and a Nebiros devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally on the top of a platform was a throne on which sat the Devil himself. On his two sides were the Leviathan girl and Merlin.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene reminded her of the days of the old where such meetings were last held. How long had it been since this was changed to the farce that was today’s council.</p><p><br></p><p>She left dumbfounded Zekram, who looked as if he had seen a ghost, on the ground and stepped forward, kneeling on the ground. “I have completed your command, my King.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. You have done well. Take your seat.”</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed before going and taking the Gremory seat and looked at Zekram who had shaking stood up but was still looking at the throne as if in a trance.</p><p><br></p><p><em>He</em> however was not in a mood to give him any time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you forgotten basic manners, Zekram? Or do I have to remind you how to greet your king?” He spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>The words seemed to have broken him out of his trance as he backed away a few steps, shaken completely. To be honest, she understood the feeling. Only Zekram had messed up even worse.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kneel.” Lucifer ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram however was still in a state of disbelief and didn’t pay attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you not hear me Zekram? I said… <em>kneel</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no. This is not real.  Do you think you can fool me with a disguise of an illusion? Who are you? Ajuka, Sirzechs, Serafall? Colluding with the likes of them,” he pointed towards Merlin and the Leviathan girl, “to take over the Underworld. Do you think of yourself as the King of the Underworld? Do you think you can make me kneel? Dream on, kid. I would never… arghhhhhhhhh.”</p><p><br></p><p>His rant however was cut short as both of his legs, right till his knees were sliced off by two spears of black light.</p><p><br></p><p>The signature move of Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>He fell down to the ground… on his knees and tried to keep his balance as a voice sounded from the throne above.</p><p><br></p><p>“There you go. See… was it so hard? All you had to do was be a good kid and you could have spared yourself the unnecessary pain. Did this help wake you up… or do I have to give it another go?”</p><p><br></p><p>She felt a shiver down her spine.</p><p><br></p><p>A non zero chance, her ass.</p><p><br></p><p>That moss head brat didn’t know what he was speaking.</p><p><br></p><p>No way it was anyone else than him.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram sat on the ground, swallowing his cries of pain and looked at the devil, his face pale, finally realising how badly he was fucked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now that we have the formalities out of the way, shall we begin the proceedings.” Lucifer ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin stepped forward and brought out a document. “Zekram Bael has been accused of seventy three direct and two hundred and eighty three indirect murders of Pillar Devils and Extra Devil Clan members, provoking war between the houses of the Devil faction, manipulating evidence, framing innocents, bribery…” The list went on and on.</p><p><br></p><p>It was taken from the evidence they had received from his own home because she was sure that if they had every piece of information on him, the murder counts would have crossed a thousand easily. Serafall had put together the entire document in the two hours they were given.</p><p><br></p><p>“... creating and spreading the Devil’s Sleeping sickness and using it against fellow houses of the Underworld, and finally… attacking and keeping, the Mother of all Devil, Lilith hostage for over a thousand years.” Merlin read and stepped back.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer looked at Zekram and questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me Zekram, did you kill or have those people killed?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… Yes.” Zekram answered and then looked stunned at the answer himself, his own throat to check.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t be surprised. You did sign a magical contract that you will answer all the questions asked in this hall truthfully, didn’t you? The contract was made by me personally. And you voluntarily agreed to it too. So let’s not waste our time. Why did you do so?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The contract?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it a binding contract? Could he even make these kinds of things?</p><p><br></p><p>She eyed him in disbelief.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next twenty minutes, Zekram was forced to speak about every piece of crime he had committed over the years to remove his political and economic rivals.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the pieces of information were shocking even to her.</p><p><br></p><p>The methods he had used to kill people were truly… by leaking information to the Old Satan faction, Fallen Angels and even the Church to finish off anyone who had been an inconvenience to him.</p><p><br></p><p>As she had expected, the numbers were far above what he had been accused of.</p><p><br></p><p>The names of the targets were frightening too, including six original Pillar devils who had been removed. She felt a chill run down her spine at the news.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the names received violent reactions from the Pillar Heads, for example the death of the Barbatos Head, who was the father of the one representing the House. The current head was under arrest, being investigated after the reveal of the Rating Games scam. He had removed the previous head and put the current head on the seat because the previous Head didn’t want to join his faction.</p><p><br></p><p>The next question came.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you, directly or indirectly involved in the attack on Ingrid Leviathan, the granddaughter of Leviathan?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The Leviathan girl beside him eyed Zekram with a gaze that could kill.</p><p><br></p><p>“... Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>A massive aura burst out from the Leviathan girl before he commanded. “Ingvild. Calm down.”</p><p><br></p><p>The aura disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. The girl took a deep breath and glared at Zekram with a freezing gaze but didn’t let out her aura anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingrid Leviathan was someone who was very different from the rest of her family. A friendly girl who preferred to stay out of trouble unlike the rest of her siblings who were violent brats who killed on a whim.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you have her daughter, Ingvild Leviathan infected with the Sleeping Sickness?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“To have her recruited into a peerage of a member of the Bael House and merge the bloodline with mine and create a branch house.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Just how many pits had he dug for himself?</p><p><br></p><p>But now was not the time to worry about that because only one case remained.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole venue became quiet, holding their breaths.</p><p><br></p><p>His casual attitude, which he had adorned for the entirety of the meeting disappeared as all expressions from his face faded away as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you… directly or indirectly… infect Lilith… with the Sleeping Sickness?”</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram gritted his teeth, trying to stop the words but failed. “... yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the entire crowd rioted.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost every Devil released their power, concentrating it on the downed man who was crushed under the combined pressure.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be quiet!” Lucifer shouted, raising his voice for the first time since the meeting started, taking the whole crowd by surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>All their auras dispersed immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>He stood up and walked down the stairs towards the centre of the room where Zekram lay crumbled on the ground, standing right in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>All this time his demonic power kept rising. It was beyond anything she had seen before, even Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>She had heard from Chysis that Sirzechs was called the strongest devil but was he stronger than him?</p><p><br></p><p>The whole place started cracking when Merlin stood up and walked forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Balance Breaker.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole castle and the surrounding area was enveloped in an expanding bubble as the area around them transformed into an eerily familiar place.</p><p><br></p><p>She almost forgot to breathe at the familiar sight.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the scene from the day the seventy pillars were created and he had addressed them with Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you remember this scene Zekram?” he asked, looking down at him.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no answer as Zekram had gone into a state of shock.</p><p><br></p><p>The King looked towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She hurriedly stood up and kneeled. “Yes, my King. It is from the day the seventy two Pillars were created.” She answered.</p><p><br></p><p>The people around her all gasped at the information. It was understandable as this was the day the Devil race was more or less founded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Correct.” he looked back at Zekram. “And on this day… I told you all something about betraying the Underworld and me. But it seems you have forgotten it. So let me refresh your memory.”</p><p><br></p><p>He picked up Zekram by his neck, raising him above the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have delivered you unto this existence… and I can just as easily pluck you out of it… The choice was yours to make… and you Zekram… made the wrong choice.”</p><p><br></p><p>And with those words he flicked his wrist, snapping the neck of Zekram Bael with ease and tossing the body.</p><p><br></p><p>The Great King of the Seventy Two Pillars of the Underworld’s devil race… died with a look of horror still etched on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer looked around the room, staring every Head of the House into their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does anyone have any problem with my decision?”</p><p><br></p><p>No one spoke a word.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m still waiting for my answer.” he repeated, a bit louder this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost immediately choruses of denial rang through the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.” He next looked around the room at Sirzechs and the other three. “Sirzechs Gremory, Ajuka Astaroth, Serafall Sitri, Falbium Glasya-Labolas.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs walked forward and the rest followed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You four… have saved the Underworld… and the Devil race from what could have been a dead end. For that I thank you. There is no doubt that each one of you has dedicated your life for the future of the Underworld… and thus, the titles that you were given… are well deserved.” His voice sounded throughout the whole venue and due to Merlin’s spell, the scene was seen by the entire city. “I am sure that my comrades, your predecessors wouldn’t have minded it one bit. I know I don’t. You all are good leaders.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the scene, strangely.</p><p><br></p><p>He was praising them?</p><p><br></p><p>Did he want to reduce the burden of the whole incident on them by these words?</p><p><br></p><p>“...but you are not good kings.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole crowd focused on the conversation due to the sudden change.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know the difference between a leader and a King?” He looked at the four. “The king reigns but does not govern. You four on the other hand became so engrossed in <em>governing</em> that you forgot that you sit on the throne of a King. The Devil race isn’t a democracy. It wasn’t made to be one. It’s not in their blood. Believe me, I would know.”</p><p><br></p><p>By now the entire venue had gone back into silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet you let them control you. <em>That</em>… was a mistake and <em>this</em>… is the result.”</p><p><br></p><p>The four of them listened quietly. “Today, I am giving you all a chance. Zekram was just one person. There were several others who had assisted him in one way or the other… and they are still free out there. I assume they will be tried for their crimes as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. So, when you sentence them today… make sure you do what a King would do. There should be no kindness shown to traitors. Don’t let today’s situation arise ever again… or I would definitely keep the promise I made to your father’s bishop the first time we met. I am the Devil of my word after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs flinched lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>She would have to ask them what promise he had made just to make sure they didn;t accidentally mess up.</p><p><br></p><p>With his words said, he walked out of the hall.</p><p><br></p><p>All the House heads bowed till he left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Two minutes after he had left, she finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, one of Falbium Glasya-Labolas’ peerage members rushed in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir, sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?” He asked gruffly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir… Agreas… The terrorists took away the floating island of Agreas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“WHAT!”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We walked out to see a strange scene in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeoticus and Venelana were standing in front of a large crowd of devils. Behind them were a few people. I recognised them as Lady Bael and her son along with another black haired child, Sairaorg Bael.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a moment to understand the situation. The crowd were trying to hold them responsible for the actions of Zekram and Lord Bael and go on a crusade… Seriously, who are these people Devils or Church members?</p><p><br></p><p>As I walked nearer, I heard the conversation clearer.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeoticus and Venelana were trying to protect them from the angry mob.</p><p><br></p><p>“The sins of Zekram had nothing to do with these children.” They argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Their ancestor killed so many Pillar Devils and even attacked Lady Lilith. Even their father must have been involved in the whole crime as the head of the house. They must be purged so that their name doesn’t taint the Underworld again.” The one at the head of the crowd, one of the people I recognised who had his family members killed by Zekram’s plots and his house declared extinct later on, shouted as he threw a spell.</p><p><br></p><p>I exchanged a look with Merlin and he was already in action before the guy’s spell even completed, making a barrier in front of them. The attack clashed against the barrier and dissipated.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacker turned back in anger but his face turned pale at the sight of me. All of them quickly kneeled.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Father started the Great War and yet I don’t see anyone throwing stones at me.” I spoke. “I know you are angry but don’t let your anger cloud your judgement. The children had nothing to do with it. They are innocent… and if you were to harm or kill any of them… you would be doing the same thing as Zekram.”</p><p><br></p><p>I walked forward to them and looked at Zeoticus and Venelana. “Have the adults of the Bael House investigated and the children sent to the houses of their other parents. I do not wish to hear of any harm coming to these children. We are devils. We don’t harm our children… That’s what humans do.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two bowed and I turned to the black haired boy.</p><p><br></p><p>Sairaorg Bael.</p><p><br></p><p>I had heard about him a lot from Merlin but I had hardly seen his performance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you angry, scared?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>To my surprise he shook his head. “No Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was no lie in his statement.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked it with my Prince of Lies.</p><p><br></p><p>He was actually not angry or scared of the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me child, what is your dream?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to become a Satan.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several aggressive voices were heard as a reply to the proclamation.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised a hand and the crowd stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>“With the stigma of your name, it will be nigh impossible for you to sit on one of those thrones. “ I said.</p><p><br></p><p>“But not completely impossible, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No… not completely impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will work hard to clear this name and win their approval.”</p><p><br></p><p>I stared right into his eyes and a bit of my Conqueror’s Haki seeped out, putting pressure on him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know what you are saying, child?”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t cower. Even when the pressure got heavier, he didn’t back down and bore everything with gritted teeth, not saying a word.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly but surely, his own Haki was forced out, making sparks appear in the atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>A clash of Conqueror’s Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled back my aura as a smile came to my face. “Good. Very good. In that case, work, train, become stronger and the day you win the approval of the Underworld… I will personally crown you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several murmurs and exclaims ran through the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>I put a hand on his head and walked by.</p><p><br></p><p>A bit ahead, I saw Rias, present with her grandmother and Grayfia.</p><p><br></p><p>She saw me coming their way and ran up to me and gave me a tight hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank You for helping me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You’re welcome, princess.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t stay behind after that and all of us teleported away to our own base.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s goal was already achieved.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>We stood in front of the huge island in front of us as Gretel and Merlin threw spells after spells at it to hide its existence from the rest of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The floating island of Agraes. The only place in the world where Agaresite, the material used for making Evil Pieces, were found.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the actual goal of Project Regicide.</p><p><br></p><p>“I still don’t believe this was your goal all along and everything with Zekram Bael… was just a distraction for this. I am pretty sure the old man would have died of an aneurysm had he known of this.” Sean joked lightly. “I mean everyone was assuming that destroying the Bael House and Zekram was the Project Regicide.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him oddly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know what Regicide means?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The killing of a King, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. So, if I consider killing him as Project Regicide, wouldn't it also mean that I consider him a King in the first place? Zekram Bael was not a king. Just an idiot who thought too highly of himself. This end is exactly what he deserved.” I replied as I sat down and Sean sat down beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not to mention, this island was the biggest trump card in their possession. Should Ajuka actually go all out, he could have made hundreds of King Pieces with the entire reserve of Agarasite, raising an army of Ultimate Class beings easily. Now, that would have been scary. I couldn’t risk that happening… so I removed it from the equation all together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In life, the King represents the future and I just took away their future. This is a complete checkmate… the actual Project Regicide.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see how they handle the situation  now.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter took a day longer than I was expecting because I got a bad case of Pink Eye.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am all healed now.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And here’s your chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things happened.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see the reaction and get some idea about Damien’s actions and long term goal in the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I hope you all like this.</strong></p><p><strong><br>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
