        <p><strong>Isekai Restaurant</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 18: Interlude 1</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I sat in the bath, eyes closed as I tried to calm my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>We had returned back to the Restaurant and Rimuru took Milim back to Tempest while Tohru took Lucoa back.</p><p><br></p><p>The lectures would come later. Although, a part of me didn’t blame them for anything they did.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna and Naruto had already been taken back home by Miu so it was only the elders who had been left behind at the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>I explained everything to the Ryozanpaku masters and as expected they were pissed at the situation too.</p><p><br></p><p>While they were not the violent sort, they didn’t shy away from violence when it was forced on them.</p><p><br></p><p>I promised them that I would set a rule in the Restaurant to prevent anything like this happening ever again.</p><p><br></p><p>The scenes from the battle flashed in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim’s power…</p><p><br></p><p>It was unreal.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew how strong I was after becoming an Archdaemon but I was pretty sure I would have been erased by that attack so bad that not even my soul would have survived it.</p><p><br></p><p>The realisation was frightening… as well as sobering. The multiverse was dangerous… very dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>“Man… running a Restaurant wasn’t supposed to be this stressful.” I sighed, rubbing my head.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of this, the door to the bath opened. I heard a familiar voice before I could turn around.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sil-kun. I didn’t know you were here.”  Lavy came, already undressed with a towel in her hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavy. When did you return?” I asked, not surprised at her nonchalance. By now, all of us knew what Lavy was like. “Did the rest come back too?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just now. No. Shuna-chan and Sakura-chan went to do some shopping. I decided to take a bath before they return.” She finished as she took a shower before coming and standing beside the bathtub.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood what she wanted and moved back slightly to make space for her and she stepped between my legs, resting her back on my chest with natural ease.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was your day?” She asked, finally settled in my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was… hah… exhausting.” I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Were there too many customers today?” She asked, confused at my answer.</p><p><br></p><p>“No… it was…” Then I went on to explain everything to her. “They… called him a sacrifice… a human sacrifice… How can someone say that to a kid? How can they even think of using a kid like a weapon… how can people be so selfish… that’s… disgusting.” I spat out before realising that the water in the bath was shaking due to my demonic power.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and calmed myself down.</p><p><br></p><p>She placed a hand on mine.</p><p><br></p><p>“The world is a very large place, Sil-kun. There are all kinds of people. You feel pain and disgust at such thoughts because you are a kind man. Similarly, there are others who don’t feel anything as long as they get what they want. You shouldn’t get depressed over people like them. They don’t deserve your attention.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken aback at the seriousness in her voice. It was completely different from the usual bubbly Lavy we knew.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost as if it was the real her. To be honest, I was always confused by her personality. Lavinia Reni was either a very simple girl, or the biggest mastermind in the world… or maybe a bit of both. My bet was on the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I remembered her own situation and realised that the situation must have reminded her of her own and pulled her into a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Lavy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>The position we were in made me hard and she felt it too. She half turned towards me and whispered into my ears.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look stressed. Let me take care of you.” She said, stopping for a moment and turning around and straddling my waist.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, the depression thoughts were scattered away. We have been a couple for almost two weeks now and except for the first day, we hadn’t done anything.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the reasons for that was Shuna being in the room at night. But now that I had the opportunity, I wasn’t about to let it go.</p><p><br></p><p>She however took some soap and started applying it on my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>The sight of her wet hair sticking around her face and slightly covering her otherwise naked breasts as she concentrated on applying soap on my chest… this girl probably doesn’t realise how mind numbingly sexy she was…</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t hold back anymore so I leaned in, taking her lips into my own.</p><p><br></p><p>She was surprised for a bit but then returned the kiss enthusiastically, her breasts pressed tightly on my chest, slipping all over my chest due to the soap she had used.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed my tongue into her mouth and she accepted it, even playing around with it.</p><p><br></p><p>I took some soap in my hand and started doing the same. I started with her back before my hands snaked around to her butt and pulled her into myself, rubbing my length right above her core.</p><p><br></p><p>She moaned lightly into my mouth as her hand ran through my hair, gripping it as she kissed me back more aggressively.</p><p><br></p><p>Her actions however only served to make me more excited. I cupped her breasts in my hands and raised them to my lips before taking one of her nipples into my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahhhh…” Her hips moved, grinding her slit over my length while she ran her finger through my hair, pushing me into her breasts, her breathing getting heavier with each passing moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Water splashed around in the tub, spilling out everywhere as she hugged me closer.</p><p><br></p><p>I sucked on her nipple, enjoying her moans as my hands slipped into her crack, massaging her ass before sliding over her rosebud. She jerked suddenly, broken from the pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sil-kun!” I looked up at her and saw that she was blushing. Suddenly, I smirked as an idea appeared in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>My fingers circled right around her rosebud, not touching it directly and her body shivered every time I got near the part.</p><p><br></p><p>She was biting her lips to control her moans and I did something which made her control break.</p><p><br></p><p>I used a quick Clean Spell, something I had created to clean off the tables and my kitchen. An interesting fact about the spell was that it worked on human bodies too.</p><p><br></p><p>A water tentacle formed inside the tub and I guided it to her backdoor making her yelp and jump.</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled back slightly, staring into my eyes with an embarrassed blush.</p><p><br></p><p>"It's important to clean each part well when bathing." I whispered. Her mouth opened at the absurdity of the situation. "Even here." I didn't give her a chance to reply as I locked her lips with mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened but slowly her arms reached into my hair and back as my tongue slid inside her. Our tongues wrestled and the water tentacle did its job making her moan in my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued the treatment for a few minutes, our lips only separating for a few moments in between and felt her hips rocking in my lap with more vigour with each passing moment until her whole body jerked as she shivered and suddenly collapsed on my chest. I felt a kiss on my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at my handiwork.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later, she got back up.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her questioningly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sil-kun hasn’t gotten… cleaned yet. Sit on the edge of the tub. Let me clean you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did as I was told and she sat down between my legs, soap gathered in her hands as she started soaping my thighs. Her hands cleaned my thighs before moving towards my rock hard rod and started working on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost on a reflex, my hand went on her head, caressing her hair.</p><p><br></p><p>She finally cleaned the soap with water and slowly jerked my cock while looking at me with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>My dick twitched at her look, making her giggle slightly before she leaned in and kissed the tip slowly and then took it into her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghhh.” I groaned as the warmth of her mouth enveloped me.</p><p><br></p><p>She started moving slowly, her tongue rolling all over my tip. Her drool rolled down her chin as she licked my length from the balls to the tip before enveloping the tip again, bobbing her head, sucking me off. She was sloppy but that was also what made her insanely hot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavy, I am going to be a bit rough. Tell me if you feel uncomfortable.” I called out to her and she nodded, humming slightly without taking out my cock from her mouth, sending pleasurable shivers down my spine.</p><p><br></p><p>I grabbed her hair and pushed her down on my length.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grgkk ghahh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” I asked and she just nodded, grabbing my waist with her hands and pushing herself more. “Alright. Just don’t force yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>I slowly pushed her down before pulling her back.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly I increased my speed, moving my waist, sometimes thrusting into her mouth, hitting the back of her throat, making her gag more.</p><p><br></p><p>The stubborn girl however didn’t back down either and kept going. Drool flowed all over my length even drenching my balls as she continued moving.</p><p><br></p><p>A few times she stopped and gasped for breath, her eyes watery but filled with determination as she dove back in. She was oddly competitive in this.</p><p><br></p><p>I was also reaching my limit so I held her head and thrusted a few times before releasing everything into her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled back and closed her eyes, swallowing everything before pausing and licking the corner of her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously this girl…</p><p><br></p><p>“Open your mouth, show me.” I said, feeling my sadistic side coming out.</p><p><br></p><p>She happily obliged.</p><p><br></p><p>I grabbed her tongue with my fingers and massaged her mouth, playing with her tongue, checking every nook and cranny. There was something incredibly hot about the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good girl.” I snapped my finger, cleaning everything and pulling her in for her reward.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy loved kisses so we kissed… a lot.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tsunade Senju -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She came out of the hospital room and found Jiraiya waiting outside.</p><p><br></p><p>The man… he looked old.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been working non stop since the incident. To hunt down any spies leaving the leaf village.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, he was supposed to investigate the things Danzo had done but the Uchiha Clan as well as several other clans of the village had downright denied that.</p><p><br></p><p>They did not want anyone related to sensei to be involved in the matter.</p><p><br>As insulting as it was, she could see and understand their reasoning too. After all, everything was happening under sensei’s nose. People would obviously doubt that things were not happening by his orders… or at least agreement with everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Let alone others, Tsunade herself doubted him.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally it was decided that the Uchiha Clan would be the one investigating the matter.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, the Konoha Police force was under the Uchiha and this did fall under their jurisdiction too.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone had supported this decision. They knew that the Uchiha wouldn’t leave any stones unturned especially after that abominable arm was left.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade’s temper flared everytime she thought of that arm. If Danzo wasn’t dead, she would have ripped him apart with her own hands.</p><p><br></p><p>These bastards hadn’t even left her grandfather’s body untouched.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing she had done after the battle was have the bodies dug out but found them to be missing.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Their bodies had been missing all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>After this discovery, even the Hyugas had rallied against the Hokage with the Uchiha.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uchiha police had gone off to search like bloodhounds after that incident.</p><p><br></p><p>All the hate and alienation they had suffered had turned into anger and bitterness and they were channelling everything into this search.</p><p><br></p><p>Members of the Shimura Clan, Sarutobi Clan, Homura Clan and Utatane Clan were getting arrested left and right.</p><p><br></p><p>The tracking squads had all left to search for the leftover root members who had fled the village after Danzo’s death.</p><p><br></p><p>They were keeping their discoveries from the public until their leader returned.</p><p><br></p><p>Fugaku Uchiha hadn’t shown his face for the last three days, supposedly healing from an injury in the fight. She didn’t see him injured but who knows.</p><p><br></p><p>He even denied her help saying his wife will take care of him and that her help would be more appreciated by the village.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the defeated looking face of Jiraiya.</p><p><br></p><p>In a way she pitied him a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>He was always the one paying for the selfishness of others. Be it Orochimaru, Sensei or even… her.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya looked at her as soon as she came out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“His condition is stable now but he cannot be a ninja anymore.” She replied. She saw the look of pain and regret on his face and added. “It’s still better than him dying. If anything you should thank that dragon. He was going to use the Shikki Fuin before she blasted him into a wall and the jutsu was unsuccessful.” A part of her felt annoyed at the man. “I guess he was planning to run away once more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsunade!”</p><p><br>“What Jiraiya! Even after seeing everything, are you still defending him?”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya’s mouth clamped down but he still looked annoyed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you say that everything that was done here was all just Danzo’s fault? Everything? That sensei had no idea what was happening? That man was walking in front of him with that abomination of a hand and he had no idea! At this point, even if the Uchiha clan rebelled, I wouldn’t blame them. They deserve that. And what about Naruto Uzumaki? Everything that happened to him? Wasn’t he your godson? They messed up so badly that even Gods descended on the village to punish them… How can you still be so… dumb?” She gritted her teeth and took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsunade…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t… don’t talk to me Jiraiya. I don’t know what I am thinking right now. I might say something which I don’t want to, so… please, please leave me alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t even joking. With that, she left him alone.</p><p><br></p><p>After the fight, she had found out what that Uchiha brat had done to her to remove her fear of blood.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a power…</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade shuddered even thinking about it.</p><p><br></p><p>But with the knowledge of that technique, came a doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>Was removing her haemophobia the only thing he did? Or did he do something else? Were her thoughts even hers?</p><p><br></p><p>She knew that she didn’t want anything to do with the village and yet she was here. Why was she even doing all this? Were these her own thoughts?</p><p><br></p><p>The more she thought about these, the more it haunted her.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade shook those thoughts away with great difficulty and all it did was make her angry at sensei.</p><p><br>It was because of him that all this was happening.</p><p><br></p><p>A part of her just wanted to finish him off in his sleep but her pride as a medic wouldn’t allow her to do that. Maybe it would have been better if that dragon had finished him off… that way, he could have gone with dignity. She consoled herself by the fact that he will not be escaping this mess he created by dying in the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>She left the hospital and was met by an unexpected face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mikoto Uchiha.” She greeted the wife of the Uchiha Clan head. “Are you here to see your son?”</p><p><br></p><p>With her was her younger son, looking at her curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman nodded. “How is Itachi?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is still unconscious. The surgery was successful but he overexerted himself and lost consciousness.” She stopped. “I think we should talk somewhere else.” She looked at her son and added. “Alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman frowned but looked at her son. “Sasuke, wait in Itachi’s room.”</p><p><br></p><p>The kid was confused but followed.</p><p><br></p><p>She, on the other hand, led Mikoto Uchiha to an empty room.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, Tsunade-sama?” The woman asked, almost wary.</p><p><br></p><p>“I checked on Itachi’s condition before his surgery. He has a disease slowly developing in his lung. It’s still in the first stage so the treatment is possible. If it develops further, then I am afraid that I won’t be able to do anything about it. I think you should start the treatment for him. I am not saying I am the only one who can do it. There are other doctors in Konoha who can do it too. You can consult someone else if you want a second opinion. The reports are all in his file.”</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the woman’s face paled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right now, yes. He is alright. But his condition will deteriorate slowly if not treated.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. I am just doing my job. How is Fugaku doing by the way?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is recovering. He had overexerted himself and one of his old wounds had opened up. He will be returning soon.” Mikoto replied, although Tsunade couldn’t help but notice that she was a bit wary.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. In that case, please send someone to inform me. I need to talk to him as soon as he is available.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman nodded and took her leave.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not take the position of the Hokage.” She denied without looking up from the files. In the absence of the Hokage, she was chosen to take over the duties.</p><p><br></p><p>“But Tsunade, there is no one better than you who can take the position right now. Without a Hokage, the village is in a mess. Other villages are looking at us like bloodhounds, ready to jump at us at a moment’s notice. Not to mention those damn Uchihas… they are doing whatever they want.” Koharu Utatane complained.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade smashed the table in front of her into dust, taking the woman aback by the sudden bout of violence and making her shut up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enough! I already said I will not become the Hokage. That’s final. As for the Uchiha, I think they are doing exactly what they were told to. The reason you are so agitated is because someone is actually doubting you. Well, news flash. You have all been doing the same to them for years now. How does it feel being on the wrong side of the blade?”</p><p><br>“Tsunade, you can’t be serious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am very serious. In fact, I think they are already restricting themselves by only keeping you under surveillance until the investigations are completed.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman looked offended.</p><p><br>Was she really expecting her to side with them after seeing what they had done?</p><p><br></p><p>The woman then had the audacity to look at Jiraiya who merely ignored her. Jiraiya might not say anything to sensei but the advisors were a completely different thing.</p><p><br></p><p>He held no love for them at all.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that there was a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened and an unexpected face showed up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Asuma.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman looked at the newcomer in hope. “Please Asuma, you need to make Tsunade understand. I think it’s the genjutsu that was cast on her…” she started to babble but the man ignored her completely and looked at her instead.</p><p><br></p><p>“Asuma Sarutobi, guard of the fire daimyo reporting.”</p><p><br></p><p>She raised an eyebrow but nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Daimyo has sent me to investigate the matter from a week ago. The extent of damage and… what happened after that… and the rumours floating around… has the Fire Daimyo worried. He wishes to know everything that happened here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alone?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I have a friend and another member of the Fire Guardians with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Very well. You can bring him in and I will explain the situation.” She replied as she got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsunade!”</p><p><br></p><p>She ignored the words of the advisors and left the room, thankful for the timely arrival of Asuma.</p><p><br></p><p>Once outside, the man sighed a bit. “How is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him and then towards the way they were going. “Alive. He lost an arm and a leg. He will be retiring.” She had heard that Asuma Sarutobi had left the village due to a fight with sensei.</p><p><br></p><p>A look of pain passed over his face before a professional look appeared as they reached a monk.</p><p><br></p><p>“Chiriku, this is Tsunade Senju, the one temporarily in charge of the village. Tsunade-sama, he is Chiriku, a monk of the Fire Temple and a fellow Ninja Guardian.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded towards the monk and led them to an empty room and took seats.</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of enemy could do this? I know there are rumours of a gigantic dragon hundreds of kilometres long and actual Gods are flying around everywhere. Each story is more ridiculous than the others. I know there was a big fight… the missing Hokage Mountain is a dead giveaway but I want to know what exactly is going on.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him strangely. “Who told you those were rumours?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour, she went and explained everything she knew to them and by the end of the hour, they were just as flabbergasted by the whole thing as anyone who had heard it later.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be serious. Please tell me you are not serious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me, Asuma. I have many better things to do than to joke around here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Gods… are you sure?” The Monk asked, the look on his face was of terror.</p><p><br></p><p>His entire belief must have been shaken.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did hear the dragon say that the one who broke the moon to fix the land… was a Goddess.” She had been close enough to hear bits of their words. Now she wished she hadn’t been.</p><p><br></p><p>At least now they know the extent of their fuck up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not only that but there was another guy, the one who stopped everything and froze the water from the ocean. We later found from our investigation that the entire trench, up till  the ocean was frozen by him… almost instantly. The dragon called him Boss.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Fourth Raikage A -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find anything?” He asked as soon as Mabui entered his office.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and handed him the report from the Land of Fire.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly flipped the pages of the file and checked the information. After a few minutes, he looked up with a frown on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this some kind of a joke?”</p><p><br></p><p>“As much as I want it to be, no. This is the exact news I have received from several of our spies in the Land of Fire and Konoha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A dozens of kilometres long dragon? A God? And a trench which connected Konoha to the ocean. What kind of nonsense is this? I want information of what secret weapon they are using, not a story from the drunk fantasies of the taverns from the Land of Fire.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you really think it’s nonsense? Even after seeing what happened to the moon?” Mabui replied and he found his retort getting stuck into his mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“It had to be a genjutsu. That… that kind of power is not real. It cannot be real.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet it is. Even according to the legends, the moon was created by the Sage of Six Paths. If that is so then I don’t think what we saw was really a genjutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his hands and looked at the file in front of him as if it was some kind of curse.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can it… is it really true? Are there really Gods in this world?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who knows? But there are certainly beings with godlike powers… and Konoha has provoked several of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked blankly at the table and went in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>A part of his mind wondered what kind of beings they were and if they were beings like Tailed Beasts and if that was so, could they be captured and used for Kumogakure?</p><p><br></p><p>Then he remembered their powers and pushed those thoughts away.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Against that kind of power, they would have no other choice but to die.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the freaking moon, dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>The moon!</p><p><br>“A-sama. Konoha is extremely weak right now. Should we… should we prepare for a war? We could use this opportunity…”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes… what is the situation in Konoha right now?</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Wait till we have the full details of the situation. Find everything. Who were those people? Where did they come from? Why did they attack Konoha? How did Konoha survive such an attack? If they can indeed survive such an attack, they might have some trump cards of their own. What if they sealed such a monster into a Jinchuriki? Send more people near the borders and test them but don’t attack them outright. Take advantage of this situation to infiltrate the Land of Fire and find out all the details. That old bastard Onoki will also be looking for a chance. Let them make a move first.”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly gave commands to make them move.</p><p><br></p><p>The incident had left everyone in shock and fear. It was his duty as the kage to ensure that his people remained calm.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Konan -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What are we going to do, Nagato? Are there really Gods in this world?” She asked, trepidation showing in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Nagato has been unnaturally quiet since hearing the report about the incident in Konoha village.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t disturb him either because she knew how worried he would be in such a situation. The news had been just that shocking and even she had a hard time believing it… even after seeing the moon collapse in front of her own eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“It… doesn’t matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter if there are Gods in this world. They aren’t doing their job well either way.” Nagato continued.</p><p><br></p><p>Konan looked at him surprised but he was looking down at the floor as he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“If they were really doing their jobs then there wouldn’t be all this pain in the world. But they aren’t, so… it’s time they stepped aside.” He looked up and there was a craze in his eyes unlike anything before. “If there are such cruel and sadistic Gods in this world who would take pleasure in seeing the pain of people… then I am going to bring them down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nagato!”</p><p><br></p><p>“No Konan… I am Pain… I am the pain of every person who has been suffering in this cruel world. The suffering which those so-called Gods have subjected us to… it’s about time they knew Pain…”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be serious. Didn’t you read the reports? Didn’t you see the moon crumbling apart?” She tried to reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“The moon was created by the Sage of Six Paths and the destruction they cause could be done if we can collect all the Tailed Beasts. I… can do it. With these eyes of mine. Perhaps, this is the reason I have been given these eyes… to bring those cruel Gods down and make them know pain…”</p><p><br></p><p>Konan looked at him with wide eyes and tried to reason with him but no matter what, he wasn’t ready to listen.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, she didn’t even know what to do anymore.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Fugaku Uchiha -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He opened his eyes and the world became clear again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are there any problems?” Mikoto asked and he activated his Sharingan.</p><p><br></p><p>The power which flowed in his eyes… it felt much stronger than before. In fact, he himself felt far stronger than before. His chakra had risen. His vision was sharper. His power flowed much smoother.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at a mirror on the side of the room and pushed more power into his eyes. His eyes changed… morphing into a six cornered star pattern, different from his three cornered star pattern before.</p><p><br></p><p>The eyes of undying light, the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan…</p><p><br></p><p>Even through the mirror, he could feel the power in those eyes…</p><p><br></p><p>Mikoto quickly checked a few more things and finally let out a sigh of relief. “Everything seems to be fine.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “How are things outside? What was happening outside while I was unconscious.” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and reported everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Today is a meeting of the council. Everyone wants to know what we have unearthed from our investigations.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Okay, I will attend it.” He got up and looked at Mikoto who hesitated a bit. “What is it?”</p><p><br>“Fugaku… Itachi… he is… ill.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“When Tsunade-sama was treating him, she discovered that he had a serious illness in his lungs. It could become terminal if not treated soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>He paused at the news while she continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tsunade-sama told me that I could verify the news from other doctors if I doubted her. I did. It was true. I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ask Tsunade what she wants. Get him the best treatment available.” He interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>Mitoko looked at him in surprise and he winced.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you really think I don’t care about him?” He asked, breaking her surprise. He shook his head. “The reason I am doing this is to show him the true face of the people he was siding with. Those eyes… I gave them to him for a reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>The power of those eyes… he knew the temptation and fear they carried. Even he himself wasn’t unaffected. But that’s why he gave them to Itachi…</p><p><br>Let him see the same people he was willing to betray his family for, turn against him due to those eyes… because there was no way anyone would allow such a power to keep on existing.</p><p><br></p><p>As for him using those eyes on the Clan… even if he were to somehow bypass the cooldown period of the technique, it would be for the best that he doesn’t use it… at least that way he can keep using those Mangekyo again.</p><p>   <br>He had sealed a technique in those eyes that would destroy them if the user ever tried to use Kotoamatsukami. But even without that technique, a pair of Mangekyo Sharingan was very strong. Just the normal Genjutsu capability and perception boost from it was far beyond a normal Sharingan not to mention the Susanno…</p><p><br></p><p>Fugaku didn’t hate his son… but that didn’t mean he wasn’t disappointed. It chilled his heart to think what could have happened if this whole incident hadn’t happened. His son had really gone astray… and it was a father’s duty to show his son the right path.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Jiraiya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He sat in the corner of the room, waiting for everyone to gather for the meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day the Uchiha Clan was going to disclose the results of their investigations of the whole incident.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one, people filled the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya was sure his sensei was getting removed from his position as Hokage… probably the first kage to be ousted from their position in the history of the Elemental Nations. Sigh…</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the picture of Minato on the wall… which had been replaced after the last one was taken by Naruto…</p><p><br></p><p>How would he feel if he were here now?</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya’s mind has been in turmoil… especially since he was summoned to Mt. Myoboku by the Toad Sages.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow the Prophecy he was chasing all this time… was void.</p><p><br></p><p>It was shattered and the Great Toad Sage had another dream. In this dream, he saw a figure with icy blue eyes and black hair. He stood in the midst of a frozen world. Even the lines of fates which approached him were being sliced to pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>The description only reminded Jiraiya of one person.</p><p><br></p><p>The Great Toad Sage has been in a critical situation since he saw that vision. Apparently, even just a glimpse of that person had injured his spirit greatly…</p><p><br></p><p>Just what kind of beings did they get involved with this time?</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, Jiraiya was left with nothing…</p><p><br></p><p>He had lost his friend, lost his student and was probably going to lose his sensei too. He was really at a loss at what to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could think more, the door opened and Asuma Sarutobi entered the room. Behind him was the Fire Daimyo himself along with the rest of his Guardians.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone stood up and headed to meet the Daimyo.</p><p><br></p><p>“Jiraiya, Tsunade… so glad you both are here to take care of things. How did such a thing happen? Just what…”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are about to discuss exactly that, Daimyo-sama. The Uchiha Clan is about to present their report.” Tsunade replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good… in that case, we would like to witness it too.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and offered him a seat at the head of the table.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a minute later, Fugaku Uchiha opened the door and entered with several of his clansmen following him.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the Daimyo with surprise and bowed slightly before looking at Tsunade.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let the meeting begin. I think we all already know of the incident which happened a week ago but I would still like to jog everyone’s memory and report everything from my point of view.” Tsunade stood up and addressed the meeting and basically recalled everything she had seen that day.</p><p><br></p><p>He saw the Daimyo’s face paling at Tsunade’s story.</p><p><br></p><p>“The attack was done because they had tried to prevent Naruto Uzumaki, who is presumed to have been the contractor of the Dragons from returning back to their realm against his will. The first attacks were made by Danzo Shimura at the green dragon and then towards Naruto Uzumaki and another child who was also a dragon. Their attack was a retaliation. Later on, the destruction of the Hokage Mountain and the… final attack which made the… countrywide trench was done because Danzo Shimura had tried to use his stolen Sharingan to take control of the two dragons.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did they want, Tsunade? How did you all stop them and send them back?” The Fire Daimyo asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They winced.</p><p><br></p><p>“We didn’t send them back… They left of their own will… on the condition that we will leave Naruto Uzumaki alone from now on. From their discussions, I could understand that the leader of the group considers Naruto as an adopted brother of his. He found out about the way Naruto was treated and Naruto has been staying there with them since then. This time Naruto had discovered his heritage and had come to take the picture of his parents from Konoha when he was stopped by the third Hokage… and the rest you all know. As for how we stopped them? We didn’t. Their leader didn’t want a fight from the start. He had even ordered them to not attack anyone unless they were attacked first… which they were. Even during the whole battle, they only retaliated when attacked first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So… they left? Just like that?” the Fire Daimyo asked, astonished.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do we know where they came from? Where is this Summoning Land of Dragons? I have never heard of dragons as summons before in my life, even in the old scrolls of the Hyuga Clan.” Hiashi Hyuga asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No one knew they existed before this. Not even the Toads of Mount Myoboku or Lady Katsuyu of Shikkotsu forest knew of them existing. We think they live in a completely different world separate from ours and Naruto was able to accidentally reverse summon himself there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So… you are trying to say that all of this was just a big coincidence?” Shikaku Nara asked, sarcastically.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. The attack itself was due to the hasty decisions of Hiruzen Sarutobi and his advisors.” Fugaku Uchiha spoke for the first time, getting everyone’s attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“As Tsunade-sama stated just now… they had only attacked in retaliation. Moreover, their entire reason for getting angry was the unfair treatment of Naruto Uzumaki. What Tsunade-sama missed to mention was that they had called Naruto Uzumaki a possession and weapon of the village, further provoking the ire of the dragons and then attacked the green dragon girl first.” That was something Jiraiya hated too but he hadn’t said anything back then.</p><p><br></p><p>From an objective point of view, not losing the jinchuriki of the village was a priority task but Jiraiya knew that today people were not here to logically look at things but rather to find a scapegoat to blame everything on and sensei and his advisors… were just too convenient to pass up.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh… he was right to stay away from all this politics.</p><p><br></p><p>Fugaku continued. “This matter would have never arisen had they done their work properly and treated Naruto Uzumaki as the Fourth wanted him to be treated. Even then, there was a chance that things wouldn’t have escalated to this degree if they hadn’t attacked first and tried to negotiate with a non-violent enemy first. That way, not only could we have the village’s jinchuriki back but also gained the support of such… powerful beings.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is… is there no way to reconcile with them?” The Fire Daimyo asked meekly.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade shook his head. “We don’t know where they came from and where they went to. Naruto was… very lucky.” She then looked at Fugaku. “Do you have the reports?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and put forward a scroll and unsealed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Several dozen files appeared on the table and he passed them over to every member on the table, including the Daimyo.</p><p><br></p><p>“Danzo Shimura, an advisor of the Hokage and the leader of a secret branch of anbu under his direct control called the root has been involved in too many things. The files in front of you contain the information about whatever we could find about him. Too bad he died and his body was destroyed or we could have the Yamanaka check through their memories to find the true extent of the damages he has caused.” Fugaku began as they all opened the files and began pursuing the contents.</p><p><br></p><p>The more he looked the deeper the frown on his face became.</p><p><br></p><p>Human Experiments, dealing with Orochimaru, kidnapping and assassinating members of Konoha Clans for techniques and kekkei genkai, colluding with nuke nin of other villages, looting villages and merchants to fund their missions, threatening orphanages to recruit. The root training regime and graduation test made him disgusted… was this the Konoha they preached about?</p><p><br></p><p>Was this the Will of Fire?</p><p><br></p><p>And Sensei was allowing all this to happen?</p><p><br>At this point, even Jiraiya couldn’t ignore the mistakes of his sensei… this was just too much.</p><p><br></p><p>The further he read, the more disgusted he became.</p><p><br></p><p>Sabotaging people, spreading false rumours and propaganda… Apparently it was them who had spread the information about Naruto being the reincarnation of the fox and sensei had tried to cover it up as him honouring Minato’s last wish…</p><p><br></p><p>That bastard was also involved in some shady deals during the nine tails attack and had been constantly spreading rumours about the Uchiha Clan in the village.</p><p><br></p><p>“In fact, these are only the things that we were able to find out from our investigation. With the help of a thorough search from the Yamanaka Clan, we can discover even more information from their minds.” Fugaku completed, remarkably keeping himself in control. Especially considering the fact that the death of Shisui Uchiha was caused by Danzo Shimura according to the reports.</p><p><br></p><p>“H-how can this be happening in Konoha?” The Fire Daimyo started. “Did Hiruzen know about this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If he did then he was as guilty as Danzo Shimura for letting this happen and if he didn’t know anything was amiss, then he is clearly not competent enough to sit in his position anymore. As for what he is, you will have to ask him by yourself, Lord Daimyo.” Jiraiya felt bad but looked around and found that no one said anything to refute it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Either way, from what I have heard, he is not fit to continue as a Hokage after losing his arm and leg. The village has lost many ninjas, so soon after the Nine Tails attack. We have even lost the fourth, Orochimaru has rebelled and now this, not to mention the jinchuriki of the village has been taken by… Gods. We are in an incredibly dire situation right now with the other villages eying us. We need to elect a new Hokage as soon as possible and stabilise the situation.” Surprisingly, it was Hiashi Hyuga who said this.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya knew he wasn’t wrong either but tried to remember and recalled the incident of the Kumo Head Ninja where Hiashi’s brother was sacrificed.</p><p><br></p><p>While he understood that it was the best possible choice, trading the life of one person for the like for hundreds in a potential war, especially right after the nine tails attack, he could also understand Hiashi’s anger with sensei about it, although the Hyuga Clan head was too good to show such a thing to anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes… then who is to become the next Hokage?” The Daimyo questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I propose Jiraiya-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think Tsunade-sama should take the seat. She is the granddaughter of the First and the grandniece of the Second, not to mention one of the Sannin. The village would regain its morale if she were to take the helm.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya raised his hand. “I do not wish to stand in the contest. My Spy Network needs me outside the village, more so now than before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>At this time Tsunade also raised her hand. “I do not wish to take the position either but I recommend Fugaku Uchiha. The Uchiha Clan has been treated unfairly but even then has continued to contribute to the village. Fugaku and his son Itachi have been major contributors in the previous battle and he is more than capable of taking the position of the Hokage. In case everyone has forgotten, the Uchiha were one of the founders of the village too. Anyways, we can vote.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough there were some doubts in the people while some didn’t agree with the choice but the vote cleared everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The only one who could stand in competition was Kakashi but he had been running around, weeding out spies.</p><p><br></p><p>Guy hadn’t been in the village during the attack. When he returned he was immediately sent out on another mission, not that anyone would recommend him as the Hokage.</p><p><br></p><p>Shikaku Nara directly pulled back.</p><p><br></p><p>In the end, only Hiashi Hyuga and Fugaku Uchiha were left.</p><p><br></p><p>And so… Fugaku Uchiha became the fifth Hokage of Konohagakure.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kaguya Otsutsuki -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Where was she?</p><p><br></p><p>She tried to remember and the last thing she could remember was being sealed by Hagoromo and Hamura and leaving her will behind to free her at a later time.</p><p><br></p><p>The following years were just her, powerless, all alone, trapped in eternal darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there was a sudden shaking. She felt the seal being cracked open but unlike what she was expecting, it wasn’t Zetsu who had freed her but rather, her seal being broken down by someone. The next thing she knew, she was buried in the ground below.</p><p><br></p><p>Her form was that of a spirit who couldn’t wander further away from her place.</p><p><br></p><p>She had no body and even her spirit was weak, almost fading due to the long period of sealing. She didn’t even have any chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, what she needed the most… was a body to latch on to so that she doesn’t fade away.</p><p><br></p><p>She soon felt a life nearby and quickly forced her spirit to move and latch onto it before she lost consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The last thing she remembered before losing her consciousness was seeing the towering figure of a girl… and Byakugan.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Hiashi Hyuga -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“How could that happen? Fugaku Uchiha, the new Hokage?” The elders clamoured between one another.</p><p><br></p><p>Their pride had been hurt when their biggest rival, the Uchiha had become a hokage.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, this would have been impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Every Clan Head knew how the Uchiha were treated by the upper management of the village, not to mention how the selection of the hokage happened.</p><p><br></p><p>It was always someone from the Hokage line.</p><p><br></p><p>From First Hokage to the Second, then Third and even the fourth was the student of the Third’s student.</p><p><br></p><p>Even last time, the only recommendations for the position of the Hokage were Orochimaru and Minato, both people related to the Third Hokage…</p><p><br></p><p>If some gained a strength and reputation comparable to them but wasn’t from the same line… they were removed.</p><p><br></p><p>A prime example would be Sakumo Hatake… or how could the information about such an important mission become public knowledge?</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone knew what was happening but no one interfered, afraid of facing the same end as the White Fang.</p><p><br></p><p>So, an Uchiha becoming the Hokage was the last thing anyone could imagine, especially after the Nine Tails fiasco… but who could have thought?</p><p><br></p><p>In the end, Hiashi’s name was given just so there was some competition. With Tsunade and Jiraiya backing away, and Tsunade recommending Fugaku, his ascension was all but decided. The Fire Daimyo was also in a hurry and quickly agreed to this.</p><p><br></p><p>But what surprised Hiashi was what happened later.</p><p><br></p><p>Fugaku Uchiha’s first decision as the Hokage was to strip the elder council of their position and have them searched thoroughly by the Yamanaka.</p><p><br></p><p>If they found anything awry, the search would then move to Hiruzen Sarutobi too. Everyone knew they would find something, after all, they had been at the top for several decades. It would be a miracle if they hadn’t done shady things, especially with Danzo and Orochimaru running around.</p><p><br></p><p>The only relief for Sarutobi was that the investigation’s results will not be made public so as to not cause too much chaos in the village during this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Now if that first decision was expected, the next one was completely out of the blue.</p><p><br></p><p>Fugaku Uchiha selected his new council and while many if not most expected him to choose from his own clan, he actually chose Tsunade, Shikaku and… him…</p><p><br></p><p>Yes… the Uchiha Clan head had chosen his clan’s biggest rival’s head as an advisor.</p><p><br></p><p>Third was the decision of dividing the duties.</p><p><br></p><p>Uchiha had always managed the Police Force alone. This had always put them at odds with the Konoha civilians. To reduce this, he had opened the police force to other clans.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hyuga were chosen for this as their Byukagan could help monitor the village just as well as the Sharingan could.</p><p><br></p><p>With just this small move, Fugaku showed people that he was not favouring his clan and actually taking power away from them whereas what it did was share their burden with other clans, removing the Uchiha as the sole target of the public’s ire when law was enforced.</p><p><br></p><p>As for taking away the power, Hiashi was sure the Anbu’s composition would change soon enough so no hair was lost on their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>It even made Hiashi doubt if the position of the Hokage suddenly made everyone a better politician because these were not things he could have expected from the previous Fugaku.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the… Gods did knock some sense into him while beating him up?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Gods…</p><p><br></p><p>It was something Tsunade had heard herself and after the show of power… no one doubted it either.</p><p><br></p><p>The purpose of the Fire Daimyo coming here… was to make Shrines to appease the wrath of the Gods…</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, one of the people investigating the incident from his court was also a member of the Fire Temple.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say the monk was beyond appalled at the news that actual Gods had descended and punished Konoha…</p><p><br></p><p>They were currently having the shrines constructed in place of the Hokage Mountain as a show of their apology.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fire Daimyo himself wanted to inaugurate the shrine in a festival while the monks from the Fire Temple had been called to offer prayers there.</p><p><br></p><p>Hiashi and the Hyuga Clan were in charge of this entire operation and he had sent his assistant, Haru Hyuga with his daughter Hinata to check the location before the construction could begin.</p><p><br></p><p>As the meeting finished, he stepped out of the room and saw his daughter who had returned, carrying… a bunny.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh… Hinata… he was always worried about what she might face if she continued to be so kind.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps, his new position could allow him to somehow change the age-old traditions of his clan.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, if an Uchiha could become the Hokage… there was no way the Hyuga couldn’t change.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Omake (Alternate End)(Crack) -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, there is no way normal ninjas can stand up to them. We need to do something.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hiruzen looked at the girl floating in the sky who was giving off a pressure far surpassing that of the dragon above and decided that he needed to do something.</p><p><br></p><p>At that point, he could only think of one jutsu which had any chance to stop them.</p><p><br></p><p>So taking one last breath he prepared himself.</p><p><br></p><p>He had committed many mistakes and now was his chance to correct them so he didn’t hesitate. He made the hand seals for the jutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>"When the tree leaves dance, one shall find flames. The fire's shadow will illuminate the village, and once again, tree leaves shall bud anew.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, no!” He heard Jiraiya’s shout. He must have figured out what he was about to do but Hiruzen didn’t waver.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly he felt a chill run down his back as the jutsu took effect.</p><p><br></p><p>He rushed the girl who merely looked at him without making any moves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shiki Fuin!”</p><p><br></p><p>A translucent figure appeared in front of him. It was a gaunt spectre with a demonic visage. It was much larger than an average human, possessing long, shaggy, white hair, from which two red horns protruded, as well as purple-hued skin. It was draped in a large white kimono and carried a set of prayer beads and a sword in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Hiruzen concentrated on the person he wanted to seal and the figure moved but rather than attacking the girl… it sheathed back his sword and then looked back.</p><p><br></p><p>A severe chill ran down Hiruzen’s spine when he was started by the blank dark eyes of the figure.</p><p><br></p><p>Then it spoke…</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p>It spoke…</p><p><br></p><p>“You want to seal her?”</p><p><br></p><p>The words sent shivers down Hiruzen’s very soul but he nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>The Shinigami and the girl both stared at him for a while and Hiruzen’s mind and heart were running over their capacity… when the Shinigami opened his mouth again.</p><p><br></p><p>“You nuts, bruh…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>With that the Shinigami disappeared again.</p><p><br></p><p>Hiruzen on the other hand looked at the girl and the next second, he was embedded into the ground… an arm and leg mangled beyond recognition…</p><p><br></p><p>But beyond the pain, only one thought ran in his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>What just happened?</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href="https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am finally back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Some people had asked me to show what happened in Konoha after that… war?
