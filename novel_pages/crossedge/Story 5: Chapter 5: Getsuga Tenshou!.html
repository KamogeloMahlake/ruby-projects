        <p><strong>Story 5: Skillful Reincarnation</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 5: Getsuga Tenshou!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sam -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>One hour had passed and the Bloodlines were copied. I felt a massive change in my body. My location and situation however didn't permit me to check those changes properly.</p><p><br></p><p>I could only see the cards merge and form something completely unexpected.</p><p><br></p><p>My Lucifer Bloodline changed completely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Ranked ??? Bloodline</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The colour of the card was far darker than that of even Sirzechs which meant it was stronger than even Sirzechs' Bael Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>It was so strange that even the System didn’t have a name for it. I guess I am thankful it doesn’t say Biblical Cocktail as the Bloodline name.</p><p><br></p><p>And with the change in Bloodline came a massive increase in my Demonic Power. It was soaring at every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>It was already in the mid levels of B Rank and was now climbing up at an insane rate,</p><p><br></p><p>But those were not the only ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Swordsmanship and Senjutsu from Vasco and Tobio were copied too, pushing my own Swordsmanship to higher levels of B Rank for both.</p><p><br></p><p>The only ones left were the A Ranked Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from the ones I was copying from others, I started a copy on another one of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dimension Lost’s A Ranked Space Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>My Skills were rising at an extremely fast rate.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially the ones related to my Bloodlines.</p><p><br></p><p>The Holy and Light Magic Skills had jumped up to B Rank, almost on the verge of breaking through the next Rank. Same with the Light and Holy Resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>My Holy Demonic Magic on the other hand had jumped up to an outrageous A Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>But this was not the end. No, it was not even close.</p><p><br></p><p>The time felt as if passing by at snail’s pace.</p><p><br></p><p>With my control over the barrier I could feel that Georg and Leonardo had awakened but were trapped with the magicians.</p><p><br></p><p>Cao Cao was still waiting for the signal. Not that he would be able to do anything. This barrier was made to stop the likes of Sirzechs. Cao Cao was just not on that level.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the time to meditate and use my new Senjutsu to calm myself and prepare my mind for the upcoming fight.</p><p><br></p><p>The range of my sensing was covering the whole room and I could feel the whole school. Rias and Kuroka were in the Old School Building and they were with the other members of her peerage as well as two other strong auras.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn’t seem like they were fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>Worried, I called her first, just in case I was worrying unnecessarily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you both need help?” I asked, without talking about anything unnecessary.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Continue what you are doing. We… were identified by Koneko.”</p><p><br></p><p>… we forgot about the smell.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.” I replied blankly at our dumb oversight. “If you want then you can wait for around two more hours. I trapped Cao Cao. Georg, Leonardo and basically the entire Hero Faction as well as the Magicians, even stole the Dimension Lost and Annihilation Maker. They will be trapped till I let them go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How long till you are done?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two hours. Then I will give the signal. If you want then you can inform your brother. I even left a mobile in the wall, under the right hand corner of the main window of the Principal’s room. It can connect to my own if he wants to talk.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I will send Souji and Beowulf to inform Onii-sama about it.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood her meaning. She was sending them there to give me a chance to copy their Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will. You do too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, I felt two people move to the Principal’s office from the Old School building. Their cards appeared in front of me as soon as they entered my range.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a quick look at their Skills and without any delay, started to copy their B Ranked Swordsmanship Skill Cards.</p><p><br></p><p>One was the sole Knight of Sirzechs, someone who took a Super Devil like him two knight pieces to reincarnate, the strongest Knight of the Underworld. His skills as a swordsman are no less than Vasco Strada. Beowulf was similar and although not at the level of Souji, he was still a master swordsman.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part was that each of them had a completely different Swordsmanship style than what I had been using. Which meant a greater increase in my skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I was waiting, the mobile rang.</p><p><br></p><p>The number was the one which I had left in the Principal’s office.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and picked up the phone.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This day was turning out to be a massive roller coaster of emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been extremely busy solving the issues which were predicted by Rias’ new pawn. In fact, some of the information helped them bring all three Abrahamic factions together.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael and Azazel were willing to listen. Obviously he had to prove the veracity of his source of information as well as the danger the Khaos Brigade were posing.</p><p><br></p><p>They had already been looking for a chance to sign a Peace Treaty and now with Kokabiel’s attack as a trigger, they even had a reason.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the reasons why Azazel didn’t do anything to stop him when he was carrying out his plans and even Michael, reduced the guard on the Excalibur swords so that they could steal it easily. On the plus side, it helped them discover the traitors among their ranks who were siding with Kokabiel. Needless to say, they were purged.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered how Kokabiell would feel if he knew that the swords he stole were embedded with spells to monitor him. All his actions, each and every one of his associates were discovered if he made contact with them even once after stealing the sword. The Alchemists of Heaven and Azazel made sure the spell seemed like a part of the Sword’s magic instead of a surveillance spell.</p><p><br></p><p>WIth Ajuka’s help, Kokabiel had no chance of ever discovering anything.</p><p><br></p><p>He had then revealed the plan of attack on the Peace Conference by the Khaos Brigade and the attackers involved.</p><p><br></p><p>Three of the Top Four Longinuses were on the other side. Not to mention the people from the Old Satan faction blessed with Ophis' snakes willing to go as far as self-destruct to take them down.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, everyone had come here, despite knowing the dangers for the sake of Peace between the Three Biblical Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>His thoughts were broken by the knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>"May we enter, Sir?" He heard Souji's voice.</p><p><br></p><p>"Enter." He ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Souji and Beowulf entered.</p><p><br></p><p>"Is everything done there?" He asked. He had stationed his Peerage members to protect Gasper.</p><p><br></p><p>"Yes. The attackers were subdued. It's just that…" Beowulf hesitated.</p><p><br></p><p>"Ojou-sama and Koneko-kun's sister are here."</p><p><br></p><p>He stopped himself from getting up and going there right now to bring her back home.</p><p><br></p><p>As much as he would like to do it, what she was doing there was extremely important for the future of their entire race. He, as a Satan, can't do so even if he wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>"How is the situation on their side?"</p><p><br></p><p>"She said that there is a mobile in the wall, under the right hand corner of the main window of the Principal’s room."</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow. Grayfia used a magic circle and cleaved the wall cleanly. Sure enough, there was a mobile in there.</p><p><br></p><p>"It was left there by her pawn and we can talk to him if we want to. She said that he has been dealing with the attackers before they began attacking."</p><p><br></p><p>"Are we talking about the mysterious seer you told us about?” Azazel enquired.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded in reply as he called the number.</p><p><br></p><p>It rang twice before the call was picked up. </p><p><br></p><p>"Is this Samuel?"</p><p><br></p><p>"<em>Yes. Just call me Sam. Am I talking to Rias' elder brother?</em>" A young male voice sounded from the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>His lips twitched slightly at the question. It was the first time someone had addressed him as Rias' brother and not Satan Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>"Yes."</p><p><br></p><p>"<em>Alright. The users of Dimension Lost and Annihilation Maker have been subdued. The barrier is currently under my control. I have trapped the True Longinus user as well as several Sacred Gear users and Magicians in their own barrier. Need around an hour and a half before the signal for attack comes. </em>"</p><p><br></p><p>"What?" He asked, failing to register the words for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>"<em>The Sacred Gear users and Magicians have been trapped and the barrier is under my control. Among the Longinus users, two have been subdued while True Longinus user is trapped. When the attack starts, I will inform you before time. At that time, I will throw in some of them to draw in the real targets, the Old Satan faction.</em>"</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Apparently he didn't hear wrong because everyone in the room heard the same and had similar looks on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>"Where are you?"</p><p><br></p><p>"<em>I am under a barrier on the school premises.</em>"</p><p><br></p><p>"Can you come here without attracting any attention?"</p><p><br></p><p>"<em>It could be risky.</em>"</p><p><br></p><p>"No need to risk anything. Although, we would like to meet you sometime if possible."</p><p><br></p><p>"<em>... alright. By the way, would anyone be interested in some Sacred Gears? We kinda need a few things and would like to trade a few of them off.</em>"</p><p><br></p><p>Trade?</p><p><br></p><p>"Have you extracted them?" Michael asked, listening to the offer.</p><p><br></p><p>"<em>None of them were hurt. If that's what you are worried about.</em>"</p><p><br></p><p>"Interesting. How did you manage to do that?" Azazel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>"<em>I have my ways. Are you interested in the trade?</em>"</p><p><br></p><p>"Sure, why not.” Azazel replied, looking amused.</p><p><br></p><p>All this time, he was wondering what was going on with the whole situation. How did a call to judge the severity of the attack turn into a trade for Sacred Gears?</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Well, I currently have a buffet in front of me. Dreamlike Curse, Aegis Mineralisation, Night Reflection as well as a few.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what do you want in return?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Swords. Holy or Demonic named swords, more specifically Arondight which is with the Fallen Angels and… the spear in your pocket for Asia Argento.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>A Spear?</p><p><br></p><p>He saw a look of surprise on Azazel’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>“You really have a great appetite, don’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>I am just asking for a fair deal.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you think it’s a fair deal?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Your spear, while good, will disintegrate after one use. If it’s merged with Asia’s Twilight Healing though, it will not only gain stability but also enable her to heal anything within a certain area. She gets a means to protect herself and you get enough data to make stable Sacred Gears. Yes. It is a fair deal.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you think the resident of the spear will agree?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>...you do realise that you all are gathered here because of the things I know. And yet you question my words? Sigh Asia is a natural born Dragon Tamer. Her natural talent is so high that she can even tame some Evil Dragons. Convincing that fetishist Dragon wouldn’t be hard.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“So you really do know about certain things. But still… we are allies. Can’t I get a discount?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Hmm… no. You are allies with the Devil faction and the current Satans. I am however not a subordinate of the Satans.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs didn’t stop him as he wanted to know what kind of person this Samuel White was. Till now, he had only heard about him from others.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel eyed him and he nodded. “Oh, then where does your loyalty lie? We had just asked both the Heavenly Dragon’s hosts what they wanted as they had the power to subvert this peace. You can do the same with your skills although in a different way. So, we would like to know where you stand on this Peace Treaty and… what is it that you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Peace is good, ya know. I am totally for it. In fact, I don’t understand why people would want to start a war in the first place. So troublesome. I am more of a family man. I’d rather lay on my couch and watch anime than go and fight in a war. In fact, my dream is to become a doctor.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Several people calmed down visibly at the answer. Azazel was not joking when he said that he could subvert peace of the whole world if he wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>Just twisting one of the several visions he has had could cause entire wars.</p><p><br></p><p>“A<em>s for my loyalty, it only lies with Rias Gremory. I am doing whatever I am to help her. And as you all know, she is currently not a part of the Three Factions, so neither am I.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>He was not exactly offended by the statement. In a way, he was glad that his sister had someone who genuinely cares about her by her side.</p><p><br></p><p>“I promise you that Rias will be welcomed back whenever she wishes to return. Her name will be cleared. The only reason I haven’t done so already despite the contribution you two have made is to avoid any suspicions towards you while you’re there." He quickly reassured him.</p><p><br></p><p>"<em>And I thank you for that.</em>"</p><p><br></p><p>"You have done a great service to the Three Factions and are still doing great work. Being rewarded for it is only obvious." Michael added.</p><p><br></p><p>"<em>Oh, is that so? Will Heaven also reward me?</em>"</p><p><br></p><p>"If there is something we can do then we would obviously like to help you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Great. First things first then. I would like the Church and Heaven to issue a public apology to Asia Argento and Xenovia Quarta for betraying them.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Michael’s words got stuck in his mouth. In fact, the entire Heaven’s side looked disturbed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem quite attached to this Asia Argento?” Azazed asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Obviously. I am her big brother.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. He had heard of it from her.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael took a deep breath and answered. “Asia Argento’s case was due to our own circumstances.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Oh I know that. The System is not working well due to you not being as proficient as your Father. The balance and all that, I know about it all. You forget who you are talking to.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael stopped while on the other side, Sam continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>But it seems you people don’t understand the situation here. You all mooched off her hard work to gather faith and then when it got inconvenient, you just threw her, a seventeen year old girl away to survive in this world. And to begin with, she was exiled for healing a devil, right?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Go on, answer.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes…” Michael replied, looking pained.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>A Devil, injured at that, got into the church premises near a holy maiden, who I assume remains under some kind of protection at all times, and survived long enough to get healed and leave without revealing their identity. Only the fact that he was a Devil was revealed… am I the only one or does the whole situation seem kinda sus?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Heaven’s side was completely quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>I am not foolish enough to think that no one from the church was involved in this mess. Over the last two years, over one dozen Saintesses and Holy Maidens were exiled from the church for one reason or another and yet none of them were investigated. Are you telling me that none of you noticed this?  And let’s assume that you knew about her innocence and still exiled her only for the stability of the System, even then, there were several things you could have done. Arrange a source of livelihood for her. A way to assimilate her back in the general public. Provide her with some funds and some measure of security since she was being targeted by someone. But No. You all did nothing about it. Do you know why?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael looked ashamed and Gabriel was looking down. Even the exorcists looked down, fists clenched.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>The actual reason is that none of you actually cared. After all, what can a mere seventeen year old girl do? Same for Xenovia. She was kicked out of the church for knowing the secret of your father’s death. But… almost the entire top brass knew the same and yet… every last one of them are still there while she was kicked out.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not how….” Dulio Gesualdo tried explaining.</p><p><br></p><p>“I understand your anger but you must understand that the situation was not so easy..” Vasco Strada stated.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>The situation eh?</em>” The voice on the other end took on a slightly steely tone for the first time. “<em>I don’t understand the situation huh?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada looked directly at the mobile at the centre of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>No Mr. BodyBuilder Priest, it’s not me who doesn’t understand. It is you people. Let me explain how. One thing first, Issei, can you leave the room for a moment please?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, me?” Issei looked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Yes. It won’t take long. Give me two minutes.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at him and Sirzechs nodded so he left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Now that we are out of danger of Issei going Juggernaut Drive and erasing all of you before I can complete my sentence, let’s continue. My little sister was shamed as a witch and thrown out of the Church after they took advantage of her since her childhood due to you people’s negligence, got killed once due to Azazel’s negligence and the whole situation started because of Ajuka Beelzebub’s negligence.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>He winced as did the other leaders at the blatant reminder.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy on the other side continued. “<em>You ask me to understand the situation. Let me tell you what the situation actually was… if she hadn’t met Issei that day and was not saved by Rias, she would have died only to be resurrected by the one who organised the whole situation… only to be repeatedly violated till her mind breaks and she accepts that piece of crap as her saviour and God… just like the other Saintesses and Holy Maidens before her. You know, the same ones who put their trust in you people and were betrayed and called witches.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>The exorcist became extremely quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>My respect for the Church is in the negative. It’s right there with the Old Satan faction idiots. Actually, in a way even those idiots are better than you all. Do you know why?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>No one answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>At least when they do bad, they get a bad rep for it. You people on the other hand do as much if not more evil and still act as self righteous individuals who have the sun shining out of their… ughh behinds.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, he’s not wrong.” Azazel shrugged, but unlike normally, no one even bothered to reprimand him for it again.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael took control of the situation and again spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise for the situation with Asia Argento. It was our mistake and I can’t tell you how much I regret it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Archangel Michael.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Saying my bad, I’m sorry doesn’t fix everything. If it did, there wouldn’t be a Fallen Angel and Devil faction in the first place.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Damn.” Shemhazai whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>And he couldn’t agree more.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t met this guy but Azazel couldn’t remember Michael getting schooled that bad ever. The same went for the Church people.</p><p><br></p><p>First when he had heard about Sirzechs’ claims about a Seer, he was extremely skeptical. The information which he brought later on did somewhat make him believe in the idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Confronting Vali and confirming from him was what finally made him believe the news of this Samuel White.</p><p><br></p><p>Although Vali seemed oddly protective of the boy and didn’t give him much information about him.</p><p><br></p><p>But one thing was confirmed that this Samuel White was someone whom Vali had come to respect.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>The first step to correct a mistake is to accept that you have committed the mistake, take responsibility for it and then work to make amends for it. Sirzechs is currently protecting Asia and Azazel is going to give her a method of self protection. They are doing their parts, you should do yours too.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>My sister was publicly shamed and called a witch and while she might not say anything because it’s not in her nature to blame anyone, she needs to have her image cleared publicly. I am not asking you to do something extreme but sometimes little things go a long way. Even now when, despite the pain, she still prays everyday. Do something about it. Same goes for Xenovia.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael’s face took on a serious expression. “I give you my word that I would make sure both of them get the justice they deserve. We have really wronged them and I will make amends for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Oh and Mr. Strada, please send Tosca to Rias’ older brother. I will unseal her when I go there for a meeting next. In the first place, you people didn’t deserve to keep her with you. Oh and make sure you give those Holy Sword factor pills… a good burial. They are still made up from the body parts of murdered kids. Don’t distribute them and call those abominations, blessings. Have some shame.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Heaven's side looked red from shame.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel wished he had a camera for this occasion. The sounds of the verbal slaps could be heard from the Heavens.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Well that’s it.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? That’s it?” Azazel asked, sarcastically. This guy just gave Michael enough nightmare fuel to throw him into a century of depression and self-guilt. “Nothing else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>What else would I need?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel rolled his eyes. “What else, he asks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Okay. I need to get to work now. I will send a message when it’s time.</em>” With that the call was cut.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs looked at Michael. “I apologise for his behaviour. He is a young man from what I have heard and they can get quite passionate about their thoughts.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael however shook his head. “No. He didn’t lie. We did make a mistake with not only Asia Argento but also every other person he pointed out.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah. He was hurt badly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Moreover, in the entire conversation, he only got angry once and that too for someone else’s sake. He seemed like a very kind young man.” Gabriel joined.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs.” Michael continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heaven would like to offer the reconstructed Excalibur Blade and one favour as an apology and a reward for the services.” He then turned towards Vasco Strada. “Investigate everyone involved with the exile of the Holy Maidens and nuns and arrest anyone who had a part in it. His words might have been harsh but they were true. We did betray our believers for the sake of our own convenience. There were other ways we could have handled the situation but we didn’t make an effort. This was our fault.”</p><p><br></p><p>"Yes, Lord Michael."</p><p><br></p><p>“So… we apparently don’t have to worry about Dimension Lost and Annihilation Maker. Their combination would have been a nightmare to deal with in an overdrawn fight. And with the True Longinus user being trapped, all we need to worry about is the Old Satan faction. He more or less handled half the battle by himself before it even started. But seriously… what’s with your sister’s luck? First she finds the host of the Boosted Gear and now she unearths someone like this?” He asked Sirzechs who looked to be in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“Her luck has blessed us with a hope for a long period of actual peace. Let’s be thankful that she is willing to put herself in such a situation to preserve this hard earned peace. I have come to hear of the situation in the Underworld and if possible, we would like to help her out in some way too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs shook out of his reverie and thanked Michael for his consideration. “The work they are doing for our factions will not go unrewarded. I, as the current Lucifer… will make sure of it myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Well, both of the leaders added something then he can’t stay back too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will see to it that everyone gets proper training for their Sacred Gears.”</p><p><br></p><p>They all discussed the upcoming attacks until the signal was sent.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched as Koneko and Kuroka hugged each other, seeing more emotions on her face than she had seen for years.</p><p><br></p><p>But she had others who needed her too.</p><p><br></p><p>Gasper was latching on to her, crying as she tried to calm him down.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia, despite the relatively small time they had spent together, had tears in her eyes and Akeno… Akeno didn’t say anything, just stared at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Her best friend, sister in all but blood looking at her with pained eyes and almost reflexively words came out of her mouth. “I’m sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>As Akeno was about to explain more, she came in front of her and hugged her, breaking down into tears, apologising repeatedly about the Rating Game.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was not your fault.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. It was. I… I could have used that power. Things could have been different if I did. But I didn’t. I held back even when you were in danger… for my own pettiness.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her voice was choking as she tried to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias just hugged her and slowly drew circles on her back, just like Sam did before, till she calmed down.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you are at fault, then I am just as much if not more at fault. But right now, we can't do anything about it. Living in pain will not help anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Yuuto...”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would not want any of us to live like this.” She cut off her statement even when she herself was feeling pained at the mention of the name.</p><p><br></p><p>A while later, everyone calmed down a bit and she told them about today’s plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to fight you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot reveal my identity to the enemies. We still need to pretend that we are on their side to find out what they are planning. For this reason, we need to fight and we need to make it convincing. I want you all to attack us with everything you have.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Noooooooo.” Gasper shouted, time stopping as she disappeared and into a corner of the room. “I don’t wannaaaa attack you, Buchou!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will only be staying here, Gasper. We need you to use your Sacred Gear and the magic prepared by the attacking magicians to stop time temporarily to give them a feeling that their plan was successful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t need to fight them directly, you know.” Kuroka came to the rescue. “You could always fight the other two Devils and their peerages. It’s not like they will stand a chance against you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fighting against both Sona, Latia and their peerages? It’s too dangerous.” Akeno protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nyahahahaha not really nya. They are good but the Princess here is far stronger. I have heard how they did against Kokabiel. If Rias were to seriously go after them, they wouldn’t stand a chance. Not to mention I will fight alongside her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is not wrong, Kuroka-san. Fighting against entire peerages can be dangerous. Moreover, they have others on their side too. The Slash Dog, Tobio Ikuse and the Trump Card of Heaven, Dulio Gesualdo. They even have Vasco Strada on their side. You participating in such a fight would be too dangerous Ojou-sama.” Mathers also pointed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Onee-sama.” Koneko protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything will be fine nyaa. It’s not like we are here alone. Sam is talking to the leaders of the Three Factions. They would be aware of the plan too. We won’t be in any danger.” Kuroka explained.</p><p><br></p><p>It took a lot of time to finally convince them of the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>And just at the time, she received a call from Sam.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are ready.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sam -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Three hours had passed.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at my Skill list in blank shock. I mean I was expecting to get strong today but this….holy crap.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>S Ranked Luck</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Severing</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Cutting</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Space Magic</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Demonic Mutation</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Holy Demonic Magic</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Ranked ???

And my Demonic Power soared again, finally breaking through to the A Rank mark….and still rising.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, with the Swordsmanship from both Souji and Beowulf, my Swordsmanship crossed the A Rank mark.</p><p><br></p><p>The Rank of Dimension Lost increased when I copied the Space Magic from it. The insights and knowledge I got from it made it easier for me to use it, thus the increase in Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>I finally looked at the comprehensive strength.</p><p><br></p><p>My comprehensive strength was at A Rank right now.</p><p><br></p><p>It brought a one metre increase in range and another new one time use card.</p><p><br></p><p>Delete Card.</p><p><br></p><p>It did just as its name stated.</p><p><br></p><p>Deleted one card from anyone I used it on.</p><p><br></p><p>The conditions for deleting a card was the same as copying them from someone. I needed to stay within the range of the person till the card was deleted which made it nigh impossible to use in an actual fight. It was weird in a way. On one hand, it could make Ophis go from one of the strongest beings to one of the weakest and on the other hand it was hardly usable on people who were a genuine threat. Both strongest and weakest at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally….I can have a voice in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next half an hour, I went around stealing the Sacred Gears from the entire Hero faction, except a few from whom I had already taken Skills before.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder if we could merge the named Holy and Demonic Swords with the Blade Blacksmith from Jeanne and give it to Xenovia to use.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I completed everything, I got the message from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>They were getting impatient and it was time for attack.</p><p><br></p><p>I passed the message on to both sides.</p><p><br></p><p>The battle of the Peace Conference had finally started.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sona Sitri -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere in the room had gone quiet. She could feel the tension in the air on her skin. The pressure was massive.</p><p><br></p><p>The mobile in the middle of the room rang again and it was Grayfia who picked it up.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is time.” The voice from the other side said and everyone went into battle mode.</p><p><br></p><p>Even her sister went from her cheerful self to the one who had fought in the Civil War and was known as one of the strongest devils alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, she felt a shift in the atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked around her and found everything paused.</p><p><br></p><p>It had begun.</p><p><br></p><p>She and the rest were protected due to being in contact with the Satans through Saji’s Absorption Line.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking outside the window, she saw the magicians and devils appear.</p><p><br></p><p>In between the place, large magic circles appeared.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Leviathan and Asmodeus Clan’s Magic Circle….Katerea Leviathan and Creuserey Asmodeus.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel looked at the White Dragon Emperor and the Slash Dog. “Go on. Have fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>Archangel Michael sent the exorcists too while Lord Lucifer sent two of his peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>The White Dragon Emperor threw a look at Issei and then a fleeting gaze at Vali. “Don’t get in between my fights.”</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Balance Breaker</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Vanishing Dragon Balance Breaker’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Divine Dividing Scale Mail.’</p><p><br></p><p>A flash of light surrounded him and when it disappeared, he was covered in a White Armour. He jumped out of the window and flew towards the army, crushing anyone who stepped in his way. She felt a shiver down her spine at the level of power he was exhibiting. Even Latia, beside her, was stunned at the show of power.</p><p><br></p><p>The Slash Dog, Tobio Ikuse on the other hand was far more polite. He bowed at them. “I apologise for Vali. He is a bit anti-social but he doesn’t really mean anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel then threw a bracelet at Issei. “You can use this to temporarily enter the Balance Breaker state. Go on. I know you want to join the fight too.”</p><p><br></p><p>He joined in the fight and was doing reasonably well even when he wasn’t anywhere near the level of the ones who went before him.</p><p><br></p><p>Those monsters were crushing their opponents completely one-sidedly.</p><p><br></p><p>The Satans tried to negotiate with the Old Satan faction leaders but they were adamant on fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel took on the Leviathan descendant while the members of the Lucifer peerage confronted the Asmodeus descendant together.</p><p><br></p><p>She too looked at Latia and stepped into the first.</p><p><br></p><p>Their work was to keep Kuroka and Rias, who was under disguise, occupied.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough an attack came towards them. She and Latia both used barriers at full strength to defend. One of their barriers broke almost instantly and the other one barely held back the attack. She looked at the attacker and saw two black haired girls. One of them had golden eyes and cat ears and two tails while the other was a blue eyed one.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at each other. </p><p><br></p><p>Rias was going through a very period of time and while there were some things which she didn’t agree on, what she was doing was something very few would dare to. For this alone, she could respect her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you?” She asked as she conjured water snakes.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Stella. I have heard the little sister of Serafall Leviathan is quite talented. Let me see if those are only false rumours.” Rias smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>She was provoking her, knowing what she hated and using just that.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, it was a good thing they needed to put on a convincing show.</p><p><br></p><p>She sent the water snakes to attack. Her peerage members, Reya and Momo also used spells to attack while Saji and Tomoe ran towards her to attack at a close range</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka in the meanwhile engaged Latia and her peerage in a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>She was expecting her to put up a barrier to defend against the attack but contrary to her expectations, she just walked towards her at a casual pace.</p><p><br></p><p>What the heaven was she thinking?</p><p><br></p><p>She even had a smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as Sona was wondering what happened, an attack from one of the stray magicians landed near her, breaking her attention. Her spell deviated, attacking the path Tomoe and Saji were on. They slipped and fell right in front of Rias who….gathered demonic power in her legs and kicked down, the force of the kick cracking the ground and knocking the two out instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two down. Five more to go. Thank you for the assist.” With these words, she rushed towards them directly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona broke out of her shock quickly and conjured several water snakes, sending them towards her but….one of her Magic Circles malfunctioned, sending it astray, crashing into the other water snake, clearing her path directly.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsubasa and Tsubaki stepped in front of her to guide her.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias sent a barrage of magic spells towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsubaki took the lead and used her Mirror Alice and absorbed the attacks to reflect them back. Just as she was finished, Sona noticed a smile on Rias’ face and realised that they were tricked.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, the attacks bounced off of her easily.</p><p><br></p><p>She had used harmless light spells, just making them look like magic bullets to trick Tsubaki into using her Mirror Alice and sending it into its cooldown time.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsubasa confronted her while Reya and Momo attacked her with spells.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias took Tsubasa’s punch but rather than confronting it directly, she directed it towards the side.</p><p><br></p><p>Martial Arts?</p><p><br></p><p>She knew that she wouldn’t be using her Power of Destruction. And while all High Class Devils, especially Pillar Devils were taught basic Martial Arts to defend themselves no one except outliers like Sairaorg Bael practised it or even used it in actual combat.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially Rias, who mostly preferred using magic to fight. Just what had she done in the last few months to match her Rook, no, toy with her rook like that?</p><p><br></p><p>“Cover Tsubasa.” She commanded as she did the same. “Back her up, Tsubaki.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tsubaki rushed while they prepared her spells.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile, Rias had managed to land a blow on Tsubasa’s guts, making her gasp for air. While she collected her, she twisted her hand and threw her at Tsubaki in what looked to be a Judo throw. Tsubaki caught Tsubasa, suddenly taken aback at the unexpected attack, blocking her hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias took this opportunity to rush towards them and take a hit.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona guided her water snakes to cut off her path and cover the two but this time, Momo’s attack went astray and attacked her water snakes, changing the path and attacking Tsubaki from the back while Rias took the opportunity to strike from the front with a punch infused with massive amounts of Demonic Power, sending them flying and knocking them out almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona forcibly crushed her shock and analysed the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why she could rush so quickly was because there was some method she could use to disturb their magic and redirect their attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it some kind of magic or artifact to disturb magic?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>It was something else probably.</p><p><br></p><p>The first attack which deviated her water serpents came from the other side. Which means it was probably not magical interference. Also, controlling magical interferences at such a level is a feat done only by Ajuka Beelzebub as far as she knew.</p><p><br></p><p>Mastering such a technique would take a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>So this had to be something else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you taking it easy on me by finishing off your own peerage members?” She taunted.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona reflexively answered. “Lucky shot.”</p><p><br>"I guess you could call it that."</p><p><br></p><p>As they were about to continue fighting, a figure crashed into the school building, completely destroying one side of it.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked there to see the Governor General of the Fallen Angels, Azazel getting up from the wreckage.. She looked at the attacker and it was….the White Dragon Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere quieted down instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you betraying us too, Vali?” Azazel looked up at the White Dragon Emperor while being helped to his feet by the Slash Dog. “Then again, you were always like them too. A descendant of their blood?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone looked up at the White Dragon Emperor as eight devil wings popped out of his back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Vali Lucifer, the half devil great grandson of Lucifer and the White Dragon Emperor. He is what you would call a satanic miracle child and the strongest White Dragon Emperor to ever exist.” Azazel said. “What is your reason for doing this, Vali?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I just wish to challenge those stronger than me, Azazel. Your idea of peace doesn’t go well with this.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two other Satan descendants flew beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since you have already decided on this, there is nothing to talk about.” Azazel brought out a golden dagger from his coat’s pocket. “Balance Breaker.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Downfall Dragon Another Armor.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>A flash of light later, he was covered in a golden scale mail similar to the White Dragon Emperor and flew up again.</p><p><br></p><p>Her sister and Archangel Gabriel joined the fight as well.</p><p><br></p><p>She almost instinctively tried to step in their direction only to be interrupted by a blast of magic in front of her. “Not now princess. You are not ready for that level of fight yet. I would be extremely sad if you were to be vaporised suddenly just by accidentally wandering close to those monsters.” She looked at the disguised Rias and realised what she was doing there.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight continued.</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada swung his sword, releasing a wave of Holy Power towards them. The Leviathan and Asmodeus descendants flew away towards her sister and Gabriel while the White Dragon Emperor got ready to face them.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio Ikuse also used his Sacred Gear to send a wave of black swords towards him and behind him Souji also joined.</p><p><br></p><p>Both attacks raced towards him, tearing up everything in front of it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this moment that a hole in space appeared directly in front of the White Dragon Emperor Vali.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of it came another familiar figure.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy with the mask. He held a sword in his hand. As the attacks came nearer, he swung his sword casually in a horizontal swing and Sona watched in awe as the attack which looked unstoppable to her….was cut into pieces and scattered into the air. The shockwave from the clash hit them near the outer parts of the battle field and she was thrown back several steps before she could barely stop with the help of barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are late and that was my fight.” Vali Lucifer looked annoyed at the guy who merely scratched his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha I opened a portal and saw an attack coming towards me. Scared the life out of me so I acted reflexively. Sorry about that.”</p><p><br></p><p>What bullshit. How was that a reflexive action?</p><p><br></p><p>“As for me being late. I was looking for the Hero faction. It seems those idiots tricked us. The barrier is locked but they are not participating in the fight. Seems like they want us to get beaten up. Scary!”</p><p><br></p><p>He remarked, almost childishly.</p><p><br></p><p>“A friend of yours, Vali?” Azazel asked, as he flew up to face Vali directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. Nice to meet you. My name is….Ichigo Kurosaki and I am gonna be the King of the Pirates….believe it dattebayo.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>She looked towards her side at Rias and asked. “Is he mad?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rias just looked embarrassed while Kuroka who had just forced Latia towards them laughed at her question. “He is her boyfriend.”</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p>Wait….is he?</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Rias for confirmation who didn’t deny anything but rather had a light blush.</p><p><br></p><p>Once more she looked at the guy and back at Rias. “Seriously.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I told him not to fool around today.” She replied slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka on the other hand just laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>They however didn’t have much time to laugh as the battle started in earnest.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Issei used the bracelet made by Azael to enter a Balance Breaker mode and join in.</p><p><br></p><p>The new guy faced Vasco Strada, Tobio Ikuse and Okita Souji while Issei went after Vali, backing Azazel up who looked to be a bit injured from the previous sneak attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone watched from the side to find out more about the new guy, whom by now Sona was pretty sure was the mysterious Samuel White from Rias’ reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada went in first, slashing down with a replica of the Durandal while Souji and Tobio attacked from both flanks, each of them going for a vital part.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Satan class beings wouldn’t take such an attack lightly and yet….and yet, the guy, self-proclaimed Ichigo Kurosaki stood there motionless.</p><p><br></p><p>The next second they understood the reason why when under the stunned expressions of everyone, he lifted his sword, blocking all the three slashes with….the tip of his sword. All their swords were….stopped by his sword tip striking at the point where their lines overlapped together.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the three attackers didn’t believe it.</p><p><br></p><p>He twisted his wrist and their swords were scattered from their initial path.</p><p><br></p><p>The three took their positions around him but what came after was completely unexpected. It seemed as if he was dancing in between them, all their attacks passing just by him, never actually touching him even lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>All of those three were swordsmen whose skills were recognised by the whole world, said to rival even Gods. Two of them were even touted as the strongest humans alive and yet, they were being toyed around by one man without being able to put any kind of resistance at all.</p><p><br></p><p>From the start to the end, he used nothing but swordsmanship in the fight to take on all three of them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Vali Lucifer -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He kicked his so-called fated Rival, making him go crashing into the ground once more.</p><p><br></p><p>It was disappointing.</p><p><br></p><p>He had heard from Sam that this person would grow on to rival him in a very short time, surpassing all the previous Red Dragon Emperors who came before him, even releasing the true power of the Heavenly Dragons but right now….all that seemed like an empty dream.</p><p><br></p><p>From the corner of his eyes he looked at Sam who had grown stronger once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>They had all noticed his abnormal jump in power over time and his ever changing magical aura.</p><p><br></p><p>Albion had conjectured that it could have something to do with the summoning ritual. Maybe he was forming some kind of connection with the dead since they were trying to summon Lucifer in his body originally. These dead souls’ memories and powers were being inherited by him somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>It could be anything. Since the ritual was destroyed, they would never know. But one thing was for <a href="https://sure….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sure….it</a> was not normal.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was not like he minded it. The stronger people he could fight, the better he would get so having an ever evolving sparring partner beside him will only push him to grow stronger. It was a win. As for him getting <a href="https://stronger….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">stronger….it</a> was only normal. He was a Lucifer. It was absolutely understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side, Katerea was getting beaten up by Serafall Leviathan and Gabriel while Azazel was owning the foolish Asmodeus.</p><p><br></p><p>Katerea was thrown into the ground by a jet of Holy Water, making a crater in the place where she crashed. One of her arms was missing, frozen at her elbow.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with the borrowed power from Ophis, she didn’t have anywhere close to the Skill necessary to face the likes of those two. One was someone who had faced and defeated even her ancestor while the other was someone who was said to have surpassed her ancestor. The same ancestor which she drivels about so much, her only claim to fame.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will say this again, Katerea. Give up. We don’t need to end it like this.” Serafall Leviathan offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“You! Do you think this will end so easily? Do you think we will let it end just like that? Even if we die, we will make sure you all suffer too.” A black aura appeared around her.</p><p><br></p><p>Self Destruction?</p><p><br></p><p>But contrary to everyone’s expectations, she gathered the aura in her hand and she threw <a href="https://it….at" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">it….at</a> Serafall’s little sister….who was fighting with….</p><p><br></p><p>He wanted to move in but the attack was too fast. The area where they were exploded as a small mushroom cloud went up the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Several auras exploded at that very instant.</p><p><br></p><p>A quick look showed him that Serafall Leviathan was looking at the scene with a vacant look in her eyes but the one whom he was feeling the most danger was from Sirzechs Lucifer. His skin was being tinged with his aura of destruction as he looked at the explosion with a blank gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>Even he himself felt an unexpected burst of rage well up within him. “What is the meaning of this Katerea?” He growled. “You attacked my people.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was the Asmodeus who answered, being able to get back as Azazel himself was shocked at the sudden change of events and provided him with an opening.</p><p><br></p><p>“She should be proud that she was able to be of use to the True Satans. You shouldn’t have brought weaklings with you. She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his fists. “When you die today….remember that it was your own fault.”</p><p><br></p><p>‘Vali, get away from this place. Quickly.’</p><p><br></p><p>He backed away as fast as he could as a shout was heard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Getsuga, Tenshou!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….” Katerea looked in the direction of the sound but she was too late.</p><p><br></p><p>A wave of black light flashed.</p><p><br></p><p>Even as he was backing away, Vali saw a thin line appearing on Katerea’s body, vertically, before her body was bisected in two and fell down.</p><p><br></p><p>The look of confusion still plastered on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>But what attracted his attention was not Katerea but rather what the attack had caused behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire barrier meant to stop several Satan Class beings was cut apart.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind it….the clouds in the sky were also bisected in two, leaving the moonlight sky for everyone to see.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked in the direction of the explosion which was cut apart in the previous attack and a figure slowly appeared in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>There, he stood, his mask had broken down, his body covered entirely in blood, carrying the Holy Sword Durandal in his hand and twelve wings spread behind his back as wisps of black fire slowly healed his wounds. Behind him, was a barrier where the girls were on their knees completely safe.</p><p><br></p><p>And then he spoke while eying the Asmodeus, “I was attacking a mosquito. She was <a href="https://just….in" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">just….in</a> the wrong <a href="https://place….at" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">place….at</a> the wrong time.”</p><p>____________________________x_________________________________________________________x_____________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><a href="https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I know people will not believe this when I say that I really didn’t plan for this cliff.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I truly didn’t.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I just reached my usual chapter length and this was the best place to stop.
