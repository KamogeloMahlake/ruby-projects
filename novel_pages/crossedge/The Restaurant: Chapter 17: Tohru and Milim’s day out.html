        <p><strong>Isekai Restaurant</strong><br><br><br><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong><br><br><br><strong>Chapter 17: Tohru and Milim’s day out</strong><br><br><br><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong><br><br><br><strong>- Silas -</strong><br><br><br>We searched around for Naruto and Kanna but found no clues anywhere.<br><br><br>An hour or so later, even the Masters of Ryozanpaku arrived at the Restaurant looking worried. Just as we were thinking of going out and searching once more, the door to the Restaurant opened and in came both Kanna and Naruto.<br><br><br>“Naruto, Kanna!” Miu rushed towards them and hugged both the kids tightly.<br><br><br>Even we let out a sigh of relief as they looked safe and sound. Hayato-san went ahead and checked on them. “The kids are fine.”<br><br><br>“Where did the two of you go?” Miu asked, angry. I could understand her anger too. She looked worried out of her mind. But angry as she might have been, she was still hugging the kids close to her as if afraid that she would lose them again.<br><br><br>“I… I am sorry, Miu nee-chan. I was… I just wanted to get a picture of my parents.” He showed a picture he was carrying to us. “I got one but I couldn’t get any of my kaa-chan.”<br><br><br>We looked at the picture of the blonde haired blue eyed guy smiling brightly in the picture. He looked like an adult version of Naruto. How different from the monstrous figure of the cursed spirit who protects Naruto.<br><br><br>His words stopped any complaints from Miu. Hayato-san however kneeled in front of him and brushed his hair. “If you wanted this, you could have told us. We could have brought it for you. But you didn’t tell anyone before going there which had everyone worried. You understand that, right?”<br><br><br>“Umm. I won’t do it again.”<br><br><br>“Good. Now, can you tell us where you were and how you got this late?” He asked.<br><br><br>They were about to speak but Kanna’s stomach growled and she looked at me. I let out a sigh. “I will get something to eat for you two.”<br><br><br>I did just that.<br><br><br>While I went inside to whip something up quickly they told us about their adventures.<br><br><br>“And then we caught fishes from the river and cooked them over fire. We even met Sasuke and I had a spar with him.”<br><br><br>“Oh, the boy from your academy?”<br><br><br>“Hmm. This time I won. You should have seen his face, Gramps. I totally kicked his ass dattebayo.” He was quite proud.<br><br><br>Several of us in the Restaurant knew about Sasuke, mostly from Naruto’s words. The top student of his class and also the one who always defeated Naruto.<br><br><br>“Then we went to the Ichiraku Ramen to meet Teuchi Jii-san and Ayame nee-san and ate ramen there.” He paused for a moment.<br><br><br>“What happened Naruto?”<br><br><br>“Umm… the old man, I mean the Hokage came there with another guy and asked me where I was. He said he would give me the picture of my mom and dad and then took us with him.” He continued, his voice lower this time.<br><br><br>I brought the dishes out by then and put them in front of them.<br><br><br>“They didn’t force you, did they?”<br><br><br>“Umm… he said that I had to attend the academy there because my parents would have wanted that… and when we tried to leave, they stopped us.”<br><br><br>Everyone in the Restaurant was frowning by now.<br><br><br>We had expected something like that could happen if he were to go back, especially knowing about the fox.<br><br><br>“That’s when Tohru-sama came and opened a portal for us to leave.”<br><br><br>“Hmm but they even drew swords at Tohru-chan. Nii-san, she will be fine, right?” Naruto asked as I froze.<br><br><br>“They did <em>what</em>?”<br><br><br>“They attacked us with something but Milim stood in the way. We didn’t see what happened later.”<br><br><br>I tuned the rest out and looked at the time.<br><br><br>Kanna and Naruto had returned fifteen minutes ago.<br><br><br>“Wait here. I will bring them back.” I said as I walked towards the door.<br><br><br>“I will go with you. Tohru can get a bit rowdy when fighting. I might be able to help.” Lucoa stood up.<br><br><br>“Let me join you guys too.” Rimuru got up.<br><br><br>I opened the door to Naruto’s world and the first thing I saw was a massive beam of energy passing right in front of my eyes, destroying everything in its path. We weren’t affected in the least due to the Restaurant’s protection but the sheer power of the attack sent shivers down my spine.<br><br><br>I turned my head to the side mechanically and looked at the mountain wide trench whose end I couldn’t see. As for where Milim and Tohru were… I didn’t even need to search for them.<br><br><br>There was a green coloured dragon in the sky and a pink haired Demon Lord floating in front of us.<br><br><br>Crap…<br><br><br><strong>- Jiraiya -</strong><br><br><br>The one who took the lead to attack was Danzo but he quickly stepped back and sensei took charge, directly summoning Monkey King Enma. “Sarutobi… what kind of enemy made you summon me?”<br><br><br>“We don’t have time to talk, old friend. I need your help.”<br><br><br>“Alright. Adamantine Staff Transformation.” The Monkey King transformed into the legendary Adamantine Staff and sensei swung it towards the girl.<br><br><br>The result however was something completely unexpected… or maybe expected.<br><br><br>The girl raised a hand which transformed into a claw and held the staff with no effort. She then lifted and used it to swing sensei to the side, smashing the hokage tower completely with the attack. The Adamantine Staff left Sensei’s hand and was thrown away. It went spinning before it stuck into the wall of the Hokage Mountain, directly into the middle of the head of Sensei’s statue.<br><br><br>What strength…<br><br><br>Tsunade took this chance to jump forward and punch towards her and the girl didn’t back down and instead punched forward. The result was something which almost made his eyes pop out.<br><br><br>Tsunade, someone whose strength gave him nightmares, had her arm collapse from the attack and was thrown into the ground, creating a massive crater in the place she crashed.<br><br><br>Just what kind of absurd strength was this?<br><br><br>The rest of the anbu attacked her from all sides but she effortlessly dismantled all their attacks one by one.<br><br><br>But it seems even that power was just a trailer. The girl began to morph.<br><br><br>Her face turned draconic and then slowly the rest of the body followed while her size grew until she was the size of a tailed beast.<br><br><br>Moments later, a large green coloured dragon with black coloured wings was in the skies above Konoha.<br><br><br>Dragon.<br><br><br>A real Dragon.<br><br><br>There were really dragons in this world.<br><br><br>Just what kind of summons did Naruto get?<br><br><br>Sensei’s attacks hit the dragon who just shrugged it off as if nothing.<br><br><br>That attack… it could stop even a Tailed Beast for a while but this dragon…<br><br><br>Jiraiya might not have seen any dragons before this but he knew the reputation, the legends about them.<br><br><br>Dragons were synonymous with power.<br><br><br>And today he could see why… the power this dragon was radiating… it is unreal.<br><br><br>Suddenly a thought came to his mind.<br><br><br>What about the little girl who said they were weak and she could take care of them?…<br><br><br>He however didn’t have enough time to think about these things.<br><br><br>Right now, the village was in danger and he needed to stop the angry dragoness in front of them.<br><br><br>Damn Danzo. They shouldn’t have attacked.<br><br><br>Attacking summons was never a good thing. It would make the entire clan their enemies… <br><br><br>He looked at Tsunade who was still stunned. The splatters of the blood from her hand had fallen on her and she was in shock, unable to even move.<br><br><br>Dammit… now of all times.<br><br><br>Jiraiya looked around and quickly took command.<br><br><br>Hundreds of ninjas were gathering.<br><br><br>“Fugaku, send your son away and order the police to evacuate the area. Itachi, help me contain her.” He ordered. However, he couldn’t find the advisors anywhere.<br><br><br>Even Danzo had disappeared… seriously, those cowards…<br><br><br>Jiraiya hoped that the assistance of Uchiha could help ease the tension in the village and help mend the gap between them and the villagers.<br><br><br>Fugaku apparently had the same thought as he created a shadow clone and sent his son away with it and got to assisting.<br><br><br>He wasn’t idle either as he quickly made hand seals and used the Summoning Jutsu.<br><br><br>A giant cloud of smoke appeared and out came Gamabunta and he jumped on his head.<br><br><br>“Jiraiya, why have you called me this tim… holy crap, is that a dragon!”<br><br><br>“Yes… yes it is. Gamabunta, do you know anything about a Dragon Summoning Land?”<br><br><br>“A Summoning Land of Dragons? I didn’t even know they existed. Just how did you encounter one?”<br><br><br>“It’s… I will explain later. Right now we need to stop her before she can destroy Konoha.”<br><br><br>Fugaku commanded the military police to quickly evacuate the people around the Hokage Tower while Itachi sent a clone to actually remove Tsunade from the scene first.<br><br><br>“What is wrong with her, Jiraiya-sama?” Itachi asked.<br><br><br>“Tsunade… she has haemophobia. She won’t be able to assist if she doesn’t snap out of it.”<br><br><br>“Haemophobia?!” The boy was surprised but contained it in seconds.<br><br><br>Sensei had recovered from the previous attack and came out of the rubble of the store he had crashed into. He threw four fuma shuriken in four different directions, surrounding the dragoness. The shuriken transformed into his shadow clones in mid air, each weaving hand seals. All five of them used a technique of five different elements at the same time from five different directions, targeting the dragoness in the middle.<br><br><br>It was sensei’s trump card, the Five Release Great Combo Technique, something which only someone like him who had mastered all five elements could use.<br><br><br>This attack could halt the approach of even tailed beasts and was something which had played a great role in getting him the title of the God of Shinobi.<br><br><br>The attacks crashed into the dragon head on, creating a massive explosion in the sky about the Hokage Tower.<br><br><br>The night sky was lit up by the explosion and what was left was only smoke in the air.<br><br><br>“Is it over?” Jiraiya heard Gamabunta speaking.<br><br><br>Jiraiya doubted it.<br><br><br>Sure enough, a deafening roar tore through the night as the smoke from the explosion was cleared, the shockwave from the roar mowing down the surrounding buildings, revealing the almost pristine condition of the dragon.<br><br><br>“Gamabunta, assist Sensei.” he commanded.<br><br><br>This is not something Gamabunta can stop by himself so Jiraiya summoned two other toads to assist.<br><br><br>Gamabunta was also aware of the seriousness of the situation and drew his sword and jumped towards the Dragon but the dragoness just opened her mouth and blasted a beam of energy and Gamabunta was blasted away into the distance, disappearing in a burst of smoke.<br><br><br>Dammit, Bunta didn’t even last one attack.<br><br><br>The worst part was that the Dragon was just watching them confidently and not exactly attacking them.<br><br><br>She was… as if mocking them, giving them a chance to do their worst before she attacks. Such thoughts sent shivers down Jiraiya’s spine.<br><br><br>He suddenly realised that he had been completely mistaken about her being like a Tailed Beast.<br><br><br>She wasn’t like a Tailed Beast. No, Tailed Beast were just that… beasts. They attacked like one.<br><br><br>This one was intelligent, skilled at using her powers and thus far worse than Tailed Beasts. Such a being… how big of an asset could they have been if they had joined Konoha… if only, Naruto had been treated a little better.<br><br><br>As much as Jiraya wanted to rage and blame sensei, it wasn’t the time for it. Right now, he needed to save the village from what could be the biggest crisis it has faced since the creation.<br><br><br>The other two toads went on to attack the dragon but were being beaten into the ground. The rest of the ninja were continuously attacking the dragon but they couldn’t even scratch her.<br><br><br>Suddenly, Danzo landed near the place from wherever he was hiding.<br><br><br>“Danzo, where are your roots?!” Sensei asked, landing near them.<br><br><br>“The roots are assisting with the evacuation of the people.” He replied and Jiraiya didn’t even need to think to know that he was lying so it was only natural that sensei knew it too.<br><br><br>“You!”<br><br><br>Danzo however didn’t wait for the reply and jumped into the battle. Although, instead of the dragon, he went off the pink haired girl who was floating in the air, watching everything quietly.<br><br><br>“Capture her. We can use her to negotiate with the dragon.” He ordered the surrounding ninjas while he took the lead himself.<br><br><br>“Uwahahaha you all want to fight me? Alright, come. I will take you all on.”<br><br><br>Danzo sent several anbu forward. Surprisingly, Itachi Uchiha followed him and attacked the girl from all directions.<br><br><br>Later down the line, Jiraiya and everyone who survives this day would realise that this was the worst decision they could have made.<br><br><br>The girl laughed and a massive aura erupted from her and to the shock of everyone.. Her aura… was beyond anything they could ever imagine.<br><br><br>It made the dragon flying in the sky look like a candle flame compared to the sun. Many ninjas collapsed on the ground, fainting from the pressure she was releasing.<br><br><br>Jiraiya saw many Hyugas covering their byakugan as cries of agony erupted from them.<br><br><br>She raised her hand and an orb of energy was fired from her hand. It struck Danzo and blasted him towards the Hokage Mountain. The attack seemed harmless but that was only till it touched the mountain and then the ground shook as the entire hokage mountain was turned to dust, leaving a large valley in its place.<br><br><br>“Danzo!”<br><br><br>Sensei shouted and raised his newly recovered Adamantine Staff and raced towards the girl but was met with a strike from the dragon above. The dragon’s tail struck him, breaking his arm and sending him crashing into the academy building.<br><br><br>The dragon gathered energy in her mouth and fired a beam, ripping a landscape of konoha, creating a large canyon through the middle of the village.<br><br><br><em>“Pay attention when you are fighting me. I am giving you all a chance to try your worst. After that I will start attacking and nothing will be left of this land. You were the ones who made the first move, now pay for it.”</em><br><br><br>Suddenly, black flames appeared on the pink haired girl’s body.<br><br><br>Jiraiya looked to the side to see Itachi Uchiha covering his eyes as he kneeled on the ground.<br><br><br>The girl however was completely unbothered as her aura erupted again and the flames were scattered around. It was only when the specks of flames fell on some of the nearby ninjas that they understood what it could do. The ninjas were burned to ashes without any chance to defend themselves while the flames kept on burning.<br><br><br>“Don’t touch those flames.” Itachi shouted. “They cannot be extinguished.”<br><br><br>Jiraiya understood the meaning and quickly jumped ahead to seal the flames to prevent the surrounding ninjas from getting caught.<br><br><br>“This is not going to work. We need Tsunade. We need to contain the damage.” Four Red Yang Formation. They could do it to contain them for a while but they needed another strong ninja for that. Right now they only have Sensei, Fugaku and him. “Itachi, go and try to get Tsunade up. I will try to hold them back for a while.”<br><br><br>Itachi was about to leave but the girl raised a finger and fired a beam, ripping through his heart and causing a massive explosion around Itachi, taking down the entire block of the village.<br><br><br>“Itachi!” Fugaku shouted at the loss of his son. Surprisingly though, before he could do something, a figure jumped out from the flames.<br><br><br>Itachi Uchiha landed on the ground and stumbled on his knees, breathing heavily. To the surprise of everyone around, including the girl, he was uninjured. She however seemed more curious and didn’t attack, preferring to watch instead.<br><br><br>“Are you alright, Itachi.” Fugaku asked while Jiraiya also reached near them.<br><br><br>“I… I will live. I am sorry. You carry on with the plan. I have a way to bring Tsunade-sama back into the fight.” He said as he got up again but they noticed that one of his eyes… they had gone white while the other had a unique pattern, completely different from a normal sharingan.<br><br><br>“Itachi you!” Fugaku looked at him in shock.<br><br><br>“It’s for the village, father. Please assist Hokage-sama.”<br><br><br>“Fugaku.” He too called out and the man was an experienced veteran who collected himself quick enough.<br><br><br>“What’s the plan?” He asked while Itachi went towards Tsunade.<br><br><br>He started explaining the plan to Fugaku.<br><br><br>“Konoha has a jutsu called the Four Yang Flame Formation. It requires four Kage level ninjas to cast. You have the appropriate level of chakra and strength for it. The jutsu should be able to contain them while we can seal them.” He explained the jutsu to him while using the summoning jutsu.<br><br><br>There was only one thing he could think of which could turn the tides or at least give them some chance to hold back the enemies.<br><br><br>Two figures appeared this time, much smaller in size but anyone who knew them wouldn’t dare underestimate them.<br><br><br>“Ma, Pa!”<br><br><br>“Jiraiya-chan! What is going on? Gamabunta, Gamaken and Gamatatsu were sent back and they are in a critical condition. Who did this to them?”<br><br><br>“We are in very serious trouble. I need your help. I need to use <em>that</em>. Please.”<br><br><br>The two toad sages also looked around, freezing at the sight of the two dragons.<br><br><br>“Are  those… dragons… How did you get in such a mess, Jiraiya-chan?”<br><br><br>“It’s because the hokage couldn’t keep his attack dog in control and now the whole village is paying for it. Nothing new really.” To his surprise, it was Fugaku who replied, the rage in his tone evident.<br><br><br>“Fugaku!”<br><br><br>“What Jiraiya-sama? Are you going to ignore everything they did? It wouldn’t be something new. Perhaps the only new thing would be them hitting an iron plate this time.”<br><br><br>“It’s not a time to fight among ourselves, Fugaku. I promise you, I will do my best to assist you in representing the Uchiha Clan after this… but please… the entire village might get destroyed at this rate.”<br><br><br>“Jiraiya is right, Fugaku.” Another voice came from behind and this time a familiar one. He turned back to see Tsunade walking towards them. There was no trace of fear in her eyes. Itachi Uchiha was walking behind her with a crow on his shoulder. “Sensei and his friends have made too many mistakes and they will answer for that but that will only happen when there is a village. I also promise you the same as Jiraiya. If you want then I, as the sole member of the Senju Clan, will nominate you as the next Hokage but for now, we need your help. Please…”<br><br><br>“Tsunade.”<br><br><br>“Give me five minutes, Jiraiya. I need to do surgery on Itachi. He needs an eye transplant to replace his eye.” She then used the summoning jutsu to summon Katsuyu to start healing the ninjas.<br><br><br>“You got it. I need five minutes to prepare too.”<br><br><br>Tsunade started operating while Jiraiya started preparing for the Sage Mode. Meanwhile, Katsuyu healed sensei.<br><br><br>The rest of the ninjas only maintained a distance controlling the fires and evacuating everyone, not attacking the ninjas. Then again, very few of them could attack the airborne enemies.<br><br><br>Sealing Squads gathered around the place.<br><br><br>Five minutes later, he was finally in Sage Mode as he felt the rush of energy in him. The extra power boosting his confidence for a moment… only until he spread his senses and then he collapsed on his knees as he looked at the little pink haired girl in shock. “Tsunade…”<br><br><br>“What is it, Jiraiya? I am busy right now.”<br><br><br>“...we are going to die today.”<br><br><br>“Hah?”<br><br><br><strong>- Tsunade -</strong><br><br><br>To say that the day had been weird for Tsunade would be the biggest understatement of the century.<br><br><br>She had been in reserve in Konoha, getting treatment from the Yamanaka for her Haemophobia in preparation for a civil war which might erupt anytime.<br><br><br>Part of her cursing sensei and the other part cursing the Uchiha. Then again, it’s not like she didn’t understand their situation.<br><br><br>She too was the member of one of the founding clans of the village, one every bit as strong as the Uchiha.<br><br><br>And yet, the Senju Clan had disappeared very suddenly and in no part due to the negligence of sensei. It was obvious that Uchiha were facing a similar situation. But unlike the Senju, the Uchiha were not an idealistic bunch who would just lie in wait for the butcher’s knife to be swung on them.<br><br><br>Was this the village that her grandfather dreamed of?<br><br><br>The situation had become worse since the jinchuriki of nine tails had disappeared.<br><br><br>Some believed it to be the Uchiha’s while others thought that Danzo had a hand in it so imagine her surprise when she was told that the jinchuriki was seen in the village with the Hokage. She had obviously rushed to the Hokage’s office and found the Uchiha Clan head with his two sons, the Hokage advisors and finally two kids with sensei and Jiraiya.<br><br><br>It didn’t take her long to understand what was going on.<br><br><br>The kid, like Jiraiya, had somehow used the summoning technique without signing any contract and was reverse summoned to their land and then he had somehow learned about his heritage. It was obvious that the kid was pissed, not that she blamed him.<br><br><br>She would have ripped the old man a new one had he done something like that to her.<br><br><br>Then as usual, the advisors poked their noses in where it didn’t belong and made the matters worse.<br><br><br>It’s just that she had no idea how worse that situation had been at that time.<br><br><br>Dragons…<br><br><br>The kid had a summoning contract with dragons… who somehow existed in this world.<br><br><br>Even when she was seeing one in front of her, she had a hard time believing it.<br><br><br>Then again, she had felt that dragon’s strength. Her mangled arm was obviously no genjutsu and neither was her panic attack. She obviously didn’t know what the Uchiha kid had done with that sharingan implanted on the crow but it had completely wiped out the fear of blood she had been suffering from or she would still be incapacitated.<br><br><br>And now, when she was finally ready to fight in earnest after almost two decades, Jiraiya was acting strange.<br><br><br>It was obviously not his looks, which were extremely creepy. He had the two toad sages sticking from his shoulders, his features had morphed to look like a toad’s. It was his blank stare towards the girl floating silently in front of them as he lay collapsed on his knees.<br><br><br>“What do you mean, Jiraiya?” She asked, concentrating on the surgery first.<br><br><br>Jiraiya however didn’t reply.<br><br><br>The battle in the background raged.<br><br><br>No, calling it a battle would be wrong.<br><br><br>The dragon was massacring everything that attacked her.<br><br><br>Worried about Jiraiya, Tsunade tried to look at the girl and understand what was going on when a figure landed in front of the girl.<br><br><br>Danzo… wasn’t he… dead?<br><br><br>Something else however attracted her attention, along with the attention of half the battlefield more than the return of a presumed dead man. It was his arm.<br><br><br>For a moment she thought she was dreaming but the sudden roar of Fugaku Uchiha as well as the other Uchiha Clan members told her that she wasn’t seeing some kind of twisted Genjutsu.<br><br><br>Sharingan… he had ten sharingan embedded in his arm, one of which had closed and looked similar to Itachi’s own.<br><br><br>The arm itself looked white and unnatural but Tsunade could feel the vitality from it.<br><br><br>A thought came to her mind and she clenched her hand.<br><br><br>“Danzo!” She gritted her teeth. “If that’s what I think it is, I am going to rip you to shreds.” She growled.<br><br><br>The man however was not bothered in the least.<br><br><br>“Everything I do is for Konoha.” He ripped the bandage around his eyes to reveal another Sharingan which caused Itachi Uchiha to be shocked and she had to press him down so that he didn’t mess up the surgery. “You two have caused too much destruction in Konoha but I can forgive you. Obey me and become my servant. With your power, I can make Konoha rise to the top of the world.”<br><br><br>She looked at Itachi as he seemed to understand what was going on. “What exactly is he trying to do?”<br><br><br>“He’s… he is trying to control that girl. The Sharingan in his eye belonged to Shisui Uchiha and contains a jutsu called Kotoamatsukami. It can manipulate the thoughts and even free will of a person. It’s the strongest genjutsu in the world. Danzo is trying to make them his servants.”<br><br><br>The thought was frightening and for a moment she was frozen at what to do.<br><br><br>She didn’t know what was worse. A Konoha under Danzo or no Konoha at all…<br><br><br>However they were too late to do anything.<br><br><br>The girl narrowed her eyes.<br><br><br>“Oh… it’s you again. How did you survive? Is it those eyes again? Are you stupid? If you survived, you should have run away like the weakling you are. And not only that but also trying to control my mind? Are you that tired of living? Is it because I have been sitting and watching the show that you all are underestimating me?” The more the girl spoke the more her aura rose and now Tsunade understood the reason behind Jiraiya’s reaction. The Dragon… it was actually not the main danger… it is this little girl.<br><br><br>The girl disappeared from her place and the next second she appeared near Danzo, his arm ripped off and his eyes plucked as she held his arm and threw him into the sky.<br><br><br>The next moment she was in the sky looking towards the now destroyed Hokage Mountain. “You wanted my power, here, have it your way.”<br><br><br>She gathered a power in her hand and shot it towards Danzo who was still airborne.<br><br><br>A massive beam of light, unlike anything till now shot out from her hand. It covered Danzo’s figure and the mountain and everything behind it.<br><br><br>There was no sky breaking sound, no shaking of earth… nothing.<br><br><br>Just a beam of light which lit up the place in a straight line.<br><br><br>Even the Dragon who had been fighting all this time paused and looked at the attack.<br><br><br>When the light disappeared, she understood the meaning of Jiraiya’s words…<br><br><br>They were all going to die…<br><br><br>Tsunade had her whole life flash in front of her and she was sure many others would be feeling the same.<br><br><br>Was this the punishment for the lives they had taken, the families they had destroyed, the innocence they had ruined all these years?<br><br><br>Was this karma?<br><br><br>The hokage mountain had disappeared. Behind it, the land had also disappeared. What was left was a canyon whose end couldn’t be seen no matter how far she looked.<br><br><br>The entire battlefield had gone still as the weapons in the hands of the ninjas dropped one by one to the ground.<br><br><br>Tsunade looked at the girl in the air and couldn’t help but ask. “Are you a God?”<br><br><br>No answers came.<br><br><br>The girl wasn’t even paying attention to them. Not that she needed to.<br><br><br>One by one, the rest of the ninjas also collapsed to their knees. They had given up all their hopes and accepted the fact that they were going to die today.<br><br><br>It was then that they heard a voice.<br><br><br>“Tohru, Milim… just what in the nine hells is going on here?”<br><br><br>She looked at the figure of a boy standing on the top of a half collapsed building and looking at the two dragons.<br><br><br>Beside him were two others a blonde haired woman, or a dragon as was evident from the horns on her head and a blue haired young girl.<br><br><br>The green dragon looked at the boy and spoke. “Boss!”<br><br><br>Tsunade suddenly felt the entire world spinning around her.<br><br><br><strong>- Silas -</strong><br><br><br>I looked at the scene which wouldn’t have looked out of place in an apocalypse in front of my eyes. The destroyed buildings and scattered bodies… and I thought the fight with the crazy magicians and the war with the orcs was bad…<br><br><br>I was totally right to not let Tohru participate in those.<br><br><br>And Milim…<br><br><br>Tohru changed back to her human form and Milim floated to me too.<br><br><br>“Sil, what are you doing here?” Milim asked.<br><br><br>“What do you mean what am <em>I</em> doing here? What exactly are you guys doing? I remember telling you all to not cause any trouble. This… how?…”<br><br><br>“We didn’t make the first move, boss. They were the ones who attacked us first.” Tohru replied hurriedly.<br><br><br>“Yes yes, Sil, Rimuru. I didn’t attack first either. They attacked me with fire and even tried to control my mind and make me his servant. Only after that I attacked. I promise.” Milim added.<br><br><br>“They did <em>what</em>?”<br><br><br>“Yes boss. And they even said bad things about Naruto-kun like he was the property of the village and that he was the village’s weapon. That’s why I was so angry but I didn’t attack them even then. I only attacked them after they did first.”<br><br><br>I was not the only one frowning at the words. As much as I had wanted to deny it when Gojo-sensei analysed the true motives of the village leaders… now it seems that it was indeed true.<br><br><br>But if that were indeed the case then they would not let Naruto go easily and they might even come and try to cause trouble in my Restaurant which would mean danger to those close to me.<br><br><br>That’s simply not something I will allow.<br><br><br>Now… how exactly do I solve this?<br><br><br>I looked at Rimuru. He also seemed to be in thought and I could see that he was pretty annoyed too.<br><br><br>We had been there when Naruto had first come to the Restaurant and had seen the condition of the child and how much he had changed for the better after being adopted.<br><br><br>These people… they didn’t deserve a kid like Naruto…<br><br><br>“Boss, did I do something bad?” Tohru asked after seeing me silent for a while.<br><br><br>“Self defence is not wrong. If they attacked you first, then they were in the wrong. But let’s stop this war here.”<br><br><br>“But boss…”<br><br><br>“Tohru… while I understand your feelings, believe me, I am angry too but, we cannot punish the innocent people of the village for the mistakes of a few.”<br><br><br>“Yes. Remember, there are other innocent children the same age as Naruto in this village. If we continue this war, then they will be harmed too…” Rimuru added.<br><br><br>At least more than they are now.<br><br><br>This was enough to shut her up but shutting her up was not the main objective.<br><br><br>I looked around towards the crowd and used magic to amplify my voice. “Who is the leader of the village?”<br><br><br>The people all just stared at us without replying when Tohru stepped forward and roared loudly. “Come out you old monkey or I will raze this village to the ground right now!”<br><br><br>Almost moments later, an old man came out. He had an arm and leg missing. The stumps were wrapped with bandages and he was being supported by a… three headed toadman.<br><br><br>There are beastmen in this world?<br><br><br>Both the people stopped a distance from us and the old man spoke first. “I am Hiruzen Sarutobi, the third Hokage of Konohagakure.”<br><br><br>“He is the guy, boss. There was another guy with bandages but he tried to control Milim-sama and was blasted by her. He was also the one who called Naruto-kun a weapon.” Tohru pointed towards the old man and added.<br><br><br>“Naruto is not a weapon.” The old man spoke but Tohru interrupted him again.<br><br><br>“Oh! Now he isn’t a weapon when you have your ass kicked. I didn’t see you saying anything when that twelve eyed freak was insulting him. The toad guy was the only one who even tried to speak.”<br><br><br>Her words made me look at the toad guy.<br><br><br>“Tohru.” I put a hand on her shoulder to calm her down and then looked at the guy. “What happened here is regrettable, but not inseparable from your own actions. But we can both agree that this much is enough so I propose the end of this… war.” I said the last word unsurely. “Obviously if anyone still wants to fight, I will be more than happy to accompany them.” I added not to appear weak as I released a bit of my power.<br><br><br>“No!” The toad man said hurriedly. “We… accept.”<br><br><br>I nodded. “Good. In that case, we only have one condition. Naruto Furinji… or the one you call Naruto Uzumaki, will stay with us. This point is not negotiable. Aside from that we don’t care what you do with your village.”<br><br><br>“Naruto Uzumaki is the son of Minato Namikaze. He is a part of this village.” The old man said.<br><br><br>I noticed that the man’s proclamation surprised many people, even other ninjas.<br><br><br>“Oh… and what exactly is his role here? A chew toy for people’s anger or a weapon?”<br><br><br>“That’s not it!” The toad man protested.<br><br><br>“Then how exactly is it?” I questioned back. “You say he is the son of the former leader of this village and yet, he was living in an orphanage and was thrown out of one at the age of six. He has been living alone since the age of six, being scorned and hated by everyone. The kid didn’t even know his parent’s names.”<br><br><br>“We did that… to protect him.” The old man gritted out. “Minato had many enemies who would have gone after him had they known about his identity.”<br><br><br>“And? You run an entire village of trained assassins. Are you unable to protect the child of your former leader? Someone who sacrificed his life and endangered the life of his child to save your hides? Did Minato Namikaze have no close friends? Tell me, you are also the leader of this village, did your children and grandchildren also grow up in an orphanage, were they scorned by the entire village? Or are you just a useless nobody with no enemies that your children are so safe?”<br><br><br>He didn’t speak but I could see the anger in his eyes.<br><br><br>But I wasn’t done yet.<br><br><br>“And even if we assume that what you did was to save him from then what about the information of him containing the fox? He was discriminated against and abused mentally because of that.”<br><br><br>“Minato wanted his son to be recognised as a hero.” He replied.<br><br><br>“Oh. I was under the impression that Heroes were treated well by the people, like you know… heroes. Is it different in this village where the standard treatment of heroes is abuse?”<br><br><br>“Jinchuriki are always feared by people because of the danger they contain. The villagers couldn’t look past their fears…” He started to explain but I was stuck on something else.<br><br><br>“Jinchuriki… human… sacrifice… You… call him a sacrifice.” I gritted my teeth, feeling my rage bubble after a long time. Was it what he was for everyone? A sacrifice?<br><br><br>Beside me, Tohru was also enraged and was also  half transformed ready to blast the old man to smithereens and for once I wouldn’t have minded it either.<br><br><br>“I think that’s the term for someone who has a monster sealed inside them.” Rimuru’s voice sounded in my head.<br><br><br>Telepathy.<br><br><br>The old man continued to blabber some nonsense but I just raised my hand.<br><br><br>“So, why didn’t you do something about it? They were being dumb so you just let them. You, as the leader of this village, could have taken steps to solve this problem, explained things to them and yet you didn’t do anything? Why?”<br><br><br>“I did whatever I could. I forbid the spreading of the information to give him a chance to make friends his age.”<br><br><br>“And yet it was not enough. Obviously. The children will always follow the lead of their parents. I mean sure they couldn’t speak of that particular thing but they could still prevent their children from associating with him, effectively isolating him. If that was your goal then Do you know the first time I met him, he was surprised that a restaurant would actually offer him services.”<br><br><br>I observed a look of sadness on the face of the toad man. Did he actually care?<br><br><br>“But then again, if isolating him was your goal from the get go, then everything is understandable.”<br><br><br>“What are you trying to say?” The man asked, anger tinting his voice but he kept his tone in check.<br><br><br>I remembered the theories Gojo-sensei and even Shoko-san had come up with after learning about Naruto’s situation.<br><br><br>“Why, swooping in as his saviour when he is rejected by everyone, making him believe that you are the only person who cares. Isn’t that a sure fire way to gain his trust, make him loyal to you, and gain the power of the so-called weapon of the village?” The frown on his face deepened.<br><br><br>“I do not… I have never treated Naruto like a weapon.”<br><br><br>“You are the leader of a village of liars, thieves and trained killers. Do you think your words have any credibility? Moreover, didn’t you say that you were the third hokage? Then why did you come back again? Why didn’t you find a new leader? I mean sure it could have been an emergency then but years have passed and you are still the leader. Are you so reluctant to let go of the power? With such a personality, pulling something like that does seem something someone like you could do.”<br><br><br>“Everything I have done till now is to protect him… Naruto is the son of my successor. This is his home…” His words stopped as he looked behind me with wide eyes. The rest had similar looks and it made me look behind me and my eyes widened as well.<br><br><br>From the trench created by Milim’s attack, a huge wave, a mini tsunami of sorts was approaching us, about to flood the entire village.<br><br><br>Almost on instinct, I raised my hand and my Demonic Power came to life.<br><br><br>I used my <em><strong>Unique Skill: Flood</strong></em> to control and shape the water and then the <em><strong>Unique Skill: Frost</strong></em> to freeze everything. I pushed my power in and the tsunami as well as the water in the trench froze .<br><br><br>Just where the fuck did that come from?<br><br><br>Was someone attacking this village?<br><br><br>“Let me check.” Rimuru said as his wings popped out of his back and he took to the skies till we couldn’t even see him anymore.<br><br><br>He came down almost five minutes later and looked at <a href="http://Milim.”Oi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Milim.”Oi</a>, Milim… just how much power did you put in that blast? That trench… it’s connected to the ocean.”<br><br><br>…<br><br><br>What?!<br><br><br>“Ah… I held back you know but that guy tried to control me and I was angry and…” her voice got lower the more she spoke and I found my eyes twitching at her words.<br><br><br>“Oh my, that’s a problem. At this rate, the water will just wash everyone up when the ice melts. We can’t let that happen, can we.” Lucoa, who had been silent for all this time, spoke. “Let me do something about it.”<br><br><br>Then something happened which I would remember till the end of my life.<br><br><br>Lucoa turned into her dragon form… her ginormous dragon from.<br><br><br>I couldn’t even see her end from the place I was standing. I wasn’t the only one surprised. Even Rimuru was slapping my back in stunned shock as he looked at her form. Milim was surprised too although she seemed more excited than anything else.<br><br><br>Tohru was the only one unsurprised. “Lucoa is a former Goddess. This much is only normal.”<br><br><br>Lucoa went high up in the sky and roared and we looked, equal parts shocked and terrified as the moon in the sky cracked. A piece of the moon was ripped apart and fell down.<br><br><br>I was sure this was the very scene Dinosaurs would have looked at before going extinct but the rocks slowed down and were crushed by her power as they slowly fell in the trench, mending the whole trench once more.<br><br><br>When that was done, trees grew at a visible pace, covering the ground and the parts mended by her.<br><br><br>Finally, the moon was then reshaped back into its previous shape and was… dragged closer to the planet so the size that we saw remained the same as before. <br><br><br>Done with everything, Lucoa turned back into her human form and landed beside us. <br><br>“There, all patched up. I had to use the moon as taking that much land from anywhere else in the world would have caused a lot of more damage. I pulled it slightly closer to prevent any change of tides. Try not to cause so much damage next time, Milim.”<br><br><br>“Okay… that was totally awesome by the way. I didn’t know we could do that. I will have to try that someday.” Milim said, sending me into a bout of panic.<br><br><br>“No… no destroying or trying something like that or…”<br><br><br>“Or?” She asked.<br><br><br>Yes… what can I even threaten her with?<br><br><br>Then I remembered something and took a deep breath. “Or no desserts for you.”<br><br><br>As expected, the girl went pale and was instantly in my face. “No Sil, that's horrible. Rimuru! Tell him.”<br><br><br>“Well, he is not wrong, you know.” Rimuru supported me and finally Milim was pacified and I prevented a heart attack.<br><br><br>Can Archdaemons even get heart attacks?<br><br><br>The show of power from Lucoa had left everyone speechless.<br><br><br>I quickly took the opportunity of this and looked at the old man. “I have already said what I wanted to say. You can either obey or I will finish what was started today. Naruto is someone I consider my little brother. He is not and will never be anyone’s weapon.”<br><br><br>This time however no one spoke anything.<br><br><br>No one even looked blinked as they stared into the sky, at the moon.<br><br><br>I asked Tohru to teleport us away to prevent them from finding where we were going.<br><br><br>With that, quickly left the place.<br><br><br>I also made a vow to never let Milim or Tohru go to any other worlds, unsupervised.<br><br><br><strong>- Fugaku Uchiha -</strong><br><br><br>Two days had passed and yet, the village was still shaken from the events of that night.<br><br><br>In fact, not only the village but the whole ninja world was shaken. After all, one couldn’t hide the reshaping of the moon or the attack which created a trench across half the Land of Fire or the attack which froze all the water in that trench.<br><br><br>Maybe the only silver lining is that the major attacks were all near the hokage mountain and not towards the village or there would probably be no village by now.<br><br><br>It both relieved and terrified him to realise that the dragon, despite destroying a part of the village, was still holding back. It also made them realise how badly they would have ended up had that black haired man… the Dragon’s boss not come when he did.<br><br><br>This attack had brought to light a lot of darkness of the villages, the flaw of management and things they desperately hid.<br><br><br>But that was not all. It also brought to light the truth about Itachi.<br><br><br>His son had those eyes too. Itachi had the Mangekyo and he hid them… Not only that, he also had eyes of Shisui which contained… that… jutsu.<br><br><br>The scenario which came to mind after the reveal of this information was not good at all. Fugaku knew about Itachi’s feelings for the clan and the realisation of which side he might have stood had the clan actually rebelled… it chilled his heart.<br><br><br>But it was this feeling which pushed him forward to actually take a stand for his people. That decrepit old monkey and his friends had pushed the Uchiha far too much and had even turned his own people against them, probably intending to use them. The eye and arm of Danzo were the final straws for Fugaku and the rest of the Uchiha Clan.<br><br><br>The attack had in a way been a boon for the Uchiha Clan overall. First, the Clan was hardly affected by the attack being on the outskirts of the village. Second, the shock of the incident of that day had actually pushed a large part of his clan members to either awaken their sharingan or pushed their sharingan to evolve further, increasing the overall power of the Uchiha Clan by leaps and bounds.<br><br><br>Lastly, the reveal of information about Naruto Uzumaki and the things Hiruzen Sarutobi had hidden and the words of that man had brought about many opinions around the village.<br><br><br>To some extent, Fugaku understood the thinking of the people.<br><br><br>They were angry and needed someone to vent… just like they had done to Naruto. They obviously couldn’t or rather didn’t even dare to say anything about the kid or the dragons, at least not after the show of power by them, so the only ones who they could vent their anger on were the third hokage and the other advisors.<br><br><br>The rumours also helped out their clan as some people who had seen the sharingan in Danzo’s presence had spread the news, especially after seeing him trying to control such strong dragons. Now there were rumours of him being involved in the kyuubi attacks since he also had the means to do so. Moreover, Danzo’s actions preventing the Uchiha clan from intervening during the Kyuubi attack also worked against him.<br><br><br>Everyone… even Fugaku himself thought that he might actually have done so since he was targeting the Uchiha Clan from the very beginning.<br><br><br>After all, everyone with a little knowhow about the man knew of his ambitions and the kyuubi attack could have cleared out most of his competition for the position of the Hokage. Too bad for him that Minato had overturned the board with his wife.<br><br><br>Now he just needed to take advantage of this situation and not only could he save his Clan but also help bring justice to his fallen clans men.<br><br><br>The image of Danzo’s arm was imprinted in his mind after all. It haunted his dreams. The bastard might be dead but Fugaku wouldn’t sit still until all his co-conspirators were punished too.<br><br><br>It was this thought which brought him to his current decision.<br><br><br>“Are you sure you want to do this, Fugaku?” Mikoto asked.<br><br><br>“Yes. I need to do this Mikoto. For the Clan and for the village.”<br><br><br>“Very well.”<br><br><br>She brought out a scroll and unsealed it.<br><br><br>In a sealed tube were two eyes.<br><br><br>Two Mangekyo Sharingan belonging to Itachi.<br><br><br>His son had implanted Shisui’s eye and Shisui being a close relative of theirs, the implants went without any hitch. It might not have been good enough to evolve the eyes but Itachi will not be facing any problems in using them. The only reason he had left those eyes with Itachi was because both the eyes had been used and won’t be usable in the near future. By the time they can be used again, he can achieve his goal.<br><br><br>The surgery had however left Itachi unconscious due to low levels of chakra he had back then and Fugaku took advantage of this and exchanged his other eye with the second eye of Shisui which was in Danzo’s possession. The dragon girl had left the eye on the ground with the arm after plucking it out from Danzo.<br><br><br>They had given him a reason that his other eye was damaged in the battle.<br><br><br>One of the eyes was white due to the use of Izanagi, an eye most would consider useless, which would be true at least until they were evolved.<br><br><br>For the Mangekyo Sharingan to evolve to the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, one didn’t need to just implant the eyes of a close family member… they needed to merge them together or two brothers could just exchange eyes.<br><br><br>One pair was sealed inside the other and over the course of a week, the two eyes merged. The requirement for being close family members was not only so that their blood doesn’t reject the eye but also because the chakra of close family members was almost identical and allowed the eyes to merge seamlessly into one.<br><br><br>This process strengthened the eyes to a new level where it doesn’t get corroded by the strong chakra of the Mangekyo.<br><br><br>He closed his eyes and let Mikoto take care of the rest.<br><br><br>When he wakes up… things will change.<br><br><br>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________<br><br><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge"></a><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a><br><br><strong> </strong><a href="https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a><br><br><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong><br><br><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong><br><br><strong>Author’s Note:</strong><br><br><strong>I am done with the next chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong><br><br><br><strong>Well, things escalated quickly, didn’t it.</strong><br><br><br><strong>Letting Tohru and Milim go after them was probably not the best idea.</strong><br><br><br><strong>As for Konoha… they fucked around and found out.</strong><br><br><br><strong>Now I know there will be that one guy who will try to defend Sarutobi… because there is always that one idiot.
