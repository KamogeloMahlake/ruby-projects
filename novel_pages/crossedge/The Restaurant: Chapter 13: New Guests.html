        <p><strong>Isekai Restaurant</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 13: New Guests</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Two orders of Chicken Fried Rice is up.” I said as I handed the plates to Tohru who carried them to the tables.</p><p><br></p><p>“Five servings of karage for Ainz-sama.” Shuna came in with the new orders as soon as Tohru left. Lavinia was taking care of cleaning the tables while Sakura was helping her.</p><p><br></p><p> With enough waitresses things were running smoothly in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the weakest link now was the speed of cooking?</p><p><br></p><p>There was only so much I could do alone, especially with no help.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should look for some other good chefs to help me out in the kitchen?</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, where would I find people who would be skilled enough to cook these levels of dishes? The ingredients I was working on were extremely difficult to work with. I mean except for the mysterious Mathias’ Farm, I didn’t even know anything about where and how these crops came from.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking this, the door to the Restaurant opened and an old man came in.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked like a frail hunched old man. He had a pompadour hairstyle as well as a goatee. “A restaurant? I don’t remember one being here. Did you open this recently?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“This place has been running for several months now.” Sakura went and greeted the old man. “Please take a seat. Is there something I can get for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Yes, since I am here I don’t see why not. A drink of sake would be wonderful, unfortunately I have nothing to pay you with.” He said, scratching his head, looking embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked like a goofy old man and I don't know why I found him funny. "In that case, the first meal can be on the house."</p><p><br></p><p>A simple bottle of alcohol wouldn't cause anything.</p><p><br></p><p>"Hahahaha thank you so much. I really owe you for this."</p><p><br></p><p>She took him to the table where the old martial arts masters were already sitting and they readily made a room for him.</p><p><br></p><p>I remodelled the place after the paperwork for Tobio’s old house was transferred to my name. The first thing was to add more rooms as Shuna was staying with Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, that was hardly a problem for her as most of the time Lavy entered my room at night so Shuna had the room to herself.</p><p><br></p><p>And boy was it a surprise for Shuna.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl had been just as confused as me the first time she found out about the whole setup. In fact, the poor girl even tried to use something as useless as common sense against Lavinia. She however soon realised the futility of the whole thing and just accepted it.</p><p><br></p><p>The situation also reassured me that I was not the crazy one here. Sakura just had an incredible tolerance for craziness.</p><p><br></p><p>And while going through all this, I decided to remodel the Restaurant. The first thing I did was to construct separate areas for drinking, as many children often visited the Restaurant. It was better to separate the areas.</p><p><br></p><p>I even made private rooms for those who wanted some privacy.</p><p><br></p><p>It also helped that Rimuru, Ainz and the rest had a space for themselves now and could indulge in their activities while no one was suddenly scared of noticing Ainz’s skeletal face on entering the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid joined them sometimes too.</p><p><br></p><p>I think he and Ainz got along a bit too well.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru had sent his Dwarves to make the place and even the interiors. Those dwarves worked extremely fast and their work was high quality too so in just a week, the entire place had a completely new makeover.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz had several great pieces of furniture and sent them over to furnish the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this furniture wouldn’t look out of place from a royal palace.</p><p><br></p><p>I seriously need to visit Ainz’s place some day.</p><p><br></p><p>When I wanted to repay them back, they didn’t take money.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dwarves took alcohol while Ainz just gave me a list of several manga and games to order from my world.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, whatever he liked. I went shopping that day and bought anything and everything I could get my hands on.</p><p><br></p><p>I had bought the entire collection of all the top selling mangas and light novels with me and they were currently going through that. I think I heard that they were planning to do a marathon of some kind recently.</p><p><br></p><p>Finishing the last order, I took a bottle of some sake and went to the table to serve the new guest myself.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked like the group had already explained the ability to him and to his credit, the guy, while curious, didn’t look too surprised or amazed either.</p><p><br></p><p>I had observed very few people could see my Restaurant and came to the conclusion that they must be something special or at least they were someone who were approved by the System or passed some criteria. Since I didn’t know what criteria that was, I made it a point to always pay respects to everyone who entered the Restaurant as long as they behaved properly.</p><p><br></p><p>I even made it a point to talk with any new guest in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like now.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man looked very happy to receive the sake and I placed a plate of snacks on the side. “On the house.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha thank you. You are a very good man, Owner-san. I will never forget this gratitude.” He said, extremely sincerely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please enjoy the food.” I then looked at the rest of the people on the table. “Can I get something else for you all?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, we have had enough for today.” Hayato-san shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how is that child, Ikki Kurogane doing, Silas?” Bang-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ikki-kun? I haven’t seen him but Kisuke-san comes here often and even takes food for him. From what I have heard, Kisuke-san’s methods are working on him so he might be doing well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I see. That’s good to hear. It’s very rare to see such determined young men.” He nodded his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. And how is your own Martial Arts training going? I heard you were out for some kind of training trip with your friends?” Issac-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. The trip was very enlightening. I learned a lot about my own powers and was able to fight against many different kinds of monsters with different kinds of abilities. It was a very educational experience. We even got a chance to fight a small war of sorts at the end.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A War?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. An army of orcs had attacked a village of ogres. Eight Hundred Ogres against over ten thousand Orcs being led by several extremely strong beings. We heard of this and decided to help out the ogres since the Orcs were invading the place Rimuru lived in.” I explained the whole situation to the group.</p><p><br></p><p>“It sounds like you had quite an adventure. Did you try Martial Arts against the Clown?” Hayato-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha I doubt I would be able to do so. That monster could take down a small country if left to rampage and it was a physical skill based monster. I doubt that a simple chef like me could take him on with only months of Martial Arts training.”</p><p><br>“Hmm? And who said that chefs can’t be strong Martial Arts Masters?” Surprisingly, it was Jirou-san who had spoken.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at him and he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“To catch better prey and to prepare truly great ingredients, a chef needs to possess incredible willpower, strength and skill. For example, the Tempura you made was from the Sake Salmon. While it is a fish with only a Capture Level 2 it's extremely difficult for a chef, even experienced ones, to keep the flavours locked when cooking it. You have managed to do something which I think only a hundred or so chefs around the world can do. Good job on that one. But for higher level ingredients, you will have to complete the process in a fraction of the time taken for this Tempura. For some dishes I know, it can be as low as a thousandth of a second. Without proper knowledge of Martial Arts, such a task is impossible."</p><p><br></p><p>It was the new old man who said this, attracting the glances from all the people around him.</p><p><br></p><p>But I was attracted to something else entirely. "You know the name of the ingredient."</p><p><br></p><p>"Hahahaha I have eaten different types of food in my life."</p><p><br></p><p>"Silas boy, is there something special about this dish?" Issac-san asked, sensing my shock.</p><p><br></p><p>"I… get provided with any raw material I need by the restaurant itself when I pay the money but even I don't know where these food products come from. There were some extremely outrageous things in the list of ingredients. Ingredients costing billions. It's just that I have only been learning to cook for a year and a half so I don't want to waste those ingredients. I will try them when I get better."</p><p><br></p><p>"Billions?" Hayato asked, quite shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>"The things from the Dark Continent can go for that price." Isaac scratched his goatee.</p><p><br></p><p>"You just get the ingredients in the shop? For money?" The new old man asked, surprised for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>"They are just kept in my refrigerator or my store room when I buy it. Oh, this restaurant is a bit special." I explained about the restaurant to the guy and after an initial shock, he listened to everything quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>"So you can buy anything you want for <em>money</em>?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Umm."</p><p><br></p><p>"Even GOD?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Yes. There is one such ingredient." I answered.</p><p><br></p><p>"How much do I need to pay for it?"</p><p><br></p><p>"This… I am sorry but I still can't cook it and this is a restaurant and not a butcher's shop. I am afraid selling raw ingredients is not allowed. I can sell only food cooked by myself."</p><p><br></p><p>He sat back and then shook his head with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>"As I thought, it would never be so easy. I hope you get there soon, child. GOD is not something money can buy so you don't even realise how lucky you are."</p><p><br></p><p>The man went on to explain some things about his world. He worked as a Knocking Master. He was a hunter in his younger days. Just because of this, he got along well with Issac-san. He said that his name was Jiro.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we could talk anymore, the door to the Restaurant opened again and two people entered the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Wow, quite a few new people were coming to the Restaurant today.</p><p><br></p><p>One was an old man wearing a kimono and another was a girl with orange clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>"I didn't know there was a restaurant near the school? Is this place new?" He asked, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm. Yes. What would you like to eat, Sir?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmph, as if this small place could serve food to satisfy us?" The girl snorted.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man sighed, "Be respectful, Erina."</p><p><br></p><p>"But grandfather…"</p><p><br></p><p>He shut the girl up and looked at me. "We will take whatever the chef recommends. Price is not an issue."</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow at the price comment.</p><p><br></p><p>"Alright."</p><p><br></p><p>I prepared a very simple dish. An Egg fried rice but with Strawberry Rice, edible Billion Bird Eggs and several other ingredients which would make the dish price at around five hundred thousand.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy said that price wasn't an issue. Let him think about it.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the girl, I made a bowl of udon noodles. The guy asked me for the chef's recommendation. The Chef recommends some humility for the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>The aroma of the dish was kept in the kitchen so they had no idea what I was making. I covered the dish and called for Lavy to serve the dish.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked over the counter to observe the reaction of the two.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia removed the covers and both their eyes glazed over.</p><p><br></p><p>"Why is my dish different?" She asked, looking at her noodles.</p><p><br></p><p>"It's the Chef's recommendation for you." I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>My Restaurant served food to Emperors and Dragons. A little brat questioning my Restaurant's tastes cannot be left alone… no matter how cute the girl was.</p><p><br></p><p>She glared at me for a moment but still took a bit of the udon.</p><p><br></p><p>"Umm ahhhh~"</p><p><br></p><p>She started rubbing her thighs together and moaning, startling me all of a sudden as everyone looked weirdly at me.</p><p><br></p><p>"I swear I didn't mix anything illegal into the dish." I quickly raised my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>What the hell?</p><p><br></p><p>Was she one of those scammers who will try to blackmail people after causing such scenes? Where are the cameras?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around the place in panic and then threw the girl a wary look.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man beside him didn't mind anything and instead laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>"Hahahaha don't worry about it. This just means that Erina likes your cooking. Our family reacts differently to delicious food. Erina was blessed or rather cursed by an ability called the God's Tongue and she can perceive tastes to a very minute level. This makes her incredibly selective of what she eats. She doesn't mean to insult you." He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>"So this…"</p><p><br></p><p>"Is how she reacts to the taste which she gets won over by."</p><p><br></p><p>He then took a bite of his own food and paused for a moment before his clothes burst out from his body and he went on for a minute long rant on the details of the dish. I didn't even think that much when I was cooking this. He stopped after a minute and then looked at me and I couldn't help but ask. "So, these bursting clothes ability was yours?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p><br></p><p>Damn… that must suck. Everytime he ate good food, he would lose his clothes. I mean imagine this ability on a woman… that would be a nightmare. An inborn training tool to make someone into an exhibitionist.</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of a messed up world was this guy living in? The very thought made me shudder.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, his clothes bill must be huge.</p><p><br></p><p>The man and the girl both concentrated on eating after that and then ordered different things too.</p><p><br></p><p>From the cheapest dish to the things going in millions.</p><p><br></p><p>For a minute I was scared if they were going to be scammed but the guy paid everything and added a twenty percent tip.</p><p><br></p><p>I made five million and eighty seven thousand yen from just this guy.</p><p><br></p><p>"Say, young man, why are you wasting your talents in such a remote place. I am sure that with your skill, you could get jobs anywhere you want? I actually want to invite you to the Totsuki Academy for the position of a teacher."</p><p><br></p><p>Totsuki Academy? Teacher?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked confused at the guy who raised an eyebrow but seeing no change in my confused look, he was a bit flustered. "The Totsuki Culinary Academy for the best chefs in the world." He offered more information.</p><p><br></p><p>"Ah, I am satisfied with my Restaurant. Thank you for inviting me though."</p><p><br></p><p>"What were the ingredients you used in your dishes? I didn't recognize most of them." For the first time, the girl enquired.</p><p><br></p><p>"Those…"</p><p><br></p><p>It led to a short explanation to what this place was and then the man proceeded to talk to Jiro, even asking if he could procure some ingredients from the Toriko world to help his daughter who got ill whenever she ate anything which she didn't find delicious. He even made me pack the best dishes I could make to bring with him to his daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>"You know, Silas-kun, the ingredients in the Gourmet World are costly beyond your comprehension. Some of the items cannot even be priced after selling off an entire planet. At this rate, you might not be able to get access to several ingredients." Jiro-san said.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man curiously who took this chance and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>"I suggest that you get a hunter as a partner if you truly want to advance as a chef. Hunters and Chefs make pairs to hunt down ingredients and cook them. They are partners in the truest sense. Even I went on hunts with my Secchan in my younger days. Besides, there are plenty of Chefs who hunt on their own too." He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>"This… I will consider the suggestion. Thank you for your advice, Jiro-san. By the way, how strong are these monsters?" I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>If things weren’t too bad, maybe Rimuru, Ainz, Saitama and I could go there for a training trip of sorts next time.</p><p><br></p><p>"They are… hmm, any halfway decent ingredient would have the strength to destroy a big continent at the very least."</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>A period of silence came down over the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the other oldies looked at Jiro-san in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>"On second thought, I will hold on to going hunting for a while."</p><p><br></p><p>Are you kidding me?</p><p><br></p><p>Just a Demon Lord Seed was dangerous to us. If it hadn’t been for Ainz’s cheat skill, there was a high chance that we would have to fight him alone to get him and even that was only because we had an aerial advantage.</p><p><br></p><p>And now he’s talking about facing Continent level monsters?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s insane.</p><p><br></p><p>"Hahahaha don't worry. The more delicious food you eat, the stronger you can become. This is the beauty of our world. Train, eat and get stronger to explore the best parts of the world."</p><p><br></p><p>“This place sounds like the Dark Continent from our world.” Issac-san said, brushing his beard.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Dark Continent?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, our world’s humanity is confined to what would amount to only a small lake compared to the whole world. The rest of the World is unexplored even with all our technologies and power. This place is called the Dark Continent. That world is….simply beyond our understanding.” He sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it really that dangerous?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It is said that the ancestors of the human race had migrated from them to the ‘Known World’. That world is filled with treasures and dangers. For example, there is a special type of product found there called Nitro Rice. It can extend the lifespan of anyone who consumes it. There is also a herb called the ‘Herb of All-Illness’ which can cure all diseases.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Has no one tried to go back there?” Hayato-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously we have. There have been 149 known expeditions and many unknown ones sent there with a survival rate of 0.04 percent from the known ones only. It’s just too dangerous for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This Dark Continent of yours sounds like our Gourmet World.” Jiro-san said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gourmet World?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Our world’s humanity is also confined within a very small part of the world. The rest of the world is called the Gourmet World which covers about seventy percent of our planet.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“How strong are they?” Bang-san asked, sounding curious.</p><p><br></p><p>“In our world, power is measured in terms of Capture Level. This depends on various factors such as the strength of the prey as well as the danger of the environment. Normally in the human world, the capture levels go from 1 to 100 while they can go in thousands in the Gourmet World. To give you an idea, something in 180s Capture Levels can take a walk and it would destroy countries they pass through while something in 300s will be beyond the Human World’s capabilities normally.”</p><p><br></p><p>….I suddenly felt a chill run down my spine at his words.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the grandfather and granddaughter pair had their faces go pale at the words while the man was simply sipping his sake.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. We also have strong people protecting everyone. Not just anyone can walk in and destroy the world.” He assured us, making us relax.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….the outside world is dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>Here I just became a Daemon Chevalier and was feeling relaxed while my Restaurant is connected to these hell worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, the things they said in the Gourmet World and the Dark Continent sounded awesome. If someday I become strong enough, I would like to go there myself….someday very far away in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>While thinking of this I searched for something in  my System and suddenly stopped.</p><p><br>“...ilas, Silas!” Issac-san’s voice broke me out of my stupor. “Is something the matter?” He asked. “You looked like you were lost in your own world.”</p><p><br>I looked at him blankly. “I….my shop has the Nitro Rice and Herb of All-Illness for ingredients.” I said, making him freeze.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “The description matches what you said and even the effects match. I think it should be the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face became very serious. ”Could you sell some of those to us?” He asked. “As the Chairman of the Hunter’s Association, I would like to formally negotiate with you for the sales of these two products.”</p><p><br>He was the chairman of the Association?</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, I don’t think I can sell the raw ingredients but I can sell the finished products as food items. The only thing I can assure you is that none of the medicinal effects will be lost.” I replied. This was a rule in the Restaurant and even I couldn’t break it.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Alright. I will not ask you to break your rule for me. I will talk to the rest of the Association and come back later to negotiate about this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about various topics and even Issac wanted to venture into Jiro-san's world and see it for himself. Bang and Hayato wanted to join too.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, these oldies are too energetic for their own good.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand the grandfather and granddaughter duo were scared out of their minds and just kept sitting on the side and listening to the stories of Jiro-san and Issac-san.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving they promised to return again and also invited me to visit their place in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, maybe I can recruit some good chefs for my Restaurant there?</p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________________x______________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The money brought by the two people from the Totsuki Academy came at the right time.</p><p><br></p><p>After buying the house and renovating everything, I was a bit short on cash. With this, I could pay Rimuru and Ainz and even have something left with me to buy ingredients.</p><p><br></p><p>While my System only had limited abilities and I didn’t even know how to level it up, it did give me the ability to buy anything which could be used as ingredients.</p><p><br></p><p>The only catch was money.</p><p><br></p><p>If I wanted to buy pricey ingredients and practise more, I would need to use money from my side.</p><p><br></p><p>This always left me in need of money if I wanted to improve my cooking skills and make different types of dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why don’t you start a business?” Ainz said, while he played his game.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama had won the previous Pokemon challenge and this time Ainz and Rimuru were giving it their all to win.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am already running a Restaurant.” I replied. “In fact, with the number of customers increasing, I don’t have enough time to do anything, let alone start another business.”</p><p><br></p><p>Starting a business was not as easy as speaking.</p><p><br></p><p>“Moreover, the last mess makes it difficult for me to go around. People are on the lookout for some Devil from what Lavinia has told me about and while things have calmed down, it has not completely settled down. Zeref’s last attack had really cleaned out everyone in that organisation in the entire country.”</p><p><br></p><p>All three of us shivered at the sudden reminder of the day.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, Zeref was something else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me suddenly appearing in the area would cause many eyes to turn in my direction."</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm, that's indeed a problem." Ainz turned a page of the magazine.</p><p><br></p><p>"You could always get someone to manage the business for you. Maybe, have Lavinia do it for you? As for the staff. I think this area is controlled by the Youkai." He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>"The nearby area. This one is neutral but yes." I corrected.</p><p><br></p><p>"I can send some Kijin under your command. They would just be happy to help you out. They can set up a territory in this area. In this way, this will be established as a territory of the youkai and people wouldn't try to look for a Devil here. Oni are a type of Youkai, right?"</p><p><br></p><p>"They are." I answered, thinking about the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>"The Youkai can act as a cover for your business. As for what business you can do?</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, how about getting manga, anime and games from other worlds and selling them here? You can easily make a successful entertainment business. It wouldn't even be that hard. And both worlds will get amazing sources of entertainment too. Sorry to say this but your world’s entertainment….it’s severely lacking. It will be a win for everyone."</p><p><br></p><p>"Moreover, it's not a business relating to supernatural things so it will be relatively safe."</p><p><br></p><p>"I have no idea how to set it all up." I only knew things about the Restaurant business because my dad had one.</p><p><br></p><p>"That's fine. We can figure things out."</p><p><br></p><p>"That would be taking advantage of all of you. You have already done too much for me."</p><p><br></p><p>"Don't mind it. This will also help us considering that some of the things from the modern world will be very convenient for our worlds. And without you, it wouldn't have been possible anyways. You help just by existing. To be honest, this was our original plan and it would be kinda sad to not see it fulfilled."</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm. I wouldn't mind some funds to buy games and other stuff from the modern world. If you are worried about taking advantage of us, we could always become shareholders. For example, there is a comic convention in a month. We can lay a foundation for our business there." Ainz pointed out in the magazine.</p><p><br></p><p>The idea did sound good.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, the door to the Restaurant opened and a little girl who looked around ten walked in. She was wearing a military cosplay uniform and had blonde hair and blue eyes. Now, the military cosplay part might have been a bit doubtful because of the all too real rifle she was carrying. To be honest, she looked like a fantasy nazi.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that her steps were measured and too much like a real soldier.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes turned around the place, widening as she looked at us. She immediately jumped back and brought out her gun and light flashed on the tip of her gun but before she could fire, the shop neutralised the magic.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked with shock at her rifle and shot from her place with the knife on the rifle raised towards us but Rimuru shot a string of spider silk, tying her to the spot.</p><p><br></p><p>She struggled, even when she was bound on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>"So, what's the case with her?" Rimuru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>"Ah, Ainz must have scared her." Out of all us Saitama replied, making the skeleton look abashed, if skeletons could even look like that.</p><p><br></p><p>"I forgot to wear the mask. Wasn't expecting anyone to come at this late hour."</p><p><br></p><p>I got down in front of the girl. "I will remove the cover from your mouth but I need you to be quiet and listen to me, alright? Nod if you understand."</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me with anger enough to burn a hole through my skull but nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>"This place is a restaurant between worlds. Not exactly a part of any world but a space connecting them. Do you understand?"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked unimpressed but nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>"This guy might look like a skeleton from a B Grade horror movie. "Hey!" But, he is not a bad guy. He is a human or rather was a human who got transferred to a different word but got stuck in a skeleton body. Reincarnation if you will call it or in this case, transmigration."</p><p><br></p><p>"I was reincarnated in a slime body. I was dying and heard a voice which asked me questions and the next thing I knew, I was in a cave with a giant dragon." Rimuru raised a hand and offered.</p><p><br></p><p>"Well yeah." I shrugged. I did notice the widening of her eyes at this point. "So, before you start trying to kill anyone, do understand that I <em>will</em> kick you out of the restaurant and ban you forever if you do so. Are we clear till here?"</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>"Good." I removed the string covering her mouth and she became relaxed or rather composed herself better than before.</p><p><br></p><p>"Now, who are you and would you like to eat something?" I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>She however sat down on a chair and stared at us for a while and then picked up the menu. "A Ramen."</p><p><br></p><p>"Sure."</p><p><br></p><p>I went inside to make a bowl of ramen while keeping an ear out to listen in on the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>"So, why did you attack us, kid? Was big bad Ainz really that scary?"</p><p><br></p><p>"You say that you were reincarnated, what did you do before that? What kind of voices did you hear?" She asked, I assume Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>"I was a salaryman. Had a run in with a mugger and got killed. The voice was asking what I wished for."</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm, it does sound like him. Did he appear in front of you? I mean, did he talk through other people?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Don't know, I was blacking out so I could only hear voices. Wait, are you?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Tanya Degurechaff. Former Japanese resident, a salaryman. Do you think I can go back home from this world?" She introduced herself, although I could still hear a tinge of suspicion in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Another isekai character.</p><p><br></p><p>What's my shop? A gathering place of isekai characters?</p><p><br></p><p>"Well… there are several Japan's in the world. Ainz was from a far future version of Japan, another guy Hayato comes from a completely different version of Japan. In fact, Silas, the owner, is also from a different version of Japan. So, I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you."</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm, thought so. It really isn't easy."</p><p><br></p><p>"Wait, you said <em>him</em>. Do you know the guy who reincarnates people?" Ainz asked.</p><p><br></p><p>"Really? Do you think he can be the same guy who reincarnated me?" Rimuru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Even my ears perked up at this. I mean I was reincarnated as well.</p><p><br></p><p>"I call him Being X. He's…"</p><p><br></p><p>We didn't get to listen to anything else as I felt a presence enter the shop, I left the ramen and came out quickly to see the figure of a man walking in, almost like a zombie. That said, the aura around the zombie was strong.</p><p><br></p><p>"So your faithlessness has even attracted the attention of devils and monsters? Are you still going to oppose me even at the cost of condemning your soul to demons?" A voice, completely foreign to the one expected of a zombie, sounded as it started at Tanya.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, what's up with today?</p><p><br></p><p>"You wanna bet against it?" The girl mocked.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean the guy was supposedly a God or something similar, right?</p><p><br></p><p>Stop mocking it.</p><p><br></p><p>"It is all futile. You must be guided towards the path of a believer. Let me show you how even demons or monsters cannot help you with this."</p><p><br></p><p>The aura thickened and I sensed an attack forming..</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, time to stop this.</p><p><br></p><p>The Restaurant crushed the aura in the very next moment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zombie looked confused.</p><p><br></p><p>"Guest, what would you like to eat? If you don't have anything to order, I suggest that you leave and not cause trouble within the premises. This is private property and I will be forced to take action if you do so."</p><p><br></p><p>"A creature seeped in demonic power. Your soul is irredeemable. I feel sorry for you."</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>"Oi, are you the guy who reincarnates people in different worlds?" Rimuru got up from the seat and asked the zombie but I don't know why a very strange silence fell over the room.</p><p><br></p><p>"It is but a mere part of my power. Rejoice at being able to witness my presence monster. Do not fear for I shall grant mercy to your souls and purge you right now."</p><p><br></p><p>The next moment, the zombie was blasted to the side of the Restaurant, against a wall. "Return my dick, you crazy bastard!"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I don't think anyone expected that. Not even the zombie guy. Not even when he was devoured by Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only after a minute that he stopped. "Oh!"</p><p><br></p><p>"What?"</p><p><br></p><p>He looked around sheepishly. "According to Great Sage, it was not this guy."</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Did you just accidentally kill the wrong guy? Also, don't act like you don't remember what you just shouted. I thought to myself but didn't say out loud.</p><p><br></p><p>"Also, it was only a possession. The one it was possessing was already dead. I got some Skills from devouring it."</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh and just went back to finish cooking the Ramen. I should have accepted such a life when I got this System in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>Tanya Degurchaff didn’t want to go back to her world so I decided to give her a place to stay. We even got to know her story in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>Tanya was apparently someone at a high level in a respected company in her previous life. She jumped at the fact that she could stay in a modern world and decided to work for me.</p><p><br></p><p>She was in fact more than happy to jump from her previous world which was drowned in war because that asshole being wanted to make her a so-called believer.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, talk about taking things too far.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can stay here or I can arrange for a new residence for you soon if you want.” I told her and she agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the day, we had decided to go forward with the business plan for the Manga and Light Novel Business.</p><p><br></p><p>We had even decided the name of the company.</p><p><br></p><p>The Crossroads Publications.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The next day, Ainz came first but he wasn’t alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him were two girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas. These are Yuri Alpha and Narberal Gamma. They will be serving you and assisting you with your new business.</p><p><br></p><p>The two bowed respectively in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is our honour to serve Silas-sama.” They said together.</p><p><br></p><p>I even got to know some things about them.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, they aren’t exactly humans despite their looks.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz had told me already that his guild was specifically for non-human characters so I should have expected this.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuri is a Dullahan while Narberal is a Doppelganger.</p><p><br></p><p>Coming to the two maids, they were both absolutely professional.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuri Alpha was a beauty with an intelligent look. She wore black lensless glasses and a blue-collar around her neck, most likely to keep her head attached to her body since she was a Dullahan. She wore her hair tied into a low-cropped bun at the back of her head and a maid uniform.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, Narberal Gamma could only be described as an elegant, snow-white skinned, black-pony tailed beauty. She also wore a maid uniform.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to say, Ainz’s guild members had great taste.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz was behaving in his role play manner until he was inside his private room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me introduce you to the rest of the staff here. You all can talk and know more about my world. You will need to know the background of the world to start a business first.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded and I took them to Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to find a way to get fake identities for them as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, this was indeed not easy.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe Lavinia would know something since she was more used to dealing with the Supernatural World?</p><p><br></p><p>All this had to be put on the side as it was time for the guests to arrive.</p><p><br></p><p>The usual guests like Naruto, Kanna and Miu and Touma came first for their daily bentos. Naruto and Kanna were in the same school now and it seems that Kanna was actually enjoying her time at her new home.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid was next.</p><p><br></p><p>He apparently had a day off at school today.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid on the other hand went and played with Ainz and the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>After they left, two new guests entered the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them was a  young elf with long golden-blonde hair and blue eyes. Her general appearance could only be described as breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>The second one was actually a girl with animal ears and even a tail. Was she a youkai?</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first time I had seen one.</p><p><br></p><p>She had black hair, canine ears and a fluffy tail. She sported purple eyes with vertical slit pupils.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru was the first to greet them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome Guests. What would you like to eat?” She asked politely.</p><p><br></p><p>In all these months, Tohru had gotten very good at this waitress business.</p><p><br></p><p>The two girls looked at Tohru, surprised for a few moments before taking a seat and taking a look at the menu.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Alpha -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Hey hey Alpha. I don’t recognise most of the dishes from the menu. Do you know what these are?” Delta asked, after trying to decide what to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha on the other hand was looking at the menu which was written in a language she was not expecting to encounter.</p><p><br>Wasn’t this the language Shadow had taught them?</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, many of the dishes here were the ones Shadow had told them about.</p><p><br></p><p>What exactly is this place which can make these things?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it another organisation Shadow had started behind their backs?</p><p><br></p><p>Were they not doing their duty adequately enough for him to take such measures?</p><p><br></p><p>Several thoughts went through her mind in one moment before she reigned them in.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still too early to say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>She needed to investigate more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two orders of Chicken Ramen.” She ordered and began observing everything in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>“Certainly.” The girl bowed and left to relay their orders to the chef.</p><p><br></p><p>While their order was prepared, she looked around trying to observe every person in the Restaurant closely while being as discreet as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly she heard a voice beside her. “Are you looking for something or someone, Miss? May I help you with something?”</p><p><br></p><p>She held herself back from accidentally attacking and turned around to see a black haired woman in glasses.</p><p><br></p><p>Before she could say anything however, Delta opened her mouth and spoke first. “Is Shadow here?”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha felt an urge to face palm. Maybe bringing Alpha here was not the best idea.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow?” The woman tilted her head, looking confused. “I apologise but I do not know of anyone with such a name. Today is my first day working here. I can ask the others and let you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman then called for a blonde human girl. “Is there someone called Shadow here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow? Oh, Cid-kun. Yes. He is inside the private room with Rimuru-san, Ainz-san and Saitama-san.” The girl pointed towards the room but what attracted Alpha’s attention was not the location but rather the name she addressed him with.</p><p><br>Cid.</p><p><br></p><p>Did they know his identity?</p><p><br></p><p>Shadow hadn’t even told his identity to his real family then why can these people know his identity?</p><p><br></p><p>A look of realisation came to the eyes of the black haired woman who then looked at them. “May I know who you people are and how you know Cid-sama?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are from Shadow Garden made by Boss.” Delta answered before she had the chance to say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, she will have to consider bringing her to future spying missions.</p><p><br></p><p>“His subordinates then. I see. So you were perhaps told to come here too.” She asked in a much quieter voice. “ I am sorry but Cid-sama is currently talking to the rest of the….” She suddenly stopped before looking around, especially at the kitchen and then spoke again. ”Would you like to go to a private room for the time being?”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha sensed the change in her tone of voice and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see what is going on here.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room, the woman first brought their order for them and then locked the room behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>Delta smelled the food and almost drooled. Even she found herself salivating at the scent of the food and her stomach made a sound making her blush a little.</p><p><br></p><p>Delta immediately dove in, eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t be embarrassed. This food is made by Silas-sama himself. It is no less than a work or art, a miracle which even Supreme Beings can only praise. For people like us, having a chance to taste it….is nothing short of a boon.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha broke out of her trance and suddenly registered some of the words the woman had said.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas-sama, Supreme Beings?</p><p><br></p><p>“You look confused. Has Cid-sama not explained everything to you yet?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are on a test by Shadow to find out about this place.” Delta answered and Alpha let her. Whatever she had done till now, had only served to answer more of their questions.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Guiding people to find their answers. Indeed, the minds and thoughts of Supreme Beings are beyond our understanding. Even we had to figure out the clues and ask Ainz-sama before he clarified our doubts. I guess Cid-sama is doing the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha had enough of these cryptic words so she took the initiative to ask. “Could you please tell us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Certainly.”</p><p><br></p><p>What the woman told her next….was certainly not something Alpha had been expecting even with everything she had been through till now.</p><p><br></p><p>Supreme Beings.</p><p><br></p><p>A Great War.</p><p><br></p><p>The Restaurant which connected to infinite worlds with the goal of reuniting all the Supreme Beings back.</p><p><br></p><p>The story was so outlandish and yet everything was right in front of their eyes to see that Alpha couldn’t even refute it at all.</p><p><br></p><p>But the more she thought of it, the more things became clearer.</p><p><br></p><p>Shadow was born to the Kagenou Household and yet he had memories and abilities completely unknown to anyone else.</p><p><br></p><p>The memories of his previous life, the memories of a Supreme Being.</p><p><br></p><p>He was doing exactly what the Supreme Beings had done in their previous life, fought against great dangers to unveil the face of darkness….and even when most of them met their ends in the Great War, they were still doing it….even in their next lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, they had gone through a war to protect several Clans in Rimuru-sama’s world, one of them being the pink haired girl who is working outside.</p><p><br></p><p>In a way, these Supreme Beings were Shadows of their own worlds, each carrying such heavy burdens on their shoulders all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>The maid, Yuri Alpha, a name which had caught her off guard but again came as a realisation, said that they were made to serve the Supreme Beings.</p><p><br></p><p>The Seven Shadows were named similarly to the Pleiades Seven Sisters, a name given to them by Shadow, probably in an attempt to create his own version of the Pleiades.</p><p><br></p><p>To think that this simple test would reveal such news to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe, Shadow has thought them to be worthy of knowing everything and guided them to this Restaurant?</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you doing here then?” She asked Yuri. Calling her Alpha was a bit odd for her even now.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you know, the spell cast by Silas-sama has left him without any power.” Yuri began and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“This has also led him to be vulnerable. And while he is regaining his powers at a very fast speed, he is still not even close to his full power. Moreover, the world where he was reincarnated, is extremely dangerous. Gods and monsters roam around everywhere. In fact, this Restaurant had even been attacked recently but thankfully, the rest of the Supreme Beings were here. They protected this place and from what I have heard, one of them had selectively wiped out all members of the organisation which had attacked this place in the whole country with just a single spell, sending a warning to every force in this world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha’s eyes widened at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there really such a spell which can do that?” She asked, shaken completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a person could wipe out the members of the Cult in moments….was this really how strong the so called Supreme Beings were?</p><p><br></p><p>“As I said, the means of Supreme Beings are beyond our understanding. Anyways, we were sent here to protect and assist him in establishing a business in this world. Unfortunately Silas-sama doesn’t have many subordinates who can help him out. That’s why Ainz-sama has assigned us to help him out while Rimuru-sama has assigned several Kijin.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly another thought struck her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Why did Shadow choose this time to guide them here?</p><p><br></p><p>Why was it that no one could find the place before today and yet she and Delta suddenly found this place magically?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it to let her meet Yuri?</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe he was trying to tell them to help him too.</p><p><br></p><p>She will have to discuss it with the rest of the Seven Shadows.</p><p><br></p><p>They stayed there for over an hour and promised to return later to know more. In the meantime, Yuri had brought them several meals for the rest of their members too.</p><p><br></p><p>When she left the room, the door to the room next to them opened to….by Shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eye at her while Delta jumped at him. “Shadow!”</p><p><br></p><p>She was however dodged by Shadow. “I am sorry but you are mistaking me for someone else maybe.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, he took some food packed for him and left the place, completely ignoring them both.</p><p><br></p><p>She couldn’t understand what was happening when she heard a voice behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t mind Cid. He is very dedicated to his role….well, his Shadow thing. He does that even with us.”</p><p><br></p><p>She turned around to see a boy with black hair and blue eyes smiling at the door and shaking his head.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuri bowed. “Silas-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, so he was Silas, the one who sacrificed everything, even his memories and life, all for the sake of reuniting his friends again.</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha felt a burst of respect well up within her and was about to bow before he spoke again. “You don’t have to bow all the time, Yuri. Relax.”</p><p><br></p><p>He then looked at her and spoke again. “So you are friends with Cid-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, my name is Alpha.” She answered, not saying anything else. Yuri had already warned her about not speaking anything about the Supreme Beings and specially in front of Silas-sama to not disturb the spell cast by him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nice to meet you, Alpha-san. Did you enjoy your food today?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, It was the best meal I have had the pleasure of eating. Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, since you are Cid-kun’s friends then this first meal will be on the house. Just take care of him, alright. He can be….well you already know that I guess?” He said and she could feel the care in his voice, something which warmed her heart.</p><p><br></p><p>This person was really like the stories of Yuri, even when he didn’t have any of those memories yet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please leave him to us.” She nodded resolutely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great then. Visit us again.” With those words, he walked into the room Shadow had left, the room where the rest of the….Supreme Beings were.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Yuri again and nodded before leaving the place, thousands of thoughts in her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href="https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As promised, I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are picking up pace now as most of the Snippet’s characters are back now.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We also saw Alpha and Delta’s visit and the confusion rolling.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Seriously, both Nazarick and Shadow Garden members can cook.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Now, how will Cid handle all this news?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Maybe in the next chapter we will see our favourite Demon Lord making an entrance.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will try to work more on this for the rest of the month.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I want to get most of the introductions for the Snippets out of the way before we can concentrate on the plot next.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>
