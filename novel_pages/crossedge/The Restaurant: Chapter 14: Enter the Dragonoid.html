Did you girls have fun?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They had gone out to Tempest to meet Shuna’s friends and teach them about our world before they used our town as their new base. All of them were quite enthusiastic about the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The Goblins and Goblinas were so funny. Even the puppies were well behaved. We all had a lot of fun walking around Tempest.”</p><p><br></p><p>... those were Dire and Star Wolves.</p><p><br></p><p>Only Lavy can call them puppies.</p><p><br></p><p>While talking, she slipped out of her dress, revealing her creamy white skin underneath.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wearing a pure white set of lingerie. She removed her bra and her golden hair fell on her breasts hypnotically.</p><p><br></p><p>I gazed at her as if in a trance and apparently she noticed my gaze too as she looked up at me and smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t an erotic smile or anything, instead it looked so... so pure... </p><p><br></p><p>Was this girl secretly an angel?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked away to avoid showing her an embarrassed look and quickly got into bed, before realising that I was still in my towel.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, before I could get out something happened which immediately cancelled my plans to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy’s bra fell on the floor and she bent down to pick it up, giving me the full view of her shapely ass in white lace panties. I could even see some hint of golden pubes due to my enhanced sights.</p><p><br></p><p>Truly, I had the senses of a demon... and right now, I wasn’t unhappy about it either. </p><p><br></p><p>Her action and the view in front of me made me hard in an instant and I was pretty sure my towel would not be able to cover it up at all.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I decided against getting out for the time being.</p><p><br></p><p>She, on the other hand, was completely unaware of my difficulties and continued speaking as she wore my shirt without buttoning it up as she came over.</p><p><br></p><p>“... and the Goblinas even made flower garlands for us from the flowers. Sakura-chan even brought some of those flowers to decorate the Restaurant.” She finished before wrapping an arm around my neck and kissing my cheek.</p><p><br></p><p>... yeah. Apparently she actually believed the story about the Good Night Kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>I was already holding back with difficulty and that kiss made it just that much harder.</p><p><br></p><p>Our relationship is quite complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, even I was sure about something. There was no way she was doing this all because of her obliviousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy was actually interested in me and I wouldn’t lie and say I didn’t have any feelings for her or she wouldn’t be sleeping beside me right now.</p><p><br></p><p>She has tactically agreed to everything we have done but never said anything expressly. She even participated and initiated many of those things so I know I am not forcing her but she always acts oblivious. It's like she enjoys my reactions or just enjoys this game. So I play along.</p><p><br></p><p>We have just never voiced out our own thoughts to each other yet.</p><p><br></p><p>But not having things cleared out made me hesitate to take this any further.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, till now she has never done anything to harm me or anyone close to me in any way so... </p><p><br></p><p>"Lavy?" I called her.</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm?" She looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>"Wanna go out with me?" I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>"Okay." She looked at me as her smile brightened.</p><p><br></p><p>"Sure.” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>... </p><p><br></p><p>Was that it?</p><p><br></p><p>Quite anticlimactic.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, what else were we supposed to do?</p><p><br></p><p>We were already living as a normal couple would do.</p><p><br></p><p>The sheer absurdity of the situation made me laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen?” She asked, tilting her head.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and laughed again. “No. No, it’s nothing. Just never change, Lavy. Never change.” I said before pulling her into a hug and laying down on the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” She looked confused so I cupped her face in my hands and brought her face to mine.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t give you a Good Night’s Kiss, did I?” I smiled and saw a light blush on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She closed her eyes and tilted her face towards mine and I didn’t need any more indication. I leaned in and took her lips with mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Her lips were soft and had a taste of mint.</p><p><br></p><p>She relaxed in my arms and I pulled her into a hug, deepening the kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, I was rock hard and the towel was doing a bad job at keeping my excitement restrained. My length was poking her thighs and I was sure she was feeling it too as her arms wrapped around and pulled me closer to her.</p><p><br></p><p>We pulled back with a strand of saliva between our tongues. Her eyes looked hazy as she gazed at me, breathing heavily due to the excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was that enough to make your night good?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t answer but pulled me in for another kiss instead.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess that was an answer in itself.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled her on top of me as my hands slid down to her ass, feeling the softness of her plump bottom on my palms while her panty clad crotch slid over my length due to my ministrations.</p><p><br></p><p>She was still busy kissing me so I decided to take things further. My hands slid under her panties, making her gasp in my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>The surprise was enough to stop from kissing me and look at me with surprise for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Just when I thought I had pushed too far, she leaned in for a kiss but not before whispering to me. “Be gentle.”</p><p><br></p><p>My dick twitched at her words but I replied with a nod. “I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>After that I started to slowly play with her ass while she was taking her time with the kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day I found that Lavy loved kissing.</p><p><br></p><p>When she was done, I turned her over and got on top of her. The blanket was removed from my body and the towel along with it, revealing my rock hard length to her.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw her eyes widen a little at the sight but then the look turned to curiosity.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can touch it.” I said and she slowly brought her hands to grip me.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s hot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now slowly move your hand. Don’t grip it too hard.” I instructed and she followed the instructions well.</p><p><br></p><p>She suddenly did something I was not expecting. She leaned in and placed a kiss on the tip, sending shivers of pleasure down my spine. I looked at her with a raised eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“I... saw it in a manga when we went to buy them earlier.”</p><p><br></p><p>... what kind of manga are you girls reading?</p><p><br></p><p>Still... Good Work, Mangaka-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does it not feel good?” She asked with that same innocence of her, making the scene a lot more erotic.</p><p><br></p><p>“It feels amazing.” I replied as I put my hand on her head and caressed her hair. “Continue. Just mind your teeth.”</p><p><br></p><p>She started raining kisses on the entire length from the tip to the balls, the stimulation only edging me further.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lick it.” I commanded, finally not being able to hold back.</p><p><br></p><p>She followed instantly, bringing out her tongue and started licking the tip.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhhh~ Yes, that's it. Now open your mouth and take the tip inside. Mind your teeth.” I assisted her by slowly moving my waist while she held my thighs for support. I started slowly before slowly going deeper. </p><p><br></p><p>She gagged but the girl was stubborn and didn’t pull back and pressed forward, taking almost half of my length.</p><p><br></p><p>I too was lost in pleasure to slow down and started trusting more, going slightly deeper every time.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally feeling my climax approaching, I held her hair and pulled her shoving my entire length into her gullet as I shot ropes after ropes of cum.</p><p><br></p><p>When I pulled back, she coughed a little, putting a hand on her mouth to avoid spitting anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her, eyes watery, hair dishevelled. She looked like a ravished angel, an angel I had ravished.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn... I really was a devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Under my gaze, she finally calmed down and actually gulped everything down, even licking her hand to clean off everything clear.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s..salty.” She said licking her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that I was hard again.</p><p><br></p><p>A snap of my finger and everything was clean and I pulled her in for a kiss, something she happily reciprocated.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was... amazing, Lavy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, really. So, what else did you read in the manga?” I asked, making the girl blush at the question.</p><p><br></p><p>A blushing Lavinia was an entirely new experience for me, something I found I loved.</p><p><br></p><p>“I... ” She stuttered as my smile widened. “Sil-kun is bullying me!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then, how about I do something and you tell me if you read that in the manga?” I asked her with a smirk.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Before she could understand anything, I slid between her thighs and dove into her pantyclad pussy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahhhh~~~”</p><p><br></p><p>She was already wet by then and I slid her panty aside revealing her lower lips for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>Pink lips with slight trimmed golden pubes at the top.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s beautiful.” I whispered, loud enough for her to hear and then looked at her. “Did you read this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her face was completely red by now.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave her another lick, making her take a sharp breath and asked again. “Did you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded, making me smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I was enjoying this a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good girl. Now let me reward you for being a good girl.” I dove directly into her pussy, starting with a kiss and then gave her slit a long lick swirling my tongue around her clit.</p><p><br></p><p>She took a sharp breath and one of her hands came on to my head while the other hand gripped the bedsheet while I continued working on her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mhhahhhh, Sil-kunnn~” Her moans sounded like music to my ears, making me work harder on her.</p><p><br></p><p>My finger found the entrance to her pussy and I slowly pushed a finger in.</p><p><br></p><p>It was hot and warm, the walls gripping my finger and massaging me lovingly as I pushed further in, similarly, when I started to pull out, it stuck to me, trying to pull me back in.</p><p><br></p><p>The grip on my hair became stronger. I started moving my finger faster.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a minute later, her body shook violently and arched as she came with a loud groan.</p><p><br></p><p>I went and lay beside her and pulled her back to my chest, feeling the warm softness of her breasts on me again.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was it?” I asked her after she came down from her orgasmic high. She just hugged me tighter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sil-kun is a bully.” I heard her whisper. </p><p><br></p><p>“If you didn’t like it then I won’t do it next time.”</p><p><br></p><p>She stiffened a bit before replying in an ant-like voice.“I... didn’t... dislike it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did it feel good?” I asked and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will make you feel even better from now on.” I whispered into her ears making her hug me tighter.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t exactly satisfied with just one release but Lavy was quite exhausted so I didn’t push her anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>"Shu-chan is going to be so mad when she finds out about this." She said, slowly giggling.</p><p><br></p><p>"What?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Shu-chan was planning on sleeping with you too, so don't let her down, okay."</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girl strangely. "You know, other girls would be jealous and not tell me to treat her well." I deadpanned and she just put her cheeks on my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>"Shu-chan, Sakura-chan and you are my family now. I don't want anyone to feel bad. Not because of me."</p><p><br></p><p>... </p><p><br></p><p>This was probably the first time I talked to the real Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, Sakura?” I asked, taken aback by the sudden name.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Sakura-chan likes you too.” She said, stunning me.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s... I think you are mistaken.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t lie and say that I wasn’t attracted to her at all. We have been together for months now. In fact, she was the first person to stay with me in this place and has helped me through some very difficult times.</p><p><br></p><p>I did have feelings for her and at times I felt she was the same but when it seems that things could be more, she always pulls back.</p><p><br></p><p>I never push her either as it could hurt her. She didn’t have anywhere to go and I didn’t want to make living in this place awkward for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Worst case, if she accepted my advances just to repay me back, I would never be able to live that down.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she even pushed Lavy towards me. So I just accepted that she didn’t like me as a partner and just like a friend.</p><p><br></p><p>“She must have meant it as a friend. There are more than one ways to like someone.” I said, shaking my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that so?” She asked a little confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Now come here.” I pulled her into a hug which she gladly returned before closing our eyes and having the best nap I have had in a while.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Cid Kagenou -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He quickly arranged everything in his setup before those girls came here. The new furniture Ainz had given him looked really good in these types of settings. It even matched with all the other furniture he had collected with his pocket money.</p><p><br></p><p>As he did this, he wondered about the biggest change in his current life.</p><p><br></p><p>The Crossroads Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Who could have thought that there was such an incredible place in the world... or worlds?</p><p><br></p><p>A place which connected to infinite worlds, infinite possibilities... and sold the most  delicious food he had ever tasted in both of his lives.</p><p><br></p><p>The place helped him uncover so many mysteries and gave him a chance to do things he hadn’t even imagined before.</p><p><br></p><p>So much to learn, so much to master.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting against the world and breaking literal shackles of fate... that was a next level of cool he hadn’t even thought about before.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t the only one of his kind who had been isekai’d. There were others too.</p><p><br></p><p>Many different versions of Earth and even more magical worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Just going to one such world gave him his trusty weapons. The set of crowbars, Umbra and Penumbra.</p><p><br></p><p>The power of his Device was to open things. This was what he felt but… he didn’t know the full extent of this power. Just what could be opened?</p><p><br></p><p>And powers were not all.</p><p><br></p><p>The people inside were also unique. Each a master of their art. He had talked to the masters of the Ryozanpaku Dojo and acknowledged their power and mastery of their respective fields.</p><p><br></p><p>He had often lamented over the fact that people gave up their childhood dreams, but here, he found people who pursued them even now, after being sent to another world, just like he had done.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz was one such person.</p><p><br></p><p>That guy played the role of the Shadow of his own world and he did so amazingly. Even he had to commend him for his acting and mannerisms and even took some notes to improve his own Shadow role.</p><p><br></p><p>But not all things go as planned.</p><p><br></p><p>Yesterday, he was listening to Ainz’s problems with his subordinates and how he had cooked up a story to convince them all about the Restaurant’s existence. But who would have thought that the moment he opened the door of the cabin, he would be face to face with Alpha and Delta.</p><p><br></p><p>Did those girls follow him there?</p><p><br></p><p>If so then, they would obviously be here to ask him more about the Restaurant and that’s why he needed to prepare in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he finished his preparations, he felt their presence approaching him and sat down on the throne with the limited edition red wine filled in a golden goblet in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you have come.” He said, looking at their reflection on one of the jewels on the picture frame in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha had come with Beta.</p><p><br></p><p>Was Beta here too?</p><p><br></p><p>He was expecting only Alpha and Delta.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Alpha sat on the armrest of the chair while Beta stood behind him. “We figured out everything about the Restaurant.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, figures. He had trained the girls too well.</p><p><br></p><p>“... just as you wanted us to.”</p><p><br></p><p>Eh?</p><p><br></p><p>Wanted?</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, were they still playing around.</p><p><br></p><p>Since that was the case, he had to give his best performance.</p><p><br></p><p>He had some amazing ideas from observing Ainz and wanted to try them out and now he got the perfect opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>“So now that you have glimpsed the true depths of the Abyss, do you have the courage to dive deeper? A warning though, when you stare at the abyss, it stares back at you. This decision of yours will be far greater than anything you have done or even thought until now, far more than just one world. Once you take this step, you will expose yourself to monsters beyond your imagination. Monsters which can make the Cult of Diabolus look like children playing in the park.”</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the two girls paused before replying with seriousness. “We are ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then tell me what you have found in the Restaurant?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Who knows what they might have seen there? He was inside the room with Ainz, Rimuru and Saitama the entire time. He didn’t even know they were there.</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha nodded and then started explaining.</p><p><br></p><p>So they had met Ainz’s maid and she told them the story which Ainz had filled them with. That works.</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. Me and my comrades have fought against untold foes and lost a lot in the process. It was only by the sacrifice of Silas that we even have a chance to gather together once more.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are all the Shadows of our own worlds, coordinating our subordinates while Silas is the one who coordinates us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, doesn’t that make him the Shadow of Shadows?</p><p><br></p><p>That sounds cooler somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are your orders?” Alpha asked while he was thinking all this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cooperate with them. They will always be our allies. You can learn a lot, even grow stronger with the knowledge of the other worlds. The Cult of Diabolus has lots of advantages but it doesn’t mean we don’t have advantages of our own either. Use this advantage to its fullest. The magic of other worlds is far different from this world’s. You can try learning. Even the technology of those worlds are beyond this world. With just bare basics, you can completely control the technological part of this world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It will be done.”</p><p><br></p><p>After that they discussed several other things before the girls had enough of the roleplay and left.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Beta -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They gathered with the rest of the Seven Shadows of Shadow Garden and Alpha explained everything to them all.</p><p><br></p><p>Other worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Supreme Beings.</p><p><br></p><p>The true meaning of Shadows.</p><p><br></p><p>The Restaurant between all worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally the one who coordinates all the Shadows, the Shadow of Shadows, Silas.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of it, there was only silence in the whole room.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was still processing the information and Beta didn’t blame them either. She still had a hard time believing everything even when everything was right in front of their eyes, clear as a day.</p><p><br></p><p>Eta was the one who spoke next, breaking the silence of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“You said, there were people under other Shadows, with the same title as us. What kind of people were they?”</p><p><br></p><p>Alpha nodded at the question. “I was only able to meet one of them. She was called Yuri Alpha. It must be noted that she is someone actually created by the Supreme Beings of their world and the reincarnated Shadows might not use the same naming terminologies for their subordinates. Still, Yuri told me that they were a part of the Seven Pleiades, the combat maids who serve the Supreme Beings of Nazarick. Unfortunately, right now only Ainz-sama remains among them as their leader while they were all transferred to a new world. Apart from them there are also floor Guardians who guard different floors of Nazarick Fort. A unique thing about them is that most of them were from completely different races just like us. For example, Yuri Alpha is a Dullahan. They are a species of Undead beings.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of skills do they possess?” Zeta asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are all experts in different kinds of magic and martial arts. The System of Magic in their world is far more advanced than in our world. They can make many magical items and medicines which could only be called the stuff of legends in this world. Supreme Beings all had their own specialities and at full power they were capable of fighting Gods. They can cause Miracles to happen on a whim. For example, Zeref-sama, a friend of Silas-sama... selectively wiped out all the members of an organisation throughout the whole country, regardless of their strengths... in one spell when they had attacked the Restaurant.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s... ”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole room was stunned into silence once again.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are also new technologies from other worlds which Shadow had taught us about. They are far more advanced than this world.” She added.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Supreme Beings hold Silas-sama in great respect and are very protective of him. In fact, the reason Yuri was there was to help him set up a business in his world and help establish a base for him while he regains his memories. That world has Gods and monsters of great power and they could be a danger to Silas-sama’s life while he is in a weakened state. Silas-sama himself doesn’t have many subordinates right now and so she and Narberal Gamma were sent to serve him. Similarly Rimuru-sama also sent several people they had saved to serve under him. Shadow has also asked us to cooperate with them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour they planned about their future course of action.</p><p><br></p><p>The reveal of the true identity of the Shadow and the Restaurant has caused major changes in their future plans.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally it was decided that they will visit the Restaurant and get to know the Pleiades and then decide on whom to send there for assistance.</p><p><br></p><p>Beta had a feeling that Shadow Garden was about to change in the coming days.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I served the hotpot to Kisuke-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here’s your order, Kisuke-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh, this looks wonderful as always. I am honestly spoiled by all this great food. Food made at home doesn’t taste the same anymore.” He praised as he picked up his chopsticks and got to eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I smiled. “By the way, I was wondering how Ikki-kun is doing? We haven’t seen him in days. How is his training going?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Ikki-kun is a wonderful student. A very hard worker. His training is going extremely well. You know what? Why don’t you guys come over and visit every now and then? Give me an opportunity to play host sometimes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I will impose upon you then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha you won’t be imposing on anyone. Always feel welcome. By the way, how is your magic training going? I heard that you guys went off on a training trip. How was it?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>There weren’t that many people in the Restaurant right now so I sat down in front of him and we talked.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him about the training trip, the war and all that happened later.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone has been busy with their own work since then.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls were teaching the Kijin before bringing them to my world. Normally they would have their magic lessons with August but he had gone somewhere with Zeref and Irene so we had some time off to ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Tanya was making preparations for establishing our new Publishing House.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to put my name out for now so it was the girls who were going to be listed as the owners of the company. In fact, Lavy was not using her name either as she was quite well known in some magician circles and they could come look for her here.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally it was decided that Shuna would be listed as the owner as Sakura was still not of age yet and she was the princess of the Kijin who would be staying here so it made more sense for her to be the owner.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuri and Narberal would be partners in the company.</p><p><br></p><p>I was busy with my Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru on the other hand had been busy. The different races in the Jura forest were wary of his village now that he had all those orcs and ogres or rather Kijin under him. The village was attacked by a bunch of Lizardmen but they were beaten up before they could even get closer to the village.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hobgoblin Riders had gone to the other Goblin villages and gathered them all under one wing and all of them agreed after they found out that the Kijin had joined, even the ones who had rejected previously.</p><p><br></p><p>They formed a pact with the guardians of the Jura Forest, the dryads under someone called Treyni to protect the forest from outside invasion because now Veldora was absent in return for being recognised by the Dryads.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru had then sent a few Kijins to the Lizardman territory to send a message to the Lizardman chief about the attack on Tempest and found out that they were doing so on their own initiative.</p><p><br></p><p>The idiots who had attacked were led by the son of the chief who actually tried to rebel against his father to attack the Kijin but was beaten to an inch of his life by them. He was later banished along with a hundred of his followers and they ended up joining Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, fate's ways are strange.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz on the other hand had decided to take a break from levelling and explore his own world. He encountered some attackers who were attacking the nearby village from a different country. He took them out and brought the village under his protection and went to investigate the situation in the nearby city.</p><p><br></p><p>After Kisuke-san left, I went back to the kitchen as Bang-san had come in immediately afterwards and ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>"Mr. Bang's order for a hotpot is done." I called out as I placed the fish on the counter where Shuna carried it from.</p><p><br></p><p>Issac-san was waiting there too. He wanted to discuss the business deal for Nitro Rice with me.</p><p><br></p><p>We had found a middle path for our trade.</p><p><br></p><p>It turns out that while I couldn’t sell raw ingredients, I could use those ingredients as dressing or make dishes which used those ingredients in raw form and sell them that way.</p><p><br></p><p>This money could help us with relocating the Kijin to this town and also establish the Publishing House.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas, come, I was just waiting for you.” Issac-san called me. Tanya was already sitting in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>I had no experience in these things and had put Tanya to it.</p><p><br></p><p>She had gone to his world with Tohru and had returned a day later after collecting some information she needed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise for making you wait.” I said while taking a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“No worries. I am the one who should apologise for interrupting your work. Anyways, our Hunters Association has agreed to go on with the trade. Will will buy a set amount of Nitro Rice as well as the Herb of All-Illness each month.”</p><p><br></p><p>I watched as Tanya discussed the price for the item and by gods, she was savage when it came to business.</p><p><br></p><p>She haggled and brought the price from nine hundred to twelve hundred times the original price, at which I got those things from the System.</p><p><br></p><p>Not twelve or one hundred and twenty… twelve hundred times.</p><p><br></p><p>According to her, that was the current price of those items in his world. It was something she had found out from her bare basics understanding of that world and the fact that there was extremely high demand but no supply for that product, allowing her to jack up the prices however she wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>We all agreed to the price and Issac-san agreed to pick up the goods the next day and transfer the money at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>My mind was still buzzing at the amount of money we had just made with this one deal.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Tanya looked proud. “This is the biggest deal I have closed in both my lives.” She smiled proudly. “I am getting my cut for this, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“5% as agreed.” I nodded. “Still, this much will be enough to get us enough property in this town to settle the Kijin and even set up the Publishing House and get the equipment required. We might even have some extra left over.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Easily.” Tanya nodded. “We would even have enough left over to open some other businesses too. I was thinking about expanding into collectibles and figurines. We could try introducing a manga based on Card Games and use it to market cards using gacha. Those things sell for a lot of money.”</p><p><br></p><p>... </p><p><br></p><p>Some of her plans made me shiver, despite my resistance to the cold.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl is evil.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, this same girl just made me a billionaire.</p><p><br></p><p>I sometimes wondered how the System managed the currency exchange thing between worlds without crashing the economies of entire countries… then I realise that I am thinking about a System which can open gates to different worlds, completely different universes. Compared to that, what’s a few billions?</p><p><br></p><p>The System never answers any questions but it still does so many things behind the scenes that I have no idea about.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, the door to the shop opened and in came Rimuru who was looking tired. He was followed by Benimaru and Hakurou and another young girl with pink coloured twin tails.</p><p><br></p><p>"Ohh, what place is this? And what is that scent?" The girl jumped around looking at everything curiously before jumping to Bang's seat and staring at his Hotpot.</p><p><br></p><p>"Behave Milim." Rimuru dragged her back to a different place while the girl stared and almost drooled at the hotpot. "I'm sorry, Bang-san."</p><p><br></p><p>"Hahaha no worries. It's good for young ones to be energetic." the old man waved it off.</p><p><br></p><p>"She is more than two thousand years old though."</p><p><br></p><p>This caused the man to almost choke on his food as he stared at the cute girl with shock in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>"Silas, get a full course of the best you can get. Actually, get us a serving of the rabbit dish you gave us that day and then start cooking the main course." Rimuru ordered while Benimaru came and said something in Shuna's ears, making her stiff.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him questioningly but he just pointed at Shuna before going back to take a seat behind Rimuru while Hakurou took a seat with Mr. Bang. He was already a part of the old monsters group.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuna came and relayed the information to me.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was called Milim Nava, one of the oldest and strongest Demon Lords from Rimuru's world who had come to Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru enticed her with food and brought her here to soothe her because the top brass had picked a fight with her thinking that she was there to kill Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>...  damn, talk about fucking up.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, this is a Demon Lord?</p><p><br></p><p>"Ohh, are you a daemon? You can cook?" I looked back to see her looking over the counter, right inside the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>"I am a Devil apparently. The Daemons from your world are different but then again I haven't met any to give an exact difference between us."</p><p><br></p><p>"My world?"</p><p><br></p><p>"This restaurant operates between several worlds. I am not from your world."</p><p><br></p><p>"What! Really?" Her eyes glittered as I brought out some of the chocolate for the dish. "Ehh, what is that? Looks and smells amazing. Can I eat some? Hey, can I eat some?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Umm, Milim-sama please wait on your seat. The dish will be served as soon as Silas-sama is done." Shuna came to the rescue.</p><p><br></p><p>"Rimuru, I want it now. I want that sweet thing he is using, now."</p><p><br></p><p>"Sure, we can get you one of those but that would be it. You cannot eat the dishes after that." Rimuru explained with his hands spread out.</p><p><br></p><p>"Ehh? Why?"</p><p><br></p><p>...  </p><p><br></p><p>Is she really a Demon Lord?</p><p><br></p><p>My impression of Demon Lords is going down very quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>"NO! I WANT IT NOW." She stomped on the ground and I sensed a massive amount of power behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>This power made that clown look like a candle compared to the sun.</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath to reorganise myself from the sudden surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>I took control of the shop and the very next instant, her power was dispelled as she looked around in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>"This shop is a place for people to enjoy their food and good food needs time to be cooked. Do you want me to give you raw food which tastes like crap? If so, then I can get it to you in a minute."</p><p><br></p><p>That did the job as she sat down quickly although with a pout.</p><p><br></p><p>Really? That easily?</p><p><br></p><p>The power of a God with the mind of a child.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a dangerous combination. Seriously, how do you even deal with someone like this?</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that Tohru of all people said. “B-boss, that girl is dangerous. Don’t mess with her.” was a testament to her power level.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru was someone who didn’t back down from any fights and had even fought Gods in her world and yet Milim’s presence made her back away.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to heed her warning and work on the dish with all my concentration.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl in the meantime was playing games with Saitama and Rimuru while I prepared the dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>I served the first dish as soon as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Lièvre À La Royale. The same dish I had served to my customers as an apology.</p><p><br></p><p>She practically jumped on the plate and I got some time to cook the other dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only after three whole hours that she was satisfied and I could sit down in peace.</p><p><br></p><p>The guests had more or less left the place except for Rimuru and his party.</p><p><br></p><p>"Oi, Devil." She got up on the chair, hands on her waist as she looked directly at me.</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p><br></p><p>"Work for me."</p><p><br></p><p>"No thanks."</p><p><br></p><p>"What? Why?"</p><p><br></p><p>"I enjoy working here. I meet many people from different worlds, visit different places and make new friends from everywhere. I don't want to leave this job."</p><p><br></p><p>"But that's not fair. I wanna have fun too." She cried.</p><p><br></p><p>"Then you can come and visit me anytime you want." I shrugged. By this time I had gotten a read on her personality and understood how to deal with her.</p><p><br></p><p>She was like a kid.</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly like a kid.</p><p><br></p><p>"Yes yes, I can bring you here to visit Silas whenever you want." Rimuru came up for my backup.</p><p><br></p><p>"Really? Promise?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Promise." Both me and Rimuru said at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>I accompanied her out till Tempest and even packed an entire chocolate cake for her making her light up instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>"You know what Devil? I like you. I will call you Sil."</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, my demonic power soared and all I could think about before blacking out was...  <em>Not again</em>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Requirements for Evolution have been met.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Starting Evolution.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Rare Skill: Water Manipulation has evolved into Unique Skill: Flood.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Rare Skill: Ice manipulation has evolved into Unique Skill: Frost.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Water Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Fire Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Cold Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Shock Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skills: Water Resistance, Fire Resistance, Cold Resistance and Shock Resistance were combined to All Elemental Resistance.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: High Speed Regeneration.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Physical Damage Resistance.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Greater Magic Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Corruption Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Spiritual Damage Resistance</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Evolution to Arch Daemon successful.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes to find myself in Shuna's lap and she was brushing my hair. I was still in the Restaurant but there were no other people there.</p><p><br></p><p>"How many days was I out this time? I asked, not even trying to get up. "What about the guests?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Eight hours. We closed the shop for the day. We didn't have many guests after that."</p><p><br></p><p>“Did Milim leave?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is staying in Tempest for the time being.” Shuna replied and I saw a strained smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, after you passed out, Tohru-chan thought you were hurt and almost attacked Milim-sama. She was stopped at the right time by Rimuru-sama but she was very angry. She only stopped when she found out that you were actually evolving and not exactly hurt.”</p><p><br></p><p>... </p><p><br></p><p>I won’t lie but I felt quite warm knowing that she did that especially since I knew she was shit scared of Milim’s power.</p><p><br></p><p>“Milim didn’t get angry, did she?” I asked, suddenly remembering the actual demon lord in the basket.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. She just laughed it off and even praised Tohru-chan. She said you had good subordinates and that she would let everything go for two chocolate cakes.”</p><p><br></p><p>... </p><p><br></p><p>She was really a child.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head at the antics of the little Demon Lord.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about Sakura and Lavy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They haven’t returned yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” Thank goodness they haven’t returned or they would be worried for no reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for taking care of the situation, Shuna." I smiled at her.</p><p><br></p><p>"It's my job." She replied with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and lay there resting for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuna’s scent felt nice. She smelled sweet, like cherry blossoms.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly remembered what Lavy had told me about Shuna last night and suddenly the whole situation felt quite intimate.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she really interested in me?</p><p><br></p><p>“Shuna.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?’</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me something about yourself, about your life in the Ogre Village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to know more about you.” I said seriously and saw the girl blush.</p><p><br></p><p>The lights in the Restaurant were dim but my senses were extremely sharp after evolving. Seeing in the dark was nothing, I could do so earlier too.</p><p><br></p><p>But now, it was on a whole other level.</p><p><br></p><p>I had thought that my evolution to a Daemon Chevalier had made me stronger but all that was nothing compared to what I was feeling right now.</p><p><br></p><p>This evolution… it was something… far deeper as if something fundamental has changed about me.</p><p><br></p><p>I’ll have to ask Rimuru later on.</p><p><br></p><p>Arch Daemon.</p><p><br></p><p>Sounds like the Demon version of Archangels.</p><p><br></p><p>But still, how freaking strong was Milim?</p><p><br></p><p>We had to fight and risk our lives and even then my previous evolution had occurred due to me accidentally eating that Clown’s soul and Milim pushed me further with just simple naming. Moreover while Rimuru was weakened by naming the ogres, she didn’t even look like she was breathing heavily.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon Lords were scary.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder, Tohru was so scared of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, it looked like she was quite easygoing and didn’t take it to heart.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and snapped out of these thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuna was telling me her story and I didn’t want to think about other things while she was pouring her heart out to me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Zeref -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He waited in the room as the door was opened and a figure entered. The figure paused looking at him, his eyes widening but he still let out a sigh and sat down.</p><p><br></p><p>"I didn't think I would ever see you again. Not that I am unhappy. It brings back some nostalgic memories of my youth but why are you here, Zeref?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Warrod. You look…"</p><p><br></p><p>"Old, like a tree? Yes. Magic is strange. I can't say I dislike this form of mine. Rather I find myself much closer to nature."</p><p><br></p><p>"I was going to say well but… I need your help, Warrod."</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He didn't answer but looked questioningly.</p><p><br></p><p>"I found a way to remove the curse of contradiction. I am free now."</p><p><br></p><p>Warrod Sequen was probably one of the only people in Ishgar who knew about him and the truth about the Black Wizard Zeref so the fact that the man's eyes widened and his jaws hung open was not a big surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>"Are you?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Yes. I am here to take her back."</p><p><br></p><p>"They will not allow you to step foot in Ishgar. Your name is…."</p><p><br></p><p>"And yet I stand here. You know as well as I do that if I really wanted to push, they cannot stop me. But I don't wish for any bloodshed. Not anymore. I just wish to take Mavis away with me and free her of her curse. In return, I will remove Tartarus and all the demons inside it. This is my offer to you. Should the Magic Council refuse it, even the Etherion or Face will not be able to save you, this… I promise."</p><p><br></p><p>A tense atmosphere descended on the room.</p><p><br></p><p>"Let her decide what she wants to do. I will ask Makarov. We will meet on Tenroujima Island in a week."</p><p><br></p><p>"Very well."</p><p><br></p><p>"Zeref… Precht, he…"</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Went rogue. He is now the leader of a Dark Guild working together with Tartarus."</p><p><br></p><p>"... I see."</p><p><br></p><p>He got up and was about to leave the room when he heard the voice of Warrod once more. "Congratulations on being free, Zeref."</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, old friend.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Irene –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the bunch of children behind her, following one who looked like a miniature version of her.</p><p><br></p><p>She never thought that there would be a day where she would be able to return for her daughter again.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, when the day comes, she is afraid to even call out to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Being able to taste food again had done a lot of good for her. Especially when she discovered the fact that she could sleep after eating the food from the restaurant. The voices in her head started to become quieter.</p><p><br></p><p>She was regaining her lost sanity bit by bit and this reignited her hope of reuniting with her daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>And what does she see when she comes back?</p><p><br></p><p>Her daughter, enslaved and forced to work by some cultists? The audacity.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind them lay the smouldering wreckage of the Tower of Heaven. A way to resurrect Zeref, the black haired girl had claimed. What foolishness!</p><p><br></p><p>How would you revive someone who is already alive?</p><p><br></p><p>They were obviously being used by someone, the one called Precht.</p><p><br></p><p>"I assume you will be taking care of Tartarus?" She asked Zeref who was sitting on a rock nearby, waiting for them.</p><p><br></p><p>"August found a child with an innate Satan Soul Take Over Magic. He wants her to devour the magic of the ones in Tartarus for her growth." He looked at the children behind her. "Congratulations on finding your daughter."</p><p><br></p><p>She froze. The children behind her froze as she looked back.</p><p><br></p><p>Her daughter was staring at her with shock on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She had the urge to glare at Zeref but then again, it made things a lot easier for her by breaking the ice between the two of them.</p><p><br></p><p>She turned back to Zeref. "The person behind this was the second Guild Master of Fairy Tail, Precht. He was manipulating the children to build the tower. I will take care of him myself."</p><p><br></p><p>He thought for a moment before answering. "Take August with you. He is related to Tartarus. August will take care of that side." She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>"And you?"</p><p><br></p><p>"You have reunited with your family. It's about time I got reunited with mine as well."</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tsunade -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Has Sensei finally gone over the edge?” She asked as she stepped under the gates of the village which she had vowed never to return.</p><p>“I warn you Tsunade, Sensei was not his usual easy going self the last time I met him. You should watch how you speak in front of him.” Jiraiya warned, seriously making her grit her teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Or what? It’s not like I have anything to lose. What can he do to me either way?” She rolled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>This village had already taken everything from her.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t have anything left to lose anymore so she wasn’t afraid of what the old man might do.</p><p><br></p><p>While they walked, she saw several people looking in her direction and speaking to themselves. Apart from that she even noticed a strange atmosphere, a strange tension of sorts in the village.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she had felt some unkind gazes from unseen corners of the village.</p><p><br></p><p>Has the friction between the village and the Uchiha clan reached this point already? </p><p><br></p><p>Was that why she was called back right now, because there could be a war anytime?</p><p><br></p><p>As they walked towards the Hokage building, she saw a few familiar faces. No, calling them familiar would be a stretch as they had changed a lot with age.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kakashi, Guy.” Jiraiya greeted them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Jiraiya-sama, Tsunade-sama.” The two bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Off to a mission again? You should take a break sometimes” Jiraiya asked Kakashi and Tsunade remembered more about the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>Kakashi Hatake, the son of the White Fang, Sakumo Hatake and the student of the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy’s eyes looked dead. Then again, so did many other people’s.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the ones who could remain in this profession and still keep their sanity who were the odd ones.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have just returned from a mission and am on my way to the Hokage Tower to report.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, come then. We were going to report to sensei too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kakashi nodded and looked at Guy “Then I will be off, Guy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, Kakashi, my friend. I can take you to my favourite Restaurant next time.” The guy in the green jumpsuit shouted loud enough to make Tsunade check her ear drums for any damages.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure sure.” Kakashi waved off and followed them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has there been any updates since I left the village”? Jiraiya asked, while they were walking towards the Hokage tower.</p><p><br></p><p>Kakashi shook his head, looking more… dead somehow as if that was even possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsunade looked confused at them not knowing the topic of their discussion.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything on your end?” Kakashi asked and Jiraiya also shook his head looking tired.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has something happened?” She asked, her curiosity getting the best of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will know when we are inside.” Jiraiya said, cryptically.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and in minutes, they were already at the Hokage’s tower.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraiya knocked on the door and a familiar voice answered it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>On entering the door, she saw her sensei again, after over a decade. He seemed so old and frail all of a sudden. How long had it been again?</p><p><br></p><p>The old man smiled. “It’s good to have you back, Tsunade.”</p><p><br></p><p>His voice broke her thoughts and her eyebrows scrunched. “I wish I could say the same but I have no good feelings about returning to this place again.”</p><p><br></p><p>She saw his face shift through several emotions, first sadness, then helplessness and guilt and finally resolve.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I am afraid that you will have to make do with it. I have given you more than enough time to recuperate, far more than anyone else. It’s time you dealt with your problems once and for all.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was taken aback at his words. She had never seen him behave like this.</p><p><br></p><p>After shock came anger.</p><p><br>“I am retired.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shinobi only retire when they are dead.” He replied, his voice cold. “The village needs your assistance at this time. I cannot allow you to throw your tantrums anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>She gritted her teeth but didn’t reply. The old man was just like he had been during the wars, the one which had earned him the title of a God of Shinobi.</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly has been going on in the village? What is so important that you have forced me to come here again?” Finally taking a breath, she asked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Konoha is on the verge of a Civil War and I need your help to stop it.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that all her hopes of sneaking away were crushed altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href="https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So the misunderstandings are spreading and this time Shadow himself confirmed everything.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Shadow Garden will be joining the fray soon.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On the topic of joining the frays, our favourite Demon Lord, Milim has entered the Restaurant finally.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will clear up some plots of different worlds first before exploring more of the Dxd world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>
