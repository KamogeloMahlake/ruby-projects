        <p><strong>Ace in the Hole</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 5: The Guardian</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Acelin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The night was long. I couldn’t contact the Emperor right now but I knew that this night would not be peaceful.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, not being able to do anything, I decided to check on my rewards from this.</p><p><br></p><p>I got four new Teigu.</p><p><br></p><p>The first one was, the One Cut Killer, Murasame. A Teigu known to kill any biological lifeform in a single cut and it even destroys their souls.</p><p><br></p><p>The second one was the Power Surging Balzac.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, this thing was an anomaly in itself. According to me it was extremely underrated due to several facts.</p><p><br></p><p>First was because people of that world couldn’t use two Teigu together without causing some kind of irreversible harm to themselves and thus they could never figure out the true Potential of this Teigu.</p><p><br></p><p>Balzac was an utter hack which could… unlock 100 percent of the hidden potential of an individual.</p><p><br></p><p>There was however a catch.</p><p><br></p><p>It only worked for the body and mind and not for energies like mana or demonic power. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it was made without considering Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>But even then, it was extremely useful too if used to learn something. Normally, we only use a small part of our mind and body but with this, we can access most of its strength.</p><p><br></p><p>This is even greater for me, a natural born devil as I can achieve extremely high levels of physical and mental power.</p><p><br></p><p>Another flaw of this is that… it’s ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. This thing looks so fucking ugly, I wouldn’t be caught dead in this. It sticks out like a sore thumb and people would obviously try to find out what it does.</p><p><br></p><p>So I can only use it in case of extreme emergencies or when learning something.</p><p><br></p><p>The third Teigu was, the Dimensional Formation, Sambhala.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a Teigu which could manipulate Space and Time and allow the user as well as others to teleport from one place to another. I still had to test its limits but I had several ways to use this one in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, I looked at the last one, a sealed golden container in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon God Manifestation, Demon’s Extract.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing attracted me as if calling out to me. I quickly used Occlumency to shield myself and found that it was indeed a type of mental attack.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder this thing could drive people mad in that world, a place with no concept of mental defences, when consumed.</p><p><br></p><p>It would be similar to having that voice inside my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone without proper control would be rendered insane by the constant murmuring inside their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>In return for taking such a risk, the user would get insane amounts of power.This thing made Esdeath, a human with a wall level to small building levels of strength into someone who could freeze even time.</p><p><br></p><p>This was without a doubt the strongest of the Teigu overall.</p><p><br></p><p>But to drink it without any kind of preparation would be foolish.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have some kind of stupid plot armour to help me out of this situation.</p><p><br>Even Esdeath, someone with an insanely strong will also had a change of personality. It might be due to the power but at the same time it could also be due to the effects of the Teigu itself.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not going to let myself get caught unguarded.</p><p><br></p><p>So I quickly made a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>This Teigu was made from the lifeblood of a Super Class Danger Beast who lived in the northern part of the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>So maybe it was the leftover will or soul of the Danger Beast in the Blood which caused this effect. If so, then maybe the will could be removed or sealed to get this magic without any kind of side effects.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to work on my Occlumency Skills till I can bear it for the worst case scenario while at the same time seeing what I can do to remove the taint of the Danger Beast in the blood.</p><p><br></p><p>There are ways to purify or remove leftover will or souls from objects in this world. It was in fact one of the most common types of jobs offered to Devils of higher ranks - to remove the curse or leftover wills from a magical object.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to research more.</p><p><br></p><p>But regardless, my harvest today was enormous.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t expect the Emperor to make such a deal with me.</p><p><br></p><p>It does provide me with a way to expand my influence in the other world.</p><p><br></p><p>That world had so many interesting things.</p><p><br></p><p>Danger Beasts and the country which made the Teigu which can be classified as top tier artifacts even in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to plan everything.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in mind, I let myself fall asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was in front of Mephisto the next morning.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night the Emperor hadn’t contacted me anymore. He might have had a lot of things to take care of so I didn’t bother him either. Things like these couldn’t be rushed.</p><p><br></p><p>In the next few months, he will have to remain under protection at all times so that he isn’t assassinated by someone from the Prime Minister’s side.</p><p><br></p><p>Until the people around him were completely purged of rebels and corrupt officials, he had to remain under guard.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully he had the current strongest man of the Empire under him.</p><p><br></p><p>General Budo was the current strongest man in the Empire because the current Esdeath was still only fourteen years old or so.</p><p><br></p><p>That was not to say that she was weak. She was currently a captain in the Empire’s army and was easily influenced.</p><p><br></p><p>I was going to take her in as a part of my team.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the Emperor, I did make some preparations for his protection.</p><p><br></p><p>He currently had two full vials of the Luck Potion to protect him which should keep him out of trouble for a full twenty four hours.</p><p><br></p><p>This was an investment.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto’s words broke me out of my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have two pieces of news for you. First of all, your request for the High Class Magician Promotion Exams have been accepted. You just needed agreement from three Ultimate Class Magicians or a dozen High Class Magicians with a decade long experience at the High Class level in the organisation to get the certification." He brought out a badge from his drawer. “There you go. Over fifty of your students agreed to your promotion already so now you are officially a High Class Magician… congratulations.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the badge in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“That easy?” I couldn’t help but ask.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? High Class certification is still quite low for what you have achieved. Creating a whole new branch of magic is something only a handful of people have done in this world. This alone was enough to promote you. Not to mention, your… older students didn’t want to learn from someone who didn’t even have a High Class certification. Overall, congratulations. You are now officially a High Class Magician.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I looked at the badge in surprise while he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?” I asked, narrowing my eyes at his following words.</p><p><br></p><p>He repeated his words and I frowned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two months of public service in the ‘Research and Development Department’ under Ajuka Beelzebub?” I asked, suspiciously.</p><p><br></p><p>“He doesn’t want any information about your magic you don’t want to disclose and just wants a sharp mind like yours in some of his own projects. As you know that his Evil Pieces also changes its targets. A joint research to see if any changes could be made into the Evil Pieces if your magic is used. You just have to assist him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought about the whole thing and sighed. Mephisto took this chance to explain everything in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>“I personally think you should take up on this opportunity. Working even for two months under him will help you develop a lot as a magician. You wouldn’t believe how many magicians would give up almost anything for such a chance. Apart from that, Ajuka is not the type to nitpick about other things as long as you do your work properly so you don’t have to worry about your disguise in front of him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I almost jolted at his words and then realising the situation I merely shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously he knew.</p><p><br></p><p>It would be strange if he didn’t realise months after taking me in. He’s someone older than even the previous Satans. It would be strange if he didn’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>“How long?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Ah, I knew it from the first day itself.” He shrugged. “But our deal doesn’t require you to reveal your identity so why does it matter to me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you not curious?” I asked, while trying to probe surface thoughts with legilimency, not exactly probing directly to avoid messing things up.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am. Just to clarify, I still don’t know who you are, only the fact that you are under a disguise at all times. In my long life I have learned to control my curiosity quite well.” he laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man strangely.</p><p><br></p><p>He passed on the documents to me regarding my public service sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did negotiate something from your side. Your <em>public sentence</em> will be known as an internship so as to avoid negatively affecting any chances of promotion for you. This was the best I could get from them. In return I got something else… you get a place in the Recommendation Games which are being held a year and half later to showcase your strength and get a Middle Class promotion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Recommendation Games?” I asked, raising my eyebrows.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh right, you don’t know about that. Haven’t been keeping up with the news of the underworld lately, have you?” he then went on to explain the details of the games which had been introduced due to some random bullshit I had spewed back then.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Damn… I had no idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto continued while I was in thought. “To be honest, I could just give you a recommendation myself but I think you should take this opportunity to showcase your strength and talent in front of the whole Underworld so that other native Low Class Devils get a better representation in future.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I thank you for your offer but I think I will participate in the games.” I said after some thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing is free huh?” he laughed, shaking his head in amusement. “Well, it’s a good policy after all so you’ll hear no complaints from me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of the exams in a year and a half and there was no way I was going to win there with my current strength. Even if I were to train day and night, I still probably won’t make it, knowing how many people will be participating in such a competition.</p><p><br></p><p>To win it, I would need an edge. I still don’t know if they will allow special weapons in the competition or if there was a no kill rule so Teigu might not help.</p><p><br></p><p>At least not all of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally deciding on something I looked up at Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… have a request to ask of you. If you want, I can pay for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow but signalled me to go on.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wish to learn exorcism and purification techniques if possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exorcism? Where did that come from?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath, “I have something personal which needs purification.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It contains the leftover will of a Demonic Beast. I wish to purify it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man scratched his chin. “Hmm. Devils are not exactly known for purification techniques. Curses are different matters. But I can talk to someone if you want to purify it urgently. As for learning such things, it might take some time. You can decide what to do for yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought for a few seconds and nodded. “I will have it purified first and will learn the purification techniques too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. I will arrange for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Payment?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled. “How about you tell me your identity?”</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow. “I thought you could control your curiosity.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I said I can control it better than most but why should I if I don’t have to.” he shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed. I will have to reveal it in a year and half anyways and this guy… he’s done a lot for me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. Once the deal is complete, I will tell you my identity.”</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled brightly. “Well we have a deal then. Always have fun making deals with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few things and I left to prepare for the next class.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Najenda -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Empire was in an uproar since yesterday when the Emperor suddenly decided to take matters into his own hands. All the loyal generals of the Emperor had gone on a crusade, taking out Prime Minister Honest and all his supporters.</p><p><br></p><p>There was obviously a lot of resistance but none stood any chance.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the man standing behind the Emperor currently, like an immovable wall, she recalled the amount of destruction this man was capable of causing.</p><p><br></p><p>Great General Budo. The commander of the Imperial Guards and the highest ranking officer of the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>After seeing him in action today, she didn’t doubt his powers for a single instant.</p><p><br></p><p>Every person which the Prime Minister could rally with him had been crushed instantly and captured.</p><p><br></p><p>Hundreds of people kneeled in the courtyards and in front of the whole group was the Prime Minister or rather the former Prime Minister Honest.</p><p><br></p><p>Both his arms were torn apart.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened before he could even use his Teigu.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from him, his entire family, distant and close, were all in the group and this was still just the first group of people who were inside the Imperial Palace.</p><p><br></p><p>There would still be hundreds even thousands of others who will be brought to justice later.</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t expected the Emperor to be this decisive at such a young age.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor looked at them and stood up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since everyone is already present here, we shall conduct the trial.” He brought out several vials from his pocket. “General Budo… use a drop of this on the tongues of every person before you question. It will make sure that they cannot lie.”</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p>Was there such a thing?</p><p><br>Was it something new made by the Empire?</p><p><br></p><p>But looking at the General’s face, she didn’t think even the man himself knew.</p><p><br></p><p>He still ordered his subordinates to follow the procedure.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few hours, everyone was questioned and to their horror, none of them could lie no matter what.</p><p><br></p><p>They all were forced to speak their true thoughts regardless.</p><p><br></p><p>Every one of them accepted their crimes and even provided the proof themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>It was honestly frightening to see such a power.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, it was time for the judgement to be served.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor stood up once more. He had tears in his eyes as he looked at the crowd in front of him but he wiped it off quickly. It was easy to forget that he was still a kid whose parents were killed by these people due to the determination he had shown today.</p><p><br></p><p>“All of you have plotted against the Empire and its peace. For that… there can be only one punishment. Death. But you people have done something far worse than traitors before you for you have the blood of even my parents, the previous Emperor, on your hands. This is a crime which cannot be punished with just a simple death. So… we leave your executions to the Guardian of the Empire. Repent in Death and be honest citizens in your next lives.”</p><p><br></p><p>Guardian?</p><p><br></p><p>She was not the only one who was surprised at the proclamations.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Great General Budo was puzzled.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor didn’t pay any attention to anyone and brought out a piece of paper from his pocket and held it close to his head and closed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them waited to see what he was doing and then it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>A rift appeared in space and slowly turned into a portal.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if someone had torn open a hole in space.</p><p><br></p><p>General Budo quickly stood in front of the Emperor but the Emperor himself stepped around him to the front and stood facing the strange hole.</p><p><br></p><p>“We offer you the souls of these traitors. Take all of them and bring prosperity and peace to the Empire.” The Emperor looked at the hole and spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>A hand appeared out of the hole, carrying a stick of sorts and waved it and… in front of the shocked eyes of everyone present, all those criminals… hundreds of lives… were all turned into marbles and fell on the floor.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the scene with her mouth wide open as a chill ran down her spine.</p><p><br></p><p>The hand waved again as the marbles flew to it and another hand appeared with a small pouch which collected them all.</p><p><br></p><p>What was it?</p><p><br></p><p>A danger beast?</p><p><br></p><p>A Teigu?</p><p><br></p><p>As if to answer their questions, a voice sounded from the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>“It shall be done.”</p><p><br></p><p>The voice seemed like that of a young boy but the Emperor looked at the place with complete seriousness.</p><p><br></p><p>With the words said, the hole closed back.</p><p><br></p><p>They still kept staring at the empty space in awe and wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>It seemed as if the Empire still held a lot of secrets and Honest had really underestimated the powers behind the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point she could only hope that these forces bring about the good of the people of the Empire now because she couldn’t even imagine what this kind of power could do if they intended harm.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Acelin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the marbles in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Six hundred and thirty three souls.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know how strong I will become if I consume this but one thing I know for sure is that I will definitely lose control. There was a reason why the devils were so crazy back in the day.</p><p><br></p><p>A rapid increase in power by eating souls has consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover it’s not like there are no limits or the Satan Descendants would have easily become Satan Class… which they didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>To use all these, I need a better method. Rituals sound good. More research will be needed for this.</p><p><br></p><p>I will hold on to these souls and any more that will come till then.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing which has been worrying me a lot is that I haven’t been able to get any contracts from other worlds apart from these two.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been regularly throwing a pamphlet in randomly opened holes to contract other worlds but there has been no progress yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should take some emergency measures.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the trunk where I kept my stuff and after a minute of thought, I opened it to bring out a vial of luck potion.</p><p><br></p><p>I took one sip, enough to last me for the next hour and started opening holes and throwing Summoning Contracts into them one after another.</p><p><br></p><p>I left everything to luck.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two days had passed.</p><p><br></p><p>I used the luck potion method for the last two days and I feel like my luck potion was wasted.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor is still cleaning up the Empire but I gave him some books and a list of people who needed to be recruited as the first batch for my team.</p><p><br></p><p>I was currently going to Mephisto for something.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching his office, I knocked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.” His voice came from inside and on opening the door to the office, I saw that he was not alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on in Ace. We were just waiting for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him with a questioning expression on which he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“The thing about learning purification. I talked to a friend of mine and he knew someone who is an expert at these matters. We can go there and get the item you wanted purified as well as have a talk about the lessons. Take whatever you need. We need to head out in an hour.”</p><p><br></p><p>So fast?</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, it was better if it was fast.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m ready. I already have everything I need.” All of my important belongings are in the shrunk trunk hanging on my necklace in case I ever needed to flee.</p><p><br></p><p>The last trunk which I had buried in the forest near the pit, the super large trunk which I had obtained from Dumbledore was still there as I hadn’t been able to bring it back.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to go back there once more and get it as well as meet Dave again.</p><p><br></p><p>He must be worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. In that case, let’s leave. I also have a meeting with that acquaintance of mine. Lavinia can also get out and see a new place.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Lavy who looked very excited at the prospect of going to a new place and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We teleported out of the organisation building.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The scene in front of our eyes changed. I looked around and it was an orchard of sorts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are we?” I asked, looking around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Japan.” Mephisto said as he led the way. “My friend has already had a talk with someone. I just need to drop you and Lavinia there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Japan?</p><p><br></p><p>The country where all the bullshit in this world apparently happens.</p><p><br></p><p>I was making a point to avoid this place as much as possible but it looks like I was dragged here anyways.</p><p><br></p><p>Just who are we going to meet?</p><p><br></p><p>A shrine appeared in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the old devil and he answered my unasked question.</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s a shrine maiden. They are extremely well versed in Purification.”</p><p><br></p><p>I waved away my stray thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>We are just meeting a Shrine Maiden.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing bad will happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>There must be thousands of Shrine Maidens in this country.</p><p><br></p><p>No reason to be tense.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, we were just meeting a random Shrine Maiden. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p><br></p><p>We were meeting a random Shrine Maiden, right?</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly realised that he didn’t tell us the name so I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s her name?”</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could answer, we saw a girl running directly towards us, tears in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Help! They… those people will kill Okaa-sama.” The girl shouted and sure enough a couple of men in kimonos ran out of the shrine, chasing after the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>FUCK!</p><p><br></p><p>I jinxed it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace, take them down. Just make sure they are able to answer questions. Be careful. They are jutsusha from their uniforms. Lavinia, protect the girl.” Mephisto ordered as he himself took action, erecting a barrier around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Jutsusha were japanese practitioners or spell users, basically the japanese version of Magicians.</p><p><br></p><p>These people wielded swords and were running towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Devils! Move away. This is not your matter.” One of them shouted but I had already taken action.</p><p><br></p><p>With a wave of my hand, the nearby tree turned into a wave of bees and swarmed them.</p><p><br></p><p>They were not expecting this as they waved their swords to fend them off while some were taking out some kind of talismans but I wasn’t about to give them any chance.</p><p><br></p><p>I transfigured the ground beneath their feet, making a pit and they fell down, destroying their balance. Another wave of my hand ensured that the soil had returned and transformed into hardened concrete around them, leaving only their heads out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please….help my Okaa-sama. She is hurt. Those people stabbed her.” The girl held my sleeve and pleaded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is your Mother, kid?” Mephisto asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She pointed towards the direction and quickly led us there.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching there, we saw a woman lying in a pool of her own blood.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly checked her breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Is she?” Mephisto asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head.<br><br></p><p>“NOOOOOOOOOO!” The girl bawled as she threw herself on the body of the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch… he owes me for this.” Mephisto clicked his tongue. “Move child. There is still a chance to save her life.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia quickly held the girl and Mephisto brought out his Evil Pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>A Bishop Piece was brought out and it floated over her before entering her body. A light shone around her.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first time I was watching someone use an Evil Piece before.</p><p><br></p><p>A few seconds later, the woman opened her eyes and Lavy released the girl who immediately jumped at the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“Geez, what a mess. You two talk to her first. I will inform my friend and her husband about the situation.” Mephisto bailed out on us.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the woman who was currently hugging the crying girl and looking at us in confusion and had an urge to bang my head on the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>Just where did I get stuck?</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, hello. I am from the Grauzaberer Magician Organisation and I was here to get something purified. We saw those people chasing her and she requested for help and…” I explained the situation to her in brief as a look of understanding came to her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I thank you for saving my daughter’s life. You don’t need to be so tense. I might have been reincarnated as a devil but it’s better than being dead. You and your guardian have saved our family a lot of pain. I am sure Baraqiel will not mind either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… you are welcome.” I replied awkwardly and then something stuck me. “Excuse me, who?”</p><p><br></p><p>No way this was her.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman smiled at my expression. “My husband Baraqiel, a cadre of the Fallen Angels.”</p><p><br></p><p>That fucking bastard Dumbledore gave me fake Luck Potions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ufufufufufu you don’t have to be worried. I don’t think he would be angry at you all. After all you saved my and my daughter and my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>She laughed but I could sense that she was still worried from taking a slight look at her surface thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>I still nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… we will give you both some space then. Come Lavy.” Lavy nodded and we left the room.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He teleported to the Shrine where Brarqiel and his wife lived.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost half an hour ago he had received a message from Mephisto whom he had referred to Shuri Himejima for some purification.</p><p><br></p><p>Some jutsusha had attacked Shuri Himejima and her daughter and killed Shuri and were chasing her daughter and now she was a Devil… just want kind of mess was this?</p><p><br></p><p>As he neared the building, he was met with a weird scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto, along with two kids, were standing in front of several people who were buried till their necks in hard concrete.</p><p><br></p><p>“Azazel, next time you refer me to someone, make sure there are no hidden trials. At my age, my heart doesn’t take such surprises well.” The old devil greeted him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am almost as old as you.” He retorted before looking at the captives. “How did you get them in there like that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, it was Ace who took care of them. I just asked him to leave them in a condition to answer questions. They are all yours now.” Mephisto waved his hand and stepped aside.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the two kids behind him. So this was Ace, the new genius Magician who created the Transfiguration Magic, a completely new type of magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel had heard about the boy through many of his contacts and there were even some people from Grigori who wanted to assassinate the kid before he could grow into something big but Mephisto’s stance made every one of them hesitate.</p><p><br></p><p>Seventeen bases of three Magician Organisations were destroyed by Tannin as a warning. Such a retaliation was not expected by anyone as assassination attempts at talents of the other organisation were more common than most people thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure two of those organisations were small fries but the last one was anything but.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wizards of Oz were a troublesome foe and Mephisto didn’t give them an inch. This greatly discouraged any foes from trying their luck.</p><p><br></p><p>But right now was not the time to test the golden boy of Mephisto. He turned his attention towards the captives.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who sent you to kill Shuri Himejima and her daughter?” He turned and asked the captives.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, no answer came.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them even had the guts to spit towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head and turned towards Mephisto. “Can you send the kids away?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Them? Don’t mind them. Both of them can take it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He shrugged. “Your wish then.” With that said, he smashed the jaw of the guy who had spit at him, breaking it and making him howl in pain.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the group’s face hardened but took on an enraged look.</p><p><br></p><p>“We will sooner give our lives than answer you, Monster.” One of them roared.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch… this is why I don’t like dealing with these kinds of people. They think dying is the worst thing which can happen to them.” He summoned a magic circle and called in for some backup to take them for interrogation.</p><p><br></p><p>He then turned back towards the Devil. “Come in. Baraqiel is on his way too. These fools will be taken care of.”</p><p><br></p><p>They walked towards the house and greeted the lady of the house.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl on the other hand looked emotionally exhausted and had fallen asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have any ideas about who they could be?” he questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “I only know that they were Baraquiel’s enemies. They didn’t say anything else for me to know but I suspect that they might have been sent by my family.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Himejima Clan?</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm… the way she had left the house was not exactly pleasant to say the least. But would they hire people to kill her?</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think?” He heard Mephisto questioning the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me?” The boy looked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Go on. What do you think of the situation? The faster this is taken care of, the faster you can get your work done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... they were not killers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean they were not trained killers. More like people who had a grudge. Trained killers would never have let a child escape so easily. Moreover, the stab wound would have been at a more vital place and they would have had some kind of suicide measures in case they got caught but they didn’t. I think if they are… questioned… a bit forcefully, they would break.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But how would they know when Baraqiel would be out? That kind of information is not easily available.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy shrugged. “They might have been hired or informed by someone but I doubt that one of the five Principal Clans would hire such amateur assassins for something like this. It might have been for some other purpose.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. That does sound reasonable. They will be speaking everything in no time. But the matter of Shuri still remains.” He turned toward Mephisto, “So, what do you think?”</p><p><br></p><p>The old Devil shrugged. “She can discuss it with Baraqiel. It’s not like I ask anything from my peerage members.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. In that case, Baraqiel can discuss it with you. I still have to take care of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Soon, the backup he had called arrived and they took the people in for interrogation.</p><p><br></p><p>Baraqiel arrived soon after that and reunited with his scared family and after reassuring them, he sat down to discuss the future path.</p><p><br></p><p>“I could appoint guards to this place but you know how that will end up. The Principal Clans will be causing problems, not to mention our people will also question the decision to guard a devil. Pardon my bland words.” he turned towards Shuri and apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry, I understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>Baraqiel sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto spoke at this point. “If I may?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You could always send her to the Grauzaberer Organisation. I mean she is technically my peerage member. She can stay there and be protected. And it’s not like you all don’t visit there anyway. It would be out of Japan and the Principal Clans have no influence there either. That’s only if you all have no problems with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Baraqiel and his wife. It was their choice after all.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them had some talks and agreed to Mephisto’s proposal.</p><p><br></p><p>They would stay over at Grauzaberer until this matter was taken care of to avoid any danger to their daughter Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ace -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The chaos was settled by the time it was night.</p><p><br></p><p>We wanted to leave and get the Purification done some other day but Shuri wanted to repay us by helping us out today itself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright go on. Bring whatever you want out.” Mephisto asked me and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I pointed to an empty corner of the room to the lady of the house. “Can I use that place?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded in agreement and I removed the trunk from my necklace and placed it there.</p><p><br></p><p>The people in the room looked at me with confusion as I waved my wand and the trunk expanded to the normal size.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t pay attention to them and opened the trunk door and entered it, soon returning back with a smaller trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy was looking at the trunks with bright eyes and so did Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s that?” he asked, pointing towards the trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was trying my hand at Enchanting. It’s basically my lab. I carry it with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A lab?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.” I ignored them and opened the smaller trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside it was one of the Teigu I had gained from the Emperor yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did you get such a thing? I don’t think I recognize it from anywhere.” Azazel asked, looking at the Jar of Demon’s Extract.</p><p><br></p><p>“I worked as a hunter in the pits.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto looked at me oddly. “You’re fourteen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… and your point is?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man shut his mouth at the answer. Even Azazel and Baraqiel became quiet</p><p><br></p><p>I placed the jar in front of the woman as everyone narrowed their eyes at it.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is the blood of a strong Demonic Beast. It still has some leftover will of the beast. I want to have it purified to remove the will to use it in one of my experiments. Do you think it can be done without losing any of the properties?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alchemy?’ Mephisto asked and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Transfiguration is related to Alchemy.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already removed a glass of the Demon’s Extract aside.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman checked the jar a few times and then drew symbols around it to isolate the effects of the Demon’s Extract.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is very strong. In fact, I haven’t seen this kind of aura from anyone apart from the Vermilion Bird but this one feels a lot more raw, unfiltered and Demonic. Yes, I know how to remove the leftover will from this. In fact, many of the inks Onmyoji use for their talismans are made from the blood of powerful Youkai and they need to remove their leftover wills from them, but it will be hard. I will need to do some preparations and need to collect some materials too and most importantly, I will need several other Miko to help me with this. It would have been easy if I had the help of the Himejima Clan but…”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… I see. In that case, can you teach me some purification techniques?’ I asked. “I have been very interested in such things.”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled. “That I can do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I look forward to learning from you, Shuri-san.” I bowed lightly. It was the best thing I can get for now. I will just have to find another way to purify this Teigu.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Today was such an utter waste of time.</p><p><br></p><p>Well not exactly a waste as saving Shuri Himejima did get me a cookie point from the Fallen Angels, however small that might have been.</p><p><br></p><p>But overall, I got exposed to more people that I would have liked.</p><p><br></p><p>And I didn’t like that.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the reason I had rejected Mephisto’s offer of recommendation was because I would have to sit for the examinations with my real identity in a year and a half and that would mean everyone would know who I am and more importantly where I am.</p><p><br></p><p>The contract between Mephisto and me didn’t end for two and half years, which was one year later.</p><p><br></p><p>During that one year, I would be easily targetable.</p><p><br></p><p>But if I participated in the Recommendation Games with my own identity, then I could always return here with my disguise and work for the remaining one year… unbothered.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want people to notice me until I was strong enough to defend myself from them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>But as they say… the best laid plans of men and mice.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I sensed a summoning once more.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly waved my hand and cleaned my room, ready to receive the summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>The hole opened and on the other end was a spiky brown haired green eyed boy. He looked like a Japanese guy around sixteen or seventeen and was wearing an outfit consisting of a gold-trimmed green mantle, white shirt, pants, and leather boots. He had a short sword on his belt.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why but it seemed oddly familiar for some reason but I couldn’t remember why.</p><p><br></p><p>“W-w-who are you?” He asked, pointing a finger at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. My name is Acelin Belphegor. May I know what your name is?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Satou Kazuma.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously?” I asked in a deadpan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi why are you giving me that look, bastard?” he pointed his finger at me and jumped in his place.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are the guy who died because you were scared by a tractor.” I deadpanned, making him freeze. I observed him with Legilimency.</p><p><br></p><p>It was him.</p><p><br></p><p>“H-h-how do you know that?” He asked me to turn pale and then looked around himself to see if anyone heard what I said. “Dammit, did Aqua spread it all over Heaven?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There are many things I know. By the way, would you like to trade something? I have plenty of stuff you might be interested in.” I waved his worries off.</p><p><br></p><p>“W-what stuff?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Video Games, consoles, manga, hentai doujinshi…” As I said each word, the guy stilled for a moment and then jumped at the hole directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I agree. Tell me what you want? I can even trade a goddess, an expert magician and a crusader.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no interest in the Loli Explosion Magician, the Masochistic Crusader and the Useless Goddess… but maybe you could give me something else.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy’s mouth opened. “You really know things.”</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what will it be?”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly laid out everything he had in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Coins, potions, adventurer card and a lot of random stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing which caught my eye was a sword.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh, nice eye you have there Ace. This is the fabled Cursed Sword Gram. It can cut through anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nintendo and one game.” I offered, stopping him from advertising.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! You are robbing me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not like you or anyone else other than Mitsurugi can use it there. Even if I trade it, it’s more than likely to be useless.” I shrugged, making him blanche.</p><p><br></p><p>“Three games with a Nintendo and a Gameboy.” He quickly bargained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Three games with a Nintendo and a Gameboy and know what, I will even throw in a magical charger which can charge the consoles with Magic but you will have to make Aqua do something for me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aqua?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. I need her to cast a purification magic on something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...just that much?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not tricking me, are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have anything to lose? If you want, I can give you half the payment upfront.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? Then deal.” he gave me a thumbs up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” I brought out a gameboy and two games from my trunk and threw it at him while taking Gram.</p><p><br></p><p>I always kept a stock of games and stuff to trade with the Kid Emperor but he’s in his serious mode right now so…</p><p><br></p><p>“I will get that useless Goddess in five minutes.” He said as he ran out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and if she tries to attack or purify me… I am not ever trading anything with you ever.” I warned him first.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to test the might of a Goddess’ purification on my body.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy gave me a thumbs up and ran away while I closed the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the sword in my hand and passed my Demonic Power through it.</p><p><br></p><p>A smile appeared on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>It worked.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils could use such equipment innately in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>My guess is that Mitsurugi was blessed with the ability to wield the sword which no one in the world possessed, kinda like how some humans have a certain amount of Holy Sword factor.</p><p><br></p><p>But it didn’t matter to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I finally had a decent sword.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could explore the sword anymore, I felt the summoning once more so I opened the portal again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Kazuma again but this time beside him was a blue haired girl looking at everything in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s complete the second part of the Deal.” Kazuma jumped before I could say anything.</p><p><br>“Kazuma, wait… he’s a demon.” Aqua pointed out towards me, making him stop… but not for long.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, did you get the charger and the rest of the games?”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave the guy a thumbs up and showed him the stuff. “But the purification first.” I replied, bringing out the Demon’s Extract and keeping it on the ground and moving a distance away from the jar.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aqua… if you want me to repay your debt, use purification on the jar.” The guy turned towards the Goddess in a cold tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“K-kazuma… you can’t be serious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, you are living in the streets then. Bye. Good to know you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“W-wait. I will do it.” She turned towards the hole and used purification on the Jar.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to jump away from the place and immediately erect a wall between me and the jar to get hurt and even then I still felt all the hair on the back of my neck stand up from the power.</p><p><br></p><p>A roar erupted from the jar as a shadow of a demonic being escaped from the jar and was erased under the attack of the light.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn…</p><p><br></p><p>I was still looking at the jar in awe when I heard the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, done.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The Goddess was pouting and turned away from the Hole and the boy beside her looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I threw the rest of the stuff through the hole and he caught it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nice doing business with you. By the way, if you don’t mind, I would like to trade more stuff from you later on if you want. For example some of the High End products from Wiz’s shop. I can pay for the stuff and extra games as your commission… but be warned.” I warned looking at the look on his face. “I can read minds so if you try to cheat me… I will curse you so that your dick shrivels up into a dry husk.” The scheming look on his face disappeared as his face became pale. He saluted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Got it. Sayonara.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t say anything either and hurriedly closed the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>And as soon as I did it, I heard several knocks on the door and it dawned on me.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone must have felt that purification magic.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck!</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>It took me hours to explain to them that I had tried one of the purification rituals from a book and messed up with the ingredients and that resulted in the explosion of purification energy.</p><p><br></p><p>They obviously didn’t buy it but didn’t bother me.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t unheard of for Magicians to do experiments and mess up often.</p><p><br></p><p>The catch was that I was called by Mephisto to his office.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… care to tell me what you did?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was experimenting with a variation of the ritual circle from a book Shuri-san gave me and messed up in the quantities of the materials and design leading to the… mishap.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“That… mishap… could have seriously wounded or downright killed an Ultimate Class Devil.” he deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>“... I am sorry. I will keep it in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… you just need to wait a bit and I will arrange for the Purification of that blood. He offered. This way you are just risking yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… am sorry. But I don’t have much time. I needed to get it done soon. Also, the purification is complete. You don’t have to look for anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>This surprised him.</p><p><br></p><p>“You did it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kinda… yes. On the other hand, can you arrange a place for me to do one last experiment. It would be for the best if it has nothing in the surroundings for a few ten kilometres.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you not listening to me? Why are you risking yourself so much? Just what is it that you want to chase so desperately that you would push yourself to this extent?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I recalled everything I had done and faced since I could remember in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Why did I do everything?</p><p><br></p><p>Why was I even doing anything at all?</p><p><br></p><p>My current level of power and position was enough for me to live the rest of my extremely long life in luxury.</p><p><br></p><p>So why?</p><p><br></p><p>And I remembered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because I do not wish to be mediocre. I refuse to be weak. I refuse to be ignored, tossed aside by anyone at their will. I don’t want to be at anyone’s mercy. But I was not born with everything… so I will work hard, I will break every bone in my body and rebuild it again if that’s what it takes to get to that level.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at him. “Arrange a place for me. I will tell you my identity.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Done. Let’s go now.”</p><p><br></p><p>He got up and took me by hand, directly teleporting away from the place.</p><p><br></p><p>The next time I could see around was the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is my territory. You can do whatever you want here. No one will disturb you. Now, tell me, who are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and indeed the whole place was empty desert wherever the eye could see.</p><p><br></p><p>Very well then.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned back to face the devil and let my disguise fall.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Acelin Abaddon, the outcast son of Bedeze Abbadon and Melisha Belphagor.”</p><p><br></p><p>I replied and turned back leaving the stunned devil as I walked into a distance and brought out the Demon’s Extract from my trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>I poured a single cup aside for future experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>It was said that even a single cup was enough but according to what I remembered from Esdeath’s words back in the manga… it gave more power the more one could drink and resist its power.</p><p><br></p><p>And since that was the case, I lifted the entire jar and placed my lips on the corner and began drinking.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mephisto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the boy from a distance, still recovering from the shock of his identity.</p><p><br></p><p>Acelin Abaddon.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, wasn’t that name a famous one… and not in the right kind of way.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything made sense now.</p><p><br></p><p>Why he was so cautious.</p><p><br></p><p>Why he never trusted anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Why a fourteen year old would be experienced at hunting in the Pits.</p><p><br></p><p>Why a kid so young would have such an outlook on life.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, those two fools, they couldn’t even recognise such a gem.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, he saw the boy bringing out the jar… and drink it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the very next moment, he fell to his knees and let out a loud cry of anguish.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto was about to ask what was wrong with him but before he could say anything to the boy, he felt a surge in Demonic Power coming from the boy and quickly erected a barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>A wave of power passed over him in all directions and wherever it went, it left behind a world of white.</p><p><br></p><p>This power… it was approaching the levels of an Ultimate Class being.<br><br></p><p>Just… what in the world was this?</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Well, a few things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ace’s boosted luck dragged him into another messy situation.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>He got a contract with the Advocate of True Gender Equality and made a cool trade.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will hopefully see more of him later on.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Empire is being cleaned.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And finally, Ace is now a bit strong.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will be having him open up some more portals to different worlds in the next chapter as he establishes a strong base and prepares for the Recommendation Games.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Underworld would not know what hits them.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>
