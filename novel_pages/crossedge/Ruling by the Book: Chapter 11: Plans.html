        <p><strong>Ruling by the Book</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 11: Plans</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kazuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I checked the data of another chakra beast in my Grimoire.</p><p><br></p><p>“Chakra reserves have increased by 30 percent since the administration of the drug.” This version of the drug was much better than the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>This mutated dog was quite stable, one of the best experimental subjects.</p><p><br></p><p>Some were easy to manage but some were hard to contain like a mutated komodo dragon was easily twenty feet tall and could actually breathe fire while the mutated snake was still growing at thirty three feet length.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, the more they grow, the better results the ritual gives, so I planned to let them grow for a while and do the ritual during the winter solstice for the best results.</p><p><br></p><p>The forest outside the capital was being transformed into a place to raise chakra beasts. Civilians are barred from entering the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Constructing the walls around the place was a herculean task. We needed strong walls and then fuinjutsu strengthening of those walls so that the beasts don’t break out and slaughter the people of the capital.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing we had discovered during these experiments was that the flesh of the chakra beasts was far more nutritious than normal beast’s flesh. In fact, even the milk of these animals was better, not to mention the quantity they produced was far better than normal animals.</p><p><br></p><p>The quality of wool from the mutated sheep was better too.</p><p><br></p><p>This made me change my plans slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>We began raising mutated cows, goats, pigs and sheep in large numbers. Raising and domesticating them from the start and in large numbers wasn’t something anyone had done before. Not to mention no one would think of them to be used for wars.</p><p><br></p><p>This way, I can create a new source of income for our country as well as create a stable and high quality supply of meat to feed my soldiers too.</p><p><br></p><p>Large scale production of mutated bears and more dangerous animals was still not possible and I had only a very limited number of them in my warehouse.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a very long term project and would probably require a few years to complete. My own version of ‘Forest of Death’, both as a place for trials and raising chakra beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>But looking at the amount of work needed for constructions, I was planning to teach the students Earth Style Jutsu, to construct walls.</p><p><br>After all, not everyone has wood style like Hashirama and can magically prop up a village out of nowhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe someday, I will get to that level too.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still growing in strength right now, even without rituals. It’s better to gain some skills rather than just be all brute strength. After all, as I was right now, all it would take was a well aimed kunai to the eye to take me down.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to say I was weak.</p><p><br></p><p>I had mastered the Water Breathing Style, Advanced level Fuinjutsu and could open up to five gates.</p><p><br></p><p>Even without much knowledge of ninjutsu, I was still at a jōnin level of strength, maybe even elite jōnin if I went all out.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I lacked their experience, something I have been working hard to gain in the last few months.</p><p><br></p><p>Seraphim has been coaching me on how to fight against ninjas.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t just all spars but more basic things like avoiding attacks, dodging kunai and traps, fighting multiple enemies at a time as well as having better awareness of my surroundings. While these may seem basic, these things were the difference between life and death in a real battle.</p><p><br></p><p>After that came spars and the most challenging spars were with Toji and Kuroka, none of which I ever won.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them were stronger than me physically as well as incredibly tricky.</p><p><br></p><p>Spars with Kuina were relatively straight forward although that girl just keeps pushing herself more and more each day and every time she recovers, she seems stronger than before.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if she had some kind of zenkai… she didn’t. I checked. It was just the ridiculous One Piece physique.</p><p><br></p><p>With the dedicated training and proper healing from Rose, her talents were coming out.</p><p><br></p><p>She had learned to open her fifth gate too and was now on par with me with her swordsmanship alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuina was a bonafide genius in swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no doubt about it.</p><p><br></p><p>She even managed to incorporate the breathing styles and Saitō’s swordsmanship on her own and was still progressing even without anyone’s help. But I noticed that her speed was slowing down.</p><p><br></p><p>Before long, I would need to find a good teacher for her to help her with her swordsmanship skills.</p><p><br></p><p>The level of swordsmanship in her world is just at a whole other level compared to this world. Even the best swordsman in this world would not be anything in that world. That also meant that I couldn’t find a good teacher for her either.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe someone from her world would be the best as they would also be able to teach her Haki. I had some plans, but to summon anyone decent from her world, I would need at least a kage or above level of power.</p><p><br></p><p>We still had some time for that but right now I had to concentrate on the things at hand.</p><p><br></p><p>I had other matters to attend to right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Three big things were coming up and I needed to prepare for those. First was my marriage to Kasumi, which was just three weeks away.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, we were close enough to not feel awkward about the marriage. In fact, I would actually go to war with the Stairs Daimyo if they tried to pull back now.</p><p><br></p><p>The second was the deal with the Uzumaki village and the upcoming attack on Uzushiogakure. Just yesterday my search on the Uzukage was completed and I found out what she was planning. Thankfully, it wasn’t anything bad. In fact, I was actually looking forward to her visit.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to make a deal with her for the location of the demons sealed in this world by the Uzumaki or other people, maybe get their help too to get them for the Soul Ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was discovering, my soul’s strength was very essential in unlocking more of the Grimoire’s powers.</p><p><br></p><p>With the last two summons, I felt like I was nearing the limits to the number of summons whom I could keep with me. One or two more would be my limit as I am now.</p><p><br></p><p>As for how many I needed? That depended on several factors.</p><p><br></p><p>The summoned people were the fastest way to increase the overall power of my forces. While the training of my soldiers was going better than I had expected, it was going to take a lot of time so I had to make the most of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The third and last was the world travel.</p><p><br></p><p>I was planning to go on a <em>‘business tour’</em> after the marriage. I had already discussed everything with Kasumi and she agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>This move will also allow us to push back the date of the merger by a few months. We were already planning to push it till the end of the war to avoid being caught in between but this just gave us one more reason.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the merger happens, things will start changing and I wanted to be at least Kage level by then to face the challenges that will come right after.</p><p><br></p><p>The first world travel can change a lot of things and I intend to take full advantage of it.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was finishing, Sera appeared behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sera, what can I do for you?” I asked, without turning back, continuing to feed the mutated chakra beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Princess Kasumi has sent a message. She said that the egg you left in her care is shaking.” She reported.</p><p><br></p><p>This made me pause.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has it already started shaking?” I asked, surprised. “Alright, let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>I accompanied her towards the warehouse where Kasumi was currently staying due to her training.</p><p><br></p><p>I had given her the Ralts egg to care for and now that same egg was shaking, meaning it was about to hatch.</p><p><br></p><p>While on our way, I tried to make some small talk with Sera. “So, how’s life, Sera?” I asked, trying to think of anything I could talk to her about but failing.</p><p><br></p><p>She just looked at me with her same bland look. “Are you sick?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“No. A bit hurt by your reply but definitely not sick.” I put a hand on my chest and acted in mock pain.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, what’s up with you?” She asked, seriously once more, making me sigh lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was just trying to make some jokes and small talk, you know. We don’t really talk much despite you being with us for months. I thought I could get to know you better.” I said, not making any excuses.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you trying to bed me too?” She asked, making my eyes twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this girl was always straight as an arrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everyday, three times a day after breakfast, lunch and dinner.” I replied with a smile. “Everytime I eat something sweet, I can’t help but think of you and your sweet voice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t do that, it’s disgusting.” She scrunched her nose.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, really? I thought that line was cool. Took me a whole week to think.” I shrugged nonchalantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that what you do? Think of lines to bed girls?” She asked, nonplussed.</p><p><br></p><p>“As much as I would like to do that, there are too many people who depend on me. I can’t afford to take so much time for myself. Your thoughts just happened to have caught me in my free time.” I smiled. “So, how about we get to know each other better? Tell me what you think of this world. Is it any different from your previous one?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason I was even doing this much is because she has chilled down a lot in the last month and now we were spending more time due to her helping me in my training. Knowing her more, I could see that she wasn’t rude for the sake of being rude.</p><p><br></p><p>It was more like her default state. She was just awkward with such things because she has never actually spent time like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Back in her world, things were still like in the Sengoku Period, at least for the vampire ninjas. They were trained to the bone from a very early age, leaving no time for a normal life… and very few people came out normal from such a childhood.</p><p><br></p><p>Sera’s case was similar. She was improving though.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s… alright.” She spoke after some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her hesitation. It was already better than before when she would have made some rude and sarcastic comment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Glad that you are enjoying your time here.”</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the room Kasumi was staying in and entered the room to find her standing near the egg.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuya-sama!” Kasumi was the first to speak. “The egg started moving suddenly today. I didn’t know what to do.” She said looking worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing to worry about. It’s probably going to hatch. Let me have a look.” I went ahead and summoned my grimoire and stored it inside for a moment, reading the information. Sure enough it was going to hatch in around an hour.</p><p><br></p><p>After checking everything, I took it out and kept it on a cushion in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s going to hatch in an hour. The egg is in perfect condition so no need to worry. In fact, we can wait for an hour for it to hatch. Meanwhile, why don’t we prepare something for the baby Ralts to eat after hatching. Actually, I haven’t eaten anything all morning either.” I said remembering.</p><p><br></p><p>My diet had increased a lot, perhaps due to the increased energy requirements of my body. I now ate almost five times more than what I used to eat just two years ago.</p><p><br></p><p>I can understand how Naruto could eat all that Ramen and not get full.</p><p><br></p><p>We waited and had something to eat and sure enough, around an hour later, the egg flashed white and cracked, revealing a tiny figure inside.</p><p><br></p><p>It had pinkish eyes peeking out from under its green bowl cut hair. A layer of its skin seemed to flow around its body like a white dress of some sort giving it a very graceful feeling and finally there were two small red horns at the front and back of its head</p><p><br></p><p>“Ralts!” The adorable pokemon tilted her head as she looked at us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cute.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whisper was very soft but I was pretty sure I heard Sera say that and looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She noticed my smile and her face went back to her usual frown.</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead and slowly picked up the baby Ralts.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s adorable.” Kasumi said too.</p><p><br></p><p>“She… this one is a female.” I said. The Grimoire had told me that. “She is a Ralts. They can feel the emotions of other people and only approach those they feel good emotions from. So, don’t be angry or afraid around her. Apart from that, they are very loyal to those they consider their master, going as far as laying down their lives for them. When they grow fully, they can become incredibly powerful too.” I rubbed her cheeks and looked at her trying to hold my fingers with her tiny hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Should we feed her?” Kasumi asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Get the milk.”</p><p><br></p><p>We had already prepared milk bottles for her.</p><p><br></p><p>I offered the Ralts to Kasumi so that she could feed her. She had taken care of the egg the whole time so it’s only natural that she gets the chance to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, with a Ralts around, she can also be protected more. She wasn’t much of a fighter and Ralts would be perfect to protect her or just teleport her out of a dangerous situation. This one already knew the Teleport move.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Sera looked at the pokemon curiously, surprising since she didn’t show interest in many things.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need a name for her. Would you like to suggest something, Sera?” I asked, taking the girl by surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“You want me to name her?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, why not?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We would love for you to name her.” Kasumi chimed in too. She knew Sera’s condition and they got along quite well in fact, I have never seen Sera act even remotely rudely towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eucliwood Hellscythe.” She said after some thought. “It’s the name of the creator of the Vampire Ninjas. She is a very strong person. Give her this name so that she may grow as strong as her one day.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>That name….</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Euclidwood it is then.”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave them the complete set of instructions on what to feed and how to take care of the Ralts. She needed to grow a bit before we could start training her.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I waited in the same place where I had met the Uzukage last time.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro had informed me that the Uzukage had asked for a meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already read the information about her and knew what she was planning so it wasn’t a big surprise for me.</p><p><br></p><p>With me were Kanae, Kuina and Saitō while Kuroka was hiding some distance away,  while Toji was hiding on a distant mountain, sniper rifle pointed this way in case something bad happened.</p><p><br></p><p>While I knew that the Uzukage was here with genuinely good intentions, we never knew what might happen in a negotiation.</p><p><br></p><p>Around fifteen minutes later, I sensed three chakra signatures approaching us and looked in the direction. Unlike the last time she was hiding her chakra and I could only identify because I knew her from the last time.</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra suppression techniques can be really scary. The one I used could completely erase my chakra signature and presence. It was actually something invented and used by the second Tsuchikage, Mu, something which earned him his name, meaning nothing. It was extremely hard to learn though and I was only able to get started with it because the basic version was imprinted in my mind by the Grimoire.</p><p><br></p><p>Toji was doing his best to learn it and I’ll be honest. That thought scares even me.</p><p><br></p><p>He is already extremely hard to catch. With this, he will be impossible to find for anyone except the likes of Kuroka.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough the three people appeared in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Genshiro, Rina and Mina approached them and bowed to them while I just nodded politely at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the Land of Flowers, Uzukage-sama.” I greeted her. “Please come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Prince Katsuyoshi.” She nodded before turning towards the man beside her. “This is my husband, the Daimyo of the Land of Whirlpool, Genzo Uzumaki.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Daimyo?</p><p><br></p><p>This guy?</p><p><br></p><p>While surprised, I didn’t let it show on my face. "Welcome to the Land of Flowers. We apologise for not recognising you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t mind it. We haven’t met before and it would be surprising if you recognised us in one glance.”</p><p><br></p><p>We went inside the room prepared beforehand.</p><p><br></p><p>I was the one who initiated the conversation this time. “Congratulations on finding the new continent, Uzukage-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a small twitch on the corner of her lips but she controlled it immediately and bowed. “Thank you. The Land of Whirlpool and the Uzumaki Clan will forever be grateful to you because of this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please don’t do this. We did what any decent person would do for their allies.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. That’s not true. Not even close allies always come to help.” The Daimyo spoke, his face showing helplessness.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised a questioning eyebrow and the man explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mito Uzumaki passed away two days ago.” He dropped a bomb.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… unfortunate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. She was a very kind person.” He agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are coming here directly from Konoha?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. As you already know, we are being monitored so both of us leaving at the same time was not easy. Last time Shiroyasha came to visit you, I covered for her using Clones. No one except the ones present here even knew about her visit.”</p><p><br></p><p>Damn…</p><p><br></p><p>“This time however, we had an opportunity and decided to make the most of it and visited here.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded, not knowing what to say to such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is Konoha?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s best for us to not expect anything from them. They are facing attacks from all four sides right now, Suna having suddenly joined the fray. Their forces are spread thin. Not that we had much expectations from the beginning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We were able to talk to Mito-sama and she actually sensed our hesitation and warned us that things are going to change after she passes away. This war has been very hard on the Senju Clan. Even her grandson passed away a while ago.” The Daimyo sighed and shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was bound to happen.” I shook my head, making them look at me with questioning looks. “The Senju Clan were too strong. It made people afraid… both outside and inside. It was inevitable that they wouldn’t want another Hashirama or Tobirama Senju to rise from somewhere and decide to nip the problem completely.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You think someone from the inside was responsible for this too?” He asked, frowning.</p><p><br></p><p>“The first two Hokages were from the Senju Clan while the third one was given the seat just due to a word from Tobirama Senju and the support of the Senju Clan otherwise do you think with just the power of the Sarutobi Clan and Hiruzen Sarutoji’s strength back then, he would be able to become Hokage so easily?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>In my previous life, perhaps all this might have seemed to be conspiracy theories but in this life, after witnessing everything around me, it seemed the most likely case.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you don’t believe us, then tell us how many people from the Sarutobi Clan died in this war? Were they stronger than the Senju or the Uchiha?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man frowned but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not only that, I think outside forces, even the Daimyo of the Fire nation had a hand in all this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?” This took the man by surprise. It was understandable. Why would the Daimyo, at least the one from Fire Nation, do something like that?</p><p><br></p><p>“Fear is a great motivator. Isn’t that why you all are in such a condition right now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That doesn’t make sense. The Senju have always been loyal to the Daimyo, not to mention their biggest supporter. Losing them would mean losing a large chunk of power.” The Uzukage denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm true. But here’s something you need to understand. There’s a difference between the strong and the monsters. You can fight the former but the latter makes you lose the will to fight. Hashirama Senju was someone who caught all the Tailed Beasts. Even Madara Uchiha with the Kyubi couldn't defeat him. That kind of power… it makes people apprehensive. It made even other kage shiver in their boots so can you imagine what it would do to those powerless and cowardly Daimyo?” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hashirama would never…”</p><p><br></p><p>“But what of his descendants? What if someone else became similarly powerful and didn’t have similar thoughts? What if they wanted to change the rule of the Daimyo? What if they decided to conquer the entire continent? Konoha had two such clans and a coward at the helm of the Fire Nation. He obviously cannot allow them to exist. The Uchiha were already cornered by Tobirama which left only the Senju. It was obvious they had to go. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a deal between the five Daimyo combined?”</p><p><br></p><p>My words made them go quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thankfully, it seems that Tobirama Senju was indeed a wise man and had prepared for this too.” I added catching them by surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Tobirama knew the Senju Clan were going to be targeted heavily till they went extinct and prepared for the eventualities. He, during his term as a Hokage, actually orchestrated fake deaths of several members of the Senju Clan, spreading them across the elemental nations, both as spies of the Senju Clan… and a way to continue the continued bloodline of the Senju… under other names. The fact that no one knew of this already tells us how much he trusted the other people under him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you serious?” the Uzukage asked, seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh very. In fact, we even know the descendants of one of these people. That’s how we found out about the whole scheme. Truly, one can never be too careful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We apologise for not being able to tell you the identity of the person without their permission but the person is the grandchild of Tōka Senju if you wish to know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tōka-sama’s grandchild!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you know Tōka Senju?” I asked, surprised by her reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Who doesn’t? She was one of Hashirama Senju’s closest aides. In fact, she was married to one of our Uzumaki Clan members too, an uncle of mine.The person was actually Genshiro’s elder brother. He had gone to Konoha as Mito-sama’s aide.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this took me by surprise. Even Genshiro was looking stunned at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“We had heard that Yuka Senju, her daughter, passed away on a mission.” Genshiro said, looking genuinely sad.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is indeed a small world. As for Yuka Senju, no, she didn’t die but rather went undercover where she got involved with a guy and had a child. She was suffering from an illness and passed away shortly afterwards.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Could you please tell us the identity of the person, Your Highness?” He asked, expectantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Again, we apologise. We would need to ask the person in question first but we promise to inform you as soon as we get the permission.” I assured him.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to check his information first and then ask Kasumi if she wants to meet him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Your Highness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“At least, we got to hear one good news today.” The Whirlpool Daimyo smiled. “And we have to thank you for this again.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Too bad we didn’t have the foresight of Tobirama Senju to prepare for all this beforehand.” The Uzukage sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s do what we can do now.” Genzo put a hand assuringly on her shoulder, making her nod.</p><p><br></p><p>They had a good chemistry.</p><p><br></p><p>I can see how they ruled the Land of Whirlpools like this.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, will the Uzumaki be moving?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The lives of our people matter more to us than a piece of land. Although some of the old ones want to stay back. Those stubborn fools.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are really serious about it?” Genshiro asked and the Uzukage nodded in response.</p><p><br></p><p>“They plan to stay back to cover for us till the last moment.” She explained the decision of the old ones in the Uzushiogakure village.</p><p><br></p><p>“For them it’s taking their home from them… although we believe that without a family inside, four walls only make a house, not a home. A real home is where our loved ones live.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How do you explain that to those people? They want to put up a last stand against the attackers. I have tried everything to convince them but they have already made up their minds. One thing you should understand about Uzumaki is that once we make up our mind, it’s nigh impossible to change it.” The Whirlpool Daimyo said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s let them do what they want. The purpose of our visit here today is to keep our side of the bargain.” The Uzukage said, bringing up the topic of business.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them looked at me. “The information given by you was verified. The continent is indeed habitable. The residents of that place don’t even know about chakra so we can probably establish ourselves there without much danger too. It’s the best place we could have asked for. Since that’s the case, we have come here to complete our side of the bargain too. We will be sending three Seal Masters from our Clan to stay here and teach you and your people, all our knowledge as a sign of our alliance and gratitude.”</p><p><br></p><p>Wait, they didn’t know about chakra?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know that.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I didn’t know anything about that continent except the location.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should send people there and see if I can discover some resources too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I bowed, not rejecting their offer this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Secondly, I propose a marriage between Rina and Mina with you to solidify the alliance between the Land of Flowers and the Uzumaki Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, both of them?!”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman just shrugged. “I asked them and it was their suggestion. Ask them if you want to know the reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the two and it was Rina who spoke. “We have lived with each other our entire lives and shared everything. We do not wish to get separated. I apologise for asking this of Your Highness. If you don’t like this, we will accept your decision.”</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to find some words but nothing came to my mind.</p><p><br>“Oh come on. It’s not like you don’t have more than one girl in your life already.” The Uzukage rolled her eyes. “Be a man.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her husband just coughed at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… are you both sure you want this?” I asked the two girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This is something we had decided a long time ago.” Rina said. “We either marry one person or not marry at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>I took a look at Kanae who was also surprised at their words and looked at me but nodded when our eyes met.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I accept.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Now, on to another topic. We were hoping you could assist us with something.” The Whirlpool Daimyo said.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still distracted by the whole twin thing and brought out a scroll from my pocket. “Here are enough supplies for three thousand people for three months.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked at me in surprise but I pretended like it was nothing. I had a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… well, isn’t this what you wanted?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes but… how did you know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“...we have our sources.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>The man took the hint and didn’t say anything but kept the scroll. “Thank you. I will send the payment for this soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to. This is just some help from us. Instead, we were hoping to exchange some information if you could help us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Information? Sure, anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have heard that the Uzumaki Clan knows about the location of many sealed beings, like Demons and strong beasts throughout the continent. We wish to know about any such being, even rumours are fine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you perhaps… planning to use them as weapons?” The Uzukage asked. “While Jinchuriki are not rare, those creatures are not like tailed beasts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We know. We do not plan on making any jinchuriki. We are planning on using them to power the barriers around the cities. As for them being dangerous, we have methods of completely destroying them if push comes to shove so you don’t need to worry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Using them as chakra sources to power barriers? You can always use people to power the barrier, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have our reasons. Still, if you are worried about us making Jinchuriki, you can rest assured. That’s the last thing we would ever do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, are you not attracted by their power? In fact, if we had made the deal with Hashirama back in the day and possessed a Jinchuriki of our own, perhaps other nations would have thought twice before attacking us.” The Uzukage said.</p><p><br></p><p>“We do <em>not</em> wish to make any jinchuriki.” I stopped her words in between. “In fact, while we respect Hashirama Senju, what he did with the Tailed Beasts… was disgusting. To use them as bargaining chips, selling them… for anyone else, it would have been different but not him or Madara.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>My words caught them off guard too so I decided to give them some insight about this world. Who knows what the Black Zetsu might pull. It’s never bad to have some more people in on this, especially people who are so adept in the art of fuinjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>I had thought long and hard about this and the Uzumaki Clan were an essential part of my plans. Here goes nothing…</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me Uzukage-sama, what do you know of the history of the Uzumaki Clan?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? Are you asking me what I know of <em>my</em> clan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. What do you know about the history, the beginning of the Uzumaki Clan?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our Uzumaki Clan began as a branch of the Senju Clan around three hundred and eighty years ago when they settled in the Land of Whirlpool to concentrate on our Fuinjutsu rather than fight continuous wars like the Senju. From there, we made our own name based on the whirlpools surrounding our village and came to be known as the Uzumaki Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about before that? Do you know about the beginning of the Senju Clan?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head and I spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Senju Clan was formed by a man called Asura Otsutsuki. He lived with his father and elder brother where he was taught about chakra and ninshu. He was quite dull compared to his brother who was a veritable genius. His elder brother was the one who created the twelve hindsigns to more easily manipulate chakra, giving birth to Ninjutsu.” I revealed to their utter surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Later on, his father sent both of them out on a test to determine his successor but ultimately chose his younger son because the older one didn’t consider other people and always relied on his own strength to solve all problems, always preferring to walk alone while the younger always took others together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As a good leader should.” The Whirlpool Daimyo said and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Unfortunately this would lead the two brothers to war… several times after their father passed away. That war had continued till the formation of the Konoha village. Can you guess who the descendants of the elder brother were?”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw their faces go pale. “Uchiha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. As a reward, we will let you know who their father was. His name was Hagoromo Otsutsuki but the whole world knows of him as The Sage of Six Paths.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“The elder brother inherited the eyes of the sage while the younger inherited his body and chakra. That’s why the Senju have such insanely strong bodies while the Uchiha have the Sharingan. It’s funny right. The whole world calls them Jutsu thieves and yet the whole world copied Indra to even know how to use ninjutsu?”</p><p><br>I laughed at it. Such an irony.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, the war between the brothers didn’t end there. Their chakra repeatedly incarnates in their descendants, continuing the war. The most prominent figures among the two clans are more often the incarnations of the two brothers, the last ones being… well you can take a guess.”</p><p><br></p><p>I let them understand the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, the reason why we are so mad is because Hashirama, that fool, actually subdued the Tailed Beasts, nine beings created by the Sage of Six Paths himself and sold them as cheap goods. The Sage called them his children. In a way, they would be siblings and he, that dumb moron, sold them like cattle.”</p><p><br></p><p>The look of shock was evident on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>“How… how do you even know all this? How should we even…”</p><p><br></p><p>“While We do not claim to be all knowing, there are many things about this world that We know. We can understand if you don’t believe us. You can talk to any tailed beast. All of them are intelligent creatures. They were originally the part of a completely different beast, called the Ten Tails, something which had almost caused the destruction of all life on this world. It was defeated by the Sage and his brother and sealed inside his body, making him the first Jinchuriki. Later on, he divided its chakra into nine pieces and thus the nine tailed beasts were born. Each of them has a name. If you talk to them, just use the Sage’s name and they will at least listen to you. So, if you ever have a chance, help those poor fellows out. They are not inherently bad.”</p><p><br></p><p>All the people in the room were quiet at this point and the Whirlpool Daimyo broke the silence after a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have given us some life changing information. We require some time to think about it. It’s too much for us to take. It just sounds too unbelievable.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We understand. It is outlandish. We were just hoping that if you encounter any of the nine, you will at least try to understand and talk to them. Just imagine the Kyubi’s case. One moment it was sleeping in some cave and saw a crazy Madara’s Sharingan and the next moment, it woke up, being sealed by Hashirama… how is that fair? Just recall what you did to that guy two days ago, nailed to a floating piece of rock. Any hate it might have is completely justified.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How do you know about the Seal.” The Uzukage asked, stunned and wary.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s where things become tricky.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have visions. Of things, of futures. We cannot completely control the line of these visions. It is through this that we were able to find a way for the Uzumaki Clan and it is through this that we have been able to find this…”</p><p><br></p><p>“That… makes sense.”</p><p><br></p><p>Huh…</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t look surprised. There are other people in this world with abilities similar to yours. For example, the Priestess of the Land of Demons has the power to glimpse into the future. Although her powers are not as potent as yours. Their warnings are taken very seriously even by the five Great Ninja Villages and their Lands are completely off limits.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you not wary of us?” I asked, curious.</p><p><br></p><p>“It would be foolish.” She replied. “After all, you came to our aid, put so much trust in us. We Uzumaki are not so ungrateful that we cannot return the same favour to you. What you do with the information is your own affairs. Either way, we will not be on this continent for long. Although there is one thing I don’t understand… why? Why did you tell us all this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for putting your trust in us. The reason we have told you all this is because of another vision we had… the visions of a one eyed beast with ten tails rampaging across the world…” I finished making them widen their eyes in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I told them about my plan… a plan that would fuck up all of Zetsu’s plans in the ass without lube and even make the violence in the Elemental Nations go down.</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed a few more things and they left the Land of Flowers promising to send the other three people they had promised.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzukage also gave me the information about some places where demons were sealed and promised to send the rest of the information soon enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving she gave Genshiro permission to teach us everything he knew about Fuinjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that went well… I guess.” I spoke, starting the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure about giving them all that information, boss?” Saitō asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Pretty sure. The main enemy we might face is extremely vulnerable to Fuinjutsu and Taijutsu. This way, if they can take away even one of two tailed beasts… it would mean one or two kage level enemy less for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Almost half of the total kage level of the Five Great Ninja villages are Jinchuriki.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ninjutsu and Genjutsu, while good, have no effect on the real top levels of this world. It’s one of the reasons why I am not training our people in those arts primarily. They still need to learn how to overcome those, however learning the actual art needs to be put off till the third year. Ninjutsu is just too useful to not learn.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. Just teaching them a simple Earth Wall technique can help us a lot in creating walls, setting traps and temporary fortification, even making roads. We can even make a hideout within the mountains and underground with that. It would be foolish to not utilise these skills.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, has anyone made any progress with the Rasengan technique I told you all about?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the only attack type ninjutsu I had given them.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, anyone who has watched Naruto must know how it is done.</p><p><br></p><p>The technique is obviously hard to learn. It was called an A Ranked Technique for a reason.</p><p><br></p><p>I had managed to master it due to my extensive chakra control exercises and the rituals. Now I was practising the technique to be able to use it instantly in a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Minato could instantly make a Rasengan and attack. I needed that kind of speed to fully utilise the technique.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. I completed the second phase. Just need to do the last phase now.” Toji said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Same.” Saitō added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not interested.” Kuina didn’t have any interest in anything that was not swordsmanship. “I am more interested in the elemental chakra flow technique though.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, with her insane physique, her chakra reserves were increasing day by day and yet she never tried to learn any special techniques except those assisting her in her swordsmanship. Then again, perhaps that one track mind is what makes her that good in what she does?</p><p><br></p><p>Kanae was working on the breathing technique and didn’t have time for anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>Sera was also more interested in chakra flow and swordsmanship techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>This was especially so after we discovered the fact that using Water attribute chakra enhances the power of Water Breathing greatly.</p><p><br></p><p>The original Breathing Styles were named after the elements because they were based on how the elements behaved and didn’t exactly manipulate the elements itself.</p><p><br></p><p>In this world however, for training the elemental affinity, one must manipulate normal chakra in a way the element behaves too, quite similarly to the Breathing Styles.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why when we tried using Water Breathing with Water Style Chakra Flow, the results were unbelievable.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack power increased by a lot. The water attribute chakra even extended from the blade like a whip at times and cut at a distance. A skilled user could control the length and shape of these water whips to increase or decrease the distance at which they cut the enemy. The swordsmanship had in turn started to look exactly as it did in the anime from my memories with actual water being used instead of just special effects.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to this, Water Attribute Chakra training and Chakra Flow techniques were added to the third year curriculum for the Samurai. Obviously this meant that no one was there yet as it was just their second year but this also allowed us time to master those techniques ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, after this I was actually planning to go to Kanae’s world as quickly as I could and hire masters of other breathing styles as well or at least get the methods of training in them. At least the five elemental methods.</p><p><br></p><p>My plan for the world jump is being delayed due to one thing or another and in this time, my Grimoire hasn’t stopped gathering energy. I estimate that by the time I come out from the first jump, I could gather enough energy for the second one too.</p><p><br></p><p>Just imagining the Lightning Breathing Style with Lightning Style Chakra Armour… yes. That would be extremely powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was a good exercise for chakra control. I have completed it.” Surprisingly, it was Rose who had completed the Rasengan.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have already completed it?” I asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>She raised her hand and concentrated for a bit and sure enough a ball of chakra formed on her hand. She kept it there for a few seconds before dispersing it.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a good way to train Shape Manipulation and as a Medic I need to train myself in Chakra Control.” She explained with a shrug.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how is your own training coming along?” I asked. She was trying to figure out most of the Medical Ninjutsu by herself from the notes I had given her, an extremely herculean task.</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked the Uzukage to help us get someone who can help us out and she said she will see what she can do.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Rose was extremely dedicated.</p><p><br></p><p>She trained the students during the day and then studied all throughout the night, continuously pushing herself to get better.</p><p><br></p><p>It was for this reason that her chakra was growing at an insane pace. She was already ridiculously strong physically, giving her much higher than average reserves and on top of that she trained herself on the verge of exhaustion only to heal herself and get right back at work. This was increasing her chakra reserves rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, she has chakra reserves similar to my own and great control too.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s slower than I would have liked but I think I am getting the hang of basic Mystic Palm Technique. A few more months and I will get it along with a few other techniques down perfectly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, take your time. We won’t have students ready to learn the technique for at least another year. Till then, you could reach a high enough level with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, Kuroka. I have a mission for you.” I addressed the newest member of our team.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes nyaa~”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want you to steal a few things.” I brought out a scroll from my  sleeves and passed it to her. “I think you are the best person for the job.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the paper and then at me. “All these?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. Just be careful and it won’t be that hard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay nyaa. I think I can get it done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As for our next immediate mission. It will be to investigate the demons whose information I have received from the Uzukage.” If we can complete the next ritual, my soul power will be enhanced by leaps and bounds and I might have more control on the Grimoire too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to focus on that first, boss? You are getting married in three weeks. The Daimyo has already started sending invitations and the city is already being prepared. The first wedding of the only Prince. Everyone is so excited.” Toji asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am actually worried, Toji. Worried about the number of spies who might come here or who have already come here. While most of our dangerous experiments are hidden away under the covers of normal research, I am still worried. We need to be at our highest alert at the time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Leave the security to us, boss.” Saitō assured me.</p><p><br></p><p>“The main problem will not be them but rather our allies. Kumo will also send people to greet us. Don’t let them catch a hint of anything awry. Always hide your chakra and keep it at a chunin level at best. Also Kuroka, remember to be back in fifteen days at best. I need you here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes nyaa~”</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzumaki trio have been living under disguise the entire time they were here, for the last six months or so and I had already told them to hide in one of the hideouts in the Land of Flowers during this time. Even Shirone was said to remain out of sight.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want them to be anywhere near the capital during this event.</p><p><br></p><p>After discussing several more security arrangements, we left for our own work.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Mhh, this is good. You are an amazing cook, Kasumi-chan.” I said making her light up despite the position she was in.</p><p><br></p><p>Kasumi was in my lap, facing me, both her legs on either side of my waist, her crotch directly over mine. Her kimono had risen up due to the position, revealing her milky white legs.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands slid on her legs, slowly reaching her thighs.</p><p><br></p><p>She was blushing up a storm but didn’t stop her job of feeding me.</p><p><br></p><p>Training had been working wonders on her. Her body has become fuller due to the physical exercise and nutrition.</p><p><br></p><p>I was even planning on enhancing her bloodline further. It’s just that the ritual I had was only designed for me. As for how to enhance her bloodline without a ritual, I had a plan, but it will take time.</p><p><br></p><p>Even then, the raw materials needed for the ritual would be hard to get.</p><p><br></p><p>She finished feeding me and kept the plate on the table beside us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Was that all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… I will go and get some more.” She was about to get up but I stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was talking about dessert.” With that, I pulled her in for a kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>We have been doing this regularly now and she was getting more comfortable, even responding to my tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands slipped into her kimono and grabbed her ass, playing with the doughy flesh as she moaned into my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>Girls didn’t exactly wear underwear under their kimono traditionally. It was something introduced later. Good for me, it still hadn’t caught up in this world yet.</p><p><br></p><p>This meant I could feel her skin on the palm of my hands. It just went to show how comfortable she was with me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was hard as iron and the rubbing was only making me harder.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to take it a step further, slowly pushing her down on the cushions behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the scene in front of me, her silky black hair spread on the cushions, slightly moist pleasure filled half open eyes, looking at me and finally her wet red lips with her tongue just visible.</p><p><br></p><p>Without waiting for a moment, I dove in to enjoy my dessert.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________ </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href="https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Ruling by the Book'.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are progressing.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kazuya has taken the Uzumaki in confidence for his grand plan… As for what that plan is, that’s a secret.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see the effect of the butterflies in the next few chapters.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>
