        <p><strong>Isekai Restaurant</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 7: Repercussions</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>____________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I quickly picked up the girl and carried her inside while Touma and Zeref-san healed the kids.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san offered to take a look at her to see if her soul was not injured.</p><p><br></p><p>At that time, Sakura quickly came up to me and checked. “Are you alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I’m fine. As you saw already, they didn’t let me fight. I only used my Innate Technique once.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is quite wonderful. Her soul was not hurt in the least. Your technique is even more mysterious than I had expected.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san spoke while he was using spells on her to check but quickly jumped back as an Ice Statue appeared in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>I sensed danger so I quickly used the power of The Restaurant to dispel it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was it her poke….notPokemon….ughh, whatever it was?” Rimuru asked as he peeked from behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>“It would seem so. That thing is tied to her soul….quite similar to a Zanpakuto and yet completely different. It must have sensed the spells and come out to protect its owner.” He finished his check and got up. “Yes. She will be fine after some rest. The possession just took some toll on her and she is exhausted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the woman who possessed her?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, she was thrown back to her own body when you did….what did you do again?” Rimuru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Jujutsu. I am learning Jujutsu. So what happened to her? Was she really?” I asked, getting back to the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“She and her associates will not be disturbing you any longer.” Zeref-san answered.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….” Was all I could say.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the blonde girl laying on one of the couches in worry.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. It was just a small possession.” Ainz patted my shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Which you all could have stopped. Why were you even watching her do what she wanted? It could have been dangerous, you know.” I reprimanded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am an Overlord, the highest possible class one can gain which deals with Possessions, Souls and Necromancy. Possessions of such level….I could fix with a snap of my finger. What we wanted to see is the means and abilities of magicians of your world to get more information. Only by knowing your enemy, can you prepare for them. We didn’t interfere because there was no danger to begin with.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That....makes sense.” I agreed. Thinking of something, I looked at Sakura. “Sakura.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” The girl who had been silent.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you please take care of this girl? I will go and see what the others are doing.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, we walked near the entrance of the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, what about them?” Ainz asked, looking back at Tobio and his group who were with the children. “From what I found out, they work for the Fallen Angels, who are enemies of devils. They could be dangerous.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Tobio is a friend. He wouldn’t do such a thing.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“But others might.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can just beat them up if they come to cause any trouble.” Tohru said, patting her chest.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thinking about what to do when Zeref-san suggested something.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know how memory manipulation might work on people of different worlds and if others have a way to undo those so why don’t we just make them take an oath, a contract of sorts that they will not reveal anything about you or this Restaurant?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….you can do that?” I asked. In jujutsu there was something called the Binding Vow but I had no idea how to use those yet.</p><p><br></p><p>“It should be quite easy but first we need to do something about the surroundings. We need to fix the area first and then hide this Restaurant and then we can think what to do with the children.” Zeref-san said.</p><p><br></p><p>With the plans made, everyone got to work.</p><p><br></p><p>The most amazing among them was Rimuru. He created a whirlpool in his hand and swallowed everything inside and with his other hand, started throwing out fixed things. He quickly fixed the area of damage removing all the signs of a fight having taken place. It was absolutely incredible to see him work like that.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was literally laying out roads by just sliding on them and fixing broken buildings the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, the rest transferred the healed kids to the nearby park.</p><p><br></p><p>“We should just end them to avoid potential trouble.” Irene, the woman with Zeref-san said and I saw the blonde girl who had come to fetch Tobio pale in fright.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is not wrong, boss.” Tohru said, cracking her knuckles as her tail and horns appeared for the two to see.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, stop scaring them. Just let them sign the contracts. They won’t tell anyone. I believe them.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded profusely at my statement.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed a ghost of a smirk on Irene’s face as she signed the papers. I guess she is not that bad of a person after all.</p><p><br></p><p>The neighbours were not a problem as Kisuke-san had apparently put them all to sleep using some kind of magic at the start.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz still used some kind of item to do something I don’t know about. He just reassured me that no people were harmed in the act.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this opportunity to thank the people who helped out. “Thank you, Cid-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy just stared at me and repeated. “As I have already told you, I am Shadow, he who lives in the shadows to hunt the shadows.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“....oh. Shadow-kun then. Thank you for helping me out today. Please visit us again. I would treat you to the best meal I can make.” I bowed slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and left quickly without any more words.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, both of us knew and were just playing along.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, which kid hasn’t thought of being a superhero at this age. I looked at Ainz and Rimuru….and maybe adults too.</p><p><br></p><p>Let him enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, with everything done, we got down to some questioning. And boy can Ainz play the bad cop.</p><p><br></p><p>The kids were apparently new with this too, well apart from the Lavinia girl who was sleeping. We were still able to get some information from them.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a bunch of supernatural factions in this world. They mostly hide from normal humans. When any such incident is found out, they erase the information and wipe the minds of those involved.</p><p><br></p><p>It was fucking MIB out there.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess that explains why I had no idea about them for so long.</p><p><br></p><p>The area I was staying in was a neutral ground of sorts .</p><p><br></p><p>Kyoto was ruled by the Youkai, the Eastern Youkai faction to be exact.</p><p><br></p><p>The other side was ruled by the Five Principal Clans, who were basically the top Onmyoji of the country.</p><p><br></p><p>This town was ownerless simply because it was used as a buffer zone between the two factions.</p><p><br></p><p>The main factions in Japan were the Shinto Gods, Youkai and the Onmyoji Clans, mainly the Five Principal Clans. The Youkai also had several other factions within them.</p><p><br></p><p>There were also the occasional members of the Abrahamic factions which were Angels, Devils and the Fallen Angels. I’m a Devil, a member of the race created by fucking Lucifer when he rebelled from heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Apparently, in this world Lucifer created a fucking race and other angels who were kicked out of Heaven became Fallen Angels instead of Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>Why I was here was not revealed from the information. But I couldn’t think of any good reasons for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Eh, who cares. I got a good life. I have no complaints about the family I got here. My parents, who were most-likely not my birth parents, treated me so well that I didn’t even know I was adopted. Why would I have a problem with them?</p><p><br></p><p>As for conspiracy theories about them using me or what not, since there was no way of finding that out anymore, I’d rather not sully the memories of my parents with such thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>A glass can be half empty or half full depending on a user’s perspective. Not appreciating the fact that you have half a glass of something when many others don’t even have that privilege is childish. This is the principle I have lived with. If something cannot be changed, there is no use bitching about it and making your life a pity party.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, not straying from the topic at hand.</p><p><br></p><p>They decided to leave the shop while Lavinia rested on the upper floor. She will be allowed to leave when she decides to sign the contract or her memories will be wiped. Sakura was taking care of her at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio thanked us before going. He was quite a polite guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma also left quickly as he was getting late.</p><p><br></p><p>We knew that the Supernatural police would be out here in a while so we decided on a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>As we didn’t know if they would recognise other magicians or supernatural beings I closed the restaurant and we had Saitama man the shop while the more <em>noticeable</em> members decided to leave for their worlds. I was welcomed by some of them to visit while the heat faded away.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would have invited you but I still don’t know anything about the world I have been teleported to so….” Ainz said.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can come with me. The goblins and dwarves in my village are quite friendly.” Rimuru offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are always invited to my place too.” Kisuke-san said and I politely rejected.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you should come to have a look at our world. You have a demon seed now so you might even learn magic suitable for you. It will help you in such situations. We can check your aptitude for different kinds of magic too. From what you have told me, you already know Curse Magic. Even in my world, Demons have great affinity for Curse Magic. Maybe you can find something for your use there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even Tohru wanted to offer but she was afraid that other dragons would attack me at first sight.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at me and I thought for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>I finally decided to take Rimuru’s offer as I had just reunited after a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can do something about magic too, you know. I have some magicians and from what I have heard, there are demons and demon lords in my world too and apparently people get summoned in my world often and get magic and skills when they do so. I have also heard that sometimes, otherworlders just walk into the world and even then they get skills suitable for them. We can try to see if you get something.” Rimuru offered a suggestion.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! And is this power gain almost instant?” Ainz asked, suddenly interested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, there are things like naming someone which can give them power. The goblins working under me all evolved into Hobgoblins when I named them and gained a lot of power. Since Silas is not a human, we can try and see if that works.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s interesting.” Ainz scratched his jaw.</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of skills are we talking about?” Kisuke-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It depends on the personality and affinity of the user. It could be anything, from being good at Gardening to being able to cut space and harm True Dragons.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>That’s scary.</p><p><br></p><p>Also True Dragons?</p><p><br></p><p>Where did that come from?</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow I had a feeling that he was very specific about the example.</p><p><br></p><p>“Merging the Demon Seed by learning magic from our world would be wiser.” Irene said before adding. “Although, having a stronger base to work with never hurts.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that decided, I went to Rimuru’s world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this a….” I looked around the hut.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah….we are still in the process of construction. The Dwarves are very good but there are only five of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>We walked out as he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s….beautiful.” I whispered as I looked at the scenery outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru’s world was….was untainted.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, that’s the word I was looking for.</p><p><br></p><p>No pollution, no hustle and bustle of the city. The air was so fresh.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and saw many, were those the goblins Rimuru was talking about.</p><p><br></p><p>He must have noticed my gaze so he explained. “These are Hobgoblins and Goblins. Those at the back are the Star Wolves. Kajin-san and the others are working on the buildings over there.” He pointed towards an incomplete house in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>While I was looking at them, even they were looking at me curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everyone! This is one of my best friends, Silas. He will often be coming here so you guys should not be surprised.”</p><p><br></p><p>The hobgoblins and goblinas all knelt immediately. Even the Star Wolves behind them knelt.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Rimuru in surprise. “This is….”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy let out a sigh. “They are very traditional.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah.”</p><p><br></p><p>The monsters of the city were quite friendly and interesting. Especially the goblin called Gobuta.</p><p><br></p><p>He was funny.</p><p><br></p><p>They brought food for us. It was mostly roasted meat and fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the lot and thought of something. “Know what? Let me cook for you all today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no, Silas-sama. How can we make you work?” Rigurd denied immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it’s an amazing idea. Silas is a great cook.” Rimuru quickly spoke up and after some convincing they prepared more materials while Rimuru prepared the grill.</p><p><br></p><p>While cooking, I taught the Goblinas how to prepare the recipes and gave them some tips.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after a hearty meal, both Rimuru and I laid on the roof of one of the houses and looked at the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t see such a starry sky in Kyoto.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. Neither in Tokyo.” I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright!” He jumped up. “Let’s get to this. Since you didn’t get any skills by just walking inside, let’s try something else.” He looked at me. “I name you, Silas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh….” Was all I could say when my eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p>Power surged from inside me, rapidly increasing with every moment and before I could say anything, the world went dark around me.</p><p><br></p><p>In that world of darkness, I could not see or hear anything.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, a thought struck me. Wish.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm.</p><p><br></p><p>My wish?</p><p><br></p><p>What do I wish for?</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, maybe to be able to run my restaurant better. I guess, be a better chef.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Unique Skill Gained: Chef.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>I might be a Devil but I don’t want to become a heartless monster. Zeref explained that for normal humans, the Demon Seed could change someone’s personality….but I don’t want to be controlled by it. I don’t want to become someone else. I want to be me.</p><p><br></p><p>I want someone to keep me sane, from losing my sanity, someone wise….</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Sage.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>And with this, I lost my consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Magic Manipulation Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Universal Speak Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Water Manipulation Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Ice Manipulation Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Material Creation Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Magic Resistance Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Possession Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Charm Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Shapeshifting Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill: Demonic Core Gained.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rimuru -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched as Silas lost consciousness. It was only the reassurance of Great Sage which kept him calm now.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a miracle that he was able to connect to his friends. He would never be able to look himself in a mirror if he actually fucked up the life of a friend now.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘The Individual Silas has gained a Unique Skill called Chef.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>Chef? Yeah, it was the Skill Silas would get. Silas cooked the best darned food he had ever tasted in his life.</p><p><br></p><p>If someone else got the Chef Skill other than Silas, Rimuru would have an objection.</p><p><br></p><p>What does the Skill do?</p><p><br></p><p>Unique Skill Chef has several sub Skills.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘First is Analysis. It allows the user to analyse anything he sees or touches, be it Material, Magic or any Skill of any kind.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>So, a bit similar to Great Sage.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again he guessed, a Chef needed to know the ingredients to cook better food.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Second is Outcome Alteration. It allows the user to overwrite the nature and fate of an object, being or even laws and alter them to his wishes. Even if one tries to oppose the user, the user will just overwrite it with a stronger wish. This skill is given absolute priority and must achieve the desired effects of the user. Only those who possess a similar skill can oppose the user. The possible drawback is the extreme consumption of magicules for using this skill. The consumption of magicules for the skill depends on the extent of the change the user intends to make. He would also need physical contact to use this part of the ability.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>So Silas would need a lot more magicules than he currently has to comfortably use this skill.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there a way I can make him stronger?” He asked Great Sage.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Great Sage suggests intense magical training and being named by another being of great power.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>“Named? We can name people more than once?”</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Each successive use takes more Magicules.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Can I name him again?”</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Currently you are not strong enough to name him.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>“Ughh. I guess we need to get him trained in the next few days, enough to be able to defend himself in case he ever encounters people like those.”</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘The Analysis of the Magic, Spriggan Law has been completed.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>What?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Unnamed Onmyoji -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at his subordinates hanging from the ceiling by water snakes.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them had lost their consciousness while some were barely holding on and would pass out soon, his own younger brother and son being among them. He then turned to look at the cause of it all who was not even sweating as he stood in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will not get away with this. The Utsusemi Agency will find you. They will take revenge. We will….”</p><p><br></p><p>The devil snapped a finger and one of his subordinates exploded, putting a stop to his triad all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mitsuru….Mitsuru!” He roared and a second later the water snake covered his head completely, drowning his voice in the gurgling noise.</p><p><br></p><p>The water snake moved away after almost a minute as he gasped for breath, repeatedly coughing to expel the water he had swallowed.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, the devil spoke, his voice containing barely suppressed rage and madness. “I have said this to others and I will say this for the first and last time….I am at the end of my patience. Do <em>not</em> test me. For every time you lie, one person in this group will die. For every minute of my time you waste, I will randomly kill one person from this group.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened in horror at the devil’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why! Why are you doing this! We never did anything to you!” He roared.</p><p><br></p><p>BOOM!</p><p><br></p><p>Another body hanging from the air exploded.</p><p><br></p><p>“What did I say about testing my patience? Let’s add another rule. Every time you speak any unnecessary drivel, another person dies.” </p><p><br></p><p>The water snake circled over the head of his son and his eyes widened in fear.</p><p><br></p><p>“No….No, please not him. Not my son.” He begged.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Son?” The devil asked softly before taking another look behind him. “I see. Yes….this is fitting. This is fitting indeed.” He murmured to himself before looking towards him. “Very well. You know the rules already so I will begin asking. First questions first, are you Yuiichi Domon?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>There were no changes in the expression of the devil as he just stared at him coldly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is Hanezu Himejima?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Out….he is out on a mission to….to capture some kids with Sacred Gears and test the….the Utsusemi we produced in collaboration with the Wizards of Oz.” He quickly answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will he come back to this place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no. He stays in the main base and only comes here on wednesdays.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is the main base?”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly gave the location of the base up, fearing the consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>“Three months and two weeks ago, did you kill the Evans family, the Restaurant owners from Tokyo for their house?” It asked suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Evans Family….” He asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>The water snake on top of his son’s head moved slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, don’t. Yes. Yes I did that.” He quickly answered. “They have nothing to do with it. Please….please let them go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who ordered you to kill them?”</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://“Hanezu….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Hanezu….it</a> was Hanezu Himejima. They wanted the location for the Leylines under it to conduct rituals. I….”</p><p><br></p><p>The devil however had no change in his expressions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who killed Rufus Beige, the magician who was with the Evans family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We….we organised an ambush for the family when they were going out for some party. A team of people from both the Utsusemi Agency and Wizards of Oz ambushed them in between. They were killed without much resistance under the attacks of Augusta of the Purple Flame, the witch of the east of the Wizards of Oz.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who were in the car at that moment?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Evans couple and the magician.”</p><p><br></p><p>The devil paused for a bit all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was there no one else in the car?”</p><p><br></p><p>He desperately shook his head. “No. No there was no one else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Very well. Then answer me one last question….the son of the Evans family….where is Silas Evans?”</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his mouth and was about to say when suddenly a wall of black light passed over him and he was drowned in neverending darkness.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And you are saying that when you woke up, you found yourselves with the children, in the middle of the park?”</p><p><br></p><p>The two kids didn’t meet his eyes but nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>They were lying.</p><p><br></p><p>“And where is Lavinia?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She said she had something to do and will be arriving later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” He stared at them again, observing them closely.</p><p><br></p><p>The sweat, tremor in their voices, their eyes….everything said only one thing- They were afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>They were even traumatised.</p><p><br></p><p>And Azazel could understand their situation.</p><p><br></p><p>That attack….Black Light….the Demonic Brilliance of Evil Light….that power belonged to only one being, his late brother Lucifer….</p><p><br></p><p>How did this involve a Lucifer? And more importantly, who was this Lucifer?</p><p><br></p><p>The attack had shaken everyone in the entire Japan.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe the only redeeming fact was that the attack was too fast and no one exactly saw it or it would have been nigh impossible to clear the mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, his people as well as the Principal Clan members were running around doing damage control.</p><p><br></p><p>He was pretty sure he would be getting a call from Serafall and Michael any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything else to explain?” He asked the two kids.</p><p><br></p><p>Natsume seemed as if she was trying to say something but no words came out.</p><p><br></p><p>He resisted narrowing his eyes and cast a spell, confirming that they were under some kind of spell which prevented them from saying anything.</p><p><br></p><p>In such cases, it was better to not force them lest it triggers the spell.</p><p><br></p><p>Still….a Lucifer. Something like this was not what he was expecting from a Lucifer. Any member of that family would have killed the kids without any hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, them keeping quiet for such a long time and only being found out when those fools stepped directly in front of him with the Incinerate Anthem of all things.</p><p><br></p><p>And Augusta paid a price for it….</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. You all can go and take some rest. We will begin your training tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded and quietly left.</p><p><br></p><p>He closed his eyes and massaged his head.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, there was a knock on the door and Shemhazai entered with a shocked face. He directly handed him a tablet without any words.</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow and looked at the tablet, noticing some cracks at the corner of the screen.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly he read the report and a cracking sound appeared. He had unconsciously broken the tablet. But he didn’t have the time to worry about it.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Shemhazai in equal shock. “Is this a joke?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do I look like I am joking?” Shemhazai replied back.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“These are just the preliminary reports. We need to investigate more to find out the detailed information.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then find it. Send more people if you have to.” He ordered. </p><p><br></p><p>“Azazel, do you think it was a result of that attack?”</p><p><br></p><p>“.... I don't know. I really don't know.”</p><p><br></p><p>They kept quiet for a while. </p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai broke the silence again.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the kids? Did they know anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They do….but they are under some kind of spell which prevents them from speaking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A spell? Why would someone from<em> that</em> family use spells?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no idea but….don’t push them. Do keep an eye on them though. I guess it explains why they were terrified. Anyways, until all reports are verified,make sure our people don't go into that area.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai nodded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes to see an unfamiliar roof above my head.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later things came rushing into my mind as I looked around.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah. Mikam….Rimuru’s house.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened to me?</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and heard a sound beside me. Looking at the source of the sound, I saw a Goblina staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed and ran out of the room, leaving me confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I got down from the bed and looked at myself.</p><p><br></p><p>My body looked the same, only much more toned and stronger than before.</p><p><br></p><p>It reminded me of the scene from Captain America where Steve Rogers transforms into the superhero form. I mean, I was fucking ripped.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror. My looks were practically the same, only more defined. I had a slightly baby face, black hair and purple eyes. None of that changed, except now, I looked much sharper. I basically went from the cute type to the cool type.</p><p><br></p><p>My power was surging like never before. My cursed energy was several times higher. It was on a level where I could easily surpass Naruto, although not even close to Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised my hand in front of me and water gathered from around and formed a water ball and then with just a thought, it froze, forming a ball of ice. With a slight twist of my finger, the ball of ice was moulded into a bunch of ice needles.</p><p><br></p><p>“Already playing with the magic, I see.” I heard Rimuru’s voice and looked at him standing on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened? Why did I lose consciousness? And how long was I out for?” I asked, still looking at the ice needles which were floating above my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were getting the skills from the voice of the world, basically the power which regulates this world or something. As for how long you were out for, around eight hours. Anyways, how are you feeling? Any discomfort? Did you check the skills?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….am getting the hang of it. Still haven’t checked the others.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take your time. Your power has risen a lot compared to what it was although you will need to practise them more often to get used to them. I will get Ainz and we can go out on hunts to get you used to your power later on.” Rimuru offered. He then went on to explain my skills to me in brief.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “I need to get back to the Restaurant. Saitama must be waiting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. Although I think he must be taking a nap more than anything else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....yeah. That does sound like him.”</p><p><br></p><p>We chuckled and got ready to go back to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t mind it. Don’t mind it. We are friends, aren’t we? This is what friends do.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Yes. Yes we are.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door to the Restaurant was in the same house in a different room which everyone was forbidden from entering.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the door to the Restaurant and Saitama was playing games in his usual seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Silas, Rimuru, you’re back.” He looked up and asked before delving back to the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru also joined him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will go and check on Sakura and then make something for everyone.”</p><p><br>“Thanks.” They both shouted, already busy with the game.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and went upstairs.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura seemed to have heard our voices and came out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san. You are back.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Was everything alright here? No one troubled you all, did they?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “No. I was up here for most of the time and Saitama-san was in the shop but I didn’t hear anything from here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Good then. It’s already morning. Did the girl, Lavinia was it, did she wake up?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “No. She is still asleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Kisuke-san said she needed some rest so let her. Poor girl went through a lot yesterday. I will go and cook something for everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Will you be opening the Restaurant today?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Gojo-sensei said he was going to bring some people today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I will prepare then.” She nodded and was about to walk when I stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled and nodded her head.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I laid the last plate on the table as we sat down to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did someone come last night after we left?” I asked Saitama.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Oh yeah. There was one guy. What was his name again? Doorman Savana....Shirt and Pajama....ah....Milk and Banana!”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” All three of us looked at Saitama.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way someone was called that.</p><p><br></p><p>Were they pulling some kind of prank on Saitama?</p><p><br></p><p>….he does look like the kind of guy who would fall for something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>“He looked like a weirdo though. He asked me about the owner. I told him I was the owner as you had asked me to. He destroyed my shirt and tried to attack me so I punched him out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He attacked you?” I asked, narrowing my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“A weirdo?” Rimuru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you fine? Did you get hurt?” I asked quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, I’m fine. He was weak. Don’t worry. I think he was here to rob the shop or something. Seriously, they should just go and work hard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A robber….seriously….yesterday was wild. Then again, a simple mugger was almost cute after facing the pokemon kids and those crazy magicians.” Rimuru nodded and we continued eating food.</p><p><br></p><p>True.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what did you guys do in Rimuru’s world?” Saitama asked and we told him about his world. After eating, I went to prepare for the day and Rimuru went out to oversee the work of his people.</p><p><br></p><p>He did tell me to contact him immediately if there was any danger.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama had stayed at the shop quite late today so he also went back early and things became quiet once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Half an hour later, Tohru was the first one to arrive.</p><p><br></p><p>“Boss! Did anyone come to disturb you again?” She asked, as soon as she entered.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I was fine. Rimuru’s place was good.”</p><p><br></p><p>She came near me and smelled me. “Boss. Did you get stronger?” She asked, eying me curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yeah. Rimuru’s method worked out.” I raised my hand and showed her my new magic. “I even learned some magic.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Water Magic. So cool. Now you can put out any accidental fires I make without any fire extinguishers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t make fires in the first place.” I deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>I told her about Rimuru’s place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, goblins? I remember them. They are quite weak. The dwarves are tricky though. Most of them are weak but they can make dangerous weapons and armour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think Rimuru had Hobgoblins though. They evolved after he named them.”</p><p><br></p><p>As we were discussing this, the door opened and Miu and Naruto came with Hayato-san and the rest of the masters of Ryozanpaku.</p><p><br></p><p>They were told that Gojo-san will be bringing some of the students and they wanted to meet them too.</p><p><br></p><p>Minutes later both Touma and Cid-kun came as well.</p><p><br></p><p>I had prepared their bento for them already.</p><p><br></p><p>They checked on us and then left for school.</p><p><br></p><p>It was another half an hour later that the door opened once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yo Silas-kun, Sakura-chan, Naruto-kun. Did you miss me?” Gojo-san came in. Behind him, Nanami-sensei and Shoko-san came in followed by several others dressed in school uniforms. I only recognised the brown haired girl among them. I think her name was Nobara or something.</p><p><br></p><p>Other students were different.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a huge guy with the side of his face burned and there was a girl too who had a large part of her face and body with burn scars. Then again, they did tell me that being a Jujutsu Sorcerer was a dangerous job. It was the last guy who made me do a takeback.</p><p><br></p><p>Is that a panda suit?</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, is this the place?” A pink haired guy at the head of the group asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Restaurant.” The guy in the panda suit spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Panda talked!” Naruto jumped out of his seat and pointed a finger at him. “Miu Nee-chan, it talked.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sit down Naruto. He’s just wearing a panda suit.” Miu pulled him back while apologising. “I am sorry. Naruro can be a little overexcited.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah don’t mind it. By the way, I am not wearing a Panda suit. This is what I look like.” He….wait seriously?</p><p><br></p><p>Even Miu was taken aback by the information.</p><p><br></p><p>Well….I guess after seeing talking dragons, slimes and skeletons, this is not that weird.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he the new student, Sensei?” Nobara asked. “Isn’t he a bit too young?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yeah. Naruto-kun might be young but he has extremely high potential. If trained well then by the time he reaches your age, he might even be able to take me on hahahaha.” Gojo-san laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was shocked by this and looked at the kid.</p><p><br></p><p>“On the other note, the girl over here is Sakura-chan and our chef Silas-kun is the last student.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at us and I took this opportunity to welcome them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome. Please have a seat. Will you all be ordering something?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes! I will have mochi and red bean cakes.” Gojo-san raised his hand excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Udon for me.” Shoko-san ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ramen sounds good.” Nanami-sensei said.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing them, others took seats and ordered as well and took a look at the menu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are those horns and tails real?” The girl with the burns asked, pointing at Tohru who was currently serving Naruto his fifth bowl of ramen.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto answered, although with his mouth full it barely made any sense so Sakura explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Tohru-san is a Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A dragon? Seriously?” The pink haired one asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, do you have any doubt?” Tohru glared, her claws and fangs enlarging.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru.” I called out and she was back to normal as she turned back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yesss boss!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take their order.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okayy!”</p><p><br></p><p>I prepared their orders and finally went and sat with them. They were already having a lot of fun.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto especially seemed to get along with the other students.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san, who had finished his meal, got up and clapped his hands. “Hai hai, everyone listen up. Today is the first gathering of the new Tokyo Jujutsu High’s students. First of all, I would like to welcome Naruto-kun, Silas-kun and Sakura-chan to our school as first year students. Everyone clap.”</p><p><br></p><p>Cheers and claps rang through the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Now let me introduce your senpai to you all.” He went on to introduce every student.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and the last one is a student from Kyoto Jujutsu High but I guess he passed out so he is a Jujutsu Sorcerer now. Meet Aoi Todo-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Since it is the first meeting of the students, you all can talk among yourselves and get to know each other. Oh, I know what. We can have some sparring matches too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both Nanami-sensei and Shoko-san looked at him but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly remembered something.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, can I ask for your help, Shoko-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up. “Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm you see….” I explained to her the incident from yesterday. “And that’s how she was injured. She is still sleeping upstairs. Kisuke-san said she was fine soulwise but could I trouble you for a second opinion?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I will take a look at her.” She nodded and Sakura-chan led her upstairs.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, that’s quite some adventure you had. Tell me about the students. They were chasing you with pokemons?”</p><p><br></p><p>“NotPokemons….or that’s what we decided to call them since we don’t know what they were. The attackers were not keen on talking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Were they like curses?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I don’t know. They didn’t seem like Curses. From what Tobio told me, they were planning to make Sacred Gears of some sort and experimented on the kids. The things they made….those were actually failures.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sacred Gears?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, apparently, the God of the Bible in this world made several artifacts and distributed them through a lottery at birth. Every human has a chance to get one at birth although the chance is exceptionally low and it can be anything, from X Ray goggles to God Killing weapons with the power to destroy entire countries. The reason they were after Tobio was because his Sacred Gear was one of the strongest ones in the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait….Gods? As in real Gods?” Nanami-sensei asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, apparently my world has all kinds of supernatural creatures, even real Gods. Amaterasu, Zeus, Shiva, everyone is real here.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw their mouths wide open.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are joking right?” He asked, still incredulous.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Not really. Even the Kyoto youkai are ruled by a Nine Tailed Fox named Yasaka, who is the leader of almost half the Youkai of Japan. Then there are the Five Principal Clans of onmyoji and all.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were curious but I didn’t know much about the world so I couldn’t tell them.</p><p><br></p><p>By that time Shoko-san and Sakura had come down too.</p><p><br></p><p>“The girl is fine. She will wake up in a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, enough of these things. Let’s go out and start our first joint training session.” Gojo-san clapped.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop didn’t have much of a crowd by then so we went out.</p><p><br></p><p>Familiar walls appeared in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>The barriers around the place seemed a lot stronger than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san seemed to have noticed my look and confirmed. “The barriers were strengthened by the old fossil. It can take a lot more beating than before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fossil?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….stop teaching them nonsense.” Nanami-sensei scolded and then looked at me and explained. “The barriers were created by the Tengen-sama. He is the head of the entire Japan’s Jujutsu world. He found out about the situation and offered to provide a place where you all could be trained without any worries.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….see. Please send our thanks to him then.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, Silas-kun, you wanted to train your new Innate Technique. The best way to do that will be during a fight. So….let’s pick an opponent for everyone. Naruto-kun will be fighting Panda-kun. Sakura-chan will be fighting Yuta-kun and finally Silas-kun will be fighting Todo-kun. Don’t worry about injuries. We can heal everyone up in a jiffy with Shoko here, so go wild.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satoru Gojo -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked as the pairs took position.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sending Yuta-senpai and Aoi-san against them is a bit too much, don't you think sensei?” Yuji asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, yes. It might be a bit too much to send Yuta. As for Silas, I don’t know. He is still learning to use his powers and Aoi can push him towards it. In fact, he is one of the people who has the best chance against Silas. As for Panda and Naruto. I think they are suitable.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I don’t think Yuta-senpai would go hard against Sakura-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha keep on looking.”</p><p><br></p><p>The first match was between Panda and Naruto so he appeared in between the field.</p><p><br></p><p>“The rules are simple. The first one to give up, lose consciousness or get out of the boundary of the field loses.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two sides took on their positions.</p><p><br></p><p>He observed both of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Panda was the perfect match for Naruto in this case as he is not truly violent and would be able to take hits.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto might look like a kid but he had a similar fighting style to Yuji and Todo. He would improve during a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get ready…..Start.”</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as his words fell, a massive amount of Cursed Energy burst out of Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>“Holy shit!” Yuji exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….impossible. Just how much power does this kid have?”</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto, completely unbothered by them, shouted. “Here I come, Panda-senpai.” he kicked the ground and dashed towards Panda who defended but was pushed back several steps simply due to the enormous amount of cursed energy behind the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Panda regained his footing and returned the favour as he punched only for Naruto to dodge using his smaller physique as an advantage.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, the kid is talented in martial arts. In just these few moves, I think I have noticed hints of Karate, Judo, Muay Thai and Wing Chun. Is he some kind of prodigy?” Maki asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto’s adopted family has a martial arts dojo. All of them are world class Martial Arts Masters, the very top of their fields.” Nanami replied.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto slid below Panda and at that moment, Golden Chains popped out of his back, binding Panda, making him unable to move anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Panda tried his best to break the chains but as expected, they didn’t break.</p><p><br></p><p>He clapped his hands. “Alright. That’s match. The winner is Naruto.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was silent at the result but this silence was soon broken by the winner.</p><p><br></p><p>“I won yatta! Did you see that Miu nee-chan, Gramps, I won dattebayo.” The kid cheered while releasing Panda from the golden chains.</p><p><br></p><p>Panda looked at himself in shock. “What was the chain? I….couldn’t use any Cursed Energy at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those chains have the ability to seal Cursed Energy and even bypass Cursed Techniques. They are almost unbreakable, so once you are caught in them….it’s game over.” He explained while patting Naruto’s head. “Well done Naruto-kun. You waited for the perfect opportunity to trap Panda-kun and gain a victory in one fell swoop.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy grinned at the compliment and walked towards his guardians.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright let’s get ready for the next match. Aoi-kun, get in. You will be fighting Silas.”</p><p><br></p><p>They went onto the field.</p><p><br></p><p>Aoi had a wide smile on his face as he threw aside his shirt and took his position.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….what kind of girl do you like?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude (Sukuna’s Isekai Adventures- Part 2) -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The ritual to empower this body was successful. In fact, it was too successful.</p><p><br></p><p>He had underestimated the potency of whatever that black mud was.</p><p><br></p><p>Initially, he was planning to use those to create his own body but found out that the mud was starting to corrupt even him.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, the owner of this body and his annoying trait came in helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>He was absorbing the black mud’s power and in turn increasing his cursed energy while any damage and mental corruption was suffered by the boy’s soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Observing the body closer, he found that the body was slowly transforming into something which was neither a human nor a Cursed Spirit, kind of a Pseudo Cursed Spirit. He had to make sure to maintain the balance so that the boy doesn’t get devoured by the power which was a delicate task and consumed such a large amount of his time.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was all worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>With this much power, even if he was not at his peak power, he was still at least as strong as he could be with a dozen fingers. Now he needed the body to adjust for a few days to this power level before he could empower it again.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been difficult hiding from those pesky exorcists and mages in his weakened state but it was worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole fiasco had given him a chance like none before. It would be a pity if things were easy.</p><p><br></p><p>He thought of a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>Satoru Gojo would not stay in the same place all the time so there was a chance that he could find his target alone.</p><p><br></p><p>First he would take over that Restaurant owner and then he would have free reign to explore any number of worlds in all of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>A grin appeared on his face at the thought.</p><p><br></p><p>He dodged the areas under the surveillance of those magus. He would make sure to kill them when he attained his goals to erase this humiliation.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost half an hour later, he reached the door to the Restaurant and knocked.</p><p><br></p><p>The door was opened by a bald man wearing an atrocious combination of clothes. The annoyance made him attack him instinctively, just for sullying his eyes with such a horrid scene.</p><p><br></p><p>But something unexpected happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead of the scene he was expecting, the man didn’t fall, chopped into two pieces. All his attack did was slash his shirt in two.</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked down at his shirt in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Did a button come off? No. There is a large cut? Did a loose string get caught somewhere? Man that sucks. I had just gotten it fixed last week.”</p><p><br></p><p>Limitless?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it another member of that annoying man’s clan?</p><p><br></p><p>No….there was no hint of Cursed Energy. Then what was it?</p><p><br></p><p>“As expected, they would never leave such a place unguarded. Tell me, where is the owner of the place?” He asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Owner? Silas is ou….I mean I am the owner.” He replied, his lie obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh! The audacity to lie in front of me, Ryomen Sukuna? Do you think I cannot touch you?” He smiled and launched a Cleave.</p><p><br></p><p>The next second however, he fell to his knees due to losing almost all his Cursed Energy in that attack. It hit the man head-on and sent a shockwave flying everywhere but to his stunned surprise, just another cut appeared on his shirt.</p><p><br></p><p>“How….did you….” He breathed out.</p><p><br></p><p>The bald man narrowed his eyes. “Did you do this?”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly jumped back, his body moving far slower for his liking due to the exhaustion of most of his Cursed Energy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Even kids are becoming robbers nowadays. This place is really dangerous.” With that said, the bald man punched and he suddenly felt as if he was drowned in a pit of endless ice. The hair on the back of his neck stood up as he felt the world collapse around him at that very instant.</p><p><br></p><p>During his entire life, this was the first time he had truly felt the feeling of death.</p><p><br></p><p>Rage welled up in his mind but before he could do anything the attack hit and he was blown kilometers away, his body shattered, all bones in his body broken.</p><p><br></p><p>He was barely able to use Reversed Curse Technique to fix his internal organs to a state that he doesn’t die instantly, barely hanging on to his life.</p><p><br></p><p>As he lay there in pain and humiliation of his defeat, the only thought that went through his head was….just who was that man?</p><p><br></p><p>“Ha hahahaha hahahahaha I will remember it. I will remember it….and one day I will kill you.”</p><p><br></p><p>But even he knew that his current strength was not enough to do so.
