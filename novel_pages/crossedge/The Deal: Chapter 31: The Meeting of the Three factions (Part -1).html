        <p><strong>The Deal</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 31: The Meeting of the Three factions (Part -1)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Are the preparations done?” I asked Merlin who was looking at the list of things.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. But are you sure all this is necessary? We could take them out even if they attacked.” Sean asked, confused. “On second thought, how did you even know who is going to attack?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“A conference of the Three Factions….without attacks….just doesn’t feel right. Even more so when the Devil himself is calling for the said conference.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I don’t get it.” He looked even more confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Remember the Fallen prisoners we had released?” Merlin asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were made to sign contracts with us. Damien had them enter the groups of the Fallen Angel cadres who were antagonistic towards him in general. Safe to say that almost all of them were selected, getting us an insight into all the actions of those cadres. From there, we got some information about what a few of them are planning and made preparations for those.” Merlin explained the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. So….do we get to fight?” he asked excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“If they attack even after our preparations, then why not?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the situation with the Shinto?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They….have been extremely quiet since the disappearance of the Gokadoin Clan. Apparently, none of them were expecting such a counterattack and are reconsidering things. It also all but confirmed the ties between us and the Nura Clan. They must be reconsidering their plans.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm.</p><p><br></p><p>“They would probably play the blame game with the Nura Clan and then descend themselves to play the saviour. Did you get the connection of the Shinto Gods behind the whole incident?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A few yes. But if we want to implicate the whole faction, we would need more or they will just say that those few were rebels and wave things off and if they are more shameless, they would just pretend the information to be false.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go with the shameless part then. That’s something most of the Gods, especially the weaker ones have the most experience in being one.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….I can’t deny that.” Merlin shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>I discussed a few more things with them before leaving the place where the rest were training.</p><p><br></p><p>We had increased the training of the kids especially since Albion started teaching Vienna his own Divide and other techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>Hagoromo Gitsune and Merlin taught Valerie about her Sacred Gear and even I sometimes joined in and taught her a few things to protect her mind against the mental corrosion of the Sephiroth Graal.</p><p><br></p><p>She was progressing quite quickly, especially with a nerfed Archmage and King’s Essence.</p><p><br></p><p>I recalled how the Sephiroth Graal was used in canon and felt how dumb those people were to use it like that.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, they made a million autonomous Boosted Gear Scale Mails, each with the power of a Middle Class being….and what did they do?</p><p><br></p><p>Just sent those mindless scale mails to attack in a bunch….</p><p><br></p><p>What a fucking waste.</p><p><br></p><p>Had they been used on people, they could have boosted a normal Middle Class being to High Class with ease.</p><p><br></p><p>A million or even ten thousand High Class Beings….that’s a whole new ball game….</p><p><br></p><p>It could have been used as easy weapons for the entire army.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean Hades did create a hundred thousand Devils but had he used the Scale Mails with them, things would have been completely different….</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, that was a dumb novel and this is the real world.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, my soldiers needed weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>Equiping such a large army needs a lot of money and we didn’t have that so we had started to work on this.</p><p><br></p><p>I already had enough DNA from the Ddraig and Albion to make the Scale Mails.</p><p><br></p><p>The next part was to remove the light and holy weakness from my soldiers.</p><p><br></p><p>But these projects were put on hold for now since Valerie wasn’t strong enough right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Today however, I hadn’t come here for Valerie but for someone else.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked towards the girl who was healing the tired and injured people in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia Argento.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl, she had been in the background of the group the entire time because she wasn’t exactly a combatant.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, her personality made her detest any form of combat.</p><p><br></p><p>That was not to say that she was weak. In terms of just Magical Power, she was rivalling an Ultimate Class being and with the Balance Breaker of her Twilight Healing which had been changed to a Subspecies due to the influence of the Essences, she could heal entire armies all at once.</p><p><br></p><p>I had often thought that Asia’s kindness was kinda exaggerated in the story but after knowing her for so long, I found out <a href="https://that….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">that….it</a> was actually severely understated.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl didn’t have a single evil bone in her body.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact she always tries to look for good in things and people and blames herself in case things go bad, even if it’s not her fault.</p><p><br></p><p>And I….hated that last part.</p><p><br></p><p>Those pieces of crap from the Church had really done a number on her mind so much so that even when she was thrown away by them as a tradable object, she never once complained.</p><p><br></p><p>The worst part was that since the reveal about my identity and that Asia Argento was actually serving me….the Church had declared her a witch.</p><p><br></p><p>….the fucking audacity of those bastards.</p><p><br></p><p>They couldn’t do anything against me because of my power and Michael’s grasp on their leash so they were slandering my subordinates and spreading hate against them.</p><p><br></p><p>And for just this fact, I am going to make them kneel in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>I had promised to give the girl a home where she would be treated with respect and I am not going to let some random self-righteous pieces of crap just shit on my word.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the girl herself, she got along well with everyone in my group and was liked by others too and while she pretended not to care about what the church were saying about her, I as well as several others here, can sense emotions and she is actually hurt by their comments.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that she ever complained to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Her relationship with <a href="https://me….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">me….it</a> was quite complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Damien.” The girl looked at me as I was approaching and quickly got up from her seat and came in front of me with excitement and kneeled with her hands clasped in prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the time she had seen me changing into my Archangel form, she had behaved like this.</p><p><br></p><p>She treats me like a real angel….someone chosen by God….</p><p><br></p><p>She even waved off me being a reincarnation of Lucifer by saying that since I could change into an Archangel, it meant that God forgave me and had accepted me back.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I know that was the case with Lucifer….but….I had only found it recently in my dreams, whereas Asia believed this to be the case since the first time she saw me transforming.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously….faith is a scary thing.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girl once more and sighed. “How many times have I told you not to kneel in front of me? Get up.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>She got up, looking a bit down so I caressed her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tomorrow, there is going to be a meeting between the Three Factions and I want you to accompany me there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“M-me?’</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I have a surprise for everyone.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>And what a surprise it was going to be.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I walked back towards my room to rest for the day and saw Gretel standing in front of the room, waiting for me.</p><p><br></p><p>She opened the door and both of us entered to see a familiar sight in front of our eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“She was training all day today and must have fallen asleep.” Gretel said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. She has been on edge since we are getting closer to our first clash with the Wizards of Oz and trains most of the day. It’s not good for her mental state.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I will see that she gets some rest after tomorrow.” Gretel replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, we should do something to make her release all the frustration that she has been holding back.”</p><p><br></p><p>While Lavinia knew about the situation with Glenda and how she had disappeared under the ruse of dying at the hands of Augusta to get rid of <a href="https://her….it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">her….it</a> was still hard for her. After all, for Lavinia, that woman was the one who raised her for several years, especially when she had been in such a delicate period of time.</p><p><br></p><p>There was some emotional connection from her part, no matter how less.</p><p><br></p><p>That was not to say that she would betray us or even refuse any of my orders, her loyalty firmly lay with us, she would still be….sad.</p><p><br></p><p>I caressed the hair of the sleeping girl and laid on the bed myself, Gretel soon taking my side.</p><p><br></p><p>She hugged me from the side and I looked at her questioningly.</p><p>‘</p><p>It had been a while since we had spent some alone time with each other so I suddenly had an idea and my lips curled up in a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Turning towards her I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master?”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t give her the chance to speak any more words as I pulled her in for a kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a bit taken aback by the sudden action but quickly hugged me and returned the kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, even she had gotten used to doing it with Lavinia sleeping beside us.</p><p><br></p><p>And the fact that Lavinia herself was extremely obvious with what she wants, I was fine with it too. All we needed was for Gretel to get comfortable and looking at her, slowly taking off her clothes without any kind of covers made me think that she was more than ready.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she had had a talk with Lavinia and the girl didn’t stop intruding into our room so Lavinia had given her acquiescence. </p><p><br></p><p>She began grinding herself on me, making me hard in a moment. I didn’t remain idle as I grabbed her breasts and pinched her nipples, making her moan before she leaned in and kissed me.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands dropped to her hips and raised her slowly and she positioned me at the entrance of her cave as I pushed, my entire length entering into her at once.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmmmmh.” She bit her lips to contain her moan but without much effect.</p><p><br></p><p>She moved and I looked up at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver hair flying around as her red eyes shined in the slight moonlight coming through the window. Her skin lighting up from the moonlight seemed to glow in an ethereal light.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, my Gretel was enchanting.</p><p><br></p><p>The way her eyes were half closed or the way she bit her lips. Her bouncing breasts or the sound of her moans, everything she did just made me more enchanted with her.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a hold of her hips and began thrusting from below as well, slowly increasing my pace as the room was filled with the sounds of clapping flesh.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my hands slipped and rubbed her little nub with a bit of my Passion Magic, making her moans even louder as she increased the pace of moving.</p><p><br></p><p>Asmodeus Clan Trait was very useful for this.</p><p><br></p><p>With a grunt I thrust once more, releasing my seed deep into her.</p><p><br></p><p>She too shivered at the same time and collapsed on top of me but this was far from enough for me.</p><p><br></p><p>While Asmodeus’ Clan Trait was useful, this blood had a flaw as well….I was almost insatiable once I started having sex. Thus I pushed her on her back, capturing her lips before she could voice her surprise and started thrusting into the still climaxing Gretel.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aaaaahhhh.” She moaned but it was muffled by my kiss. Her hands clawed my back and then grabbed my hair as she pulled me to deepen the kiss while both her legs wrapped around my waist tightly.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t realised it but I had a lot of stress piling up and she had been working very hard too so this was a very good opportunity for us to release some steam.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough, I released my second load inside her and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>We had completely forgotten about our fellow companion as we indulged ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>After letting out my fifth load inside her, I pulled out as my semen poured out of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of us were covered with sweat and I picked her up and made her lay on my chest as I lay down again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this time that I noticed something different.</p><p><br></p><p>The even breathing beside us had changed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavy.” I called out making Gretel look my direction and then as if realising something, in Lavinia’s direction. As for the girl herself, she shuddered lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed a hand on her head and caressed her hair lightly and she turned towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>She was blushing madly to the extent that even her ears were red.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….” She whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know what you want, Lavy.” I said when she didn’t speak further.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean your intentions were a bit obvious.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>Her mouth opened slightly at my words then a sad look came upon her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….she was thinking that I was rejecting her so I pulled her to my side, surprising her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not rejecting your advances. In fact, I would be lying if I said that after all these years together, I didn’t feel anything towards you. Trust me, if that were the case, you wouldn’t be sleeping beside me.” I clarified before she had those kinds of thoughts any further.</p><p><br></p><p>“The only reason I didn’t respond earlier was because I wanted to give us some time so that you can have a chance in case you had any second thoughts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn’t….” She began speaking but I put a finger on her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I found that out soon too. That brings me to the second reason. I had just accepted Gretel’s feelings and I wanted to give our relationship some time before bringing someone else into it or it wouldn’t have been fair to any one of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She calmed down on hearing my reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“But I guess I have been a bit too slow this time and ended up worrying you instead. So let me make up for it. ”I looked at Gretel and she nodded at me. Then I turned towards her. “My current state might not be the perfect one for such things so I apologise for that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavinia Reni….would you go out with me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl just stared at me and the moment lasted a bit too long to make it awkward but just as I was going to say something she leaned in and kissed me directly on my lips. I looked at her and then responded accordingly.</p><p><br></p><p>She was clearly inexperienced but was trying to make up for it with her enthusiasm. I caressed her back, letting her take her time as my hand slid inside her shirt.</p><p><br></p><p>She always just wore one of my shirts or oversized T Shirts when sleeping with nothing inside.</p><p><br></p><p>It was somehow even more seductive than being naked.</p><p><br></p><p>My hand crept from her back to her ass as I lifted her and pulled her on top of me. She was hugging my neck, never breaking the kiss while I did so.</p><p><br></p><p>She finally pulled back after a full minute and her eyes looked hazy.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was a great way to answer. Let me return the favour.” I got up and pushed her on her back, getting on top of her. “Help me, Gretel.”</p><p><br></p><p>““Eh?!””</p><p><br></p><p>Both the girls were surprised at my words but my cute maid understood me in a look and a rare smile crept on her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master. I need to welcome the newest addition to our family too.” She smirked, something even I had only seen a few times and crept on Laviinia’s side, taking one of her breasts in her hands and massaging it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gre-chan! Mmmhh.”</p><p><br></p><p>I, in the meanwhile, claimed her lips again and worked on her other breast.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel wasn’t far behind and began showering kisses on her breast, slowly circling her nipple but never getting there, making Lavy moan in my mouth from all the stimulation.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to our position, my length was rudding directly on her slit. She was wet and I moved at a slow speed, slowly increasing my speed to tease her even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Pulling back, I saw her, drool slightly flowing from the side of her face as she was trying hard to control her moans.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let them out, Lavy. I like your cute voice. I want to hear it more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“N-nooo ahhhh. I….I’m embarrassed.” She answered, earning her a bite on her nipple from my maid.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you embarrassed, Lavy? You are cute. That’s something we all knew. I want to see more of it.” I smiled, pinching her nipple while my other hand went down and brushed her clit, making her jerk from the stimulation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mhhhh.” She shook her head and by the seven heavens, she looked so fucking adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think she was even aware of how mind numbingly arousing her actions were.</p><p><br></p><p>It just made me want to tease her even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I once again reaffirmed that I am a sadist and found out a new fact that….just like Gretel, Lavinia is also a bit of a masochist.</p><p><br></p><p>And I was going to explore this side of her to the fullest.</p><p><br></p><p>I lifted her by her thighs so that my face was directly in front of her pussy and she could see both her core and me directly, and placed a kiss on it while staring into her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Noooo stoppp it.” She covered her face but the third person in the room wouldn’t allow it.</p><p><br></p><p>My maid knew me and my intentions very well and she would never allow my fun to be interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>She caught Lavinia’s hand and held them above her head, preventing her from hiding her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah Gre-chan….”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not good. You shouldn’t hide yourself like that, Lavy. Master is right. You do look adorable when you are flustered like this. I never knew you could show such expressions.” She said in a stoic tone but the light smirk on the corner of her lips was telling a different story altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she awakening to something new?</p><p><br></p><p>I would have smirked if I wasn’t busy tasting the tasty feast in front of me. I lapped at the increasingly wet slit of my newest lover while Gretel focused on her nipples.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmphhh ahhhh d-dont….aahhh.” Lavinia moaned but she was given no respite.</p><p><br></p><p>My lips caught on to her little nub and sucked them with force while Gretel took the same time to bite her nipple, making the poor blonde scream as her entire body shivered hard.</p><p><br></p><p>She came.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up from her core to the piece of art we had created.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy had half closed eyes and her innocent appearance was completely replaced with mind numbing sexiness.</p><p><br></p><p>I was hard as a rock all over again.</p><p><br></p><p>My maid noticed this and took action.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said as she took a hold of my length and slowly rubbed it up and down before taking it in her mouth, making me moan.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t stand by either. I dove into Lavinia’s pussy again, this time, one of my fingers finding her hole and loosening her up lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Her moans increased as Gretel worked on me.</p><p><br></p><p>A minute or two later she moved back and I took a position between Lavy’s legs while Gretel went to her head and placed Lavy’s head on her lap, giving her a lap pillow, her breasts hanging right above the blonde’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at both my lovers and took a moment to appreciate the sight.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy too realised  my gaze and nodded her head shyly.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t make her wait for long, positioning myself at the entrance of her smouldering cave, I pushed slowly at first, entering her inch by inch.</p><p><br></p><p>She tightly held Gretel’s hand as I entered her, her entire body gripping me like a wet vice. A few seconds later, I made the final push as I felt myself enter her fully.</p><p><br></p><p>“Agghhh.” Her moan resounded throughout the room as her body arched.</p><p><br></p><p>I used a bit of Passion Magic to prevent her from feeling any pain, changing it all into pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a hold of her waist and pulled back slightly and pushed again, the incredible resistance of her core making me humm in satisfaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, I increased my speed as she was getting used to it too, her waist shook in response to my movements.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, I was thrusting in and she was matching my thrusts as her legs wrapped around my waist. She was even responding to Gretel as she took on of my cure maid’s nipples in her mouth, making her yelp in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>My hand found her breasts and massaged them while my other hand made sure that my maid wasn’t feeling ignored.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled Gretel in for a kiss which she returned happily.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few minutes the room was filled with the sounds of flesh slapping and moans.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt myself approacing my peak and began thrusting harder, making her let go of Gretel as her moans grew louder.</p><p><br></p><p>With my peak, my Passion Magic flared as Lavinia experienced her climax as well, her entire body jerking wildly as she squirted hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t pull back as I ejaculated ropes of my sperm as deep inside her as I couldwith each thrust.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow.”</p><p><br></p><p>The one who said it was not me….nor Lavy, who looked like she had fainted. And I had to agree.</p><p><br></p><p>The result of our incessant teasing could indeed be described with this word alone.</p><p><br></p><p>I let myself fall beside her body as Gretel slowly slipped beside me, into my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the unconscious girl and smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>At least her first time would be memorable….after all, how man girls could say they lost their virginity in a threesome and fainted at that.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed a small kiss on both my lover’s heads as both Gretel and I looked at Lavinia who was sleeping peacefully.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly Gretel let out a giggle.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuroka is going to be so mad when she finds out.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“She would, wouldn’t she?” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>As a fact she was….after all, she was a Satan Class being who fainted from excess pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I overdid it with the Passion Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>She woke up after half an hour and cuddled into my side and I caressed her hair.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the family, Lavy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmh.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and spoke. “I might not be the best person in the world. In fact, I have a lot of flaws. I might have more women in my life too, but I promise you….that I will never  betray you or let you go….even if you want me to. I am very possessive like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just rubbed her face on my chest, making herself more comfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>After resting for a while, she opened up too.</p><p><br></p><p>She was having different thoughts about facing her previous Mentor if we were to fight against the Wizards of Oz.</p><p><br></p><p>“She might have just kept me to study my Sacred Gear but….she did save my life when I was at the lowest point of my life. Moreover, she didn’t treat me badly either. And she might have created a lie to make me leave but….she could have done so. After all, she didn’t owe me anything. So….”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t want to fight her or kill her.” I completed and she became silent.</p><p><br></p><p>She had matured a lot compared to how she was when we had first met.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….that’s quite understandable. I am actually proud of you for thinking that.” I caressed her hair and she felt her release the breath she was holding.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you don’t want to fight her….don’t. I give you my word that as long as she doesn’t attack us or harm our people, I will not give any orders to kill her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But….” I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“In return, you must promise me that….if she….or any of the Wizards of the Oz, attack or plan to harm us….”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not hold back either.” She completed my words with an uncharacteristically serious tone. “This place is my home….and I will not let anyone destroy it….Not even Glenda.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her for a moment and nodded. “That’s my girl.”</p><p><br></p><p>We enjoyed each other’s company till all of us drifted off to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Tomorrow was a big day and I needed to prepare for it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Are you ready?” He asked Serafall and Ajuka as they teleported to the Gremory Mansion followed by Behemoth.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, let’s leave.” He got up as well and Grayfia followed him.</p><p><br></p><p>This meeting was something they had been waiting for since Merlin’s eerie warning.</p><p><br></p><p>For the last two weeks, Ajuka had been spending all his time to find out any information about the Melbranche and the secret of the Evil Pieces. It did lead to some discoveries.</p><p><br></p><p>They discovered a place under the city of Lucifad where something had been sealed till a while ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Twelve things to be exact and then they were moved from there. The move took place around four hundred years or so ago when the Civil War was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Were those things released during the Civil War? If so then why weren’t they used?</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t even imagine what would have happened if they had joined the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>They had been trying tirelessly to figure out a way to counter them since they had heard of it and all four of them were exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was not even mentioning the bomb about the afterlife of Devils Cleria had thrown.</p><p><br></p><p>There were too many questions and the only chance for an answer was this meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>Things were turning out to be too troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked back at his family and saw his mother joining both her hands in prayer and let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been doing the same for a while now and claims that she even had a response to her prayers.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka tested her to see if there was something wrong with her but found nothing wrong with her. That said, her Demonic Power was slowly increasing and she was gaining powers very similar to Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it?</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>The main thing was that several others of the servants in the house had started doing the same after seeing her.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head and looked at Grayfia and nodded and she activated the Teleportation magic.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Is this the place?” Uriel asked him as they teleported to Damien’s appointed location.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and sure enough, he felt few people approaching the place.</p><p><br></p><p>They revealed themselves and he heard Uriel take a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Celine.” He called.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded but not before taking an extra moment to stare back at her father and his brother.</p><p><br></p><p>“The meeting will be in a different location. We have received the news of people planning to attack the conference and we are going to lay a trap for them there.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Who is planning attacks?” He asked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“A few groups. We will see who attacks when they do.” She said and teleported them from there.</p><p><br></p><p>As he arrived at the place, he recalled the number of people dissatisfied with Helel’s return as well as the changes in the management of Heaven. It was mainly the group who fell as he resolved the loopholes of Heaven's system. It had taken them a considerable amount of effort to resolve that matter as the number was a lot more than he was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>The second was a group of people from the church who were dissatisfied with his handling of the matter.</p><p><br></p><p>It took him personally coming down to the Vatican to silence the group but even that felt like a temporary relief.</p><p><br></p><p>There was bound to be a fight because of the thousands of years of grudges between the three sides.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe the only one who could stop such a thing and resolve this matter peacefully was….</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>A voice from Celine stopped his thoughts and they saw that they had reached the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin stood at the door to receive them.</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t sense anything inside the building.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin as if sensing his thoughts explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“The place inside is a completely different dimension.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….that explains it.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are the first group to arrive so we have a bit of time on our hands.” Merlin informed as he led them inside.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop was still the same but this time there is barely any people inside but every one inside was someone with great strength.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly took a look around and there were around twenty people, all High Ultimate Class or higher. This kind of strength….along with the ones he had shown during the ruckus in the Underworld….was at a level of an independent faction already.</p><p><br></p><p>And there were not only devils but also people from other races….all of them together in harmony.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien managed to gather this without anyone even being aware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe she was actually right….Helel is a King and Michael is a General.</p><p><br></p><p>They followed Merlin inside and inside a private room, and there he was, sitting with his maid and the Child of Light, Sean Collins, behind him. The most surprising was probably the last member of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia Argento.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin too walked and joined them behind him while Celine stayed by the door.</p><p><br></p><p>He felt Uriel halt his steps slightly and looked at his brother’s stunned face.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one thing to hear and see someone on a screen and something else entirely to see them face to face.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien noticed Uriel’s hesitation and sent a smile his way as he spoke. “So….what would you like to have? Tea, coffee….holy water or would you like me to turn water into wine? I must say that’s a convenient skill to have.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He stared blankly at his twin. “Really….that joke again?”</p><p><br></p><p>He just laughed. “It worked, didn’t it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh.” he let out an audible sigh as he sat down. The crude attempt of humour did lighten the atmosphere for them too as Uriel looked calmed down and took a seat beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien glanced at Uriel and saw his eyes moving towards the boy behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sean….give him the spear.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy nodded and in the next second, the room was filled with the Holy Aura from the True Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel held the spear in his hand and bowed to it for a moment before opening his eyes and returning the spear back to Sean. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere became sombre after this.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, Damien looked as if he felt something. “Great. Our guests are here too. Let’s get on with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Five minutes or so later, they found themselves sitting on the top floor of the building with Sirzechs, Serafall, Azazel and Shemhazai sitting in front of them. </p><p><br></p><p>The view outside was clear for them to see.</p><p><br></p><p>It took him a moment to realise that this dimension was created using the Dimension Lost which they had found to be in the possession of Gretel Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are there really people who are going to attack this meeting?” Sirzechs asked, looking outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien shrugged. “What can I say….people are jealous of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael wasn’t the only one rolling his eyes at this.</p><p><br></p><p>Some things never change.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s think about those later. I am sure that since you have decided to go on with this meeting, it means that you have already arranged more than enough protection details for everyone. What I am more interested in is just what kind of world ending threat it is that you wanted to talk about.” Azazel brought up the matter everyone wanted to talk about.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien looked at all of them and his eyes stopped at him. “Let’s begin this from a history lesson, shall we?”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael suddenly had a very bad feeling.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Ah….Michael guessed it already.</p><p><br></p><p>Did he awaken some kind of mind reading power?</p><p><br></p><p>Well, not my problem.</p><p><br></p><p>“As I am sure many know about my previous life’s adventures. Establishing a new race in the Underworld and all….but I doubt rarely anyone knows why I did it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wasn’t it because Father never went there? Heaven had its own afterlife for the dead and that place was inhabited by Pits and Demonic Beings, things Father was allergic to.” Azazel replied nonchalantly, making Uriel glare at the man for the last part.</p><p><br></p><p>“On the matter of the dead, I also have a question.” Sirzechs asked, diverting the attention of everyone in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow and he continued. “Is it true that Devil and Fallen Angel souls can also go to Heaven’s afterlife?” he asked directly, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“What nonsense? As if he would ever tolerate such a thing. The Heaven’s system would be blaring alarms as soon as a Demonic Being or corrupted individual like us enters. For them to live there….even the thought of it is stupid.” Azazel waved it off.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel and Shemhazai, while likely saying the same words as Azazel, had expressions which said the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael on the other hand was….looking at me….unsure.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “They can.”</p><p><br></p><p>The reply had different reactions from everyone. Azazel looked back at me, taken aback, Shemhazai looked at me oddly too while Michael….he just had a sad look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nonsense.” Uriel, the last one. as expected, burst out in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shush….just because something doesn’t match your belief doesn’t mean it’s untrue, brother. To explain with an example, just because a colour blind person can only see black and white shades for their entire life doesn’t mean the other colours don’t exist or are you claiming to know of all of the billions of souls in the Third Heaven?” I questioned making him shut down his response.</p><p><br></p><p>But he didn’t give up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father would never let the Demonic or Corrupted, enter Heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch tch tch.” I shook my finger. “Not quite true, brother. Father never treated someone badly due to their demonic nature….what he hated were their deeds. As for letting someone with Demonic nature live in Heaven he would….and he has already….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Helel!” Michael spoke in a warning tone, eliciting a surprised look from everyone at the normally calm and peaceful Archangel using that kind of voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“What brother? Did I say something wrong?”</p><p><br></p><p>He just stared at me, a dead serious look in his eyes without speaking any words.</p><p><br></p><p>“The truth always comes out at one point, brother. Father has taught this too. I think it’s about time.”</p><p><br></p><p>However Michael, as stubborn as ever, didn’t agree. “If you break your word, I will kill you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now that….made all the leaders in the room stare at Michael in shock. Even Uriel was looking at him as if he was someone else.</p><p><br></p><p>“I never break my word, brother. You of all people should know about that. If I did….the result of the Great War would have been far different than what it was.” I said in an equally serious tone.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was true.</p><p><br></p><p>If Lucifer had indeed revealed the news about his mother during the Great War, a great number of Angels would have rebelled and the Fallen Angels might have sided with him too….but he didn’t….just because he had given a word to his Father, an oath that they would never speak about their Mother with others….ever again.</p><p><br></p><p>God knew that information about her would lead to a division between his children so he erased all traces of her.</p><p><br></p><p>The other Archangels except Michael and Helel were infants….and didn’t remember anything when she was sealed.</p><p><br></p><p>Seraphs and younger Angels were not born from them but rather created by God using their powers.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, only Michael and Helel were actually born from their mother. Others were all created with their power.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why the Archangels were so much stronger than other ones was because they were created by both their parents while the rest were just created by God alone, using the power of his wife.</p><p><br></p><p>She did love all her children regardless but Helel was getting increasingly frustrated with his mother’s imprisonment and finally left after not being able to convince his father otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did promise that I wouldn’t speak a word about her….till I die. And guess what brother, I did die. Promise kept.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael had a look of realisation on his face and just closed his eyes, facing towards the ground….not even facing us.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need my Haki to feel the helplessness from the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, he was carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>“Michael....today's discussion does involve….this information.” I tried to explain.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked up at me, his blank face returning again but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay….just what are you two talking about? What promise? Who is this ‘she’ you both are talking about?” Azazel asked, having had enough of this.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a look at Michael and he didn’t say anything so I decided to go ahead with it and turned towards Azazel, asking him a question.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many parents does a child have, Azazel?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kokabiel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked around himself at the forces which had gathered to attack the meeting of the Three Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Over a Thousand Fallen Angels and humans lined up, each having their own agenda.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t expected the plan to go so smoothly when he had thought of it but it seems as if the world was helping him too.</p><p><br></p><p>The sudden influx of Fallen Angels from Heaven who had been driven out when Michael somehow worked out the loopholes of the Heaven’s System had been more than eager to lend a hand with the promise that they would get a chance to get even with Michael.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there were the hundreds of Fallen Angels who were destroyed by Uriel during the Great War after the attack on his daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>While Uriel’s rage had scared away most of them, their anger had never subsided even in the past centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, there were the ones from the Church.</p><p><br></p><p>These people hadn’t joined them but had organised a resistance of their own in an attempt to take down the Devil. Most of them consisted of people who had retired from work or left, especially those few monsters among the group.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t sat idle either.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, he received help from someone he wasn’t expecting at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael lent a hand in this attack and who was he to look the gift horse in the mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>A dozen or so Sacred Gear users, including Azazel’s secret weapon going berserk in the middle of the meeting would increase the probability of success of their attack by a large margin.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the vials Satanael had given them and the person wearing the hood who gave him chills with the amount of fighting intent he was exuding.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael had also sent a large group of magicians to help maintain the barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>He had no idea how he had obtained ‘Its’ help or what he intended to do with ‘It’ but he didn’t care.</p><p><br></p><p>As long as the danger to the Fallen Angels can be removed.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the last group was not someone who had arrived at the final moment and this was what gave Kokabiel the confidence of finally being able to take them all down.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the blue haired God who was throwing around spells to lock the surrounding dimension and prevent their enemies from escaping as well as anyone from outside from assisting.</p><p><br></p><p>The mad Norse God had decided to lend his hand because he was annoyed by Odin’s increasing closeness with Lucifer and the alliance between them.</p><p><br></p><p>The insane God was crazy and wanted to bring Armageddon and while Kokabiel might not share his same feelings….there was no requirements for their thoughts to align to get his help.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, he might not admit to it but each and every leader inside was stronger than Kokabiel. He wanted to take them down but he wasn’t a fool to attempt to do that on his own and Loki was a massive help here, especially when his son and grandsons were included when fighting against such monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>The magicians threw around barriers </p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satanael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He stood in the place where he was called for the meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, he was wondering why that man would call him of all people, although he had an inkling, he could never be sure when that person was concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough, a teleportation magic circle lit up the place and out of it came the man.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver hair, blue eyes and a goatee and dressed in black and silver.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim Livan Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha hello there dear Uncle. How have you been? It’s been a long time since we saw each other. The last time was….well we tried to kill each other in the Great War, remember?”</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael just stared at the man without any expression and got directly to the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you need, Rizevim?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oya, directly getting to the topic, I see. No hi, no hello, no asking for my well being? But I guess I understand. You are on the run right now and must be very busy. Don’t worry, I bring good news.” he spread his arms.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t reply and kept staring.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that you have started a new organisation, Chaos Brigade? I was wondering if I could join in the fun? After all, you know, if there is something which I like, it’s causing some good ol’ chaos.” he rubbed his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are not recruiting.” Satanael directly stopped him from speaking further.</p><p><br></p><p>In all these centuries, there was one thing he had known for a face….that nothing good comes from associating with this man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh come on, don’t be a spoilsport! I will be a bad boy, I promise hahahaha. Get it? Bad boy since we are planning to cause a lot of chaos?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing no reply come from him, Rizevim threw aside the joking tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch, no fun. Then how about a deal? A deal of mutual benefit?” He offered and Satanael raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that you wish to find a way to break the limiters of Supernatural races and even Sacred Gears to create more Longinus tier Sacred Gears?”</p><p><br></p><p>He paused for a second and didn’t deny.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim brought out a file from a magical space and threw it at him.</p><p><br></p><p>Malebranche.</p><p><br></p><p>The title on the file.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael opened it and took a look at the contents.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim didn’t stay quiet and explained while he read the file.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dear Dad and his buddies were very wary of the trinkets created by Gramps before the Great War so they did some research of their own and the results of their hard work were these magnificent pieces of art, the Malebranche. Twelve sentient gears, similar to an autonomous type Sacred Gear with the power, each rivalling a Longinus.”</p><p><br></p><p>He read each page and the information matched with everything said by Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>“They could have destroyed their enemies if they had used it in the Great War and even had the chance to win the war but they….sigh….it’s embarrassing to say this but….they were afraid of using them. Afraid that they would lose control and destroy everything. Seriously, how did they even call themselves Satans and be afraid of their own tools? And thus, all these amazing items….could never see the light of the day and let the world see their glory. Unfortunate, right? They went so far to hide their existence that they had sealed them and not even I knew of it and only found out about it by chance recently and have been trying to work on them….with little success. And that’s when I heard about you.” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael looked up from the file, having finished looking at the entire thing and clenched his fist.</p><p><br></p><p>They….did they hold back during the Great War?</p><p><br></p><p>Could he access an even greater power?</p><p><br></p><p>Didn’t that mean that what he had been working to achieve all this time, was already achieved by him….a millenia ago?</p><p><br></p><p>Was he once again defeated by him?</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael gritted his teeth at the mere thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“What I offer is that I provide you with an access to these beauties and in return, I want you to find a way to control them. I would have preferred Azazel but he would never agree so I have to make do with the second best.” Rizevim shrugged, making him glare at the silver haired devil.</p><p><br></p><p>This bastard was provoking him to make use of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael took a deep breath and calmed himself down.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, two people could play at this.</p><p><br></p><p>“You would know about second place, wouldn’t you? After all, you could never surpass him, despite being far stronger than him.” He quipped and felt a hint of pleasure when Rizevim’s face twisted  into a smile and a bit of his power was let loose.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha I take it back about you not being fun. You are probably my favourite Fallen Angel now. So….what do you say, can I join your boy scout group now?” Rizevim smiled, almost ferociously.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael looked at the man and then at the file and clutched at it.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer might have started the research before him but even he couldn’t control these Malebranche so….he will do what even the Devil failed to do. He will completely make these Satanic Arms kneel before him. Since Rizevim wanted to make use of him….he should be prepared to be used by him too.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought, he nodded in agreement at Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha that’s the spirit. Our partnership is going to be gloriously evil. I can’t wait for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Man….I am tired.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Writing the last part while falling asleep on my keyboard.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, a lot of things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Damien organising a meeting of the three Factions and as he knows about the attacks.
