        <p><strong>Isekai Restaurant </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 15: Archdaemon</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>___________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up to the feeling of softness on both sides of my chest. Opening my eyes, I saw blonde and cherry blossom coloured hair in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>On one side of me was Lavy, like usual, in my shirt and on the other side was Shuna, in a thin kimono.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, how did it come to this?</p><p><br></p><p>That evolution had brought a lot of changes to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was hoping Sakura and Lavy wouldn’t notice but I wouldn’t have such useless wishes had I seen myself in a mirror even once.</p><p><br></p><p>My height had increased by an inch and my body was now leaner and sharper than before. The changes might not be obvious for someone who didn’t know me that well but was obvious to someone who knew me even relatively well.</p><p><br></p><p>A few tests showed that my power had increased by leaps and bounds. A Daemon Chevailler wasn’t even in the same league as an Archdaemon.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say that both the girls had noticed the changes the very second they saw me and started fretting over me.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me reassuring them for a full hour before they calmed down.</p><p><br></p><p>They had seen me laying on Shuna’s lap when they returned and so, Lavy of all people invited Shuna to have a sleepover. The real surprise was Sakura actually encouraging her too.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, Shuna had already known about Lavy sleeping with me. She had even seen her with my shirt on my bed so she wasn’t as surprised as the first time but she was embarrassed. I felt a bit awkward too.</p><p><br></p><p>Just yesterday I had confessed to and slept with Lavy and today she was bringing another girl, a girl she knew had feelings for me to our bed.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t kidding about all that yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the blushing oni princess, I couldn’t find it in myself to reject her. It must have taken her a great deal of courage to do something like this. I didn’t want to be a jerk. And it’s not like I didn’t like the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuna was a very pretty girl with a great personality too. If anything I was lucky to have such a girl like me and Lavy actually being supportive of this. Perhaps, Rimuru and Ainz’s words about ‘ the Harem Protagonist’ thing had some basis after all?</p><p><br></p><p>And so, here I was, waking up between two beautiful girls.</p><p><br></p><p>My movements woke both up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhh, is it morning already?” Lavy said before wrapping her hands around my neck and pulling me in for a kiss, something I wholeheartedly responded to.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning, Sil-kun, Su-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>The scene was enough to awaken Shuna who was blushing red by now but she still leaned in and gave me a peck on my cheek.</p><p><br></p><p>“G-good morning, Silas-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning. We still have thirty minutes on hand. If you two want to stay and rest for some time, you can.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it’s fine.” Shuna stuttered so I just wrapped a hand around her waist and hugged her to my side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then just accompany us for some more time.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just nodded shyly and I closed my eyes, enjoying the feeling till I needed to get up for work.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“An Archdaemon is a spiritual being. It’s a qualitative change compared to your previous evolutions.” Milim explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have also heard that Archdaemons are very strong, boss.” Tohru said. She had come in early in the morning to check up on me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you explain in detail?” I asked Milim.</p><p><br></p><p>“In this form, one is as strong as any monster with a Demon Lord Seed. Your case is unique even among Archdaemons. Generally a purely spiritual being cannot stay in our world for long without a body, but you already have that so it allows you to exert your full power unlike other Archdaemons. The second thing is having a name, you got that too. Finally, somehow, miraculously, you have not one but two Demon Lord Seeds. It shouldn’t be possible, you know. How did you get it?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No idea. By the way, how did you know about the Demon Lord Seed thing?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahahaha nothing can escape my eyes.” She replied smugly at my question. “Still, you have almost everything needed to become a Demon Lord. Say, wanna join the council with us? Both Rimuru and you could join. I can recommend you, you know?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, not interested. You don’t seem to have too much fun there, seeing as you stay here all the time.” I retorted, making her blanched.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s not fair. I don’t have such a fun place. It’s not my fault.” She pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“As I said earlier, you’re always welcome here.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, why don’t I sense a connection with you?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Normally, when a stronger being names someone, they risk losing a portion of their power. Obviously, I am very strong so nothing will happen to me hahahaha.” She laughed again, making my eyes twitch. “Naming can make the one being stronger but it also makes a connection between them and their namer. It can have different effects like sometimes making them evolve like in your case or in case of Shuna-chan when she was named by Rimuru. Do you understand this much?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“The one getting named can also gain some abilities from the namer sometimes, although that’s very rare. But one thing almost always happens. The one being named forms a connection with the one naming. In your case, it formed but then broke as soon as you were carried into the Restaurant. Why is that?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, what’s the use of asking me? I didn’t even know about the connection part let alone the part about the connection breaking. Then again, if I had to guess then it would be that the Restaurant removed it. Was it harmful by any chance?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. You were already named by Rimuru so nothing new on that. I will have to ask Guy about it. I don’t have any experience in naming others.” She smiled, making me want to facepalm.</p><p><br></p><p>“If there is nothing to worry about then don’t. Tell me more about Archdaemons.” I asked. I wanted to know more about my new abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are alright I guess. Not that strong but can destroy a country easily. You could probably do far more though with all the extra stuff I mentioned earlier. If you train a bit more, you could evolve again. Or well, I can always name you again. Next time I will ask Guy about them and tell you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll pass for now.” I had evolved twice in close succession. I needed some time to understand and control my power first. “By the way, who is this Guy… guy?” I asked, completely ignoring the fact that she just waved off country destroyers as just… alright. It was not good for my sanity to think about it more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, he is one of the Demon Lords along with me. He is also the first Demon Lord and a Daemon just like you so he should know more about the abilities of Daemons.”</p><p><br></p><p>There were several pieces of information in those sentences which could individually give me an aneurysm but together they felt like I was bashed in the face.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will try to understand my abilities more till then so take your time.  Here, I am done with your order too.” I placed her plate in front of her and she immediately forgot about everything and dove into her food.</p><p><br></p><p>I went to Rimuru’s world and checked myself once more. This time, analysing all the changes. The raw amount of Demonic Power I possessed had increased by several times. The same was the case with my Cursed Energy, it had increased to an absurd degree. I was pretty sure I could rival or even surpass Naruto’s Cursed Energy now, but unlike him, I can control every bit of my power. It also felt like my Innate Cursed Technique had some changes and I can use Water and Ice now. I will have to check that first.</p><p><br></p><p>My new Skills, Flood and Frost helped me control water and ice with a thought. It also increased the power I could exert with the same amount of Demonic Power. The exercises Irene-san had me doing before, I could now do them as easy as breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ice Devil Slayer Magic I used was also far stronger now without any extra effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, that magic was supposed to turn me into a Demon and now I was an Archdaemon. I doubt it gets better than this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe you can go and ask Kisuke. He seemed to know quite a lot about souls.” Rimuru suggested. “I haven’t heard from Ikki either. You can check out how he is doing too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Sounds like a plan.” I nodded. “I was planning to visit Zeref, August or Irene-san to know more, but they are not in Alvarez right now. Also, I don’t know where exactly Jujutsu Academy is so I can’t go there. Kisuke-san seems like a good idea too. He has already invited me several times before.”</p><p><br></p><p>We all agreed to this suggestion and finally done with my work, I took the time to sit with Saitama and Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what’s the deal with you and Lavinia?” Rimuru asked as soon as we were alone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh don’t give me that look. You have both been sharing those sickly sweet looks with each other. I mean sure, that’s usual for Lavinia but what about you?”</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes twitched at his words but it didn’t look like he was going to relent so I confessed. It will come out sooner or later.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two days ago, I asked her out. She accepted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shh! Don’t make a scene.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What the hell do you mean don’t make a scene? You got a girlfriend. We <em>have</em> to make a scene. Remember what you guys did when I was going on that date with Shizuka-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That was Ainz’s idea.”</p><p><br>“You were quite happy to go along with it.” He countered, not backing out.</p><p><br></p><p>We did tease him a lot, especially with him being mistaken as a girl by Shizuka-san.</p><p><br></p><p>In my defence… it was damn funny.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we could say anything else, Shuna came with glasses of juice for us and he became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>She gave me a shy smile, blushing as our eyes met and went back to the kitchen to clean up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi, what was that about?” Rimuru asked, as soon as Shuna disappeared into the kitchen. “You are not stringing her along, are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously not. What kind of guy do you think I am?” I asked, offended.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what was up with that look?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… the thing is…” I explained the whole situation to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Screw you, damn harem protagonist!”</p><p><br></p><p>…The worst part was that I couldn’t even refute his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s it. It’s decided. You are throwing us a party.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“A party. I died a virgin at almost forty years old. Ainz is the same. Saitama…” We looked at the guy and became quiet. He was taken aback at the sudden silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? What do you two want to say?” He questioned defensively.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing.” We replied at the same time and Rimuru turned towards me and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you got two girlfriends in two days. You better give us a treat or so help me…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, fine.” I relented, not wanting him to start causing chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru can be extremely vindictive about the strangest of things… and we <em>did</em> tease him… a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Know what, maybe you should take Lavinia with you on a date to Kisuke’s world since you officially asked her out and all that.” He suggested and I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a good idea. Everyone has been so busy recently that we have had no time to spend on ourselves and we cannot exactly go out in our world as there might still be some supernatural people looking out for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>We also had the Jujutsu Exam in line in a week or two and who knows how long that might take?</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, we finished for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>In the evening, I closed the Restaurant and invited Lavy to go out with me.</p><p><br></p><p>The order of things was already messed up but I wanted to at least let her experience a normal relationship… or as normal as our relationship could get.</p><p><br></p><p>The place where Kisuke lived was called Karakura town.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a normal Japanese town but there was something about this place which made it an ideal place to go on a date - the fact that there won't be anyone looking for a mysterious Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>We spent the whole day having fun together and had our dinner outside. The food from my Restaurant had spoiled any normal food for us.</p><p><br></p><p>The two of us got a bit lost and didn't realise the time. It was night by the time we decided to find Kisuke's place.</p><p><br></p><p>"So, his shop is in this area. The Urahara Candy Shop. Let's look around the area and see."</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p><br></p><p>We walked past a corner and I suddenly felt something flying towards me at a high speed. I reflexively slapped it aside as a wall crashed and I saw the figure embedded into the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>What’s that… a boy?</p><p><br></p><p>"Ichigo!"</p><p><br></p><p>From the other side of the street, a black haired girl cried loudly and came running towards the guy and looked at me menacingly.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I know she was supposedly trying to look menacing but all she looked like was a menacing squirrel with its mouth full of nuts.</p><p><br></p><p>"Who are you people? Why did you attack Ichigo?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Attack is a strong word. It's just that I felt something about to crash into me and reflexively slapped it away. You know, kinda when you feel like a fly or something is about to enter your eyes and you try to slap it away. It wasn’t exactly intentional so it’s more of an accident than an actual attack."</p><p><br></p><p>"You can't slap someone like Ichigo away? You shouldn't even be able to see him." She shouted, offended?</p><p><br></p><p>"Umm why? I have perfect vision (especially during the nights). Also, why can't I hit him? Is he a prince somewhere? Does he own this street? If someone is about to crash into me, potentially push me into the middle of a road and cause an accident, I do believe I have a right to defend myself. Haven't you heard, running on the streets is not good? What do they teach in Middle Schools these days?"</p><p><br></p><p>"I am not a Middle Schooler!" She shrieked.</p><p><br></p><p>"Umm… sorry. Eleme…" I stopped my words looking at her face. “Probably not.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could say anything, we heard a blast of sorts from the nearby street and the girl checked her phone.</p><p><br></p><p>"Oh no, the hollow." She ran towards the boy embedded in the wall. "Ichigo, wake up. The hollow is attacking."</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and let out a sigh. I have been doing this a lot in the last few months. Then again, I wasn't caught in such situations before and neither did I have a multiverse spanning restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>"Lavy, check on the boy. See if a restoration potion works. I will go and see what's going on."</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and went to check on the boy while I turned towards the place where the sound of the explosion came from.</p><p><br></p><p>The noise was coming from a house. The surprising thing was that no one was coming out or even noticing anything wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>There were no barriers around. Were the people of this area so used to these kinds of things?</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke's world is messed up.</p><p><br></p><p>I jumped to the window of the house and saw a half human half serpent ghost kind of thing looking at an orange haired girl while another girl lay on the ground injured.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster jumped and I almost reflexively created ice around it, freezing it in an ice box.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl fell on her butt. I rushed to their side and picked both up and carried the other girl on my shoulder before jumping out of the window.</p><p><br></p><p>The black haired girl from before came in running, carrying the fainted boy on her shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>"Okay, what the hell was that? And why is this guy still down? Didn't the potion work on him?"</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia shook her head. "Sil-kun, these people are apparently Shinigami."</p><p><br></p><p>"Death Gods? No way. They are too weak. Don't get tricked by them, Lavy. I am not good at sensing power but even by my standards, they are too weak. That guy took one slap but hasn't woken up yet."</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy looked at the girl suspiciously. "Are you lying?"</p><p><br></p><p>"What? No. I recently lost my power in an attack. Ichigo is still new at this work. Also, it's that guy who is the freak."</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you calling a freak? I am just a respectable… ah, yeah. My bad.” I realised mid sentence what I really was.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a bang inside the house and the ghost thing came out, blasting a wall.</p><p><br></p><p>I was able to take a look behind and the ice cube was still as it is. How did it get out?</p><p><br></p><p>I created another ice cage around it instantly and looked at the black haired girl.</p><p><br></p><p>"Okay, keep the discussions for later. What is that thing?"</p><p><br></p><p>"It's a hollow. They are spirits which have some leftover wishes and haven't passed on to the afterlife. They become corrupted and become hollows who form that mask on their faces. They attack anything with Spiritual Power."</p><p><br></p><p>"So an evil spirit of sorts. Reminds me of some Youkai. Will it be a problem if I just kill it?" I was pretty sure I could do that. In fact, I could instinctively feel that it was a soul of sorts and that I could literally eat it.</p><p><br></p><p>"No don’t!" It was surprisingly the orange haired girl who said that. And that was not the end of surprises as she walked to the monster and hugged it, apologising.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster's mask broke and a face was revealed and from the girl's words, I knew it to be her brother.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like a freaking anime.</p><p><br></p><p>The now unmasked guy looked at me. "Kill me."</p><p><br></p><p>"No please, don't." The girl cried out again.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn. So troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>The black haired girl spoke again. "He will just become a mindless hollow if he is not purified."</p><p><br></p><p>How do I even purify it?</p><p><br></p><p>I am a devil for fuck's sake. We are beings the furthest away from pure</p><p><br></p><p>Purify?</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly an idea struck me. "Lavy, use the Incinerate Anthem. I don't have any purification Skills."</p><p><br></p><p>She looked conflicted for a moment. She didn’t like using her Sacred Gears normally, but after looking at the girl and then the ghost who was literally begging us, she steeled her resolve and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>She walked towards the guy while I stopped the girl. "Don't worry. She won't hurt him."</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia's body was surrounded by a purple flame as a giant cross appeared behind her. I was feeling chills even now when looking at the flame. It was however far lower than the last time I had felt when Augusta was using the flames.</p><p><br></p><p>Is it because Lavy was new and didn’t know how to use it to Augusta’s level of my own strength? I didn’t know. What I did know was that it was strong and could severely hurt and even kill me.</p><p><br></p><p>I took some distance with the girl as the ghost waved at the girl and closed his eyes allowing the flames to touch him. The flames didn't exactly burn him but rather burned off his monstrous features, leaving a normal human-like soul in its place.</p><p><br></p><p>He waved goodbye to the weeping girl one last time and disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia recalled the flames back.</p><p><br></p><p>"See, he's probably going to a better place." The girl nodded and then fainted.</p><p><br></p><p>…. Now, what to do with this. I turned back to the black haired girl who was looking at us as if we were ghosts. "Say, do you know an address?"</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_______________________________</p><p><br></p><p>"And so we came here." I explained to a rather amused looking Kisuke.</p><p><br></p><p>Turns out that the black haired girl, Rukia knew Kisuke and so did the carrot top, Ichigo.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, apparently, she wasn’t a middle school student but rather someone like Kanna, a hundred plus years old… high school student.</p><p><br></p><p>They healed the girl, Orihime and the carrot top Ichigo.</p><p><br></p><p>"So, we are not in any trouble, are we?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Not really. You could be if you went around without controlling your Reiatsu though."</p><p><br></p><p>"Reiawhat?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Reiatsu, Spiritual Pressure or Soul Power." Kisuke then explained what he was talking about and showed me how to reign in my power.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I wanted to talk to you about this. You see, I encountered something yesterday which kinda made me evolve again.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Evolve? Like the time you fought a war? What exactly happened? Did you get into another war?” He asked, amused.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. “If only it were that easy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh! Something worse than a war then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Although I wouldn’t call it worse. Mildly troublesome at best.” I corrected it when I thought about everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are we talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I met and was named by a Demon Lord. An Ancient Demon Lord who is one of the strongest beings in Rimuru’s world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Demon Lord?” He asked, surprised this time. “Is everything alright there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. Milim is not a bad person. In fact, as I said, she is more like Kanna than anything. The Power of a God and the mind of a child.” I shuddered at the combination.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, that does sound scary. How strong are we talking about?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru was scared by her presence alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>He blanched. “Yes, that’s scary alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, as I said, she is a good person. Mostly just lays around and plays games.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what’s the problem? You said she made you evolve.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. She named me and I evolved from the increased power. I am an Archdaemon now.”</p><p><br></p><p>He brought out a paper fan from his sleeves and covered his face. “Oh my, that’s good news then. Congratulations, I guess?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and was about to speak when a cat walked into the room.</p><p><br></p><p>A black cat, who just took a look at us and then went up and sat on the table.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at the cat and then I looked back at Kisuke and continued.  “The thing is, the evolution to an Archdaemon is a fundamental change. They are Spiritual Beings and there are many things I don’t know about them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I then went on to explain everything Milim told me about Archdaemons and myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you thought I could help you out with my knowledge of souls?” He asked and I nodded. “Well, you have come to the right person. Come, we have so much to exper… um, learn.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi, you were about to say experiment. You totally were going to say experiment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Slip of tongue, Silas-kun. Don’t mind these small things.” He waved his fan with a smile, making my eyes twitch wildly.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s not exactly a small thing, ya know?!</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, we can start with teaching you how to control your Reiatsu. If you continue throwing around any more of your power, it will attract some dangerous things.”</p><p><br></p><p>"Umm, I am already reigning in my power a lot. I learned it because it scared the goblins at Rimuru's village." It's more of a town now though.</p><p><br></p><p>"Really? You are giving off a new lieutenant class to a 3rd Seat Class reiatsu. That's you holding back? You must have quite some juice." The black cat sleeping on the table talked, completely taking me by surprise with the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>It talked?</p><p><br></p><p>And what's with that manly voice?</p><p><br></p><p>"So cute!" Lavinia jumped and hugged the cat almost immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>"Yoruichi is an old friend." Kisike stated as if the talking cat part was already understood.</p><p><br></p><p>No no, explain more about the talking cat part.</p><p><br></p><p>I reiterate again. This world is messed up.</p><p><br></p><p>"Silas?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Oh. Yes. 2% power." I replied absentmindedly.</p><p><br></p><p>"You were holding back 2% power?" He deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>"What? No. I am <em>showing</em> 2% of my power."</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I continued seeing their blank looks, "But then again it's my magic and soul power might be hidden in a different way. I am new to this, can you show me an example?"</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. "I think we should go to the training room first. Kurogane-kun is training there already."</p><p><br></p><p>We went down a flight of stairs into what looked to be a gigantic space, complete with lights and all too.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the space was Ikki… being chased around by two children, one with a baseball bat while the other was a girl with a freaking rocket launcher.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the shopkeeper who suddenly began to seem a lot more sinister to me.</p><p><br></p><p>"Just kids having some fun. Don't worry, we can heal everyone back to full health again."</p><p><br></p><p>…. That doesn't change anything, dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that I noticed something odd. Attached to Ikki's chest was a chain and on the other end of the chain was a body which looked exactly like Ikki's.</p><p><br></p><p>"So you noticed. The chain attaches the body to the soul. In our world, we can train to increase our spiritual power. Since the laws of Kurogane-kun's world binds a <em>human</em>, to bypass them, we simply made him into something other than a human. We temporarily separated his soul from his body and helped him train. It worked too as his Spiritual Power has been increasing steadily. This progress can be maintained even when he returns to his body."</p><p><br></p><p>"The boy is a ridiculously hard worker too. He has never once complained no matter what kind of training we threw at him. Kind of makes me want to train him too." The cat… said.</p><p><br></p><p>I am really having quite a hard time getting used to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Also what was it going to teach him, cat walk?</p><p><br></p><p>“Those chains I had cut back then?” I asked and he nodded in agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>"What are the risks?"</p><p><br></p><p>"He will turn into a hollow."</p><p><br></p><p>'You mean those masked ghost things?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Yes those. By the way, how did you defeat the hollow?"</p><p><br></p><p>"I didn't. Lavy did."</p><p><br></p><p>"Your waitress?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm. She purified it."</p><p><br></p><p>"Purified?"</p><p><br></p><p>"You know, cleanse the soul of their sins, resentment and stuff and send it to the Shinigami Heaven. The Rukia girl told us that the guy will get there."</p><p><br></p><p>"Oh! Did she use her device? I didn't realise that these devices were so similar to a Zanpakuto. To perform a Konso too."</p><p><br></p><p>"She doesn’t have a device. She used her Sacred Gear?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Sacred Gear? Those NotPokemon things? I never got to hear exactly what they were.”</p><p><br></p><p>"Have you read the Bible?"</p><p><br></p><p>"A bit, yes."</p><p><br></p><p>"In my home world, the God of the Bible created a bunch of artifacts and started a lucky draw at birth to incarnate them in a human soul. This was done to give humanity the power to stand against the supernatural."</p><p><br></p><p>"God?" He asked, completely stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>"Yes. There are literal Gods living in my world. I was surprised and shit scared too. What is my life turning into? Demon Lords and Gods…"</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke was the first one to break the silence. "So these Sacred Gears. What kind of things can they be?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Can be anything. From something to give the user an eidetic memory to having the power to kill even Gods."</p><p><br></p><p>“Kill Gods…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, you understand why I am afraid to go out in my world now? There are weirdos roaming about with weapons which can kill Gods and Demon Lords.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me more about them.” He said, this time in a far more serious tone.</p><p><br></p><p>"There are thirteen Longinuses."</p><p><br></p><p>"Like the Spear which killed Jesus Christ."</p><p><br></p><p>"It was the first. These thirteen are weapons of enormous power. They can enable the user to kill gods too… with enough training of course. Even that crazy fire lady who tried to possess Lavy had one of the Longinuses. She just hadn’t been able to use its full power. I was raised by human parents so I don't know much about the Supernatural world, only the things I should stay away from." I made it a point to get to know what to avoid first.</p><p><br></p><p>"How fascinating. So, how did Miss Lavinia purify this hollow?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Her Sacred Gear, the one used by the crazy fire lady, allows her to use the Holy Flames to purify dark beings. It’s actually the cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified."</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I would totally like to see how it works some time but we need to fix your problem first.” He said with a slight nod.</p><p><br></p><p>By then Ikki had fallen down to the ground, fainting so we moved on to him.</p><p><br></p><p>While Ikki was being healed, Kisuke showed me a way to cloak my power.</p><p><br></p><p>"First, why don't you go and stop holding back? Don't worry, this place is sealed tight. No one will be able to detect us outside." Kisuke waved at me. He looked very curious. It reminded me of those crazy scientist types.</p><p><br></p><p>"You sure?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Absolutely." He assured me.</p><p><br></p><p>"Well alright. Lavinia, why don't you take the children a bit away from the area and make a barrier around you all."</p><p><br></p><p>"Okay~"</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. The cat surprisingly stayed on Ikki's head.</p><p><br></p><p>"Ready then. Here I go." I let go of all restraints for the first time since becoming an Archdaemon, the power which could destroy countries, and the place shook.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Yoruichi -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck, Kisuke?</p><p><br></p><p>Just who is this monster?</p><p><br></p><p>This kind of power was something she had only felt once, when she had seen the Head Captain spar against his two disciples.</p><p><br></p><p>Was all that talk about Demons actually true?</p><p><br></p><p>She was having a very hard time maintaining her composure and using her Spiritual Pressure to shield Ikki who was already pressed to the ground from the pressure despite her efforts. Kisuke himself was barely standing. She felt Tessai make a barrier around them and the pressure lightened.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy soon held back his power and everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>"A-alright. Observe me." Kisuke instructed him to control his power after that released his power and slowly reigned it in.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy just nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>"To do this…"</p><p><br></p><p>Before Kisuke could continue, he started reigning his power to near invisible levels just like Kisuke.</p><p><br></p><p>"Is this alright?"</p><p><br></p><p>"... yes. How did you do that though?"</p><p><br></p><p>"I saw you, copied it."</p><p><br></p><p>"Just by seeing me once?"</p><p><br></p><p>"The method was pretty simple."</p><p><br></p><p>"Just out of curiosity, can you try something for me?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Try copying this." Kisuke moved to a different place with a Shunpo.</p><p><br></p><p>Even she was quite interested. To be honest, a large part of her was screaming bullshit at the guy. As if someone could learn to control their spiritual power so easily. Wouldn't that mean that the work they had put all this time was for naught?</p><p><br></p><p>But as if to break her preconceived notions, he appeared several tens of metres away from his place. "Oops, this is a bit hard to control." he then proceeded to disappear and reappear several times around the ground back to the place where he was standing at the beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>She saw the first few steps and the last one was close to a blur for her. He was getting better at a mindblowing pace. "That's more like it. I had to use brute force but this method is much more convenient. What's it called?"</p><p><br></p><p>"This is called Shunpo or Flash Step." Kisuke replied while bringing out a notepad taking some notes. "Interested in learning some more tricks?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Sil-kun seems to be having so much fun." She was picked up by the girl who came with him and she started petting her. "Are you having fun, Yoru-chan?"</p><p><br></p><p>"I didn't know that Silas-san was this strong?" Ikki said while sitting in his place, his face still pale but the light in his eyes was as strong as ever. She observed that he was heaving for breath but his soul was becoming stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, a soul grew stronger the fastest when it was in danger. And feeling that kind of power…</p><p><br></p><p>"Sil-kun is very strong. I don't think I can defeat him even if I used both of my Sacred Gears. Maybe hold him back for a while but not defeat him."</p><p><br></p><p>Yoruichi found herself still for a moment. "You can hold <em>him</em> back for a while?"</p><p><br></p><p>"An hour at best if I could achieve Balance Breaker with both my Sacred Gears. I don't have much Magic Power to sustain the use though."</p><p><br></p><p>"Balance Breakers?"</p><p><br></p><p>"Oh, they are the temporary power upped forms of the Sacred Gears."</p><p><br></p><p>As she talked to the girl, Kisuke continued with his experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the period of the next two hours, he continued to break all of Yoruichi's preconceived notions of being a genius.</p><p><br></p><p>This was no longer a genius. This was a genuine monster.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke helped me learn many spiritual spells from his world called Kido. They were of two types, primarily, which were Hadō for direct attacks, and Bakudō for battle support. There were healing type Kido as well and it was also something I was most interested in.</p><p><br></p><p>My Reversed Curse Technique allowed me to heal my body. I just needed something to heal my soul with.</p><p><br></p><p>There were obviously spells in Rimuru’s worlds but most of them were of Holy nature and we had no one who knew how to cast them, that’s why I wanted to learn Healing Kido. Unfortunately, Kisuke wasn’t an expert in those.</p><p><br></p><p>He did teach me some basic spells though.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Hadō and Bakudō spells were numbered from 1 to 99, the higher the number, the stronger the spell power.</p><p><br></p><p>I was invited to come over and learn more spells later on.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikki seemed to be having fun training there and there was still time before his school reopened so he decided to stay there for training. He said he will go to the Ryozanpaku masters for training after this.</p><p><br></p><p>It was getting late, so we left and went back to our restaurant. But before leaving, I left a card of my restaurant with the girl whose house I had almost destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt kinda bad for her.</p><p><br></p><p>The stay in Kisuke's world was full of ups and downs but at least the candies in his store were something.</p><p><br></p><p>That reminds me, I need other helpers in the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I can ask Nakiri-san since he was the Principal of a Culinary School or something? He could introduce me to some of his students who can help me out. In fact, I needed some new waitresses for my Restaurant too.</p><p><br></p><p>With most of the girls being busy with teaching the Oni and setting up the business. That only left me with Tohru as a waitress.</p><p><br></p><p>“Boss, I heard we are having a party?” My musings were broken by Tohru’s words. She looked excited.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. A week later, we are having a party.” I had earned a lot in the deal with Issac-san and could easily afford to splurge here. “In fact, you can invite your friends if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. Kanna is often with Naruto and the Dojo Masters so she must be missing the other dragon friends too. It will be a good chance for them to reunite and have some fun.” I suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will bring some of my friends too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just make sure they don’t cause any trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me, Boss.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru had also gone out to invite Shizuka-san for the party and I had asked Cid-kun’s friends to invite others too.</p><p><br></p><p>It would be a good opportunity for all the guests to gather and also give me time to prepare everything in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, they could bring their friends and that could increase my customer base.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of this, the door to the Restaurant opened and some familiar figures popped in.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san had come with the orange haired girl, Orihime, the black haired girl, Rukia, the carrot top Ichigo and… Yoruichi.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this the place? A maid cafe?” Ichigo said, looking around the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not a maid cafe, just a simple Restaurant.” I replied. “Tohru, take their orders.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>As Tohru took their orders, I talked with Kisuke-san.</p><p><br></p><p>The orange haired girl called Orihime was looking around the area nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>"Umm, hello." She said, attracting our attention.</p><p><br></p><p>"Hello. Welcome to my restaurant. What will you be having today?" I asked politely.</p><p><br></p><p>"Ano… I… you are the one who saved me, aren't you?"</p><p><br></p><p>"... I am. Are you alright now?" I asked. She had been unconscious when we left so we never got a chance to go back.</p><p><br></p><p>"Ah yes. Thank you for helping me… and my brother." She bowed deeply.</p><p><br></p><p>"It's fine. The… supernatural police of that world would have done that anyway." I said turning towards Rukia and Ichigo.</p><p><br></p><p>"Ohh…" She replied awkwardly, not knowing what to say.</p><p><br></p><p>"So, what will you be having today?"</p><p><br></p><p>"This…" She hesitated.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san spoke on her behalf.  "She will be having a job at your restaurant if you have one."</p><p><br></p><p>"Say what?"</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke went on to explain the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>She was living alone after her brother's death. Her parents had died even before her brother and after her brother's death, she was given an allowance by her aunt who stayed far away.</p><p><br></p><p>The incident that day had caused her house to crash. The landlord was an ass and had evicted her from the place and made her pay for the damage. Partly because there were no culprits found for the incident. Now, that part was taken care of by her aunt but she had reduced her allowance by a lot because she too thought that the girl was making up stories.</p><p><br></p><p>… talk about a messed up situation.</p><p><br></p><p>"So you are looking for a part time job in my Restaurant?"</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed. "Please."</p><p><br></p><p>"Hmm, well alright. The damage was partially caused by me because I interfered in the work of whatever soul police was doing back then. I think I can take responsibility for this."</p><p><br></p><p>I explained to her the schedule. I did need some more staff in the restaurant. It's not like I didn't have any empty rooms. We had expanded both the house and the Restaurant just a week ago.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, Hat-and-clogs, are you sure this is a good place to work? It totally looks like a shady maid cafe and not a good one at that.” The carrot top spoke, making my eyes twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me, what do you mean by ‘not so good maid cafe’?” I asked, my tone calm, as I reigned in my anger.</p><p><br></p><p>Who the fuck did this brat think he was, dissing my Restaurant?</p><p><br></p><p>Even Dragons and Demon Lords had to politely sit in line to be served here.</p><p><br></p><p>“What else? Your Restaurant is obviously empty and even the one waitress is a cosplayer pretending to be who knows what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a dragon, little boy.” Tohru replied, hotly and then looked at me. “Do you want me to bash his face, boss?” Tohru asked, not hiding her anger</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now, Tohru, what have we learned about customer service?” I assuaged her anger and looked at the carrot top. “Tell me, have you ever seen a Restaurant which is always full?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his mouth to reply but shut up again.</p><p><br></p><p>“As for my waitress, as she has already said, she is a dragon. A genuine Dragon. Do you perhaps have a problem with them?”</p><p><br></p><p>To his credit he didn’t say anything and apologised too.</p><p><br></p><p>Rukia on the other hand looked at Kisuke, “But Dragons are…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru-chan is not that kind of Dragon. So don’t worry about it” He reassured her and then explained a bit about this place.</p><p><br></p><p>They ordered. Yoruichi, ordering milk and some fish.</p><p><br></p><p>I went in and cooked their orders while Tohru happily showed Orihime around the place and also the work clothes they were supposed to wear.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, what is Ikki doing?” Tohru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, he was too tired and is sleeping. We will be having a packed meal for him too.” Kisuke-san ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I will get it arranged. Oh, by the way, there is a Party in the Restaurant, a week from now. You are invited and can bring friends too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, that sounds like fun. Did something good happen for you to be throwing a party?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. I signed a big deal with Issac-san and we are also opening a new Publishing House. The Restaurant also had a renovation. Finally, I had a bit of time on my hand and decided to throw a party to share my happiness with everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations! I will be happy to join.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sat down and looked at them as they ate.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Yoruichi was eating with full concentration.</p><p><br></p><p>“One more.” Rukia ordered, her mouth still puffed with food.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“One more of me too.” Yoruichi’s voice sounded before changing her order. “Actually, make it two more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In a minute.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn Kisuke, keeping this place all to yourself. Why didn’t you tell me about this place before?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahaha… well, it’s quite expensive eating out everyday and…”</p><p><br></p><p>“So you were just being a cheapskate. That's it. Silas, pack fifteen, no twenty of these fishes for me. Kisuke will pay the bill.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yoruichi…”</p><p><br></p><p>The banter went on for some time and they left after they were done.</p><p><br></p><p>Orihime will be shifting here by tonight.</p><p><br></p><p>She will be working as a waitress here during the evenings as she had school in the mornings. I agreed as I needed more help in the evenings.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Naruto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And Ninjas can also make bunshin but I can’t do that, ya know. It’s always that crappy bunshin jutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, aren’t there any other jutsu that you know?” Kanna asked him. “We could totally pull a big prank on Kensei-sensei if we can learn it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, not really. I wasn’t able to learn any before coming here, but other kids might know. They had clans and clan people had many jutsu of their own.” He was a bit miffed. By now, he had figured out that he was the son of the fourth Hokage. Although he didn’t understand why his own father would seal the fox inside him, he didn’t want to blame him without knowing his side of the story.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandpa had told him that people had to make hard decisions in difficult times and maybe he had his reasons, especially since he sacrificed his life for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto decided to listen to his words but it didn’t stop him from being miffed about not having any jutsu from his father or… his mother.</p><p><br></p><p>Why didn’t anyone tell him about his parents?</p><p><br></p><p>Even the fox knew of his Kaa-san, then there is no way they wouldn’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>The more he thought of it, the angrier he became but grandpa taught him that the fox would take advantage of his anger and try to take control of him.</p><p><br></p><p>If he became too angry, even his mom and dad’s soul came out and he didn’t want to disturb them in their rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Aghh, this is so annoying.</p><p><br></p><p>He suddenly felt a smack on his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stupid Naruto, don’t think too much or your head will  burst.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghh, Kanna-chan, that hurt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you don’t know any ninjutsu, aren’t there others who do? We can always go and ask them to teach us.” Kanna suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, will they teach us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, Iruka-sensei might but he will probably be mad that I left the academy without telling anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we can just sneak around. Aren’t you a ninja? We can also use magic.” She said as she made lightning spark around her fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We can, dattebayo. I have also learned about the Jujutsu Barrier technique from Nanami-sensei. We can totally use that to hide. It will be like a top secret mission hahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Top Secret Mission, yes.” Kanna-chan nodded too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I also… “</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br>“I also want to find some pictures of my parents.” He said, remembering that he didn’t have anything belonging to them from their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, we can find those too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But what if others find out?”</p><p><br>“We will sneak in.” Kanna said and they quietly made plans.</p><p><br></p><p>Miu nee-chan and Shigure nee-chan were busy and they had a holiday in the academy today. He had even finished his training for today.</p><p><br></p><p>They could totally play around for the rest of the day and no one will say anything.</p><p><br>Finally, it was decided.</p><p><br></p><p>The two of them went to the Restaurant and only Tohru-chan and another pink haired girl were there, playing games. They had their breakfast there and packed some food while Kanna recharged in the Restaurant to her full power.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them waited until it was time for Tohru-chan to eat and then slowly sneaked towards the door.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened the door to his world and snuck out.</p><p><br></p><p>They were suddenly around the same familiar buildings and quickly jumped to one of the rooftops.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna-chan did some magic to hide them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this your world, Naruto?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. See that mountain over there, the faces on them are the ones belonging to the Hokage. My dad is the fourth one.” He pointed to a mountain and took out a camera and clicked a picture of the fourth hokage’s face on the mountain.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm. This world has magic. I can feel it.” Kanna-chan said as she breathed deeply. “Yes. Now, where do we go from here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me show you around the village first, Kanna-chan. We can go to the places where we played. I can also take you to my favourite fishing spot and we can fish there.” He said, as memories of Konoha came back to him.</p><p><br></p><p>He was very happy with his life and wouldn’t leave his new home for anything but Konoha had some good memories for him too and he wanted to share them with his new friends.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, let’s go.” Kanna-chan took his hand and they flew into the air, flying over Konoha and towards the mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>If they had, however, been paying attention, they would have noticed that they were spotted by a small figure with dark blue hair and pearl-like white eyes as they left the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few hours, they went around the spots where Naruto played and even did fishing together.</p><p><br></p><p>Fishing was so much fun when he used his Cursed Techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>The chains could easily catch fish and Kanna-chan just dove into the water and chased the fishes, catching and eating them instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he hadn’t mastered it, he could teleport to places he had marked too. It’s just that, to use it to the fullest extent, he had to summon his dad and he didn’t want to disturb them.</p><p><br></p><p>He had to stop her so that they could fry the fish together and eat.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to visit Teuchi-san and Ayame nee-chan. They were the ones who helped me a lot first. We can also eat some ramen there.” He said, remembering the duo who had fed him ramen for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umu, let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kanna-chan said as she took his hand and they flew into the sky, completely forgetting about why they had come here in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/crossedge" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href="https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’ as promised.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sorry for the delay.
