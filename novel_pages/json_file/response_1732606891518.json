    "content": "<p>“Okay, calm down,” I murmured as I found myself questioning just how long I had been under the rubble. </p><p>Far too long … at least for several hours, and that was assuming my disappearance had triggered intense region-wide news to provide me with a lot of Intent. But that didn’t make sense either … as if such a thing happened, the stadium should have been filled with reporters. </p><p>And, if such a thing hadn’t happened, days had passed as the System slowly recovered the necessary Intent to repair. </p><p>Days that I had spent buried underground, abandoned for dead. </p><p>“Something is wrong. Really wrong,” I murmured as I closed my eyes once more, examining my surroundings. The biggest problem, one that I didn’t pay attention to a moment ago … I could sense the presence of magic all around. </p><p>It wasn’t as intense as the sudden, suffocating wave that had been triggered when Arthur received the warning about the fallen guardian … but instead, it was an even, calm wave that surrounded me like a blanket, easy to ignore. </p><p>“What the fuck had happened,” I asked, but once again, received no answer. So, with a sigh, I started digging myself from the pit I had been buried. Even with my super strength, it was a difficult achievement. I started to dig up slowly but steadily, each second a challenge. </p><p>Trying to dig myself out of a grave was hardly the most pleasant experience I had ever encountered. Slowly but steadily, I continued to push upward, pushing the earth away and kicking off larger pieces of rubble. </p><p>It took several minutes for me to dig to the surface … and I froze again. </p><p>Not because I was in empty ruins of the stadium, which I had been expecting. What I wasn’t expecting was the state of the ruins … overgrown and lush. It showed a lot of time had passed. “Worse, why are those leaves yellow and red?” </p><p>All around me, I could see signs of Autumn … and considering it was the middle of the winter just moments ago — or, what was supposed to be moments ago — it made things even worse. </p><p>“It has been months,” I muttered, looking around in shock, trying to see any sign of human movement. There weren’t any, and worse, the area around me was covered with wild plants and trees. </p><p>With a sigh, I caressed my cheeks, expecting to find a huge beard … but then,, there was nothing. Probably another effect of my Divine Physique, which also accounted for the fact that I didn’t die of hunger. </p><p>“Walk now, speculate later,” I murmured as I started walking toward the main campus area, hoping to find some evidence of what had just happened. There was no real benefit of standing in one place and waiting.</p><p>However, I didn’t make a point of shouting my presence either. It might help me find someone, but I wasn’t entirely sure that it was a good thing. </p><p>Luckily, the intense overgrowth gave me a chance to move fast without being noticed, allowing me to observe my surroundings… And, soon, I noticed the first sign of movement. </p><p>A flying beast. An eagle to be exact, flying over me. It wouldn’t have been surprising, if it wasn’t for one problem. </p><p>The eagle was huge, with a wingspan that was easily surpassing fifty feet, flying fast enough to rival a plane with a propeller. “Like I didn’t have enough evidence to realize that things had been going badly,” I said, but made sure to stay concealed. </p><p>I didn’t know if the huge eagle had anything to do with the absence of humans, but I rather not take the risk. </p><p>“It’s time to experiment,” I murmured as I tried to pull some magic from my surroundings. Unlike earlier, I didn’t have a convenient and constant flow of Intent targeting me … indeed, I wasn’t feeling any. It might be about the fact that months had passed and people had forgotten me, or it might be about the constant magic that surrounded me. </p><p>Unfortunately, it meant that I lost my personalized, easy-to-use source of magic. </p><p>I tried to connect with the energy that surrounded me, but using it directly was much harder than just expanding my senses through my traits. </p><p>Only after several attempts, I managed to grab some, but using it was much harder, like the difference between trying to shape clay and water; the latter rejecting the attempts to force compliance easily. </p><p>I felt a sense of achievement when I grabbed the first bit, which made the mana that surrounded me move wildly. </p><p>A mistake, I realized the moment a doorway of light flickered in front of me. I threw myself behind a door, using the mana I managed to grab as some kind of cloak, with no idea whether it would work or not. </p><p>I expected some kind of monster to step out … which was why it was surprising to see two men stepping out, both dressed in jeans, but a weird style of shirt … and carrying bows. </p><p>“Are you sure they sent us the correct location?” one asked, in English. </p><p>“How should I know, George. We received the order at the exact same time.” </p><p>“No need to be an asshole. Just try to focus. They said they had caught another magical disorder. We just need to make sure it’s not another breach this close to the city. We won’t have time to organize a defense.” </p><p>“How about the blockade? Do you think it’ll work?” </p><p>“Of course not. It’s just the army. It’ll be completely useless. We just need to make sure there’s no breach.” </p><p>“Do you see a giant red door puking out monsters, George,” he asked. </p><p>George looked petulant, yet answered with a soft voice. “No,” he said. </p><p>“Then, there’s no breach.” </p><p>George didn’t look resigned. “Still, we need to be sure. We can’t afford to fail. I don’t want to explain to that arrogant demigod why we have lost another city.” </p><p>“Fine,” the other one said and closed his eyes. As much as I wanted to focus on the information they had inevitably revealed, I was more interested in staying hidden. I focused on the small sense of wave that occurred as he spread his mana, using it as some kind of radar. </p><p>Luckily, my accidental cloak trick worked against it as well, and it bypassed me easily. “Everything is in order —“ he started, but before he could finish, the giant eagle suddenly dived toward them. “I hate this,” he shouted as he raised his bow, and attacked the eagle. </p><p>The moment the arrow left his bow, it turned into a bolt of flame. The eagle dodged it, as well as the following attack, but it was enough to dissuade the beast from attacking. A smart idea considering the lack of alarm the two displayed, treating it more of a pest than an actual threat. </p><p>Soon, another blue gate appeared, and they stepped away. </p><p>Even when they were gone, I stayed hidden for a while, and when I started moving, I chose to crawl away. No need to be caught until I could get a better understanding. </p><p>Their words implied that the city was still in place, and I rather approach it while staying concealed than getting caught by mysterious people with even more mysterious abilities. </p><p>Their concern for the safety of the city was a good sign, but their mention of a demigod was not. </p><p>Not to mention, even if they were some kind of magical police, that didn’t necessarily mean anything good to me. With no knowledge of what was happening, but with magical abilities, I was aware of just how much of a suspicious target I represented. </p><p>And, I had enough life experience to know never to trust law enforcement while looking that suspicious. </p><p>I moved forward, but I wasn’t shocked to find every single college building destroyed, some through blunt force, others by fire. Luckily, the buildings weren’t filled with skeletons, meaning they were evacuated in time. </p><p>Or, at least, that was what I hoped among all possible alternatives. </p><p>I spent two hours carefully walking around, trying to find some kind of evidence of movement, but came empty. </p><p>Pity, I thought as I explored some more, trying to find anything other than broken rubble, only to meet with failure. As the sun started to set, I found myself near my dorm … which had been burnt to a crisp. I wanted to search, but after what had happened earlier, I didn’t dare to try using magic. </p><p>Just as I started looking for a nook to hide, notifications filled my vision. </p><p>[System Repair - Stage II - Complete]</p><p>[DIVINE SYSTEM II</p><p>Traits: (Divine Body I, Divine Mind I, Divine Aura I)</p><p>Domains: (Lust I, Command I, Athletics I)</p><p>Acolytes: (Megan(?))</p><p>Totem Animals: (Black Tortoise [?])</p><p>Intent Pool: 0]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Run faster. No pain, no gain!” I shouted as I looked at more than three hundred athletes filling the football field, running despite their exhaustion, following my orders. “Last lap! We need to be ready for the next matches! We don’t want to lose the game!” </p><p>No player complained. Football players were already used to my unique training method, and while the other players had been shocked at first, they soon learned that complaining didn’t help. Not to me, not to their own coaches… </p><p>After all, it had been three days since the first group training session, even the slowest one had learned about the truth of the matter. </p><p>It was a bit hard to believe it had been almost a week since Coach Juana requested me to handle the physical training of the students … with great benefits, each team showing incredible improvement. Social media was already filled with my training, some admiring my success while others fought against the idea.  </p><p>Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough to complete even a quarter of the repair process. </p><p>[Repair Progress 22.3%]</p><p>Worse, I could feel that the training was responsible for only a fraction of it, and the rest came from the marketing campaign about me — which was getting more and more extensive. </p><p>Megan gained some more notoriety on her own, particularly her rather noticeable lesbian relationship with a famous model, but even that wasn’t enough to push the repair process any higher. </p><p>I couldn’t wait until tomorrow. I had a football game in the morning, one that I would be able to play on both sides of the ball, followed by a basketball game. Together, they should be enough to push the repair process to the halfway point … maybe even more. </p><p>Of course, I was still worried about the possibility of an attack against me and Megan, but it seemed that the responsible parties were not too enthusiastic about following up, likely discouraged after their latest failure. </p><p>Just as I was planning to handle it, I noticed Arthur suddenly rushing away, his expression even more grim than the basketball game. Something was wrong. </p><p>“Take five,” I called the team as I moved back, following Arthur from a distance, careful to stay hidden … but close enough that I could hear the other side. </p><p>“Emergency code eight, the third guardian has fallen, and the fourth guardian is already trying to run away. Quickly, retreat to the safe house,” the voice on the phone said. </p><p>“How is this possible?” Arthur said as he retreated toward his car. Curious, I followed him as well, especially since he was going toward his car. My car was nearby as well. “We expected the great guardian beasts to last for another decade at least.” </p><p>“I don’t know. Just retreat,” the voice on the phone said before ending the call … and I found myself facing a dangerous dilemma. </p><p>Whatever that was going on, it was not good news. Tense, I quickly sent a message to Megan, warning her that something was going on, and that she needed to hide and trust my pet to protect her. I would contact her again once things had been calmed down. </p><p>Then, after some thought, I sent the same message to Coach Juana and Laura… But, it was just a generic message, one that barely managed to warn them. Anything else, I couldn’t explain. At the same time, I rushed inside, pulling a fire alarm. </p><p>It was the easiest way of triggering that. My next aim was to go and take my car, ready to move … but before I could do that, I felt something. </p><p>A wave of energy, thick, almost suffocating. </p><p>Magic, I recognized it, but it was far more wild than the one that I created based on Intent. The moment it surrounded me, I felt like trying to swim for the first time, the panic impossible to suppress. Damn, I thought as I shivered, however even as that happened, I could see several students at the field, suddenly floating, surrounded by some kind of glow…</p><p>I didn’t need to see that to understand that something extraordinary was going on, but it just pushed the absurdity to the next stage. Whatever that was going on, it was good exactly good news. </p><p>I wanted to run away, but at that moment, I had a problem. </p><p>A very unwelcome problem. </p><p>My guide. </p><p>The sudden rush of magic infused the cage I had been keeping contained as well, too intense for me to prevent. It might have been different if I had intervened on time, but without it, keeping her down was impossible. I tried to push her down … but it was impossible. </p><p>Her magic continued to grow inside me, accompanied by the worst pain I had ever felt, pressing against the system. </p><p>“Fortune favors the bold,” I murmured as I reversed the flow … and rather than trying to keep her inside, I pushed her as strongly as I could manage. </p><p>As I pushed her, she appeared out … but for once, she wasn’t ethereal but physical. </p><p>And completely naked, beautiful enough for me to appreciate despite the terrible pain. A pain that didn’t get any better as I felt a sense of tugging, like a metaphorical chain between her and the System. </p><p>A chain that shattered a moment later … and she continued flying up, for once not restricted by the distance, breaking the ceiling as she rushed up. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured as I dodged the falling pieces of concrete, ignoring the giant gap in the ceiling. Unfortunately, the rocks continued to fall. The stadium had been built strong … but not strong enough to handle an angel bursting out of the ceiling in near-terminal velocity. </p><p>More and more rocks fell around me. Worse, the pain was horrible enough to prevent me from running. Even crawling was an achievement. </p><p>I wrapped my arms around my head as I crouched near a large piece of rock, hoping that it would be enough to protect me until someone could dig me out…</p><p>As the pieces of concrete rained around me, the pain continued to increase … and soon, I fell unconscious.</p><p>***</p><p>Waking up with the most horrible headache I had ever felt was not a nice experience … and the fact that I was still buried didn’t make things any better. </p><p>However, I decided to look on the bright side of it. </p><p>I actually managed to wake up … it was far better than the alternative, especially since I was buried under a thick layer of rubble, the weight unmistakable. </p><p>I had no idea just how long I had been underground, but considering no one had managed to dig me up, it shouldn’t be particularly long. I couldn’t even hear any sirens, meaning no firetrucks or ambulances. </p><p>Good enough. </p><p>Even a couple weeks ago, I would have been panicking, but luckily, my Divine Traits helped me to resist the weight far more effectively than I expected. With my supernatural resistance, the layer of rubble didn’t feel any heavier than a thick blanket, and the little gaps were enough to allow me to breathe. </p><p>I could slowly dig myself out, but I stayed put. After all, there was no doubt that many students surrounded the place with their phones out, ready to record the show. And, as much as I loved my fame, bursting out from a thick layer of rubble without any visible damage was too suspicious. </p><p>So, rather than making an immediate move, I stayed put, waiting for the emergency services to arrive. </p><p>A minute passed … then two. “Okay, maybe I should be more proactive and help them find me,” I said as I reached for my phone, which was hardly an easy achievement considering I was still being squeezed by rubble. </p><p>Luckily, my strength was enough to allow me to wiggle and reach for my phone. “Don’t be broken, don’t be broken, don’t be broken,” I murmured as I managed to drag it … only to see a blank screen. “Fuck.” There was no visible damage, but it didn’t turn on. </p><p>Not exactly a convenient situation. </p><p>Helpless, I continued to wait. Another minute, but there was still no movement. </p><p>“What the hell is going on,” I said as I closed my eyes, trying to expand my senses. Not my hearing, but my magic. Hopefully, whatever damage my bitchy guide had created didn’t prevent me from using magic. </p><p>Luckily, it did not. </p><p>Unluckily, I failed to sense anyone in my immediate surroundings. I continued expanding, covering the stadium … yet once again, there was no one. </p><p>“Maybe they evacuated,” I thought as I continued expanding the area. Surely, as I expanded, I could sense more. </p><p>I failed again, even as I expanded the radius to a mile. </p><p>“Maybe my System was damaged somehow,” I thought as I reached into my system, and met with three notifications. </p><p>The good news, my System was still working. </p><p>Bad news … I might be under the rubble more than I expected. </p><p>[Repair - Emergency Repair - Complete]</p><p>[Repair - Phase Two - Complete]</p><p>[Recovery in Progress…]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The party had lasted until the first lights of the morning, with every single noble getting completely hammered with the magically reinforced wine that was served without a stop. </p><p>Of course, not one to miss an opportunity, I used that Charisma trick to sell the idea of expanding Silver Spires by allowing peasants to attend. Of course, some believed that it would help them profit by getting more mages, while others believed that such a trick would support their houses. Some even believed it was an attack against their political opponents. </p><p>Ultimately, their reasons didn’t matter. The important thing was, they were quite a bit convinced by the genius idea of the prince — who finally declared his plan toward the end of the night, when he was utterly drunk — much to the consternation of his steward. </p><p>However, I didn’t care about that as I once again entered the cart they assigned to me, and started traveling back to the capital. After an evening of dealing with an annoying number of nobles, I wanted to do something actually productive. </p><p>Like starting to forge the weapons I ‘promised’ to the fourth prince. Hopefully, by pushing servants as well, I would be able to hasten their distribution. Oeyne should be able to discover that if she was free. If she was not … well, that was something for the future. </p><p>For the moment, that was the best I could do before I could establish a proper spy organization. Which was simply impossible to do quickly. Maybe, as I ‘proved’ myself to the prince, I would be able to get in contact with the royal spies, giving me a chance to subvert their organization. </p><p>Too bad I was simply too busy to poke around them. </p><p>As the carriage moved, my mind was already on how to forge those weapons … when I felt a movement outside. The assigned bodyguards were moving … six of them suddenly burst into action, and killed the other two. </p><p>I used my magic to observe their performance, trying to see if they could actually threaten me. </p><p>The answer was … they could not. </p><p>Still, I gathered some mana from the Aether dimension and created an invisible ward underneath the carriage that was ready to explode outward just in case. </p><p>At the same time, I pulled out my hammer and kicked the door open. “What’s going on, you cowards,” I shouted, but seeing I was facing six, I stayed tense and defensive. </p><p>“No need to panic, Grandmaster,” one of my supposed bodyguards said with a large, threatening smile. “We’re just going to have a nice talk and nothing more.” </p><p>“Interesting way of inviting me for a talk,” I said, doing my best to look panicked and intimidated by the sudden reversal. Though, I was more interested in the implications of the sudden attack … the residence of the fourth prince must be filled with an incredible amount of spies for six of my eight assigned bodyguards to work for his enemies. </p><p>Likely his brothers. </p><p>Of course, even as I faked a scared look, I made sure not to make it too exaggerated. After all, I was supposed to be a high-level warrior who climbed without any help, even with my blacksmith skills dragging me down. </p><p>I couldn’t just act as a coward … luckily, they didn’t seem to be expecting that. “First of all, Grandmaster, let me apologize for the inconvenience,” he had said as he passed a pouch to me. Curious, I opened it, only to find some very precious crafting material. </p><p>If their magical signature was accurate, they belonged to Class Twenty-Five beasts. </p><p>“Certainly enough to justify some discomfort,” I said as I leaned back slightly, making a show of being impressed. With my magical prowess, finding and hunting such beasts wasn’t a trouble, but for a mere Grandmaster blacksmith, it was an incredible gift. “Now, tell me what you want.” </p><p>“Your reputation for directness is not unfounded, Grandmaster,” he said with a chuckle. I shrugged.</p><p>“I’m too busy with my business already without all this pointless royal politics, especially between different princes,” I said, the slight tightening in his eyes confirming that my guess was accurate. </p><p>They were working for one of the other princes. </p><p>“And, how happy are you to gain the support of the fourth prince,” he asked. </p><p>“Support, what support?” I said with a chuckle, dismissive. “I have dealt with enough nobles to know that he wouldn’t care about me the slightest if he didn’t need me.” </p><p>“And, what does he need you for,” the spy tested me, but I just raised my eyebrow in amusement. “We’ll make sure to suitably reward you, of course.” </p><p>“And, treating me as an idiot is not a good start,” I said. “You should be already aware of what he asked me for. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have revealed yourself in that way.” </p><p>The spy was surprised at my bluntness. “You’re more aware of the political landscape than you show,” the spy suggested. </p><p>“No, it’s just not as complicated as you all seem to. That bunch of useless nobles is no different than a bunch of blacksmiths that received their business from their fathers, trying to jockey around,” I explained, deliberately giving a cynical yet accurate analysis. </p><p>Ironically, I couldn’t just brainwash a spy … well, I could, but it wouldn’t be effective. Their handler would easily notice the sudden discrepancy in their behavior. Unlike them, a Prince had the right to be stupid and willful, allowing such behavior to slip under notice — especially since the plans were halfway reasonable. </p><p>Instead, I needed to show myself as a capable partner. </p><p>It worked, as the spy activated a silencing ward around us, even keeping the others silent. “And, are you willing to help the prince repair that mysterious weapon,” the spy asked me directly. </p><p>“Fuck no,” I answered, and the spy looked surprised. </p><p>“That’s a more dedicated response than I had been expecting,” the spy said. </p><p>“Do I look like a moron? He’s asking my help to repair some kind of mysterious weapon that he believes to be completely secret. Unless the royal family suddenly lost all of their resources, there should be some blacksmiths at least half as good as me,” I explained, not neglecting to brag about my abilities. </p><p>It was not a bad idea to give the impression that I could be easily manipulated by my professional pride. </p><p>“But you still accepted,” he countered. </p><p>“Well, it’s because he’s using tens of thousands of weapons from me to be distributed all along the Empire, and the more he distributes it, the harder it would be for me to just disappear. Once it’s finally time to repair, I’m just going to reject the offer,” I explained, giving him my ‘plan’. </p><p>Naturally, I didn’t need to see his mocking smirk to know it was a stupid idea. If a prince was angered personally, no amount of reputation would save an ordinary blacksmith from death … either officially, or through assassination. </p><p>“And what if we give you a different offer,” the spy suggested. “A better one.” </p><p>“Naturally, I will be interested,” I said. “Naturally, the price has to match the job.” </p><p>“We want you to take the job to repair the weapon, but instead steal it for us. Don’t worry, we’ll send reinforcements to make sure you can get away safely.” </p><p>“Interesting offer, but I need to make sure you can’t simply get rid of me. First, I want whoever supporting you to order even more weapons from me, and distribute them all around the Empire, and each weapon has to carry my mark.” </p><p>“Acceptable,” the spy said. “But the fourth prince will not be delayed for long.” </p><p>For a moment, I thought about talking about the plan to expand Silver Spires and how the other princes should steal his thunder … but after some consideration, I decided against it. It was not something a blacksmith should be caring for. “That’s your job as a spy,” I said. “I’ll do my job, and you do yours. Just be aware that, I won’t accept repairing that weapon unless my reputation is spread across the Empire.” </p><p>“You drive a hard bargain,” the spy countered, acting like I had received a big concession from them. </p><p>In actuality, I did not. After all, distributing thousands of high-quality weapons to their key supporters in a visible manner was not exactly something harmful.</p><p>“I’m guessing that’s all. I’ll be waiting for your order from official channels. And, don’t forget to supply me with enough materials as well, as the guild is already being annoying.” </p><p>The spy just chuckled as he pulled back, and the carriage started moving once more. They still had to explain the death of the two bodyguards, but it was their problem. I said nothing else as they escorted me back to my base. </p><p>The moment I arrived, I gathered all my newly hired apprentices and started forging, making a show of rapidly finishing a huge number of short swords with the help of my new apprentices. At the huge forge I had built, twenty forging apprentices were responsible for continuously melting the metal, while on the other side, thirty of them were responsible for putting the finishing touches. </p><p>And, in the middle, I was able to quickly forge every piece of hot metal they had prepared into short swords, each slam of my hammer infusing the monster parts into metal in a very specific way — and at the same time, hiding the short yet intense burst of mana I infused. </p><p>At the same time, I was planning exactly how to spread the gossip about the fourth prince’s genius idea of turning Silver Spire into a school for peasants and expanding it significantly. Naturally, disguised as spies of various forces. </p><p>Hopefully, the combination would be enough to make contact. </p><p>All that remained was to show patience. </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 33280}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>As we arrived at the courtyard, I felt the wards settle over me, giving me a sense of suppression. Not because they were particularly strong, but because I didn’t appreciate the sensation of being under the wards that weren’t under my control. </p><p>The fact that they assumed I was magically insensitive made it worse. They didn’t even bother adjusting the intensity, giving me a sense of suppression, tempting me to break them. </p><p>I ignored the weight along with the servant that led me inside and instead focused on my surroundings … particularly the guards, making sure that there was no one that could threaten me like an undercover Eternal soldier.</p><p>Luckily, it seemed that their entanglement with the royal family wasn’t at the level of filling the residence of every prince. Maybe they had a few spies, but no one that they bothered to empower. </p><p>Good, I thought as walked through the official entrance, the inner wards parting as well, allowing me to effortlessly bypass the strongest part of the defenses. As I passed them, an upbeat melody reached to my ears, marking a celebration. </p><p>The servant continued to escort me, and I noticed the nobles filling the place. I looked rather absurd among them, my blacksmith outfit contrasting greatly with the rich nobles that filled the place. I looked like a barbarian among them. </p><p>Naturally, I noticed more than one mocking whisper about my clothing … though they made sure to keep that whisper down. After all, I also represented an important source of high-quality weapons, hence my invitation. They didn’t want to lose such a great opportunity just in case. </p><p>Soon, they led me to a garden, one that was filled with a lot of noble guests, and even more servants keeping them well-fed while dancers and musicians kept them entertained. </p><p>At the center, there was the prince that invited me. To my surprise, rather than waiting for his servant to lead me to him like it was appropriate, he jumped up to his feet and walked toward me with quick steps. “And, the guest of honor of today’s party is finally here,” he declared loudly. “The courageous blacksmith that dared to strike against the suffocating dominance of the blacksmith guild!” he greeted. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smile as the prince greeted me in such an explosive manner. It was a great honor, to the point of being absurd … meaning he needed something important from me, important enough to greet me with such aggression. </p><p>Interesting. </p><p>“My Prince,” I said, giving a slight bow … one that was far too weak to be respectful to a royal, especially coming from a peasant, even a high-leveled one. </p><p>Immediately, I noticed several frowns around, but the prince managed to hide his distaste quickly as he led me toward a table that was occupied by about a dozen noblemen and noblewomen who were resting, enjoying wine and food. </p><p>Most of them were unfamiliar, and some I recognized from my research. None of them were particularly important, meaning the prince didn’t call any of his important supporters, not wanting to insult them with my presence. </p><p>It would have been quite a hidden insult if I cared the slightest. Instead, I listened as the prince rattled over my ear for almost an hour, while I listened to his nonsense. Luckily, the food was enjoyable — even though once again, they went for the flash rather than quality, assuming I was easy to trick. </p><p>My job got even easier. </p><p>Finally, he gestured to a servant, and they led the other guests away, leaving me alone with the prince. “I need your help for a topic that’s vital for the fate of our country, Grandmaster,” he said, once again exaggerating his compliments. </p><p>“What exactly do you need, my prince,” I said, but even as I did so, I reached his soul space and subtly suppressed his stats. </p><p>Not that it was difficult. He was merely level twelve. His stats were unnaturally high, but that was to be expected with the potential knowledge of the royal family. However, I didn’t push my Charisma yet. “I need your help repairing a weapon,” he said. </p><p>“There’s no weapon I can’t repair,” I declared. </p><p>“Good to see you’re confident,” he declared, relaxing visibly as I accepted the task. </p><p>“I can just take it with me. I promise you that it’ll be repaired in a week at most,” I added, feeling free to promise. It was easy to promise things when I didn’t expect to actually fulfill them. </p><p>The prince had a sheepish expression, one that he did his best to look casual, but I could sense a sudden tenseness. “Unfortunately, that would not do. The weapon we have to repair is a secret treasure, and you have to visit it.” </p><p>“That’s acceptable, but that means I have to first stay in my new business and make sure everything is in order, my prince,” I said, finally pushing the magical weight of my stats against him, and he immediately looked dazed. </p><p>Privacy wards around us had some defensive features to block me from using my Charisma aggressively, but interfering with those defensive features was even easier than temporarily suppressing his stats. </p><p>“It’s … problematic,” the prince admitted, dazed. “It’s really important for that weapon to be repaired. It might be the key to putting me on the throne.” </p><p>“What kind of weapon are we talking about, my prince?” I asked, even though I already guessed the answer. </p><p>“A spear,” he replied, and immediately, the memory of a broken spear popped into my mind. It seemed that the fourth prince had some substantial benefits from the attack against my girls.  </p><p>“Very good, my prince. I can repair it, but before I can justify my lengthy disappearance, I need to set up my operation. How about if you put me a hefty order. Maybe something like ten thousand weapons.” </p><p>“What would I do with that many weapons?” he asked. “I can’t even afford such a huge order.” </p><p>“It will be only good for your eventual bid to the throne if it’s known that one of the royal princes cares about the ordinary citizens of the public,” I said, as I did so, I started to increase the pressure on the Charisma, but with it, started to add several spells to further muddle his thinking. </p><p>The spells were hard to cast, pushing my capabilities to their limits, but I needed them to convince him of my words. “I sincerely believe that you care about us peasants, my prince. It’s why I, a peasant blacksmith that had risen from nothing, is supporting you with all my Strength, enough to forge ten thousand weapons for free so that you can build up your reputation against your brothers, and gain the throne.” </p><p>The spell and my words were calculated. Even with the spells, I couldn’t just brainwash him to actually care about the peasants. However, it was possible to quickly convince him that he managed to successfully tricked me into that fact. </p><p>Therefore, he wouldn’t suddenly find it suspicious that I started to support him with a lot of free weapons. </p><p>“Of course. You’re one of my greatest supporters because you believe in my true cause,” he quickly answered, even his dazed state unable to prevent him from lying to increase my support. “And, you’re right, visible support to peasants would help my cause,” he said. </p><p>In that moment, I enhanced the pressure even more, and put him in a trance. “However, you have to do something striking for your sudden support against the peasants to be convincing. Why not sponsor a sudden influx of new magical students from all corners of the Empire? That way, everyone will be excited for a new Emperor that actually cared about his citizens.” </p><p>“Hmm,” he hummed, too dazed to say something as I did my best to push that idea into his subconsciousness, repeating it again and again. This part of the trick, I was using for the first time, so I wasn’t particularly sure how effective it would be. </p><p>But it couldn’t hurt. </p><p>Hopefully, it would work and he would start pushing for more peasant intake for Silver Spires quickly, which would give Helga a much better source for Knowledge Spark. </p><p>I slowly lessened the pressure once more. “Now, my prince. Let’s focus on exactly how can I support you by providing you with all those weapons,” I said. “I can deliver at least five hundred weapons a day, maybe even a thousand if you can help me resolve my problem of acquiring high-quality metal ores…” </p><p>With that, our private meeting turned normal. Soon, we came to an agreement that I would stay and supply him with endless weapons that he would distribute toward the locations that were struggling most with the monster attacks, and in a few weeks, I would move to that secret base to repair that mysterious spear. </p><p>Naturally, he didn’t mention anything about Silver Spires, but when I mentioned it, he just smiled smugly like he had a genius idea. </p><p>With that, the first step of my plan was complete. Now, I just needed to return to the capital and start working. </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 33280}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>As she watched her boss’ sister rush toward her with anger, Sakura wanted to follow her first instinct and apologize. Only the presence of Darion behind her stopped her. Not because she expected him to protect her … but because she was frozen after getting squeezed between two direct aspects. </p><p>What if he got angry if she tried to argue. As much as Lily scared her — mostly due to her sister’s power — it was nothing compared to the sheer desire to obey that Darion awakened in her. </p><p>That didn’t mean she was happy by the way Lily grabbed her neck and pulled her away. “You bitch, how dare you,” she growled in anger. </p><p>“I’m … I’m sorry,” Sakura apologized, giving the easiest and most convenient answer she could deliver. The moment she noticed Darion’s mocking smirk, she wished she could say something else, but her instincts to obey were simply too strong. </p><p>And she hated herself for it. </p><p>“Do you even know what you are sorry for, you blue-haired whore,” Lily growled, roughly forcing her to turn. She faced the cafe, mostly naked. “You’re lucky that we don’t have a guest that could watch your humiliation,” she added. “Now, tell me, what are you sorry for?” </p><p>Lily froze. She realized the answer she had been expecting, but it was not one she could give. She was not sorry by the way she got caught … as she was obeying her real boss during that. She was just sorry that she had to suffer a direct confrontation. </p><p>Nothing else. </p><p>She didn’t know if Lily was trying to date or seduce Darion … but it didn’t matter. It wouldn’t have even mattered if they were married. “Speak, you little whore,” she growled, her anger getting thicker. </p><p>Ironically, that made Sakura less likely to actually follow her command. The shift in her tone reminded Sakura that Lily was not Mia. She wasn’t her boss who could cut her down with just a word and destroy her sense of worth … </p><p>Lily was just a petulant child. </p><p>As that realization hit, she caught Darion’s gaze, watching the show with a rare smile, clearly enjoying her struggle. A struggle that she didn’t need to lose, Sakura suddenly realized. </p><p>As she realized that, however, Lily started to act even rougher. “I asked you a question, bitch,” she growled, trying to replace her lack of control with physical violence … too bad it had even less of an effect on Sakura. </p><p>She was not bad in self-defense, and her weak grab was nothing compared to some of the hits she received during sparring. It was her habits rather than her lack of physical capability that prevented her from resisting while Lily pushed her down to her knees. “Stay there and sulk if you’re not going to speak,” she ordered. </p><p>Lily wanted to stand up and resist. She was even determined as she shifted, but once she looked up to see her confident pose, that determination died quickly. “Lick my feet if you want to apologize,” she ordered. </p><p>Sakura fidgeted under her gaze, but managed to resist … for a total of three seconds. Then, her hands rebelled, and she grabbed her feet and delivered a soft kiss to the topside of her foot. </p><p>“Show your enthusiasm,” Lily ordered, giving her a good, long stare. Sakura could see that she was shocked by her obedience as well, but pushing happily as she failed to order. Sakura continued kissing her feet. </p><p>“That’s enough dilly-dallying. Now, let’s go to your real punishment,” Lily ordered, but her voice was already panting, showing her desire as she pulled her toward her wet lips. Sakura started licking … ironically, every moan Lily let out weakened the hold she had over Sakura. </p><p>She was about to get free from her incompetent dominance…</p><p>Any moment now.</p>",

    "title": "Accidental Villainy 4 - Tara POW",
    "content": "<p>As she stepped out of the shower, the strongest emotion Tara was feeling was confusion. At least, she hoped that it was confusion, and decisively ignored the chance to ponder on it further. It didn’t like she had the proper experience to assess things. </p><p>Not when she had lived most of her life in a boring routine. Growing up on a ranch only with her mother was simple. She just needed to follow her orders, and everything would be alright. And, once she awakened, things got even better … though she never let her mother learn that. </p><p>Her only rebellion, keeping her awakening secret. But she had long learned that finishing her work early would have only gotten more work from her mother, who believed that idleness was the root of all evil. </p><p>So, keeping her strength hidden allowed her to use her strength to finish her work in minutes and sneak into the barn to read. Pity she couldn’t have done that at the bar, which stretched the work that could be finished in minutes into hours. </p><p>Though, thinking that, a blush covered her face. She couldn’t help but feel self-conscious about the way she looked after her prospective boss arrived, feeling self-conscious about the way she looked. </p><p>Of course, he was right, a bra was nothing. It covered just as much as a conservative bikini that everyone seemed to wear at the beach — at least that’s what the movies showed, she was yet to visit the ocean in person — and many female heroes had even smaller costumes. </p><p>Yet, she couldn’t help but feel shy as she put on her towel, glad that the mirror was still steamy. She wasn’t particularly tall, but the towel was barely able to keep everything in order. “It’s just normal, Tara. Don’t be a hick,” she murmured, trying to convince herself as she reached and opened the door. </p><p>She didn’t want to act out against the first person who seemed to be willing to give her a chance. </p><p>It didn’t long for her to lose the farm after her mother’s demise — days, as it seemed her mother had accumulated quite a bit of debt — and the little money she had was barely enough for her to afford a room at a terrible motel. Worse, her cash reserve was dwindling even further. </p><p>She needed this job … at least until he decided to actually require a power test. </p><p>“Don’t be shy,” she murmured as she grabbed the handle, doing her best to put on a calm demeanor. Unfortunately, that determination only lasted until she stepped out, accompanied by a wave of steam, and saw her new boss. </p><p>And she froze. Luckily, he was looking the other way, giving her a chance to recover her demeanor. </p><p>She could do it. </p><p>She took a deep breath for courage … and then stopped to fix her towel to prevent an accident. “I … sir,” she whispered. </p><p>He turned toward her, and for a moment, she expected him to make some vulgar comment like the men on the street, but he did not. He just looked at her face, like there was nothing out of the ordinary. </p><p>There wasn’t. She just needed to act like a city girl. </p><p>“So, your clothes need another hour at least to dry,” he said, and she nodded, unable to meet his gaze. “Let’s use that time to test you about being a waitress.” </p><p>“D-downstairs?” she found herself asking. </p><p>“No need. Here’s fine,” he said, and she relaxed. “Now, grab this tray and walk back and forth. I want to see if you can walk without dropping anything.” She looked at him in surprise, but saw nothing but casual professionalism, silently telling her to act professional. “Now,” he added, his voice stiff. </p><p>And just like that, she reached for the tray. </p><p>“Now, I want you to start walking back and forth,” he said. She did so, but before she could even cover half of the distance, he called her again. “Stop, you’re doing it wrong,” he called. </p><p>She found herself blushing, suddenly self-aware. How could she screw up walking? He walked next to her, and made a gesture. “Imagine that there’s a line here, and make sure you’re stepping on that line with each step, and make sure your steps are slow and measured…” </p><p>She followed that, still feeling confused. Luckily, he must have felt her problem, because he followed it with another order about swaying her hips. Then, another one about her stride length, her pacing, the way she held up her head. </p><p>Each other put her in a more comfortable space. It was much easier to just follow them without thinking. For the first time since her mother’s loss, she felt like the world wasn’t overwhelming chaos. She just needed to follow the directions… </p><p>“Stop,” he called once more, and she followed it immediately, still holding the tray up, but this time, she wasn’t panicking. After all, she managed to follow every single order he delivered perfectly, with no need to repeat. </p><p>She trusted him to have a reason. </p><p>“Now, let’s fix the smaller details,” he said as he put his hand on the small of her back. His touch was electric, and she felt her back arching reflexively. And, just like that, confusion was back, even though it was for a different reason. </p><p>It was bad. </p><p>She surrendered to her daze as he pushed her around in the room, though this time, her attention was on his fingers, climbing along her spine. “You need to be better,” he whispered. </p><p>“You’re right. I need to be better, sir,” she whispered. “Please show me how I can be better.” </p><p>“Close your eyes, and don’t move,” he ordered. She shivered as his order hit her ears, realizing that there was something different in his order. Something dangerous. </p><p>Nothing physical. It was not something she feared since she had awakened — except the fear of finding herself in the middle of a battle of supers — but something different. Something personal. She was supposed to stop and leave. </p><p>Yet, she still followed his order. It was easy. </p><p>Comfortable. </p><p>“Don’t drop your tray, and don’t open your eyes, no matter what,” he ordered.  </p><p>She felt apprehensive, but she ignored it when she felt his fingers touching her empty arm. Her right hand, which she held the tray, trembled, but nothing happened. </p><p>“Good girl,” he whispered, and she trembled even worse, but he ignored it as he caressed her arm, climbing up to her elbow first, then her shoulder. </p><p>His touch made her feel things, things that she wanted more of. His other hand landed on her thigh, climbing up, caressing the outer side of her legs, fueling those confusing feelings further. </p><p>And further, when he arrived at the line that was created by her tiny towel … and stopped. She suddenly felt bad, like she missed something great, but it turned out to be a prelude to something even more confusing. She took a panicked breath… </p><p>And her towel started to loosen once more. However, this time, before she could even reach to fix it, he spoke once more. “Don’t move.” </p><p>So, she did not, even when she could feel her towel slowly unraveling, slipping down. Just a fraction of an inch at first … then an inch … then, just like a dam being breached, slipping free and hitting the floor. </p><p>Just like that, she was naked. For the first time in front of a man. Her insecurities flared, waiting for him to ask her to cover herself, that she was too ugly to be looked at. He did not. Maybe she was ugly enough that he didn’t even need to say. </p><p>She bit her lips, trying to ignore the confusing flood by focusing on his fingertips, once again climbing across her back, dancing over her spine, leaving tracks of fire. The sensation helped her to ignore the self-consciousness of her blatant exposure. </p><p>Ridiculous as the feeling was, she did not want to let it go, even when it climbed back to her neck, then to her collarbone.  </p><p>When his fingers started dropping down once more, she realized that it reached a point where she should ask him to stop … but he asked her to stay silent, and it was easier to follow that order than to take a decision. </p><p>His fingertips reached the edge of her breasts, dancing gently, slowly creating a spiral, driving closer and closer to the center … until his fingers pulled back, and landed on her nipple with a flick. </p><p>And, just like that, the tray slipped out of her hand. “I’m sorry I failed, sir,” she gasped, expecting an expression of anger. </p><p>Yet, she found an expression she couldn’t read. “Are you really?” he said. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said, nodding enthusiastically. </p><p>“Good,” he said as he walked to the mattress and sat down, then patted his lap. “Come here, and lay down.” </p><p>So, she did.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I approached Tara, I was getting more and more confident that she didn’t have any kind of enhanced senses. If she had any, she would have reacted before I stood behind her, just outside her kicking range and behind a table — in case it was her shocked response — watching her as she aggressively scrubbed the fryer with a reinforced sponge. </p><p>Watching her, I could see that she had super strength — as it would have been impossible to get rid of the age-old marks without it — but that was not it. Her control was also impressive, not damaging the device slightest. </p><p>Of course, that clearly didn’t apply to some kind of supernatural grace, as I noticed the shirt she was wearing at the side, the front of it washed after some kind of cleaning accident. A happy one, giving me an amazing show to be entertained. </p><p>Not a bad power set, I thought, but it was a momentary thought. The way her bosom swayed during her enthusiastic scrubbing was too fascinating not to pay attention. Her bra was large and plain, but with her surprisingly large breasts, it wasn’t enough to prevent the situation an incredible show. </p><p>All she needed to do was to straighten her hair and get rid of her ugly glasses, and she would be the top attraction in an upscale strip club. </p><p>I waited until she was holding the old bucket rather than the old — yet still too expensive to replace — fryer when I spoke. “I see that you’re working hard,” I said suddenly. </p><p>She gasped in shock as she turned toward me, her breasts swaying. For a moment, I hoped that her bra would fail, but that didn’t happen. </p><p>Unfortunate. </p><p>“S-sir,” she gasped as she raised her arms to cover her chest, doing her best to keep them covered … with moderate success. </p><p>Pity. </p><p>“Excellent work. I can see that you can work without supervision incredibly well. It’s certainly a big advantage in your favor,” I said, acting like I hadn’t noticed she had cleaned better than a professional team. She was clearly naive enough to miss the implications, and I preferred to act just unaware in order not to reveal I had caught her secret. </p><p>However, as I talked, I met with another surprise. Rather than reaching for her shirt, she stayed frozen and hesitant. “T-thank you, sir,” she whispered. </p><p>“Good, continue cleaning,” I said, curious whether that hesitancy would hold as I took a step to the side, blocking her path to her shirt accidentally. She bit her lips as she sent a fleeting glance, but no move to reach it over me. </p><p>Or even ask it. </p><p>Instead, she just picked up my clue about her state of dress being normal, and turned her attention back to the cleaning. </p><p>Blushing furiously in the process. </p><p>Fascinating, I thought, biting my lips to hold back laughter once she turned her back to avoid my gaze. She must have been even more sheltered than I had first assumed based on her looks and her attitude. </p><p>A good reminder to me about my powers not being perfect, but I ignored that in favor of focusing on the way tits swayed. Their movement wasn’t as enthusiastic as before as she tried to control her movement, but the added color from her shy blush more than compensated for it. </p><p>While she cleaned, I placed my purchases in the fridge, curious whether she would dare to reach her shirt. It took another minute for her to gather that courage … just enough for me to gather mine to push my powered temporary employee more. </p><p>Before she could grab her shirt, I did. “Let me clean it properly. This is the least I could do,” I said as I took it away to the apartment upstairs — empty except for a solitary mattress, but with running water — and used the shower to drench it completely before leaving it to dry. </p><p>Another test of her obedience, one that she functioned excellently. She was still cleaning the fryer, her blush getting thicker. </p><p>It was already the limits of my courage if it wasn’t for my ability, but even as I pushed her, I could see that she had no intention of resisting. Together with the latent danger, it tempted me even more. </p><p>“Let me help you with cleaning,” I said. </p><p>“N-no need,” she whispered, but that was all she was able to say as I started helping her. From close quarters, it was easier for me to read her reactions, and I could see that she was shy … cripplingly so, which was dangerous alongside her naivety. </p><p>More importantly, it was my apparent lack of attention to her half-naked state that made her stick around that. “No different than a swimsuit,” she whispered to herself as I walked the other side to pick up something, trying to encourage herself. </p><p>I only heard it due to my enhanced observation, which apparently included hearing as well. I wasn’t exactly able to hear things I couldn’t hear before, but I could separate her voice from the background noise well. </p><p>It was enough for me to listen to her.</p><p>“Careful about this part,” I said as I reached into one area, accidentally rubbing my finger against the back of her hand. Another subtle test, and she shivered even more, but otherwise didn’t comment. </p><p>She just bit her lip, tempting me to touch her more. Of course, I limited my touches to her hands and arms, partially to see if she would have a sudden change of attitude, and partially to get her used to my touch. </p><p>As we finished cleaning the fryer five minutes later, she showed great improvement. Saying that she got used to it was a stretch, as with every touch, her blush flared … but she stopped flinching, which was progress. </p><p>“What should we do next, sir,” she said as she looked at the floor, but this time, she didn’t cover her chest with her arms despite the direct cleavage. </p><p>“Start scrubbing the floor,” I said, doing my best to sound strict. She seemed to react well to that. “You start rubbing, and I’ll refill the bucket.” </p><p>She just nodded and started kneeling, but as she did so, her cleavage looked even better, tempting me more. It got even better as she started working, the angle working even better combined with her obedience. It felt heavenly. </p><p>I barely held back the temptation to push for more, and instead just refilled the bucket and passed it to her. I had pushed her enough. </p><p>However, before I could put it down, she put her hand in the bucket. At the same time, she looked up, caught my gaze, and flinched … and with her hand already in the bucket, dunked all of the water on her.</p><p>“Careful, woman,” I growled even as she ended up being completely drenched, unable to hold back my response. </p><p>Shockingly, she froze as I raised my voice. She just stayed on her knees even as her body was drenched with water, her bra losing its shape … even gaining a hint of transparency. Unfortunately, just a hint, as the bra was too thick to fade any further. “I’m sorry, sir. It won’t happen again. Please don’t fire me,” she gasped. </p><p>God, just how long she had been trying to find work to react to her accident like this, even forgetting the way she was dressed. </p><p>“Are you going to promise me that it won’t happen again,” I said. </p><p>“I promise, sir,” she said, her obedience tempting. I couldn’t help to tease her more. I let out a sigh of exaggerated disappointment, a fake expression I could replicate easily after my own underwhelming life. </p><p>“Good, then stand up and follow me,” I said, and without waiting for an answer, I started walking. </p><p>She followed, not even skipping a step, her shoes sloshing with water. Yet, she didn’t ask any questions, not even when we climbed the stairs. </p><p>She froze as she noticed the room, empty except for a naked mattress and one damaged suitcase. “S-sir,” she stammered, shocked. </p><p>It took everything I had not to test her limits by asking her to lie down. “You can use the shower,” I said as I pointed at the door. “You can’t just wait in wet clothes.” </p><p>She probably could considering her powers, but she didn’t volunteer that information. Instead, she just walked inside while I dug into my suitcase for a towel. </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” she whispered as she looked down once more, her wet hair sticking against her equally wet cleavage, the drops begging to be licked away… </p><p>I spoke again once she was at the doorway. “Give your clothes to me so I can dry them,” I suddenly ordered, unable to resist the temptation. However, this time, she just closed the door. </p><p>A sigh escaped my mouth. Apparently, it was finally too much. I started walking away … until I heard the distinct click of a door. It parted open slightly, and a hand jerked out, holding several clothes. </p><p>I changed direction, barely holding back a wolf call. She did her best to crack the door enough for her arm to slip out and hang her clothes on to door handle. It would have been smart … but my towel was tiny enough to barely wrap around her, showing even more of her cleavage and her surprisingly long and toned legs. </p><p>She hung all of her clothes including her underwear before she closed it hurriedly, giving me one last tantalizing glimpse of her body. </p><p>Just like that, I walked away … but to pick some props. She was just too marvelous, and I had to see just how far I could tease her despite the risk.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, what’s your name?” I asked even as I observed her carefully. Luckily, I was giving her an interview, so she wouldn’t suspect I had already realized her superpowers. </p><p>Good, as the secret identity was an important feature, and supers tend to be sensitive when their true identity was revealed. I didn’t want to annoy a super …  especially when the super in question had super strength, but not confident enough to actually use it. </p><p>“T-Tara,” she stammered as she sat on the stool, looking everywhere but my face as a blush slowly covered her face. Shy, far too shy than I expected. And, as much as I would have liked to believe that it was about my handsome face, her focus on the dirty state of the bar suggested she was not familiar with such rundown places. </p><p>Unfortunately, my ability of super observation had its limits. I could see her discomfort, but I was far too unfamiliar with her general attitude to derive anything more. </p><p>I just hoped that she wasn’t one of those over-enthusiastic vigilantes trying to stamp out crime the moment she discovered her powers. A vigilante like that could destroy the bar easily as she looked at drugs or other criminals, uncaring of the costs. </p><p>Hardly something I could afford. </p><p>“And you can call me Jason. So, you’re interested in being a waitress,” I said, and she nodded. Rather than continuing immediately, I started cleaning the glass at the same time, like I wasn’t paying attention, using the chance to think a bit more. </p><p>Admittedly, I was hoping that she would get bored and leave once she realized the bar was empty. It was what she would do if she were a vigilante, freeing me from making a decision. </p><p>People almost underestimated the value of silence. </p><p>However, as I waited, it was getting clear that she had no intention of actually leaving. So, either she wasn’t here as a vigilante, or she was playing a longer game. “Tell me about yourself,” I said. I couldn’t afford to send her away without asking for her permission. </p><p>“Oh,” she murmured as she took a deep breath, reaching to fix her glass in what was no doubt a nervous tick. “I have just finished the first year of college, and looking for a summer job to make some extra money,” she murmured, clearly avoiding an important topic. </p><p>I had a feeling it had something to do with why she was treating the world like fragile glass. </p><p>“Any experience in waiting tables?” I asked even as I turned my back to put the glass back on the shelf while observing her through the cracked bar mirror —the place was really a dump, after all.</p><p>“No, but I’m a quick learner and a hard worker,” she gasped rapidly despite her earlier shyness, coming across as practiced, suggesting that my place wasn’t the first location she had visited. It was good, as if she had been talking with other places, it reduced the chances of her being an enthusiastic vigilante searching for criminals to beat up. </p><p>Then, she tensed. “And, I’m just looking for part-time work. A few days at most.” </p><p>That almost managed to earn a chuckle from me. I could see where she was going. While the businesses tested their employees for superpowers, the test wasn’t exactly cheap. </p><p>Not worth it for a part-time employee. </p><p>I sighed in amusement. It seemed like an obvious solution, but there was a reason I didn’t use it. It was a solution that everyone could think of… and as a consequence, more discerning people occasionally checked people desperate to avoid the test. </p><p>Inevitably getting caught. </p><p>Of course, her desperation as she said that didn’t surprise me either. </p><p>Thanks to the constant super battles and the resulting destructions, the economy of the town weren’t exactly booming. The larger cities like New York survived better, but the smaller ones in the midlands, like our Sunset City — aptly named — struggled. </p><p>Funnily enough, even the construction sector was in a downturn, because only a few private companies were allowed to clean up after superhero battles, and they did so through extremely advanced technology developed by intelligence-based superheroes. No local contractor could match their expertise and their prices. </p><p>With the economy in tatters, even the shittier jobs as waiting tables were in high demand, with limited opportunities for temporary workers. Especially temporary workers in the form of shy, plain-looking girls with no experience. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked, even as I started pondering about a dangerous thought. I should just tell her that I tested even the temporary workers, which would make her turn and leave. </p><p>But, looking at the disgusting, dirty bar, I had a different thought. Why not put the desperation of a super to good use and ask her to help with the cleaning while I handled the tasks I needed to do outside. If she was as good of a worker as she was desperate, maybe we could even make the bar open faster than I expected. </p><p>The biggest problem was her superpowers. </p><p>I had precious little idea about the full range of her abilities other than the fact that she had some kind of super-strength. She likely had some kind of resistance or toughness, as it was common knowledge that except for very rare cases, those kinds of abilities appeared together. </p><p>Based on her expression, I was almost sure that she didn’t have any kind of super sense, but there was always a chance that she could turn them on under certain circumstances. </p><p>Still, the unclear nature of the limits of her strength was not the biggest question. The problem was the tendency supers had to intervene with things, and someone poking around in the rough part of the town using my bar as a base was very dangerous. </p><p>From a fair perspective, their god complex was understandable, the ability to throw a bus into orbit was a good reason to nurse a god complex, but their relative rightfulness would hardly help my case if the cute girl in front of me decided to smash a drug dealer in front of my bar. </p><p>Just the collateral damage would be enough to put me out of the business, and, moreover, I would be lucky if the local gangs didn’t decide I was working with heroes.</p><p>So, despite the amusing possibility of having a desperate super working as a waitress in my newly established bar, I would reject her. </p><p>After she helped with my cleaning. I would still pay her, of course. “How about this, I have to go out and handle some critical purchases. Meanwhile, you stay and clean the place as much as you can handle. Once I return, I’ll make a decision to hire you for a week based on how thorough your work is. Deal?” </p><p>A smile bloomed on her face. “Deal,” she gasped, her expression an open book even without my power. She nodded hesitantly, while I was already planning on my exact purchases. </p><p>Of course, there was a reason I could trust her … there was literally nothing worthy of being stolen in the place. Even the cutthroat agent just signed everything away to me for free after some bargaining … as it would have cost him money to throw them out. </p><p>However, she didn’t even bother to ask about the pay. She was really naive. </p><p>While she started cleaning, I left the bar, and instead went for a shopping trip.</p><p>And, while my superpower might be useless in a fight, it was quite useful when it came to picking up the fruits and spices I needed for the cocktails. Of course, I didn’t expect to be selling a lot of cocktails at first, so rather than piling it up, I picked up a few select materials to make a dozen common cocktails … and three signature ones. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was much more difficult to afford alcohol, especially in the quality I needed. Naturally, I was not buying everything needed to stock the place. A supplier would soon arrive with a beer keg and other cheap alcohol, but I wanted to have a few bottles I could use for my signature cocktails instead. </p><p>My shopping took almost four hours. Hopefully, Tara had made some progress with the cleaning to give me enough hope that I could start inviting customers tomorrow. </p><p>“Or earlier,” I murmured as I opened the door, only to freeze. The reason was simple. The customer area was absolutely spotless, so much so that I thought that I was in a new place. </p><p>It was a superhuman effort … literally. I realized she was even more gullible than I had first thought. The speed she cleaned was enough to reveal her super strength. </p><p>Even the floor color was different, an impossible feat to achieve without an industrial washer — or, it seemed, super strength. </p><p>Fascinating, I thought, wondering whether I should reconsider my idea of kicking her out after a couple days. She was clearly more useful than I expected… I already had superpowers … what was one more. </p><p>Then, I took a step and saw her cleaning the kitchen … wearing just a bra, a poor article of clothing that was struggling to keep back the perkiest breasts I had ever seen — and failing.</p><p>And, just like that, my determination to keep her around got much stronger. </p><p>Was that stupid to sneak to a super, certainly … but it was an easy stupidity to commit with my pants getting tight, reminding me that I had been running around desperately since I had awakened, unable to entertain any female company.</p><p>It was time to test just how good my new power reading the body language… </p>",

    "content": "<p>A world filled with superheroes was a horrible experience. </p><p>That was the truth, and story after story fed by the media, about the glittering flying people saving the day endlessly, hardly changed that. All of it was a great show… </p><p>How could it be any different when the streets were filled with supernaturally powerful vigilantes doing their best to implement their own understanding of justice, leaving only ruins behind. </p><p>Albeit, villains were hardly different, dressed in equally stupid outfits as they acted out, even less careful about the collateral damage. </p><p>Neither helped a newly awakened superpowered individual like me. </p><p>Of course, one might ask why would I choose to hide away in a world filled with monsters on both sides of the law when I could join one side. After all, one side had the habit of bringing the hammer down anyone they termed as criminal, meaning anyone that wasn’t on their side, and the others were more than happy to force the others to join them. </p><p>The problem was … I didn’t have any other choice. </p><p>My superpowers were hardly something incredible. Just enhanced perception with a sprinkle of enhanced body control. No super strength, no immunities, no laser vision. Add in some complicated family obligations, joining any side was a dangerous mess. </p><p>Unfortunately, hiding was not easy. </p><p>The biggest problem was the fact that superpowers could be detected. Not the type and the applications, but the existence of it. And, almost every single business applied those tests — a reasonable precaution after several multinational companies had been robbed in a row. </p><p>Of course, the government claimed that such a violation of privacy was not a problem, and that every single result was completely confidential … but I wasn’t exactly willing to believe that.  </p><p>Not when the aforementioned complicated family history already made me a target. I was already struggling to make a living in a way that I could hide my own name … and add in the text, I had no chances. </p><p>Not when I personally knew two people that took their offer only to disappear forever. </p><p>Villain work was already horrible, but the heroic path was just as complicated … government literally sucked the weaker heroes dry, and the independent guilds were no better; especially for people with bottom-of-the-barrel abilities like me. </p><p>With a fake identity, the only option I had was to start a business of my own. </p><p>… too bad that all my savings were barely enough to rent a rundown, failing bar in the worst part of the town. A desperate bet, but I already had experience with bartending, and trying to open my bar was a believable reason for suddenly leaving my job before the periodical monthly check. </p><p>I couldn’t afford people’s suspicions. </p><p>“Are you ready to sign,” the man in front of me looked at me with a big smirk, aware that he was getting one over me. But I had no other choice, so I signed. </p><p>And became the operator of a nice little bar, one that came with a tiny one-bedroom apartment in the back. Not only did it cost me everything I had including my emergency cash, but also I had to borrow some money from a shady acquaintance. </p><p>I just hoped it wouldn’t bite me in the ass. </p><p>“Have fun, and don’t forget you have to send the rent before the fifth of every month, or we kick you out,” the agent reminded before dashing out, chuckling as he did so, happy that he swindled another sucker.  </p><p>“Oh, fun,” I said as I examined the place. Broken chairs, empty bar, smelly bathroom, horrible location… “I have a lot of work to do.” </p><p>It was a desperate bet, that I knew. </p><p>If the place had any money-making potential, it wouldn’t have changed hands four times in the last ten months. The street barely had any traffic during the day, and it was even worse during the night. </p><p>And, I didn’t even have an employee to help … but luckily I didn’t have any customer to serve either. </p><p>“At least my superpowers are not completely useless,” I murmured as I started working on the repairs. With the help of my power, I made a quick list of the biggest problems, and started working. </p><p>First, finding help; hopefully one that wouldn’t escape when seeing the dirty state of the bar.</p><p>With a sigh, I grabbed a paper, created a small ad for looking for servers, and stuck that to the window before walking back to the bar and moving to the next item on the list … repairing the weak chairs…</p><p> Then, there was cleaning… </p><p>As much as I wanted to focus on the repairs, there were several cleaning tasks that had the biggest priority, particularly the visible ones in the bar area. Tables, mirrors, and the floor … particularly, all the areas that the customers would see. </p><p>As much as I wanted to clean the dirty fryer and other areas that disgusted me the moment I saw them, they were not as important. And, the less said about that horrible room that was supposed to be the office of the manager, the better. </p><p>The sooner I could open the bar, the sooner I could actually have any hope of gathering the necessary money to keep the bar open … at least without touching anything illegal. The shady acquaintance I had talked with had already implied that there were other ways I could make money using the bar, but I wanted to avoid that if that was possible. </p><p>Not because I was a stickler for the laws, but because I didn’t want to dip into the illegal side of the business. That way, I would eventually end up dealing with the villains … ruining the whole point of trying to open my own business. </p><p>Hours passed as I desperately cleaned the place to prepare for the grand opening —okay, not so grand, more like pathetic— as soon as possible. But despite the limited size of my new bar just a bar and a few tables, hours barely made a dent on the dirt. </p><p>Under the dirt was … more dirt. No wonder the place had been struggling that badly. Even for alcoholics, the place was too much. </p><p>Funny enough, my super observation ability was making my job even harder by feeding me information about the stains. </p><p>I was dealing with a particularly nasty stain that was a combination of oil and dust that was cooked repeatedly under the heat of the lamps, when I heard a knock on the door. “We’re not open yet,” I shouted even without bothering to check. </p><p>I was not in the mood to deal with an alcoholic, which was the only possible conclusion as to why someone would actually try to enter while the sun was still out to show every little horrible flaw of the place. </p><p>I was expecting a rough voice cursing at me, so, I was surprised when I heard a stammering shout instead. “I-I’m here for the waitress ad on the window!” </p><p>That made me turn, only to see a petite brown-haired white girl with fizzy hair, her large glasses covering half of her face, a large backpack on one of her shoulders that looked like it was filled with books, dressed in loose clothing that was fitter to a boy than a girl. </p><p>She shuffled on her feet, clearly afraid that I would send her away. </p><p>Not surprising, as she looked like a perfect target for bullying. A weak target that tempted everyone, particularly the losers that would work in such a horrible bar. </p><p>The moment I saw her, however, I realized that my observation power gave me some interesting additional information. For example, the fact that despite the utter unflattering state of her clothing and relative cheapness, her stuff was both pristinely clean and pressed, showing a meticulous person.</p><p>Not exactly a profile to be walking in an exceptionally seedy ghetto street. She must be really desperate for work. </p><p>Gullible and desperate. Exactly the cheap labor I needed to work hard to clean the place.  </p><p>“Sorry, come in,” I said, my tone shifting to a softer one as she pushed open the door carefully. </p><p>Too carefully, I noticed, like she was afraid of breaking the door, my superpower almost shouted. It was a weird sensation to notice such an important disconnect. I was barely able to prevent myself from exploding in shock. “Please take a seat,” I said as I gestured at one of the bar stools while I walked behind the bar, watching her from the corner of my eyes, trying to catch more detail. </p><p>After all, I had to be wrong. </p><p>Right. </p><p>Surely I couldn’t be that unlucky to get a superhero —or supervillain— visitor to my place, one with super-strength if her carefulness was any indicator. And, based on her care, either a new awakening, or her power was particularly hard to control.</p><p>Just my luck, I thought as I watched her sit, thinking about the best way to send her away. </p><p>Naturally, without angering her. The last thing I needed was an angry hero ‘accidentally’ throwing a car at my bar. </p><p>Just my luck indeed.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“How can I help you, director?” I asked as I stepped inside, only to see her looking at me with a furious expression … one tinged with jealousy and desire. </p><p>Oh, she was feeling jealous of the cheerleaders I had been hanging out with. How cute. </p><p>“We need to talk about your conduct,” she said as she shook her hand, though her attitude showed she would have preferred to break my head instead. It was nice to see her fiery side. And, if I was being honest, a bit intimidating. </p><p>She gestured the seat across her, but I ignored that, and instead turned until I stood behind her, and put my hands on her back. “Yes, coach,” I said as I put my hands on her shoulders. </p><p>“Sit down,” she said even as she used her elbow. I let out a grunt as her elbow bounced off, and stayed breathless for a moment, though more as a show than actual distress. </p><p>“I didn’t think you were one of those old-school coaches, using violence against your players,” I said with a chuckle as I started rubbing her shoulders, ignoring her growl of anger as I ignored her earlier blow. “Other physical incentives, yes, but not violence.” </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she said as she looked up at me, her face twisted into a grimace, but it took a lot for her to maintain that expression as my magical touch worked wonders even through her jacket. </p><p>“And you’re pushing your luck inviting me while wearing that delicious pantsuit,” I said as I continued to massage her shoulders, watching as her anger melted steadily despite her best attempts to maintain it. Then, I smirked. “Oh, I see. That’s my reward for getting rid of that annoying windbag, isn’t it?” I said. </p><p>She shivered as her arousal grew. </p><p>She let out a twisted growl, even more fake as she tried to conceal her arousal. A vain attempt. “Of course not. I called you here to be punished.” </p><p>I laughed as I leaned forward, pressing my chest against her back, enjoying her shiver. “Oh, an excellent idea, coach,” I whispered. “Did you bring the handcuffs?” </p><p>“B-be serious,” she whispered throatily, her tone certainly not conducive for anything serious. </p><p>I blinked playfully, and darted a glance back at her. “What do you mean, coach? I’m always serious when it comes to … lovemaking.”</p><p>“E-enough,” she growled, trying to get up to her feet, only for me to bend her down against her desk, enjoying her shivers. </p><p>“Don’t worry, coach, I have already locked the door,” I said as I enjoyed her shivers. Technically, I didn’t, but a little telekinetic trick was enough to solve that particular problem. “Now, let’s talk about your frustrations.” </p><p>“I-it’s about your behavior. You’re causing a scandal, it needs to stop,” she said, and did so almost without a hitch. Impressive as I was running my hand over her ass, enjoying her shiver. </p><p>“Oh, is this what annoys you, my beautiful coach,” I said as I pushed her pants down without a warning, enjoying her shivers, almost as much as I enjoyed her red lacy panties. “Or, are you feeling neglected?” </p><p>This time, she found herself licking her lips before answering. “O-of course not. W-who do you think you are!” she answered, which would have been more convincing if she managed to deliver it smoothly without a hitch. </p><p>“Oh, lying doesn’t fit you, my beautiful coach,” I said as I enjoyed her trembling. </p><p>“Y-you’re a coach now, it’s not appropriate for you to be seen with students relating to the football team,” she admitted. </p><p>I dragged my finger against her entrance, enjoying her shivers once more. “And, you’re saying that it has nothing to do with your jealousy. Not even a little bit,” I said as I caressed her wetness, and she shivered. </p><p>“M-maybe a little,” she answered. </p><p>I chuckled as I leaned forward, kissing her neck, but avoiding a kiss. “Here’s my good girl. No lies. Now, tell me the truth. Are those photos really that problematic?” </p><p>“N-not really,” she admitted. “Actually, it’s helping. Your popularity helping us with our athlete admissions for the next year. We even managed to get some out-of-state applicants.” </p><p>“Excellent. So you just called me here because of your jealousy. Oh, coach, you know you’re my favorite. Just a picture of you would have been enough to summon me…” I said as leaned down, and pulled down her panties with my teeth. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t leak any of those pictures without ruining her career. The public would have loved them. </p><p>“There’s another thing,” she whispered, this time quickly, like she was afraid of forgetting it. </p><p>Admittedly, with the way her wetness grew, a reasonable concern. “Go ahead,” I said before I let my tongue out, dragging against her entrance to earn a beautiful moan. </p><p>“Y-you need to help with the other teams in their conditioning as well. The students are responding to you really well, and the school management thinks it’ll help. So they want to have a group training.” </p><p>“Sure,” I said, but even as I said that, I was happy she wasn’t looking at me, because I was frowning. It didn’t make much sense for them to ask me that. My tactical genius was for everyone to see … but that hardly applied to the magical tricks I pulled during the training. They should have been unnoticed …</p><p>Unless it was being prompted by someone who was aware of the tricks I was pulling. </p><p>They no doubt wanted to test me … or the fake artifact I was using to heal the students repeatedly, to see its limits correctly. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly a great disaster, but it was the third direct intervention in the last twenty-four hours, with Paul and the attack, meaning my mysterious opponents were getting impatient. </p><p>I was glad that I had already triggered the repair process rather than trying to delay it further. </p><p>“As you wish, coach. But you need to pay the price,” I said with another chuckle, this time darker as I flipped her, and she ended up on her back. I pushed her shirt and bra up to reveal her incredible bosom as I slipped inside, enjoying her incredible moan.</p><p>I enjoyed her wetness as much as the dance of her incredible breasts, her nipples readily erect. She raised her hands to cover them instinctively, and I let out, enjoying her improvised hand bra, while her expression melted into desire. </p><p>Pity I didn’t have much time to enjoy it with the need to go around and see where exactly the request for group training had come from. </p><p>Instead, I reached forward and displaced her hands and replaced them with mine, enjoying the way her chest heaved at my touch. A grand sensation as always, enough to blunt the misfortune of needing to hurry up. My fingers danced aggressively, leaving my mark. </p><p>“Harder,” she moaned, and my grip turned into a slap, her tit swaying with the hit. The sound was loud, but luckily for her, I knew exactly how she liked it. </p><p>The reversal of the supposed power difference between us only made it hotter. </p><p>“You like it rough, don’t you coach?” I said as I leaned forward without a warning, my other hand reached for her hair, wrapping it tightly around my hand. I tugged her head back, enough to extract a pained cry from her as her tits rubbed against my chest, each push of my hips carrying my full weight. </p><p>She opened her mouth, but I sealed her moan with a kiss before pulling back. “Don’t forget to keep your voice down, coach,” I teased her. “The building is still crowded, after all.</p><p>She froze after the sudden reminder, but I only pushed harder, testing her determination to keep silent. To her credit, she managed to stay mostly silent, the occasional whimpers not as loud as her crazy heartbeat, hammering her chest mercilessly, shocked by the sudden shift. </p><p>Satisfied, I used my free hand to explore her body once more, starting from her flat belly, and paying a quick visit to the bottom of her globes in a quick detour before dipping my fingers down, teasing her clit as I repeatedly rammed inside her. </p><p>I could feel her hopes staying silent dying as her eyes were filled with ecstasy, strong enough to be a physical entity. “Oh, coach. What would have you done without me,” I whispered as she tightened around me, experiencing a surprisingly quick climax under my invasion. </p><p>“It’s a pity that I need to prepare for your request,” I murmured as I pulled out of her, and exploded, covering her tits and belly with my seed… A lot of it was thanks to my supernatural enhancements, making her look like a cheap whore after a particularly busy night. “You have a change of clothes, right?” I asked as I buttoned my pants, and she just nodded dazedly. </p><p>“Have fun cleaning up, then,” I said, and after one last searing kiss that left her even more dazed, I departed. </p><p>She was lucky that she had a private bathroom in her office. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“A question, Mr. Black,” I said as I looked at my turtle back in my room,, ignoring just how ridiculous it would look. “Are you capable of protecting Megan?” </p><p>He nodded, conveying his ability, but there was a sense of hesitation in his answer, showing that he might have his limits.  </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll continue pumping you with magic, you gluttonous beast,” I said, and this time, his nod was far more enthusiastic. </p><p>Then, he disappeared. </p><p>At a distance, I could sense his presence near Megan, both at a distance. I had let Megan leave after another long talk, explaining to her the fundamentals of power and Intent. </p><p>Even now, I was feeling surprised that she had turned out to be my first candidate for an Acolyte, but sometimes, fate was interesting. Her actions proved her loyalty — at least as far as anyone could be loyal to anyone else — and thinking about it, she was not a bad candidate. </p><p>She was a proficient player in the mercurial game of fame, and her magical enchantments would only make her more proficient; so not only she could help me further my fame in the areas it would be difficult for me to access, but also she was a good candidate to get famous herself. </p><p>A young, beautiful, and vapid woman suddenly turning into a business mogul. It was enough to make a lot of people angry and jealous.</p><p>And, as I experienced before, anger and jealousy converted to Intent very efficiently. </p><p>However, with that, I had my next challenge. </p><p>Who would be my next Acolyte? From the knowledge perspective, Arthur was the best, but he was tangled with the supernatural too much already, and he certainly didn’t feel any kind of loyalty to me. I could probably play his apparent rivalry with Paul, but I didn’t see how it could benefit me ultimately.</p><p>I thought a bit about choosing Marcus, or another football player, but after some consideration, I decided against it as well. This time, not just because of loyalty. I could feel that, with my current authority and their perception, I could open the discussion in a way that would earn their loyalty. </p><p>However, that didn’t mean there were other problems. The biggest being … we shared the same field, both literally and figuratively, meaning there would be overlap in terms of the Intent I could collect. Meaning, that unless there was a significant change in my location — which I wasn’t planning — it would be quite redundant. </p><p>Another challenge was the increased risk of getting caught. One advantage of my hurried selection of Megan, was that she would use her powers in an indirect manner to enhance her business acumen and her looks. And, while it was not impossible for her to get caught, it was far easier for her to hide her abilities than another football player with supernatural enhancement. </p><p>Pity that chain of thought also meant I couldn’t just use Coach Juana for an immediate candidate. Once again, the benefits were limited; and I could sense that, before I upgraded the System, I could select only another Acolyte, and that would be stretching the System in certain critical ways. </p><p>However, while I was considering that, I received a message from Megan. ‘We’re about to launch the marketing campaign,’ the message read. </p><p>Curious, I turned on my computer, curious about the quality. Then, I checked the first picture as the ad was up and running. </p><p>Well, I had to say, it looked good. It showed me dunking over half of the team during our pickup game, with a tagline about power and freedom. The fact that they were obviously flying me to the point of pulling my leg but failing to keep me down made it look even more impressive.  </p><p>The faces of the basketball team were tastefully blurred, but I doubted it would help much. Not with the commotion they created today. </p><p>Yet, even as I examined the picture, I felt a flood of Intent, one that filled my reserves almost as quickly as a touchdown. Curious, I started searching … and noticed a very long social media about all the ways I could dunk, the left side of a picture of me playing basketball … and the right side of a picture with Miriam on my lap … a picture from the tactics session. </p><p>And, the number of views had been climbing ridiculously, with people commenting all around the world, already trending on several social media platforms. </p><p>It seemed that I was about to have my fifteen minutes of global fame — well, not just fifteen minutes if I could help it. </p><p>However, before I could start that, I realized that there was an opportunity. Why not bet on Megan and the sudden publicity campaign to support the repair process rather than desperately betting on a second Acolyte.</p><p>It was an excellent opportunity, and with the next match for the basketball team upcoming, I could always use it as a platform for more intent… </p><p>“Fortune favors the brave,” I murmured, and sent a mental message. I felt something flicker inside me, and the System suddenly turned far more unwieldy, sucking the Intent I stored desperately.  </p><p>[System Repair Initiated]</p><p>[Repair Progress 0.3%]</p><p>It seemed that this time, the repair would take a lot of time. On the positive side, I had better control of my Intent, and I could use it in emergencies; and even use it to support Megan or my mysterious pet. </p><p>Altogether, not as bad as I feared. </p><p>“Let’s focus on the present,” I murmured with a sigh, and once again focused on my computer, focusing on creating several more bots based on my earlier tricks, this time tasked to increase the popularity of the newest fashion line by fueling the absurd discussion. </p><p>The longer I could stay popular, the better. </p><p>Naturally, soon the other variant appeared, showing me against Kevin on the left, while me in the pool with Megan, frolicking, on the right — which felt like a lifetime ago — or me, destroying the offensive line in my charge for a sack, together with my chess-themed celebration… </p><p>“Wow, they have a lot of materials,” I muttered amusingly as I continued to type, though the more I worked, the more I realized I needed a new computer. </p><p>Or better, a decent server that I could remotely use. I wished that I could rent some cloud space, but considering the illegal nature of my actions, it was hardly viable. </p><p>Instead, I continued drudging for hours … and in the morning, I went back to training ... then the classes, then training again. A shockingly routine day to compare to the one before. The only break from the routine was the times disappeared with a sexy cheerleader from time to time.  </p><p>And, amusingly, they were desperate enough to tap into my popularity, so I didn’t even have to arrange for someone to take a picture of us and leak. They arranged it beforehand. Some just served their freshly-fucked aftermath, trusting their messy hair and streaky face to convey the message … while the others actually served their half-naked poses. </p><p>As a result, my spotty reputation turned even more chaotic, and there was news about me nationwide. Some mocking me, some treated me as a social threat that needed to be kicked out of the school as a lesson. </p><p>Luckily, I had just got the dean and the sports director fired, and the interim dean wasn’t stupid enough to risk his chance to turn into the permanent dean by trying to take me down. And, my beautiful sports director was already by my side. </p><p>Well, hopefully, considering I was going to her room after training for an emergency meeting. I hoped that there was no emergency, because I was very happy with the results of the day. </p><p>[Repair Progress 5.2%]</p><p>While I was parking my car, Megan sent a message. ‘I have already managed to license the design and signed an exclusive production deal, and that’s your part of the advance,’ the message read. It also had a picture attached. </p><p>“Twenty-thousand, not bad,” I murmured before I paused. No, I realized, I had managed to miss a zero.  </p><p>Two hundred thousand. </p><p>‘Not bad for demolishing a few noobs in a pickup game,’ I wrote, and she just sent an angry emoji in return. </p><p>Then, the second one came. </p><p> ‘Jane says hi, and she wants to meet with you,’ the message read, and it showed Megan kissing a sexy redhead passionately. It was taken from a distance, clearly looking like the work of a paparazzi, no doubt about her little ploy to create a scandal. They both looked passionate and in love. </p><p>Amusingly, my Lust Domain allowed me to read their feelings very accurately. Jane was acting … but she was doing it well enough that nothing was out of place in the picture. </p><p>Megan, on the other hand, certainly had mixed feelings about the reality of the situation. How entertaining. </p><p>Maybe I should pay a visit to them soon. But, it was for another time. For now, I put away my phone and knocked on the door. </p><p>I had a sexy sports director to appease. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The three days passed without anything notable. I had hired a lot of apprentices who worked day and night to process the raw materials while I forged weapons without stopping in my private forge. In those three days, I stayed focused on the operations of the forge.</p><p>Naturally, there were some attempts to block me. For example, no supplier in the whole capital was willing to sell anything to me … and more interestingly, the guards suddenly became far more proactive in searching the carts, stopping and confiscating any forging material that didn’t belong to official suppliers. </p><p>I was able to bypass that blockade using teleportation, which probably left the guild members scratching their heads about their apparent failure. </p><p>However, I ignored all of it as I faced a young enchanter who was trying to solve the problem I had given to her. She was the first one who had managed to solve the unofficial test I had given her, making her a good candidate for my plan. </p><p>Now, she was trying to solve a deceptively simple Arcana ward structure and turn it into an enchantment. She was nowhere near solving it, but she still made good progress … most importantly, she was willing to understand and solve it despite her skills being useless, which meant she was a good candidate as a magical assistant. </p><p>Was she perfect, no. But I had to start from somewhere; and under the circumstances, speed was far more useful than the alternative.  </p><p>So, I approached her when she was alone. She tensed when she noticed me, which was understandable as I used a disguise. I ignored it as I spoke. “You have true potential in magic,” I declared as I let my voice gain an incredible cadence. “Tell me, girl. Are you willing to learn the secrets of true magic?” I said. </p><p>“Who are you. And, w-what do you mean?” she asked, looking suspicious, but I raised my hand, and a useless ball of mana appeared on my hand. Useless, but nearly impossible to create without an average stat distribution over thirty, along with a good understanding of Arcana mana. </p><p>She gasped in shock. “B-but, why here…” she said as she watched the rotating ball. </p><p>“Because this place is such a distraction, one of the many places we recruit our true students. People capable of understanding the truth about the magic,” I said, exaggerating slightly. </p><p>A bit rude, but it was a recruitment pitch. Hardy an avenue of accuracy. </p><p>“May I think about it?” she asked. </p><p>“No,” I answered. “Either accept or leave.” </p><p>She looked at me in disbelief. “I can leave. What if I tell others?” </p><p>“And people will believe you?” I countered with a smirk. Of course, I wouldn’t actually let her leave, but instead put her into some kind of sleep for a few weeks, which should be enough for my trick here to turn useless. </p><p>She looked confused, while I tapped into my Light node slightly, and the Arcana mana turned into light mana, still dancing elegantly… </p><p>“I accept,” she admitted. It was a bit hurried, of course, but understandable. She was a mere six-level mage, and already at her limit, which put her slightly above a common worker even with her surprisingly decent precision stat. And, I had already researched her. No family, no close friends. Perfect target for our organization. </p><p>Which was certainly not a cult. Right? </p><p>All of those factors made her easy to accept my abrupt suggestion. Not to mention, with my display of power, I had about a thousand different ways of harming her if I wished. Ironically, it made it easier for her to believe me. </p><p>“Good.” </p><p>“What do I need to do?” she asked. </p><p>“Nothing,” I said as I grabbed her shoulder, covered her with mana, and teleported. She gasped in shock as she saw the chaos of the Aether, but before she could register, we were under Silver Spires. </p><p>“Hello, love,” I greeted Helga with a searing kiss, distracting her from studying. </p><p>After she pulled back, she noticed our guest. “A candidate,” she asked. </p><p>“Yes, the first student of your chapter,” I answered, following our previously agreed lie. Since I recruited her acting like an already existing organization, we needed an excuse as to why there were no other students. </p><p>Building a new chapter was a good excuse. </p><p>I didn’t bother asking, but I was sure she still believed us to be under the capital. A good thing for the students to believe. </p><p>“I’ll leave you two to get acquainted,” I said, and after another kiss, I teleported away. When I returned, I used an illusion to look like our first student, exited the building, walked into an alley next to a building I hired for guild spies … and disappeared. </p><p>If I could use a string of disappearances on the guild, it would be even better. </p><p>But, for now, I hadn't taken any action. It would be more effective if I could point out several disappearances. </p><p>After I ‘disappeared’ in the alley, I returned to the base, only to change into another disguise and leave. However, this time, my disguise was deliberately poor. At a distance, I could already see several spies following me while I stepped into a black carriage waiting for me.</p><p>In the carriage, there was a servant waiting for me, serving me a drink. “My lord is glad that you have decided to take his meeting. You won’t be disappointed. He’s the one that can break the guild’s resistance.” </p><p>“I don’t need his help against a bunch of pencil pushers that forgot how to hold a hammer,” I answered, arrogant and direct just like a stereotypical man who spent all his time dealing with forging than other humans. That rash and careless attitude were not exactly designed to achieve optimal political objectives. </p><p>But it allowed me to poke around the complex web of political alliances easily, without care. “I have already told him what I need from him. If he’s unwilling to deliver that, you might stop the carriage right now.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, grandmaster,” he said. “My prince is happy to give you what you need as long as you supply him with what you promised.” </p><p>I waved my hand. “Just a thousand sets of armor. It’s nothing,” I said as I bragged shamelessly, but said nothing else. Even when the carriage left the city walls. A while later, a group joined us on horseback, carrying bows, but the lack of reaction from the servant suggested that they were pre-arranged bodyguards. </p><p>I might have tensed if I was just a fighter as I led them to believe, so I decided to put that show on. My fingers tightened around the glass while I looked out of the window, subtly fidgeting. As we moved away from the capital, not using the main road, more than one monster attacked us. </p><p>But, with a full squad of bodyguards around us, nothing happened. </p><p>“Our royal guards are very competent,” he commented. Which, I had to agree with. Of eight bodyguards, the weakest was level sixteen. Already at his level cap, but with a decent stat distribution. The strongest was level twenty-two … but with some interesting Skills. Like, having illusion magic rather than a melee ability. </p><p>A spy, and a very good one from the looks of it. I felt flattered. </p><p>I was already worth mobilizing such an important asset. </p><p>“Since we’re approaching the residence of our prince, would you like refreshes about the etiquette, grandmaster?” he asked. </p><p>“No need,” I said. “I’m a blacksmith here to talk business. He can summon one of the frogs from the court if he needs to be entertained,” I said, glad that my character didn’t require me to bow and scrape. </p><p>I certainly didn’t want another year acting as some kind of servant. </p><p>It took almost half an hour for us to arrive at the mansion of the prince, though even if I didn’t know about the owner, it wouldn’t have been hard to guess. The first reason was the lavish nature of the place, as who else would have walls covered with gold and gems. </p><p>I would have understood if they were a part of the wards, but I could sense that it was not the case. There was no mana connection, just opulence. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean there was no magical protection. I could sense several wards, layered on top of each other, though they prioritized defense over counterattack, all under a central point of control. Clearly, they assumed that, for any attack, they would receive reinforcements in quick order. </p><p>The wards were strong yet simple … and certainly not resource-efficient. Clearly, the royal family was not lacking in money or other resources… Curious, I dug deeper into the structure, trying to see if there was a nasty surprise, like a surprise addition by the Eternals that would trap me … but it seemed clean. </p><p>“We’re here,” the servant said, and I stepped out as I arrived at the inner court.</p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 33280}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>It didn’t take long for me to purchase a large building with a huge garden. The properties in the capital weren’t exactly cheap, but I wasn’t exactly hurting for money either. </p><p>Especially since a magical weapon could easily be used as money. Four magical great swords, six longswords, and two bows allowed me to purchase the building with little fanfare. The owner tried to bargain, but a threat about going to another building was enough to stop his attempts to bargain further.</p><p>I also used an agent to purchase the surrounding buildings … but for the moment, kept that particular detail a secret. Subterfuge and teleportation were a very useful combination for that purpose.  </p><p>The sellers didn’t argue much. Especially since I was significantly overpaying for the old, poorly maintained buildings … but considering my first action was to demolish it completely before I set up a temporary workshop in the open, it was hardly a problem. </p><p>Then, I started forging myself a house, made entirely of bronze and steel, right out in the open. </p><p>At first, it looked like a needless expense, especially as I was visibly using parts from Class Ten beasts to strengthen the metal further, but there were three benefits to it. </p><p>First, it was the best advertisement I could create. As I forged out there in the open, a huge crowd gathered in the streets, piling around to watch me work. Not everyone could meet with someone with Grandmaster Blacksmithing skill. </p><p>Of course, technically, I didn’t have that skill anymore. Luckily, for that, the guild helped, which formed my second benefit.  </p><p>From the window of the nearest building, three people with Grandmaster Blacksmithing skill watched me. I had no doubt that they were sent by the higher-ups to assess the threat of the sudden appearance of another Grandmaster, and what was the best way of communication. </p><p>And, to do that, they needed to assess my true range of mastery. Not only in terms of skills, but also the key stats, particularly, Strength, Precision, and Endurance. </p><p>However, they were unaware that their presence was helping me greatly. </p><p>No matter how strong my stats were, without my Skills, I was at a disadvantage. Luckily, their presence helped me resolve that particular problem. </p><p>A string of pure mana, mixed with darkness mana to keep it hidden, connecting to their soul space directly, subtly stimulating their Skill. It was a variant of the trick the Crown Princess pulled, but rather than letting the system create an artificial soul-space on a clone for me to control, I tapped the information flow of an existing one. </p><p>It was a difficult trick, especially with a Grandmaster-level skill. Rather than my soul space creating a cushion for me to absorb it slowly and steadily, the information flooded my mind mercilessly, leaving me with a nasty headache even with my Intelligence helping me greatly to filter through the knowledge … but the benefits were incredible. </p><p>I could sense my forging capabilities improving with each second. It wasn’t as good as directly having the skill … but then, unlike having the skill, it couldn’t simply disappear. </p><p>Altogether, it was much more preferable. </p><p>The third benefit was simpler. I didn’t use my own mana to forge, but using incredible amounts of monster parts still created a temporary cloud of mana that created some interference despite the constant devouring of the System, which allowed me to create a deep tunnel toward the bottom, and several secret basements, which would ultimately be very useful. </p><p>More and more people gathered around the place as my metal house started to rise, and at the edge, a line grew … potential customers, much to the distaste of the guild members. </p><p>It was fun, but unfortunately, I had a lot of things to do, so I stopped after two days, only after building two floors, with the potential to build more. </p><p>Then, I grabbed a huge metal plate, and started carving letters on it before I hung at the walls. </p><p>And the crowd exploded in shocked whispers.  </p><p>It was an announcement, one that told that I was recruiting apprentices for forging, as well as mages capable of enchantment. Each role had several requirements such as level, skills, and minimum stats, which was not exactly shocking especially since I kept them deliberately low. </p><p>No, their gossip was triggered by the last line. </p><p>No official guild affiliates were allowed. </p><p>A declaration of war. </p><p>The guild members scoffed at my daring as they left, probably to deliver their findings to the headquarters so that they could teach a lesson to someone daring to challenge them. Arrogance, they thought without a doubt. </p><p>Admittedly, it didn’t take long for me to see an immediate impact. The huge line of people waiting to purchase my weapons suddenly scattered like chickens, afraid of angering the guild. Only a fraction stayed, and I had no doubt some of them actually belonged to the guild, wanting to buy some of my works for detailed examination. </p><p>I ignored them as I put another plate … one that showed a detailed price conversion list. One that contained a huge amount of materials, from common iron and copper to very rare gems and monster parts, each with a direct point equivalent. </p><p>I wanted to preempt the most obvious trick the guild would pull against me, blocking the sale of the supplies. </p><p>I didn’t know if it would actually work to give me the materials I needed. I preferred it if it did, as it would keep me from going around purchasing materials from other cities under different identities before teleporting back … or stealing from the guild warehouses. </p><p>I could do both, but I preferred not to waste time. </p><p>The moment I put the price list on, the line started to grow once more, with several people who had left the line earlier returning. </p><p>The temptation of my prices, half of the official guild prices for the same quality of weapons was hard to turn down. </p><p>At a distance, I could see the guild members signaling to their member, who was third in line. The first two quickly purchased a weapon each, cradling them like newborn children. Then, it was the turn of the third one. “I’ll buy everything,” he declared proudly. </p><p>“No,” I answered simply. </p><p>“What do you mean, no?” he asked. “I’m willing to pay the full price.” </p><p>“No, I’m not going to sell all my stock to guild dogs so you can continue to swindle the poor fighters that stand against the endless monsters that surround us,” I said, deliberately shouting. </p><p>“I’m not a guild member. How dare you—“ he started, then, suddenly stopped. </p><p>Which might about my fingers around his throat as I lifted him up, and threw him away like a ragdoll. Everyone on the line froze while I turned and walked back to the price board, and added another line. </p><p>‘Each customer is limited to one weapon.’ </p><p>That made a lot of people grumble in frustration, and a few more left their places on the line, but more people filled the line … until I sold everything. A few people used monster parts to pay, but most just paid with money. </p><p>Understandable, as not everyone just walked around with their carts filled with iron. </p><p>“You can stay in the line if you want. I will be selling at least fifty weapons each day. The number will increase if I can find some competent apprentices.” </p><p>With that, I started moving my workshop inside, a trivial task with my immense strength, ignoring the two other growing lines, one for forging apprentices, and one for mages that would work as enchanters. They had been gossiping and fighting, but I didn’t care too much about it. </p><p>As long as I had some helpers to look convincing, it was enough. </p><p>After all, it was just a cover for the real thing. </p><p>Of course, while I was busy with that, people were already trying to purchase the surrounding buildings, most I had already purchased. I didn’t sell any of them, but some, I deliberately let them rent, letting spies fill the places. </p><p>Others, I had put on various disguises as I covered them with wards, acting as I belonged to some other group that was spying on me as well… By that way, I would be able to act much freer while blaming some mysterious third party. </p><p>At the same time, I quickly interviewed the apprentices, kicking only the most obvious spies out while letting in the rest. </p><p>Just like that, everything was ready… </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 33280}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Fascinating,” I murmured, though, for once, it was not about the next brunette on my lap, exhausted after our explosive embrace…</p><p>No, it was about the intense connection I could feel with the ruins, this time directly rather than through Audrum after our magical marriage ceremony was successfully completed…</p><p>And, what I found was fascinating, and much weirder than I expected. I could actually feel the signs of anxiety in the ruins. The ruins were not sentient, but only barely, and fascinatingly, there was no hint of necromancy or any dark tricks that could enhance the magical entity. </p><p>It was pure magic and nothing else, yet somehow reached the level of a near living being. It was an incredible achievement. </p><p>I closed my eyes, exploring the ruins through the magical connections, the information easily presented now that the near-intelligence of the ruins acknowledged me as the owner. Then, along with it, came fear. </p><p>Not me, but the ruins. It felt like trying to pet a scared kitten who just saw a rabid dog, ready to escape. Frightened, but not sure what to do. Doomed with nowhere to run.</p><p>With the fear, came disjoined memories about the past. A time when that ruin was the center of the world, the ruling seat of an Empire that ruled the whole world. </p><p>No, not the whole world, I realized, but many worlds. Worlds that were not only occupied by humans, but also elves and phoenixes, along with many other legendary beings, with permanent pathways created between the worlds. </p><p>I shivered. </p><p>It was the same magical paths that the Empress wanted to open the address the issues of the North, about the disappearance of the towns. But, according to that information, the moment those paths were powered with an Eternal core, they would be functional … which in turn allowed the transfer of the otherworldly forces. </p><p>The realization of just how close we had been to a disaster was a tough bit to swallow. Just a small difference in how I handled the Queen … by giving her what she wanted to gain her favor rather than what she truly needed, I would have likely triggered an intense war. </p><p>I had no idea how it would have ended, as I had no idea who was behind that particular plan. Maybe elves or phoenixes, but unless it was another faction leading that, it wouldn’t be the case. Their current plans didn’t require the sudden invasion of an army … and I doubted that their current managers actually required one. </p><p>It was better to assume it was a third mythical entity trying to invade … hopefully not the ones responsible for the destruction of the magical empire in the first place. </p><p>I continued to browse the incomplete magical records more. Memories of an invasion that came from darkness … magically strong enough that any recording of them had long corrupted and destroyed, leaving only a gap. </p><p>However, the other parts stayed strong, showing armies being destroyed, cities falling…</p><p>However, the defending armies were interesting. They were not made of humans or elves, not even phoenixes… No, they were made of magical constructs. Some were similar to the guardian I had fought against, though more streamlined and less elegant. Weaker as well, but considering their numbers counted in many thousands … maybe even millions, that was a reasonable compromise. </p><p>And, mixed with those soldier constructs, there were bigger entities, creating a shadow for the others to hide. A majority was around fifty feet, but a few among them easily surpassed a hundred feet, moving with a shocking elegance and a magical output to match. </p><p>Endless Legion, a name popped into my mind … but the following memories disagreed with that name. In every fight against that nameless army, the so-called Endless Legion dwindled further. </p><p>Ironically, as the memories continued, I realized it wasn’t the enemy that destroyed their vaunted empire. Whatever the threat was, they were strong … but they lacked the ability to move between the worlds. </p><p>The empire ended itself. The Endless Legion dwindled, and along with it, the power their rulers had, unaware of the brewing danger. Then, once the whispers of weakness reached their peak, the rebellions began.  </p><p>The species living at the edge was the first to depart … but that could have been stemmed. But it was enough to make the ruling class panic. The magical nobles fled, the great artisan houses responsible for the Endless Legion started accumulating guards for themselves rather than replenishing the legions, and merchants hunkered down, afraid of moving between worlds. </p><p>The empire had already collapsed before the rebels started to capture and sabotage the paths between the worlds… That just made that collapse permanent. From there, the recordings got sketchier, the memories of many proclamations of wannabe-conquerors, intimidating Dark Lords that destroyed multiple worlds, planets retreating to manage their won.</p><p>Then, the recordings from the other worlds stopped, replaced by the nobles building the magical ruins we were in. A magical bunker, it turned out to be, built by all the riches of the family ruling our current world — which turned out to be one of the premier families —  that would allow them to sleep for a while while keeping the paths closed. </p><p>They wanted to wake up after the chaos ended … but their fate was far more ignoble. Even before they could go to their magical sleep, they had died in the hands of magical elven assassins, leaving the ruins a secret. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I thought as I continued exploring my connection. The history was fascinating, but ultimately, it was an intellectual exercise for my short-term priorities. I already knew that both elves and phoenixes — and the mysterious party in the north — wanted to take control of the world, and they wanted to control the paths to do so. </p><p>Phoenixes wanted to use the Dark Families for that, Elves were determined to take control of the Empire of Light, and the mysterious third party wanted to push the Empire until they were desperate enough to open the gates…</p><p>Pity that I had the undisputed control, and used that control to bind the paths to me. I could feel several breaches, breaches that I could immediately close with my control … but there was no hurry. I focussed on getting tighter control first. </p><p>Taking a panicked action would force them to act before I was ready. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once we arrived at the nearest mall, we met with a familiar surprise.</p><p>Umi was here as well, next to her fiancee. “Oh, how interesting,” I murmured to Tiffany as I chuckled at the show. Unlike their earlier attitude, Umi wasn’t looking at him with a shy expression but pure annoyance while Charlie tried his best to apologize for his mistakes with Brenda, trying to blame it on drinks…</p><p>Admittedly, he looked well for a guy who had just drunk himself to a stupor, which didn’t help Umi’s mood any, lessening the weight of his excuse about being drunk. He handled the hangover far better than his drink. </p><p>Of course, under her annoyance, I could see thick guilt on Umi’s face, self-conscious about her great betrayal as well. However, she was simply too shy to actually admit what had happened, and too passive to just come out and break her engagement. </p><p>A nicer man would have walked away, but I just walked toward them with Tiffany in tow. </p><p>There were many ways I could mess with them, but in the end, I decided on the option that would continue playing on the persona of a desperate old man being strung along by the sexy young woman. </p><p>Which had the added benefit of freeing Tiffany from trying to hide her purchases from her husband. </p><p>“Let’s put on a show,” I said.</p><p>“Same story?” she asked.</p><p>“Yes, and I would love it if you could distract the fiancee once in a while, but only after the initial talk,” I said. </p><p>“Naughty,” Tiffany said, then giggled loudly enough to get their attention while she dragged me toward the shopping area, where they could see us. “Oh, Umi, what a surprise,” she said with a giggle as she approached. </p><p>Umi’s sheer expression of shock and panic was enough to reveal everything that had been going on … luckily, the poor fiancee — whose name I didn’t bother to remember — was more interested in our sudden appearance than her expression, missing that. “And Charlie it also here.” </p><p>“Oh, Tiffany,” the poor guy said with a surprised tone, unaware of the crisis his fiancee was going through. “What a surprise. What are you doing here?” </p><p>“Nothing much, Nathan here mentioned that he needed my help, and since my hubby is busy, I decided to join him.” As she said that, she patted my shoulder very a patronizing manner delivered perfectly with a quirk of her ruby lips.</p><p>I would have believed myself firmly stuck in the friend zone if it wasn’t for the same lips wrapped around my girth for an hour.   </p><p>“Oh,” Charlie said, thinking that he understood the situation. “What’s the occasion?” </p><p>“I need a secretary, but since I’m an old-fashioned employer, I want my secretary to have a uniform. Tiffany is here to help me pick one.” </p><p>“Oh, really, a secretary?” he asked, quick to understand the implications of such a position … although, it might have been about the longing gaze I had sent toward Umi, giving a pining expression, it was fleeting enough that he felt smart for catching it. He turned at Umi. “Honey, you’re looking for work as well. What a coincidence. </p><p>Umi’s expression of shock was impossible to hide, but he misread the source, and instead of talking with her, he poked her side pointedly. “You have just graduated from college, it’ll be a good opportunity.” </p><p>“Oh, what a good idea, and that way, we don’t need to pick clothes for an unknown, and pick them perfectly. What a good idea!” </p><p>I did my best to look reluctant yet excited at the same time. “It’s a good idea, but I don’t know if Natalie would go for it. I can’t really hire someone without her approval…” I started, giving another hint of weakness. </p><p>Tiffany hugged my arm. “Oh, nonsense,” she said as she massaged my arm with her tits, one that ‘broke’ my resistance. </p><p>“Alright,” I whispered. Tiffany giggled happily, Charlie smiled victoriously like he had just got a promotion as he looked at Umi, completely misreading her widened eyes and shocked expression. And, Umi was too shocked to actually speak. </p><p>“Actually, why don’t you go and talk with Natalie while I pick an outfit,” Tiffany said with a wink. “I promise that you’ll love it.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said and turned, but she grabbed my arm, opening her hand. </p><p>With a chuckle, I dropped a card in her hand, then gestured her a three, and a zero. The card had a thirty-thousand-dollar limit. I liked Tiffany, but not enough to actually give her a card with no limit. </p><p>And, while Tiffany dragged Umi and Charlie away, I went to find a sales clerk, and let my charm — and a little bribe — do the talking until he led me to a VIP changing room, with the promise to make sure not letting anyone in the corridor except the three. </p><p>I went into the dressing room, which consisted of not only a large mirror, but also a comfortable couch, large enough for a fun adventure. I didn’t have to wait for long before I heard Umi’s voice. “… I don’t know. Isn’t it too short for office wear,” she whispered. </p><p>“Not at all, especially not with a pantyhose underneath … or a fishnet if you’re trying to get a raise. Don’t you think so, Charlie,,” Tiffany cut in.  </p><p>“I don’t know…” Charlie murmured. “Maybe Umi is right.” </p><p>Tiffany was quick to attack his hesitation. “Come on, Charlie. What’s the harm in flashing the old guy with a flash of legs if it gives you the promotion you’re trying to get. Imagine the house you’ll be able to afford with double income, especially with a nice promotion once Umi could whisper some suggestions.” </p><p>“… maybe she’s right,” Charlie said after a long pause. “And, you’ll look sexy. I can imagine that old asshole pining after you, while I’m the only one that can touch you.” </p><p>I barely held back a laugh. I had to admit, the line he delivered was amazing, conveying confidence and flattering his fiancee while also staking his claim. A nice balance between freedom and jealousy. </p><p>Too bad for him that he used it at the worst possible time, right after losing Umi, making it an incredible self-burn, his fake confidence only damaging his standing in Umi’s eyes. </p><p>I was sure Tiffany fed him the line for that exact purpose. </p><p>“Really, that’s what you want. For me to parade myself s you can get unearned promotions,” Umi growled in sudden anger. “Okay, let’s see how you’ll like it. Maybe I shouldn’t even wear a bra while going office.” With that, footsteps started to get closer to the room. </p><p>A shocked gasp escaped Charlie, but before he could speak, Tiffany spoke. I had no idea what she had said as she spoke softly, but her amusement was clear, clearly enjoying the prospect of what was about to happen. </p><p>The moment Umi entered the dressing room, she gasped, freezing. “What happened,” Charlie asked,, worried. </p><p>I pushed the door. “Tell him you stubbed your toe,” I whispered. </p><p>She looked reluctant. Understandable, as she was a little sheep taking a turn, only to come face to face with a wolf searching for a meal … another meal. “Oh, I …” she started, pausing for a moment as she looked at the door. </p><p>I deliberately took a step back, letting her know that, if she wished, she could turn and leave. At that moment, Tiffany helped me as well. She giggled playfully, Charlie laughed with a hint of guilt, no doubt a joke at Umi’s expense. </p><p>She was already tethering on the edge, and that pushed to one side … right under me. “I just stubbed my toe,” she declared heatedly as she took a step forward, standing next to me. </p><p>I let my smile widen as I caressed her cheek gently,, whispering. “An excellent choice,” I whispered. “Now, why don’t you change. I want to see the beauty of my secretary.” </p><p>She blushed, her anger quick to fuel her enthusiasm as the memories of our first time flashed through her mind. But along with that, there was some hesitation. “You can use the curtain to change,” I whispered as I pointed to the curtain that could be used to part the room. </p><p>She checked the clothes in her hand, then nodded shyly. As much as I wanted to see her strip, I wasn’t in a hurry, so I let her. </p><p>She disappeared behind the curtain, and when it opened again, I met with a heavenly sight. </p><p>Umi was a beautiful woman, but she was always hampered by her choice of clothing. The clothing she wore last night was sexy, but not beautiful as they were picked for Tiffany’s style and hair color … which contrasted greatly with Umi. </p><p>My first mental comment as I took in her beauty, Tiffany really knew how to shop. </p><p>Umi was wearing a nice white blouse that hugged her body perfectly while giving a nice dip into her cleavage. The pencil skirt was tight enough to hug her ass, yet long. Enough to be office-appropriate … barely. </p><p>Or, it would have without the thigh-high stockings she wore, somehow managing to add an erotic quality that begged her boss — an honor that I owned — to bend her and teach her about the risks of dressing dangerously. </p><p>Yet, it was somehow still innocent, her head, dipped low to hide her shy blush, enhancing its impact even more. Dressed as a classical secretary with a sexy twist, she looked like a perfect sacrificial secretary, prepared to sate the lust of the boss for the sake of the company. </p>",

    "content": "<p>While the unfamiliar guest looked at me, I looked at Natalie, expecting her to leave. However, it was the girl that I was struggling to remember who spoke first. “Just send them a message and delay it for an hour, we have a lot of things to talk about,” she said.</p><p>It was a weird declaration to order me to terminate my imaginary call, though, curious, I acted like I pressed a button and acted like I ended the call, even typed a message — even though it meant I let go of Tiffany’s head, expecting her to pull back. </p><p>She continued. Naughty.</p><p>Meanwhile, she sat down, while Natalie delayed until she could sit. Meaning, she was someone important — well, someone important’s wife or daughter, likely, but sometimes, that was all one needed — enough to make her hesitate.  </p><p>I glanced at Natalie, who nodded decisively. “I think it’s for the best if Nathan stays as well. His presence will be beneficial for the discussion. He has been instrumental in the recent surge.”</p><p>She looked at me and nodded … though her blush was unmistakable. She had a crush on me; probably relating to her expectations that I remembered her. “Of course,” she said, delivering it with only the slightest hesitation. “Not a surprise though. Nathan has an incredible reputation in our line of business,” she said as she looked at me. “I have even written a thesis last year based on our discussion, and it was the best in class,” she said, still confident that I remembered her. </p><p>“A fascinating achievement. I’m sure the chairman was happy that the company will be in your incredible hands once he retires,” Natalie answered … unknowingly resolving my dilemma. Now, I remembered her. </p><p>It was the owner’s daughter, who I met during some kind of company event during the acquisition; likely a year and half before my eventual exile. She had annoyed me for an hour with pointless management theories and other nonsense. </p><p>Interesting. She had been a mousy little thing back then, a brown-haired, slightly plump girl with more enthusiasm than smarts, desperate to show off her smart theories; which prevented me from seducing an incredible brunette. Of course, back then, I indulged her … as annoying the owner of the company with a net worth in billions hardly a smart move. </p><p>Naturally, the acquisition of my company — or even my eventual exile — was too small to get the attention of the chairman for longer than a summary paragraph, or a slide page in a presentation, but in the same vein, a sentence delivered with a frown would have been enough to destroy the sale. </p><p>So, I indulged his mousy daughter during dinner. </p><p>Interestingly, she wasn’t as mousy anymore. Her hair changed into a bright blonde, and she must have spent quite a bit of time at the gym, getting rid of her fat … leaving some very interesting curves, which her current casual dress framed very well. </p><p>Very interesting. </p><p>If only I could remember her name. Something with an ‘R’ … no, includes an ‘R’ … probably … maybe.</p><p>I shrugged. After decades in business, I was an expert in acting like I was good friends with people no matter how annoying the situation was, and my current state was nowhere near annoying. Distracting a sexy young woman while I had another sexy ally in the room was hardy a chore … and the presence of Tiffany under the table, still blowing me expertly could turn torture into heaven. </p><p>While I was thinking that, Natalie walked around the table to sit next to me, no doubt to give me some directions if needed … only to tremble the moment she caught what was happening. </p><p>“Is something wrong?” the chairman’s daughter asked. </p><p>“Just a message from my girlfriend. S-she’s pregnant, so I’m a bit worried,” Natalie answered, her shock not preventing her from coming up with an excellent lie. </p><p>Another benefit of life in a corporation. </p><p>“Oh, you should go and call her. It’s a special moment. Nathan can entertain me while you’re away,” she said. “And, how many times I have to tell you, don’t call me madam. It makes me feel old. Call me Dorothy.” </p><p>“Alright, Dorothy,” Natalie whispered, and after a warning glare at me, trying to tell me to be careful, she left. </p><p>It was so unfair. I was always careful… It was her fault to barge in when I was busy. </p><p>“So, how is college. Have you managed to make your mark just like I told you?” I said, watching her blush. Did I remember what I told her during that boring chat? Certainly not, but it was easy to imagine the kind of bullshit I would have told. </p><p>With her clear interest in business, I probably drew a convincing scientific picture about building a business, all about analyzing the market, tracking the financials, sprinkled with genius instincts and occasional inspirations … and avoiding even the mention of backroom dealings that truly drove my success. </p><p>All sprinkled with a lot of compliments. </p><p>However, looking at her eager expression as Natalie walked out, I realized that I might have overdone it slightly. “Oh, you remember our talk,” she murmured, her eyes brightening. </p><p>How interesting … and promising.  </p><p>Of course, I didn’t have a grudge against her, or even her father. She was a non-entity, and her father was pretty hands-on, his biggest crime was the new CEO he had brought. She turned out to be a penny-counting bitch, and decided that bullying me until I quit was a nice way to make some savings to impress the Chairman and the other minor shareholders. </p><p>“Of course, I remembered. Not every day a boring business dinner is interrupted by a budding genius with many ideas,” I said. Once again, I had no idea what she had said … but I was sure that it was genius. </p><p>Any idea generated by a pretty woman with more than a billion to be inherited was genius; as confirmed by people around her. </p><p>“Oh, you still remember my variation of the market analysis methods?” she said excitedly. “Actually, I have made some more changes,” she said, and launched a long explanation. Her excitement was intense enough that she didn’t notice when Natalie entered the room and sat back to me, listening to our discussion with a fascinated expression, treating her like a genius. </p><p>It had all the hallmarks of an extremely boring one hour … but Tiffany’s presence was enough to resolve that particular challenge beautifully, keeping the discussion very pleasant. Tiffany was an excellent cocksucker, her lips going up and down… </p><p>Natalie didn’t share my enjoyment, her expression tight and stony as she glanced under the table far too many times despite her outwardly pleasant expression, and whenever they glanced at each other, Tiffany’s eyes were bright with amusement. </p><p>Clearly, there was no love lost between them, and I suspected Tiffany was feeling like the current situation was a good way to take revenge. Tiffany clearly understood that Dorothy was Natalie’s superior … but I seriously doubted she understood just how high. </p><p>A word from Dorothy was enough to ruin their lives … even against me, it had the risk of creating a significant annoyance that would require months to clear. </p><p>Yet, that only made the dance of her lips more entertaining. “That’s an interesting theory,” I commented. After all, while I was humoring her, it couldn’t be done by just listening to her while nodding. That way, she would eventually get bored. “That’s actually one of the drivers of our recent growth. When I joined the local department, the managerial practices were outdated.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” Dorothy said, excited. “How exactly did you manage to implement them,” she said.</p><p>I smirked at Natalie’s panic, which was bigger than her earlier panic when she noticed Tiffany, mixed with betrayal. She clearly expected me to steal all the credit and leave her in trouble. </p><p>Admittedly, three months ago, I would have done it mercilessly, but now, things were different. She was going to be one of the mothers of my child, and while I might not be the most paternal, that would not work. “Actually, I was just the messenger, and responsible for some of the client-facing aspects. Natalie is the real genius, particularly when it comes to financials,” I said. </p><p>And, spun an excellent story about her expertise in accounting and finance, and how it helped to save the company a lot of money. Ironically, all the times I had worked on the financials to identify the money she had swindled from the company helped. </p><p>With that issue resolved, there was no harm in using those abilities to extol her qualities. I had no doubt that Natalie could continue explaining, as I wasn’t exaggerating her skills, just adjusting their origins a bit, and linking her genius to Dorothy’s ideas. </p><p>At first, it seemed like I was still stealing credit from Natalie and giving it to Dorothy, but that was not the case. If so, Natalie wouldn’t have smiled at me as Christmas had come early. </p><p>It was an excellent opportunity for Natalie to get a hefty promotion, and if she played her cards really well, a lifelong contact that would elevate her career to incredible heights. </p><p>“Actually, I’m not sure Natalie mentioned it because she doesn’t like bragging, but the next workshop is also inspired by your ideas. Why don’t you join and listen from behind.” </p><p>Admittedly, keeping Dorothy near to use against that bitch that was supposed to be the CEO was tempting … but I decided against it. </p><p>Ultimately, I just wanted to finish my contract and receive the promised high seven-figure bonus before disappearing. No need to get into contact with such a volatile element. </p><p>Young women with crushes on older men were volatile enough without having billionaire fathers… </p><p>“A good idea,” she said, blushing as she stood up, telling me the danger was not over. “And we can discuss it over drinks tonight. Though, it has to be early, as I have to fly away…” </p><p>But she seemed to have other ideas. I was lucky that she had plans. </p><p>The moment they left, I grabbed Tiffany’s head and started fucking her face mercilessly, driving for a quick explosion even as I punished — and rewarded — her for her hour-long torture… </p><p>Only after she swallowed every little drop, she stand up, a sexy smile on her lips. “You owe me a new dress as well,” she smirked. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said with a smirk and left. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Soon after the fun, I managed to complete the urgent tasks in my underground layer. The second layer of the ward was established, Helga’s Divine Domain started to coalesce, and security measures were established. </p><p>It was time for me to leave once more. </p><p>I didn’t want to do that. I had missed Helga greatly, and another separation, no matter how short, was not a welcome development. Unfortunately, I had two important priorities. One was to empower her, and the other was to find the rest of the girls. </p><p>Neither could be done in Silver Spires. </p><p>Finding the others was obvious … searching for them couldn’t be done from Silver Spires. The school was already away from the centers of power even before my arrival, a haven for the noble children to slowly develop. The current situation isolated it even further. Trying to find the girls from there was not only inefficient, but any new spy ring would be caught easily. </p><p>Strengthening Helga was trickier. Increasing the production of the Divine Spark was very simple. The more students in Silver Spires, working to improve themselves through a study of magic, the more Divine Spark fragments there would be generated … and the faster Helga would get stronger. </p><p>Unfortunately, while it was simple, it was not easy. </p><p>Silver Spires were effectively in a political exile, and were being deliberately suppressed. I could easily take the role of the headmaster in disguise or put a puppet before increasing the student intake … but that would get the attention of the royal family, which then in turn bring the Eternals down. </p><p>However, trying to set up another school from scratch was an even more complicated process, and if a mysterious organization suddenly grew from nothing and surpassed Silver Spires in numbers, it would be even more difficult. </p><p>Political problems require political solutions…</p><p>So, I decided to travel to the Royal Capital, the biggest city on the material plane. Not only I could make the necessary moves that could be leveraged, but also I could set up the feelers necessary to an extent. </p><p>Admittedly, my melancholy about leaving her was a bit exaggerated, as I still have my ability to teleport back and forth, but with the several self-assigned missions that needed to be launched at once, I would be extremely busy. </p><p>There were people to be hired, spies to be organized, businesses created … no, I would be extremely busy, and it couldn’t be simply done by just disguising as a servant. </p><p>It was why I was at city gates, driving a large carriage while wearing armor, a huge hammer on my back, and my hand scarred with flames. My outfit shouted blacksmith, and my cart was filled with exquisite weapons … well, exquisite from a commoner perspective, as forging them took barely an hour with the help of my magic. </p><p>It was just there to establish a business, waiting for my turn at line, just to enter the outer city. Finally, it was my turn. </p><p>The guards looked disappointed at my arrival. After all, I was a sole traveler, which meant little money they could skim from the top. </p><p>“Reason for arrival,” one asked. </p><p>“I’m a blacksmith, trying to establish a business,” I answered. At my mention, their gaze widened, and grew even bigger once they looked at the cart. </p><p>“That’s a lot of weapons,” one said, their eyes glinting with greed. </p><p>The other joined immediately.  “Bringing that many weapons into the city is suspicious. We need to check them carefully.” </p><p>“You’re right, of course,” I answered, but didn’t act panicking. Instead, I grabbed two swords, both considerably better than what they had, and passed them to the guards. “How about now. The number should be acceptable,” I said. </p><p>The guards didn’t answer, and I immediately grabbed more, this time two daggers, and their greed was stoked even further as I passed it to them, thinking that I was easy to extort. “We still need to…” he started while he played with his new sword. </p><p>“How about I check your old sword as well,” I said, and before he could react, I grabbed his old sword. “A piece of garbage,” I said as I bent it, and it immediately shattered. </p><p>The expression of the guards changed immediately. “On second thought, the numbers look more than satisfactory,” the guards changed their attitude, even ready to give the swords back. </p><p>“Good, you can keep them,” I said as I rode the cart into the city. </p><p>After all, my aim was not to avoid the guards or somehow save one or two weapons. If that had been the case, I could have just sneaked into the city and silently established a business. </p><p>No, I wanted everyone to know that a formidable blacksmith had arrived in the city, one that appeared from nothing… Which was not that uncommon in a world that was ruled by the system. A strong soul space and a certain amount of recklessness — and a lot of luck, both to survive against the monsters and to get decent achievements — was all that was needed for someone to climb up to the peak from nowhere. </p><p>Of course, while such entrances burned brightly, they were usually suppressed soon after. Oeyne’s fate was a good example. An incredible blacksmith who could forge enchantments directly to the metal, yet she had been suppressed until she had to escape to Silver Spires and live ignobly. </p><p>I wanted to replicate that trick. </p><p>There were multiple reasons for choosing a blacksmith. First of all, a blacksmith was not immediately threatening. Oh, they could take down a lot of low-level people if they had time, but that was true for every high-level individual. They lacked area-of-effect impact, which was what mages dangerous. Which meant, that blacksmiths represented opportunity rather than danger. </p><p>Especially when they were not a part of the Guild. </p><p>Which was the second part of my trick. I wanted the Guild to target me. Not because my objective was to actually hurt them — no, that was a nice side benefit — but I wanted a reason to expand aggressively, sell my weapons at the cheap, and helplessly align with a lot of parties despite the apparent disadvantages.  </p><p>I was willing to give away my weapons for free as long as I could establish the necessary connections, but such disadvantageous actions would require an important reason — which the guild should provide with their arrogant ways. </p><p>Such connections should give me the necessary political connections so I could poke and prod the decisions about Silver Spires once I understood the political landscape. I could always pull some more obvious actions as a last resort, but I wanted to see if I could resolve it with some soft touches first. </p><p>Another advantage was the recruiting. I needed to hire and assess a lot of mages, with a preference for low-level and non-combat roles that might be desperate to accept a mysterious role; to create some additional source of Divine Spark for Helga … or maybe even find a few good candidates to be raised as Chosen. </p><p>Amusingly, a blacksmith's identity was better than a mage for it. To get a lot of apprentice candidates, a mage should be very high level, and such a high level one was expected to be discerning. And, if not, they would get a lot of unwelcome attention. </p><p>Making a blacksmith identity far more useful for recruitment. </p><p>Of course, while they were important, none of them was the main reason. </p><p>I wanted to send a message to Oeyne. </p><p>The girls were being hunted, and naturally, they would be very carefully hidden. I couldn’t find them directly, and since they weren’t stupid, they wouldn’t try to find me without having a reason to believe I returned. </p><p>The weapons I planned to sell would be that reason. I had worked together with Oeyne for a long time, and I knew her style intimately, just like she knew mine. By creating tens of thousands of weapons in that exact style and flooding the market with them cheaply, it would be a message for them. </p><p>Hopefully, the cheap prices I would push as I fought with the Guild would allow those weapons to spread all along the Empire, while the story of their creation would lead her right back to Capital. </p><p>Which was the most dangerous yet the safest place for her. </p><p>Pity I didn’t have a similar way to connect with the rest, or it would have been much easier. </p><p>“One step at a time,,” I murmured as I moved toward the commercial district at the outer city, ready to plunge the capital into a smithing crisis. </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 33280}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>The linchpin of our success was in creating a domain in Silver Spires. </p><p>Even in ruins, with its old luster lost, Silver Spires was still the closest thing I knew to a pure center of learning and research, with a focus on more. The intense action of studying created Divine Spark. </p><p>Of course, even the most focused mage lost in the studying generated only a fraction of the concept that could be termed as Knowledge Spark. Despite the students counting in thousands and the total population in tens of thousands, we would be lucky if we could reach a two-digit Knowledge Spark harvest daily … </p><p>“… the fourth section has a problem with the subsection, it’s breaking the whole structure. Correct it,” Helga cut in my work, her attention intense. </p><p>We were working on the collection array to make sure we could collect Divine Spark from the students before the System could devour, made out of a mixture of Arcana wards and Darkness mana. The initial ward had been established in a hurry, and therefore imperfect, barely able to pick a few points of Divine Spark every day, less than a point could be defined as Knowledge spark. </p><p>Of course, looking back, it was a happy accident. If that hadn’t been the case, Helga probably would have met with an unfortunate end even with the suppression of the crystal platform. </p><p>“Why don’t you fix it yourself then, goddess,” I growled in mock anger as I slapped her ass — her naked ass, as we missed each other far too much to bother wearing clothes, which was pointless considering we ended up entangled with every couple of ours. </p><p>“Why should I bother when I have my servant with me to deal with that trivial things. Anyone could handle those mundane things.” </p><p>She was smiling teasingly as she said that, and I chuckled as well. Naturally, she knew just how difficult was to create such a complicated control ward. Even with all the practice I had outside the System — which created a much more delicate warding tradition due to the absence of the system’s constant devouring — the only reason I was able to create the delicate ward she had designed was my immense stats. </p><p>And the fact that, under the layer of Darkness mana, the System didn’t drain its mana completely and ruin its structure. </p><p>However, no matter my casting capabilities and my Intelligence stat, I couldn’t have come up with that design. Intelligence and Wisdom were excellent at supporting rapid learning, and they allowed me to adapt the things I had known to other traditions … but inventing completely new methods was far more different. </p><p>Helga had always been better at that, and it only got better once she merged with the Knowledge stat. Together, we made an excellent team. </p><p>Not to mention, it was fun to work with, I decided as I suddenly stabilized the ward and stopped working, and pushed Helga on the same huge desk we had the plans, putting our nudity to the best usage once more. </p><p>“You’re insatiable,” she moaned, her hips responding already. “We need to work.” </p><p>“The first stage is already complete, and the second stage could wait a few minutes.” </p><p>“Minutes,” she chuckled. “Don’t tell me the great Caesar finally exhausted and turned into a quick shooter.” </p><p>I laughed. “You asked for it. Hours it is,” I said as I slapped her ass, she giggled, and we started ruining the plans on the desk once again…</p><p>The reason I was quick to stop was because we had managed to complete the first stage of the ward, which was the urgent aspect.  </p><p>The first part focused on the Knowledge Spark. Based on several incredible leaps Helga managed to come up with, we had managed to enhance the identification capabilities of the ward several times, so it only collected what could be converted into Knowledge spark, and didn’t target any other spark. </p><p>That way, we were able to collect the majority of the spark Helga needed and store it, feeding into a ward of purified mana to soften slightly so Helga could absorb and bond with it. That way, she would be able to receive several points of Spark every day … likely doubling her Knowledge Spark stores in ten days,  from a hundred to two hundred. </p><p>Of course, ultimately, it was nothing. For us to even have a hope of making a stand against the Eternal, she would need hundreds of thousands of Spark, not just a hundred … but it was to be concerned for the future. </p><p>For now, we were happy with the linear growth. </p><p>The second stage of the ward was different. It was mainly for my benefit, which was the reason I was willing to delay a couple more hours for fun. Essentially, the aim was to create a secondary collection mechanism with its own filters so it could convert the other Divine Sparks, purify, and store them for my convenience. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was only a marginal benefit, as the amount we could collect was limited. Even if we collected everything the school produced, it would probably mean a hundred sparks, and we certainly didn’t dare to collect all of it. </p><p>We had no idea whether the System could track the source of the Divine Spark it collected — but I certainly suspected there was, even if it was not too accurate — and if it did, the sudden dip of the Divine Spark would be noticed. </p><p>Pity we couldn’t just spread that ward under every single city, but that was not possible. First, and the simplest reason. We didn’t have enough Darkness mana. The ones that had been collected for months were barely enough to serve our needs. </p><p>Not to mention, multiple locations increased the risk of being caught. One location, we could defend … multiple, we could not, and I didn’t want the Eternals to have any purified spark. </p><p>Who knew how they would use it. </p><p>I wished I could use the various types of other Sparks that were being generated, but it was impossible. Because, every single fragment had a slight difference, and required a central mentality to focus and channel it, allowing it to coalesce into a coherent piece of spark. </p><p>If that had been the case, I would have been far more enthusiastic about collecting the fragments through that ward. </p><p>I might have been able to use it to grow my current Companion crystals, but even then it would have limits. Doubling the size might have been possible, though even that would have been a stretch. Anymore, and it would lose its coherence and I would be forced to purify it. </p><p>I experimented with Nature Spark many times during my lengthy stay to get a better understanding of Divine Spark. </p><p>With both paths closed, I focused on empowering the sexy blonde who was currently riding with reckless abandon, her huge tits dancing with each push to send tingles through me. The pleasure that filled me was incredible…</p><p>However, the melding of our souls as I slowly guided her Divine-infused soul was even more impressive. </p><p>It was the other part of my strategy of empowering her. By carefully leading her external senses, I was allowing her to bond with the area that was under the darkness ward, creating an absolute Divine Domain. </p><p>By that way, her Divine Domain would be established where she had near-absolute power, the Darkness was keeping it safely out detection. </p><p>At first glance, it seemed like a terrible choice. After all, other gods and goddesses had world fragments to themselves. What was the benefit of such a small domain to rule, when the enemies could easily surround … or ignore considering it was even tucked underground.</p><p>Worse, she would be bound to that small area, unable to leave unless she uprooted herself, which was only possible by a terrible price, reversing her complete divinity. Together, no other god or goddess would actually do such a thing.   </p><p>But, Helga was certainly a special case. </p><p>Her Divine Spark was unique, and even if she had a huge domain to herself, I doubted she would be able to defend it successfully against another avatar … </p><p>Instead, we had to find other ways to use her advantages. But, those exact plans for the future. First, she needed to establish her Divine Domain and complete her Apotheosis, which required some time. </p><p>And, lots and lots of sex. </p><p>“Move faster, my whore goddess,” I moaned as I spanked her tits, making them dance as I enjoyed the tingling sensation it created. Her moans rose higher and higher, resonating with her surroundings, and that was not just a figure of speech. </p><p>I could feel that she was slowly assimilating the surrounding area into her divine domain, some of her Divine Spark dancing outside her body. It was the one advantage of creating such a small Divine Domain, that she was able to afford the consumption of the Apotheosis. </p><p>Taking a comfortable step into the divinity. </p><p>Now, it was my turn to support her… </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 47</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 33275}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 700  Mana: 2000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>Lily had a problem. A big problem. </p><p>She was being neglected by her newest paramour. </p><p>Ordinarily, she wouldn’t have cared much. She was one of the sexiest and most popular girls in her college, and guys chased her while she rejected them. But with Darion, things were different. Not only he was amazing, but he was also confident enough to push her away the moment she tried to get control…</p><p>For some reason, being ignored felt amazing. </p><p>Unfortunately, it came with some disadvantages as well. Like the last night, when she tried to reach him but failed … only for her slutty friend Mary to share some photos about his absence, some starring her … some starring her host Fatima. </p><p>Pity Mary only had some photos of the aftermath, as Lily would have loved to watch how a submissive old lady reacted to her. </p><p>She wanted her turn … so she came to work early … only to see Darion was missing. And, according to that whore secretary, she went to an important meeting, taking Darion with her. </p><p>Lily would have suspected her sister of acting like Fatima, but even the thought of it made her chuckle. Her sister was famous for being a snob. Not only did she have to be always in control, but also the guy needed a CV that could get into every single Ivy League college. </p><p>Her loss, Lily’s gain. </p><p>Her gains were the reason she was currently at a corner cafe in an abandoned corner of the city. The reason, she had followed Sakura. </p><p>The way Sakura acted while she was talking about Darion’s whereabouts was surprisingly suspicious, so she followed her. </p><p>“Wow, such a surprising little display,” Lily murmured as she took a glimpse into the place, only for her eyes to widen. She certainly didn’t expect Sakura to be dressed like that. “Wow, her work outfit was hiding a lot.” </p><p>She didn’t dally for long before she entered, enjoying the sudden explosion of panic on Sakura’s face. “Wow, I didn’t know my sister allowed her employees to work part-time.” </p><p>“L-Lily,” Sakura just gasped, shocked at her sudden arrival. </p><p>She walked toward there with a confident smirk, wondering how far she could push the little office worker. In such issues, she was like her sister.</p><p>Never let weakness go. </p><p>Lily smiled while she waited for Sakura to realize just badly she screwed up. “I hope your boss is paying you well, as you have to rely on only one job,” Lily declared smugly. “Unless…” </p><p>“Unless, what,”  Sakura whispered, hesitant. </p><p>“Well, first let’s talk about the risks. I know how my sister would react, but how your new boss would react. Maybe you’ll get kicked out of here as well.” She glanced around. “It doesn’t look like your tits are driving business.” </p><p>Lily was smug as she delivered her ultimatum, but by watching her face, she realized she made a mistake. Exactly what, Lily didn’t know, but her fear was suddenly gone. </p><p>“Do your worst,” Sakura said. </p><p>“Oh, I will—“ she started, only to freeze. The reason, Darion suddenly appeared behind the cafe. “Oh, Darion, what are you doing here?” she gasped. </p><p>“Should I ask your permission to visit my own store,” he said, his voice once again sending shivers through her. </p><p>“Of course not,” Lily said as she walked closer. “I was just asking Sakura about starting to work here as well. I need some spending money my sister doesn’t know.” </p><p>“As long as you’re willing to dress appropriately, not a problem,” he said.</p><p>“Oh, I can handle everything this little girl could handle,” Lily declared, enjoying her anger. Lily was ready to admit that Sakura looked far better than she expected, but she lacked the personality to hold such a man. </p><p>With a smirk, she walked to the other side of the store.</p><p>***</p><p>“That bitch,” Sakura murmured once she heard the door being slammed. “Like I’m not dealing with her enough at work.” </p><p>Darion walked closer as she complained. “Oh, really?” </p><p>In her anger, she didn’t pause to decipher his tone. “Yes, she’s a spoiled bitch. You can’t allow her to join the cafe. She’ll ruin the place—“ Sakura complained for a while … only to realize too late that she tried to order him. </p><p>A mistake she realized once she was floating in his arms. “Did you just order me?” he whispered.</p><p>“N-no,” Sakura answered. </p><p>“A liar as well,” he followed, and she froze. </p><p>She was stuck now. She said nothing even as he flipped her, easily like she was a simple toy, the way his arms wrapped around her making her blood flow faster. She loved the way he hugged her … she just wished he didn’t do it in such a public place. </p><p>There were never any customers in the cafe, but still … the fear of getting caught was there. He ignored her fears as he undressed her, far too familiar with the exact locations of the buttons … and she was left in her panties, pressed against the counter. </p><p>Sakura flushed as he flipped her once more, this time looking at the wall. She bit her lower lip in an effort to suppress her moans, unable to ignore the sensation of his cock being pressed against her ass.</p><p>Her juices flowing once more… </p><p>As he grabbed her tits, her determination to contain her moans disappeared, letting him play with her easily. </p><p>Then, Lily arrived … reminding her that she was here in the first place … and looking amazing in their official uniform. </p><p>Enough to make Sakura jealous if it wasn’t for Darion’s hands molesting her.</p><p>*** </p><p>‘What the hell is going on here,” Lily gasped as she took a turn, her smugness about her uniform melting into shock. Admittedly, it wasn’t about what Darion was doing. Lily had already caught him with Janet, they had an incredible threesome with Mary, and she had the photos of him sleeping with a naked Fatima…</p><p>The only thing Lily was sure that he wasn’t able to touch Mia. Her sister, the hardass. </p><p>However, she was surprised that he was daring enough to do it behind the counter. It was … incredibly sexy.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Audrum was cute and fun to hang around with, but unless there was a very important necessity, I didn’t like to act passive for a long time. And, with Audrum, we finally hit that point. </p><p>Especially since she looked extremely happy devouring my cock. I gripped her head without a warning and pulled her down, assisting her efforts to take me deeper into her throat. She tried to gasp in surprise, but it just melted into her gagging as I invaded her throat. </p><p>I busied myself with stretching her throat for a while. She moaned with each push, her lips still doing their best to massage my girth, and I enjoyed her throat. </p><p> I couldn’t help but grunt as I continued to push forward, enjoying the warmth of her throat. An excellent way to brighten the experience. “Feel free to tap my leg to show you’re too weak to handle my help, miss explorer,” I said. </p><p>I only received an angry glare, which I loved as I pushed deeper and deeper, enjoying her protesting grunts. The gags echoing from the broken walls were simply spectacular. </p><p>She was stronger than I expected. She just accepted it, her earlier confidence not completely gone as I lashed into her throat. I could have continued like that for hours … but at the same time, I was multitasking. </p><p>As I invaded her throat, I also invaded her body with my mana, checking the connection between her and the ruins, which was more sublime than I expected … but with a very nice surprise. As I used my Tantric magic, I started to feel her tentative connection with the ruins slowly seeping into mine. </p><p>That was impressive. I knew Tantric magic was ancient magic, but I had always dismissed that as a statement of value. There were a lot of techniques that were ancient and still useless, only used to trick gullible people. I had assumed it belonged to the same category. </p><p>However, using those tricks on her, I could feel that it allowed me to build some kind of connection with the ruins… Interesting. I couldn’t help but remember some of the descriptions of Tantric, where they had been not only used by the priestess — in a manner that wasn’t dissimilar to what Sapphire had been doing while dancing — but also to officiate weddings and other bindings. </p><p>Could that be that easy, I thought as a possibility clicked in my mind. Luckily, testing it wouldn’t take any extra effort. </p><p> I turned my attention back to Audrum, enjoying her unbelievable throat around me while I continued to douse her body with my magic, and she continued to push forward … until I exploded in her throat, forcing her to swallow. </p><p>At the same time, I could feel a flicker of connection being established by the wards. An amazing start. </p><p>I pulled back, watching as she struggled to swallow without spilling. “Good girl,” I said even as I used magic for a recovery trick, and I was raging to go once again. “Now, warmup is over. Let’s start the real fun.” </p><p>She gasped as I pushed her to her feet, leaning against the wall, her ass pointing toward me. My shaft throbbed in excitement as she pushed her ass out, showing that she wanted it as much as I did. </p><p>I slipped into her wetness and she moaned. However, even as she cried, she pushed her ass out, taking more of my shaft, the temptation overwhelming her. There was only a brief pause once she hit her limits, but she just pulled back and repeated the move, breaking that limit. </p><p>That continued more and more, and soon, she found herself dealing with a different challenge, keeping her voice low enough not to deafen me. “Damn, girl, keep your voice down, or you’ll bring down the ruins.” </p><p>“N-not a problem. The ruins are stable enough,” she managed to answer between moans, which was far cheekier than I expected, but it only made it more fun. I let my overwhelming wave of arousal do the job and started rocking back and forth, her beautiful face giving me a range of expressions, each more beautiful than the last. </p><p>Despite the explosive moans she was putting on, she was barely able to take half of my length inside her, though she worked hard to increase that. I could have pushed forward recklessly for more, but watching her struggle with the amount was more fun. </p><p>Especially since I punished her failures with a spank. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t entirely passive. With a hand on the wall, I soon started to take control, pushing harder and harder. Soon, I was buried in her completely. It made her moans get even more intense, and the movement of her hips picked up even more. </p><p>They were still steady and rhythmic, which wasn’t shocking considering her dancing performance. Steady, but not monotone. Soon, my hands shifted to her shoulders, pinning her against the wall even better, and my hips started to move much harder. </p><p>“A - a second,” she gasped, and shocked by her request, I actually pulled back, wondering if I pushed her too much and misread the signal. </p><p>My concern turned empty, as she quickly turned toward me, her back against the wall, and jumped on my lap. Her legs were wrapped around my waist, once again showing the extent of her surprising strength, imprisoning me inside her. </p><p>Technically, escaping was not impossible, but it was too fun to stop. </p><p>Her moans rose once more as my hands slid away from her shoulders to her breasts while her body was comfortably locked between my body and the wall, her hips still moving with a shocking speed. </p><p>Her tightening declared her climax, and her trembling showed the growing impact… </p><p>I could have resisted the call, but I was too interested in testing the impact of the connection, so I let my body explode along with her, filling her insides … and along with it, I felt a growing connection. </p><p>I rapidly used Tantric to enhance the connection further. It was a tricky spell. What I was doing was replicating a half-remembered ancient marriage ritual, but I was hoping that it would work. </p><p>It worked … after a fashion. I could feel the connection with the ruins increasing … slowly, without a direct feeling of when it would end. </p><p>I decided to continue using the same trick. I leaned in for a searing kiss, but my hips continued to impale her without giving her a chance to recover, her wetness reaching a new height. </p><p>“Harder,” she begged once I pulled for a breather. I stopped instead. “Please,” she whispered. </p><p>“Only if you promise to be mine forever,” I whispered. If she was in a different mood, her reaction might have been different, and questioned the necessity of such words, especially in such dubious ruins. But. as the pleasure invaded her brain, she was quick to comply. </p><p>“As you wish,” she moaned. “I’m yours, forever, just fuck me harder, you magnificent bastard,” she cried.</p><p>I felt the connection between me and the ruins solidify, enough to understand that the ruins were trying to build an even stronger connection with her, but her lack of magical proficiency prevented that. </p><p>“And, here’s your reward,” I said as I grabbed her hips, and started drilling her mercilessly. </p><p>The sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the ruins, and I started walking around. With the connection between me and the ruins getting stronger, the traps and guards suddenly turned useless against me, their presence already suggested to me magically. </p><p>I could feel that, if the connection grew any further, I could just use that connection to push for more. Ultimately, I reached a large room, something between a throne room and a ritual chamber. A large chair that reminded me of a throne was in the middle, with runes and pictures rotating around them.</p><p>And, at the back of the room, I saw a surprising object. A large block of metal, with two dozens of Eternal Cores … an incredible discovery. </p><p>Feeling like taking some risk, I brought her to the chair, and started fucking her on it, partially as a point, and partially to enhance the connection even further. </p><p>A good choice, as I could feel the chair using its magic to check for authority like a key. I used Tantric to meld against her completely, and the chair detected her presence … and my magic. And, as the biggest benefit, the chair failed to understand the nature of the connection, and treated us as one being. </p><p>I settled on the chair, with Audrum on my lap, still jumping up and down to enjoy my presence…</p><p>And I focused on the magics of the ruins…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Someone has spent too much time with Cornelia —” I started, which was all I was able to say before Helga waved her hand, and her magic closed my mouth, silencing me. </p><p>“It’s punishment time, no talking,” she warned even as her hips started moving, riding me. I let out a muffled chuckle at the setup. Naturally, even if the spell she used was genius, she currently had access to a very limited amount of mana, and it couldn’t be compared to my reserves — and the less said about my ability to convert the mana from Aether, the better. </p><p>However, I didn’t use them, instead just struggled against the bonds physically. </p><p>To my shock, they were able to resist even as I applied enough Strength to reach twenty points. Impressive. </p><p>“You can’t escape without cheating with magic,” she declared smugly even as she put her hands on my chest, going back and forth, showing she was strongly underestimating my new physical abilities. </p><p>I let her continue to believe that. She earned the right for it, and I was happy to play at her own pace.  </p><p>Particularly, considering the enthusiastic dance she was conducting on my lap was less of a chore and more of an excellent sexy dream. It took her several moments to get into a pace and control her initial pleasure. </p><p>A cheeky smile bloomed across her face.</p><p>She raised her hips and brought them down with a sudden change of pace. A jolt of pleasure shot up my spine while she looked down at me smugly. “It’s not fun when you’re the one being played, is it?” she asked. </p><p>I certainly disagreed. I was having a lot of fun, but my mouth was blocked, so saying that was difficult. Instead, I looked up, enjoying the dance of her tits while her legs splayed on both sides of me while her wetness spread along my length. She had pulled out, and limited herself to gliding along my length after her initial desperate ride. </p><p>She clearly wanted to play with me just as well. </p><p>“Patience,” she delivered, trying to sound smug as she slid down even more, and took my length into her mouth, teasing the head. Pity she just sounded needy. She needed her orgasm even more than I did, her body trembling in anticipation. </p><p>She was cute, beautiful, and sexy at the same time. </p><p>God, I really missed her. </p><p>Unaware of my thoughts and focused on my shaft, she pulled back and breathed over my shaft, the sudden change making me shiver. Then, she returned sucking the sensitive head, treating it as a particularly sweet dish.</p><p>“ I figured you need some lazy pampering,” she whispered, though as I shifted my leg slightly so it rubbed against her wetness, she followed by a deep moan. “Naughty,” she gasped as she waved her hand, and two more chains appeared, this time along my legs. </p><p>Satisfied with her achievement, she went back to licking and suckling on my shaft, her fingers focusing on the base. </p><p>I tugged at the restraints playfully, acting like I was using the full range of my strength. She just chuckled. “You can’t escape those with brute force,” she whispered. “Too bad you’re behind in your magical studies, you naughty boy.” </p><p>The bindings had almost no give, holding my wrists spread, but it was her tone that made me shiver. She played the sexy yet disappointed teacher very well. </p><p>My body acted on its own, pushing my hips high just as her lips wrapped once again, touching at the entrance of her throat. She pulled back, and patted my chest playfully. “No need to be impatient,” she whispered, repeating my treatment earlier. </p><p>She clearly enjoyed having me tied and under her mercy.</p><p>I was tempted to let her play more. After all, she deserved a lot of rewards. Unfortunately for her, her last words made me even hornier than I expected … and more importantly, I knew she would enjoy the reversal just as much. </p><p>I tugged the magical chains once more, and she grinned smugly. </p><p>A smug grin that disappeared when her magical chains shattered. “I-impossible,” she gasped, but that was all she was able to say as I ripped off my gag as well. “Not impossible,” I said as I grabbed her and rolled, and she ended up under me, her wrists grabbed by my hands. “Just difficult.” </p><p>She smiled, which turned into panic as she realized a very important detail. There was no mana around her, not even a point she could use. “N-no,” she gasped. </p><p>“Did you know this barbarian discovered a way to create an anti-mana field,” I whispered. “A bit difficult to use in a practical manner, but very useful to teach a smug mage a lesson she couldn’t forget. </p><p>She flexed her muscles, trying to get out, her eyes wide as she stayed pinned. Though, as she struggled, it wasn’t despair that appeared on her face, but resignation. </p><p>And, intense arousal. </p><p>Even knowing it was impossible, she struggled to get free, each second making her feel a more intense arousal. She moaned as I pressed my shaft against her entrance, but she didn’t tense, clearly expecting me to tease her just like she had been doing. </p><p>I had a different plan in mind, one that was worthy of a barbarian who just captured a princess. I pushed hard, and her wetness swallowed me. </p><p>“It seems that you’re overestimating yourself against a barbarian warrior, you pitiful princess,” I said loudly. She might have answered, if it wasn’t for the moan that occupied her mouth. Instead, she undulated as best she could and squealed in delight as I impaled her mercilessly.</p><p>Invading her body with Tantric mana was almost an afterthought, hastening her binding. Too bad I couldn’t help her absorb Purified Spark without risking diluting the conceptual integrity of her merging. </p><p>Instead, I continued rocking my hips mercilessly, a simple move that I nonetheless turned into an art form despite its inherent simplicity. It wasn’t just an animalistic push, but a rough dance, the pace, the strength, the distance, all adding to her pleasure while I invaded her in reckless abandon. </p><p>There was only so much pleasure her body could endure before it succumbed to another orgasm, especially when she was as tense as she was. She closed her eyes, moans filling the room as the orgasm hit. </p><p>The healing spell I used ruined the barbarian role I was playing, but keeping her conscious was more important. </p><p>Her bleary eyes opened. “You haven’t blacked out and missed the fun, exalted mage,” I said mockingly, my grin wide enough to annoy her even under the circumstances. However, with my hips drilling ceaselessly, she didn’t have time to comment on that. </p><p>“You’re merciless,” she gasped. </p><p>“I know,” I whispered. “But you haven’t seen anything. After all, Strength is not my biggest stat…” </p><p>“And, what’s it?” </p><p>“Endurance,” I whispered. “Currently, it has sixty points.” </p><p>Her breath hitched when the implication of that number hit her, tensing in anticipation of pleasure. I continued banging her repeatedly, not giving her a chance to delude herself so that she could tire me out. </p><p>As her eyes closed to focus on the pleasure, she didn’t seem to be particularly against the idea. </p><p>I impaled her again and again, reshaping her wet hole for my presence once more. She just groaned and moaned, her body losing every hint of energy it possessed. She was limp and obedient. </p><p>Until another orgasm hit, and she involuntarily bucked against my hold despite the impossibility of getting free, earning a chuckle.</p><p>“You’re still acting out, maybe you deserve another punishment,” I whispered. Another small spell to cheat, this time to ready her backdoor entrance for my invasion, I pulled out, and slipped into her tightness. </p><p>The sudden intrusion was enough to earn a cry from her, which was a perfect mixture of pain and pleasure. “You’re nothing but an anal slut for my barbaric cock, you pitiful mage,” I growled. </p><p>“No, I’m not pitiful,” she gasped. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, and suddenly, I flipped once more before letting her hands go free. “Here, I stopped. Are you saying that you have the willpower to just pull back?” </p><p>“You’re a fucking bastard,” she growled, but that was all she said before she put her hands on my chest, using it as leverage as she rode me desperately, doing her best to climax from anal penetration. With her panting and trembling, it didn’t take long for her to reach another climax. </p><p>This time, she wasn’t alone. As the orgasm hit her and her ass tightened around me, I exploded in her as well, filling her with my seed. </p><p>She collapsed against my chest, barely conscious. “You’re such an evil man,” she growled. “You’re lucky that I love you.” </p><p>“I love you too,” I answered, hugging her as she fell asleep, the emotional highs and physical challenges finally catching up with her. She earned her rest. </p><p>I closed my eyes as well, but for me, there was no sleep. </p><p>I still needed to plan her divine domain. We could afford no mistake with her fate. </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 45</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 33269}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 700  Mana: 2000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“… so, you’re saying I’m now an actual divine entity,” Helga murmured as she lay in front of me, while I massaged her body. Partially to help her merge with her divine spark successfully, but more to continue touching her after our intense embrace. </p><p>As much as I wanted to continue, she needed a break. Not physically, as that was easy to bypass with magic, but mentally. As much as meeting again was elating for her, she still needed to process living in magical suspension for months, and experienced a close call with death due to an unforeseen magical complication with the wards. </p><p>So, while I massaged her naked body, I had given her a breakdown of my experiences, both the events that happened since my disappearance, and some of the pertinent details I had hidden from her during our encounters. </p><p>She took them better than I expected, which implied that their lives hadn’t been particularly easy in my absence — not that I needed evidence for that with the state of Silver Spires. </p><p>“Oh, you have always been a goddess for me,” I answered, which made her chuckle. </p><p>“You are a shameless flatterer,” she said, trying to complain, but it was hard to do with my hand caressing her sides gently. “I’m sure I can’t compare to that elven goddess.” </p><p>“Oh, someone is feeling jealous,” I said with a chuckle, leaning down to kiss her neck, and making her moan. “So cute,” I murmured as I pulled back, enjoying her shuffle. “But no need to be jealous. You’re already a pseudo-goddess, and we just need to find a location for you to complete the transformation to get away.” </p><p>“Does that mean we need to escape this plane?” she asked. </p><p>I frowned. ‘That, I don’t know yet. Running away is certainly safer, but that also means months of travel at best. Primordial Aether is not the friendliest place. Maybe hiding in plain sight is the better option, but for that, I need to know what exactly happened after my disappearance.” </p><p>“Actually, there’s not much I could tell,” Helga admitted. “We pulled back to Silver Spires after your warning, and organized the defenses. It was a good thing that we did, as it took just a day for the biggest monster horde we had seen to attack, sieging us nonstop for a month, and the moment we defeated it, they were replaced by the royal army.” </p><p>“Let me guess, they were much stronger than you expected,” I added. </p><p>“Yes, it was probably the Eternals supporting them directly,” Helga admitted. “That was much harder to defeat, but somehow, we still managed to do so … but then, the System changed a month ago, giving us several levels, a lot of achievements, enhanced mana and HP regeneration, and promises for even more.” </p><p>“As long as you provided Divine Spark to it,” I said. Helga nodded. “I’m guessing you were the one that discovered the true source of Divine Spark and built that ward to steal the generated fragments from the main System.” </p><p>“Yes,” Helga said proudly, then wilted. “But it backfired. When we started absorbing the sparks directly, the Eternals decided to take a direct approach, and attacked with a small army of level-forty soldiers, each carrying weapons we had never seen before. Our wards were strong, and we managed to resist at first… But then, the System stopped.” </p><p>“Yes, that’s a nasty trick they have,” I said. </p><p>“I was in the middle of casting a Spark-Powered ward, so the sudden loss hit me particularly hard. I barely managed to ask the Princess to bring me to the safe house and set the wards, and I lost consciousness before I could arrive. The last thing I remember is a magical message from Titania, saying that they were trying to escape.” </p><p>“They are still alive. I can still feel them,” I explained. “I’m hoping that they are also free, as the search for them is still ongoing, but that, we can’t be sure about. It’s also likely that the Eternals captured them but didn’t bother actually informing the source.” </p><p>“And what are we going to do?” she asked. </p><p>I sighed even as I caressed her spine, making her shiver. “It’s your call. Retreating and finding a fragmented plane is the safest option. We can make your bond with the plane and strengthen you slowly, safe from intervention.” </p><p>“But it’s not the only option,” she commented, too smart not to notice my phrasing. </p><p>“No, we can also stay here, and you can bond with the area under the darkness ward. It should be enough to empower you to the next stage, and we could enhance the current ward to be more efficient and provide you with constant Divine Sparks from the school, especially if go and focus on the recovery of the school. But there are a lot of risks in doing so. I don’t know what would happen if the darkness ward ever breaks down, but I can’t imagine it being pretty.” </p><p>“We’re going to stay and save them,” Helga declared bravely, not waiting for even a second. </p><p>“My brave goddess,” I said as I kissed her. I wasn’t surprised by her decision, but that didn’t mean I wasn’t impressed. Not everyone could risk their lives directly for their friends — and I had no doubt that, they become even better friends under the constant siege. </p><p>“It’s only right—“ she started, only to gasp as I flipped her, and she ended up on her back, her beautiful breasts once again in my sight. </p><p>“Just because it’s right doesn’t mean people would do it,” I said even as I cupped her breasts, enjoying her moan. “It means you deserve a reward.” </p><p>“Oh, a reward,” she whispered. “Is it any better than your earlier reward?” </p><p>“Certainly,” I said as I caressed her curves, her stomach contracting as her body trembled in anticipation. “Earlier was a frantic greeting because I missed you. This is going to be a reward for my most beautiful and most knowledgeable goddess.” </p><p>“You’re exaggerating,” she whispered, followed by a moan as I tweaked her nipple. </p><p>“Oh, really? The only way to bond with a divine spark is to have the perfect alignment with it,” I explained. “Consider what it says about you to have such a unique alignment with something that I could only classify as the Spark of Knowledge.” </p><p>“I … I don’t know,” she whispered, blushing shyly. It was good to see that, despite everything that happened, she was still shy enough to maintain her cuteness. </p><p>“Now, to the reward,” I said as I caressed her breasts before moving down, my movements getting less erotic and more patient. Her eyes widened as she realized what would follow. “That doesn’t feel like a reward,” she whispered. </p><p>“Nonsense, you’ll relax, and we’ll make sure you’re properly bonded with your Spark in the process. Don’t you want to be healthy so I won’t worry?” </p><p>“You’re playing dirty,” she growled. </p><p>I just chuckled. “Oh, sweetie. Did you forget? I always play dirty.” She moaned. “And, why are you complaining? It’s not like you don’t like it.” </p><p>“… maybe,” she whispered, followed by another moan. As my hands danced on her body, Tantric mana infused her body, not only allowing the Divine Spark to meld into her body perfectly, but also resolving the tightness of her muscles and healing the hidden dangers and blockages. </p><p>And, as I worked her body, Helga moaned repeatedly, but stayed passive, letting me enjoy the show of her naked body once more. Soon, my focus was on the light perspiration she was developing, highlighting the beautiful contours of her curvy body, from her pouty lips to her shapely hips. </p><p>Pity I had already committed to teasing her, as I was already raging for another taste. “Now, let’s change your pose,” I said as I flipped her once more, but this time, I didn’t let her lay. Instead, I let her tense her arms and legs while pulling her up, making her create a triangle. </p><p>A very sexy, naked triangle, with her hips tensing even further. “Now, don’t move,” I warned her as I dragged my fingers along her inner thigh, close to her core. The way her legs trembled tempted me to cut this little game close, but I managed to reject that call. </p><p>Barely. </p><p>“Slide your foot further,” I told her instead while I caressed her inner thigh again, my mana circling inside her, removing the remaining signs of System from her body. I doubted that those fragments would do anything, but it was always better safe than sorry. </p><p>Though, I didn’t keep myself from teasing her. I pushed her to more and more tempting poses, which challenged me more than I was expecting, but it was good to see her frustrated expression. </p><p>I missed teasing her. </p><p>Ten minutes later, her beautiful slender fingers curled over my shoulders and pushed me down. Her strength was barely more than an ordinary person, which was shocking considering she had already bounded with her Divine Spark, and it should have worked enough to empower her. </p><p>But it seemed that the distorted nature of her spark didn’t enhance her physically, leaving her vulnerable. </p><p>However, she was quick to show that while the physical enhancement might have been limited, the exact opposite worked for her magical attitude. Two magical chains appeared and pulled me down, pinning me on the ground, their structure completely novel … and more importantly, rapidly shifting as she experimented on them. </p><p>Her experimental capabilities had enhanced greatly, but I wasn’t able to talk about that, as she used my bound state to climb on top of me. “My turn,” she growled as she pushed herself down, her warmth wrapping around my girth. </p><p>She was impatient. </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 45</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 33269}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 700  Mana: 2000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Fuck, you weren’t joking when you were bragging about us lasting all night, weren’t you,” Megan moaned as she pulled up her head. We were still in the middle of nowhere, but that was about to come to an end as I dragged her into the car. </p><p>“Let’s spice things up a bit, things are getting a bit monotone,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, yes, very monotone,” Megan answered playfully. “Just three hours of intense sex, public sex, with more orgasms than I could count. Just a casual weekday.” </p><p>I chuckled even as I gently placed her into the passenger seat, while her clothing floated to the backseat under the effects of the telekinesis. I was impressed that she somehow managed to sound bitchy even after that chain of explosive orgasms. </p><p>“Yes, that’s why the next one, you’re going to actually earn,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, what’s the rules of this little challenge,“ she said quickly even as I sat in the driver’s seat, equally naked. </p><p>“The rules of the game are very simple. I would be driving aimlessly, and you would be doing your best to make me cum. And, whenever you make me cum, I’ll make you cum as well.” </p><p>Her eyes widened in excitement, which was certainly not a surprise. I had seen the way she drove, and she was certainly a speed devil, and the setup was certainly a challenge for her. “Just no cheating,” she said. </p><p>“Define cheating,” I countered. </p><p>“No using magic to prevent yourself from cumming,” she defined. </p><p>“Certainly,” I said, accepting her deal. Another day, I might have used my tricks to see just how far I pushed her, but tonight was a celebration of my first successful Acolyte, and I wanted to reward her.</p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean her job would be easy. “Just make sure to hold on,” I said as I started driving. </p><p>“And you just make sure we don’t crash,” she warned back, but the speed she leaned toward me showed she didn’t have a particular concern about that aspect. </p><p>I started driving slowly — relatively, barely at seventy miles — while she settled into her new position, her fingers wrapped around the base of my shaft, finally testing the length and thickness calmly after our frantic rutting. “A bit small, isn’t it,” she commented, trying to be a bitchy tease. Her words would have been more effective if her fingers could have met around my girth …</p><p>Or, she hadn’t spent the last few hours reaching double-digits in her orgasm counter. </p><p>I just chucked as she leaned further, amused to see desire still shining in her eyes after everything, her fingers dancing back and forth gently. “How interesting. Why don’t you prove it?” I challenged. </p><p>“Of course, how do you want me to prove it?” she asked. </p><p>“If it’s that small, taking it all shouldn’t be a challenge,’ I said, enjoying the way her eyes widened as I put my hands on her shoulders. I could have pushed her down, but I wanted to watch her struggle in her power, so I pulled back after a momentary caress. </p><p>“Of course not,” she answered. Her voice wasn’t as confident as she intended, but that didn’t prevent her from leaning down and capturing my length bravely. Megan might be a lot of things … but a coward, she was not.  </p><p>So, she took my girth bravely even if she had to open her mouth to the limit, sinking down with a sudden aggressiveness. Just a push was enough to take it halfway in. </p><p>An excellent start. </p><p>While she moved up and down, I decided to multitask. Particularly, I wanted to experiment with my car. I had been surprised by the sudden performance it had during the collusion with an armored car, and I wanted to test the limits. </p><p>Spreading my Intent over the car had been easy, allowing me to connect to the car better. It wasn’t suddenly like a new body part, but more of a mental HUD that fed me accurate information about the various aspects and the condition of the car. I focused on the scratches on the side, curious whether my recovery trick would work. </p><p>It did not … but I could feel that I wasn’t too far away. A task for the future. </p><p>Instead, I pressed the gas, suddenly pushing the car to its limits. The sensation of sudden speed was amazing, and I wasn’t the only one enjoying the change if Megan’s sudden change was any indicator. </p><p>Her eyes flashed with desire mixed with fear as she took me fully into her mouth, pumping as fast as she could manage, her gags ringing against the backdrop of the engine noise. It would have been a crazy and reckless thing to do without my supernatural powers, with an accident enough to ruin both of our lives. </p><p>But with magic, it was just a thrilling roller-coaster ride. </p><p>“Do you want me to go faster?” I asked her. </p><p>She pulled back, and paused for a moment to suppress her gasps. “What are you talking about, I know all the parts you have used for your rust-bucket, we’re already going at the limit of what’s possible.” </p><p>I chuckled even as I pushed her hair away from her hair gently, a touch that turned domineering as I grabbed her hair hard enough to make her yelp. “Oh, sweetie, did you forget I have magic,” I reminded her as I pushed her down. </p><p>I didn’t need to keep my hand there as she continued pushing down. Soon, she was doing her best to devour my length, while I pumped even more Intent to the car, and soon, it reached a speed that could be comparable to a supercar. </p><p>And, making turns even a supercar would have failed on the poorly maintained empty interstate highway, giving me a sense of the enhancement. In some sense, I could feel that I was granting temporary traits to the car, Speed and Agility in particular. </p><p>They worked similarly to how they did for me when I received my first Traits when I started playing football, allowing a temporary rejection of physics. For example, it should have been impossible to take such a sharp turn while going faster than three-hundred-and-fifty miles, but not only I managed to take that turn, but also I grabbed Megan’s shoulder to keep her in place so she could continue deep-throating me with a passion that shocked me. </p><p>It turned out physics-breaking speed was her weakness. Her body slid back and forth as her tits smashed against my legs, allowing her to take me in fully without straining her neck. To admit the truth, I loved the sensation as well, and exploded into her mouth far quicker than I would have otherwise. </p><p>Luckily, not too soon, as the moment I exploded into her mouth, she started trembling, climaxing without even touching herself. </p><p>I slowed before her trembling could even subside. “Good girl,” I said as she struggled to swallow the last drops, but before she could say anything else, I pulled her on my lap, already raging to go, not bothering to stop. </p><p>And, started fucking her while going just at the edge of two hundred. </p><p>“Faster!” she moaned as she jumped on my lap repeatedly, taking me deep into her wetness once again. “You owe me another orgasm.” </p><p>“I pay my debts,” I answered. I didn’t know her request for me to go faster was about driving faster, or moving my hips faster. To be on the safe side, I did both, and her cries filled the car, loud enough to suppress the sound of the engine. </p><p>Her eyelids closed firmly as she cried repeatedly, appreciating the incredible fucking she was receiving, just as much as I was enjoying her tightness. “Faster,” she moaned once again.” </p><p>“Are you sure you can handle it, my sexy partner in crime?” I said, but I didn’t even wait for a response as I pumped my hips up mercilessly, giving an even rougher treatment. Just like that, her moans lost any sense of control and moderation, turning animalistic. </p><p>Her fingernails dug into my shoulders, hard enough to hurt, and I responded by fucking her even harder, using the wheel for leverage to push even deeper, only my supernatural abilities preventing a disaster. </p><p>She was close to the edge, and her mind was losing all cohesion, but she still responded by letting her instincts take over and impaling herself deeper in a beastly fury. I had to admit, I was surprised. I would have expected to be calmer. </p><p>Her constant acting to maintain her popularity must have been even more of a challenge than I guessed. </p><p>“You’re mine, Megan,” I growled as I exploded into her, and even as I did so, I felt the Acolyte bond solidify further, not just from my demand, but also from her acceptance. The difference was stark. Earlier, it could be snapped. </p><p>Now, it was permanent. </p><p>I wondered if she knew exactly how deep she found herself in the situation, but that was a question for another time. Now, I exploded into her, celebrating the sudden turn of events… </p><p>It was truly Divine… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, we’re celebrating your divine ascension,” I said with a chuckle once she pulled for a breather. </p><p>“Don’t be — a smartass,” she growled back, trying to sound angry, but the arousal she was developing at the courtesy of my touch was enough to erase her anger and replace it with desire. “That’s a terrible idea with everything going on. What if the police…” </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as she tried to argue against me while her hips pushed against mine, dry humping desperately. It reminded me of her first lap dance, delivered as a show to the public and a punishment for me, leaving me aching. </p><p>Also the other encounters, like the photoshoot, where I had left her equally frustrated. </p><p>We had a fun little game, but it was time to finally end it. I captured her lips, enjoying the dance of her tongue intensely while I enjoyed her tight ass dance against my hips while her legs stayed wrapped around me … all the while, we continued to float. </p><p>I could have undressed her with my hands, but I felt like showing off, so I used telekinesis to get rid of her clothes, leaving her in her underwear, a sexy black set that contrasted greatly with her beautiful innocent skin. </p><p>“So, aren’t you risking a lightning bolt using your divine skills like this,” she asked when she pulled back for a breather. </p><p>“I don’t know, but not likely. Apparently, the Greek gods are real, and if even a tenth of the stories about them are accurate, they don’t really have a problem using their divine gifts for sex.” I followed with a bite to her neck, and she moaned, her back arching. </p><p>“An existential crisis to deal with. Just what every girl needs while having sex. Excellent choice,” she responded, doing her best to sound sarcastic. Unfortunately for her, sarcasm didn’t work well with a voice throaty with pleasure. </p><p>“What can I say, I’m doing my best to keep things fun,” I said even as I licked the nape of her neck. Her back arched once more, her words gone, and I let my gaze fall, enjoying her fair skin and impressive curves. She wasn’t exactly stacked, but the curves she had were sculpted to perfection.   </p><p>I wasn’t the only one distracted by the presence of some naked skin, as Megan was equally hungry as she traced my muscles, multitasking her moans. As she shifted, my raging erection was pressing against her stomach, rather noticeable in its presence. “You’re overdressed,” she growled, and pushed my underwear down, leaving me naked. </p><p>“Oh, naughty—“ I started, but this time, it was me that was interrupted by a moan as Megan sank down, taking my length without even bothering to remove her panties, just sliding them to the side. </p><p>“Less talk, more work. Don’t forget that you’re an employee!” she growled as she pushed down. </p><p>I might have been annoyed at her attempts to look dominant, but with her hair sticking on her sweaty face and with her eyes wide with pleasure, she looked even more vulnerable than the first time she realized the true extent of my power over hers. And, I was nice enough to let her maintain that fiction to gain her confidence. </p><p>For a while, at least. </p><p>“Let me worship then, boss,” I said as I tightened my grip around her hips, enjoying her ass, taking a moment to flick my fingers to rip off her panties. They weren’t exactly made of the strongest fabric, but the ease I did was enough to show the extent of my physical strength. </p><p>A detail she didn’t miss if the phenomenal tightness that followed was any indicator. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I tightened my grip, supporting the desperate rocking of her hips. “So, boss, tell me, just how long you have been dreaming of taming your poor employee,” I asked. </p><p>“Jerk,” she murmured, but still answered. “Far too long, but it’s unbearable since that cursed photoshoot. That whore Kimberly didn’t make it any easier by constantly bragging about your cock. I was sure that she had exaggerated. It had to be magical for it to be that amazing…” </p><p>“But it turned out the magic is real,” I chuckled as I pushed hard, earning a beautiful cry that echoed in the emptiness around us. </p><p>“Bastard,” she insulted once more, but her words disappeared once again once I added two fingers to the balance, twisting her nipples alternatingly. </p><p>“S-slow down, you bastard,” she gasped soon. “If you go that hard, I won’t last long, and I don’t want this to be quick.” </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, you’re forgetting something,” I said even as I dragged my fingers along her spine, the sudden gentleness of touch enough to trigger a very explosive climax. She rocked on my hips desperately, her hold weakening…</p><p>Her response came a minute later, which she used to recover from her explosive climax. “What am I forgetting, you magnificent bastard,” she said. </p><p>“That you have supernatural powers as well.” Her eyes widened. “Don’t worry, beautiful, not lasting long is the least of your concerns. Perks of divine lovemaking.” </p><p>“Oh, not bad,” she answered, trying to sound nonchalant, but it died a quick death when an aftershock of tremble hit and it turned into a moan. “I can see the benefits of keeping you on the side…” </p><p>I chuckled, but it was a dark one. “Oh, baby, if you think I’ll let you go after everything, you’re sorely mistaken. The moment you returned to defend my life, you signed yourself to me. I won’t ever let you go!” </p><p>“You think you can tame me—“ she gasped, but I bit her shoulder playfully, making her gasp, but it also left a mark. ”You’re a barbarian,” she added, but her voice was filled with desire. </p><p>It seemed that she wasn’t exactly torn up about the implied permanency of the issue. </p><p>A nice session of sex was always useful … though, admittedly, granting divine powers to her might have played a slight role as well. Certainly a better gift than an emerald ring. </p><p>Certainly far more permanent.  </p><p>“I think that’s enough rest,” I said with a chuckle even as I pushed. </p><p>“That’s too fast,” Megan gasped, her beautiful blonde hair dancing as she threw her head back, but the way her back arched and her utter lack of an attempt to stop me suggested that she wasn’t as against the second round as she wanted to admit. </p><p>I started drilling into her harder and harder, enjoying the pace. “So, to make you stronger, we need to make you famous,” I said. </p><p>“Really—“ she gasped. “That’s the time you want to talk strategy.” </p><p>“Oh, we can always talk later if you don’t think you can handle it,” I said, the challenge enough to awaken her competitive side. I liked Megan best when she was competitive, fighting for verbal domination. </p><p>“Of course, I can handle it,” she answered, managing to deliver her sentence in one block despite my drilling. “But what exactly does it have to do with me being famous.” </p><p>“Oh, here’s a summary of my discoveries…” I started, and delivered her a short and intense summary of how emotions of the public worked wonders to enhance our powers, and how certain intense emotions like elation of victory, jealousy, and anger worked … all the while drilling her into near-stupor. She climaxed once again, and only a jolt of recovery energy kept her conscious. </p><p>“So, we need to make people jealous,” she murmured. “Maybe I should start dating —“ she started. </p><p>“Be careful,” I warned, growling threateningly as I did so. I knew that she was teasing me, but that didn’t mean that I would let her. I was feeling very possessive after linking her with the System. </p><p>“… with a woman,” she added, her smile playful. “I’ll start dating a sexy model publicly, and will come out as bisexual,” she added. “That way, bigots will be scandalized, and a lot of incompetent men would start dreaming about what they couldn’t have, especially coming from a young businesswoman.” </p><p>I thought a bit, and found it far more palatable. “At least the visits will be far more entertaining,” I said, amused to see this time it was her that had a flash of jealousy.</p><p>“No, I have a name in mind, but there will be nothing going on between us. It’ll be a purely business deal for the media. She’s very straight,” Megan explained quickly, showing that she wasn’t ready to go in that direction. But, something in the way she said that gave me an interesting clue. </p><p>“And, who’s this candidate that you came up with very quickly.” </p><p>“Jane Stacy, an old friend,” Megan answered, even though she looked very reluctant to reveal that name. I was not very familiar with the modeling scene, but the name was quick to pop up. An absolutely stacked redhead model, and one of the most popular names in the country. An excellent name to gather a lot of Intent quickly, probably enough to match all the Intent I had been gathering from the football games. </p><p>It was good to see revealing my secret to Megan was not a wrong choice. She was quickly shaping up to be an excellent second-in-command. I couldn’t wait until she applied her enhanced abilities to the business arena. </p><p>But, the implied potential for the future was certainly not enough to prevent me from teasing her. “Oh, poor little Megan failed to seduce her friend. Don’t worry, your faithful employee is here to help you. Don’t worry, I’ll do my best to help you get a taste of that sexy redhead…” </p><p>“I’ll kill you,” Megan gasped, but her anger was impossible to maintain as I exploded inside her, filling her with my seed while triggering another spectacular orgasm… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Anna Presley was one of the most successful businesswomen in the country, a fact she had leveraged not only for her benefit but also for her fun several times. </p><p>Her particular favorite, teaching lessons to younger, less successful businesswomen about the true face of the business. Some blamed her for being anti-women, but she disagreed. She was just helping them to learn about the true face of the business. </p><p>If she wasn’t the one acting as their teacher, they would learn their lesson in a far more humiliating manner than losing their pansy, weak husbands and boyfriends. Oh, there was no doubt that she loved toying with their significant other until she got bored … but ultimately, she was doing them a favor. </p><p> A favor that was bouncing back in a very unexpected way…</p><p>Until this fateful day, she never had any problem treating her boyfriend as she wished. After all, for her target to even dare to talk to her significant other about her naughty offer, she needed to be the dominant side of the relationship, with a man making less caring about maintaining his girlfriend’s financial wellbeing. And, it meant that she could easily dominate and break the men in question … just a frown or two, maybe a subtle threat. </p><p>But, as two fingers slipped into her wetness, invading her pelvis in a way she hadn’t felt for a long time, she was ready to admit that, maybe she had made a mistake. </p><p>“T-this is …” she managed to say, turning to moan. </p><p>“Yes, this is wrong,” he said, finishing her sentence, and for a moment, she thought he would pull back. Instead, he just changed position, and attacked her folds with his other hands while his body pressed against hers, using his fingers in a way she had never felt before. Strong, rough, and determined, but never enough to lose sight of the pleasure. </p><p>“I — we can’t do it here,” Anna moaned, though even as the words escaped her mouth, she hated herself. That was not the statement she should be making. She should be asking him to stop, not change locations.</p><p>Still, for a moment, she hoped it worked when he helped her to stand up. “Here you go,” he said. </p><p>But, her legs, trembling with excitement, betrayed her, and she was about to stumble when he hugged her from behind, his hand far too low to be appropriate. She put her hand above his, but she was unable to pull it away, her fingers rebelling. </p><p>“Oh, thanks for the help—“ she tried to say, doing her best to act normal, but his fingers started dancing in her core, and that died a quick death. </p><p>“Don’t worry, Madam Presley. No need to thank me yet. There’s a lot of things I will do to you, just like I promised to my girlfriend…” </p><p>Anna felt shocked, unable to believe how such a simple misunderstanding could push things to such an absurd situation. When her legs stopped trembling, she moved away. He let her, but his fingers stayed in her core, still fingering her. </p><p>Each pump of his thick fingers drove her crazy. </p><p>She let him do what for a minute … or maybe more, the time passed weirdly in that moment, but soon, she spoke once more. “I think that’s enough with the fingers,” she managed to whisper, ready to stop things. </p><p>She loved the feelings, but she was not ready to surrender control. No matter what. </p><p>“You’re right, Madam,” he said, but, unlike what she expected, he grabbed her arms and pushed her forward, before shifting one hand to her throat, his hold burning. “It’s time for the real treat.” </p><p>“T-this is absurd,” she said, but that was all she was able to say as he pressed his crotch against her ass, showing just how big of a monster he packed. Normally, she wasn’t exactly obsessed with size, but when combined with his attitude, it was breaking her resistance in a shocking manner. </p><p>“Of course not, sweetie. Why waste the private beach,” he said, and she found herself pressing against the bed once more, unable to answer. There was no mirror, but she was sure her expression was dazed, on the edge of a collapse.</p><p>Not exactly something that she was ready to show. </p><p>“Now, let’s open those beautiful legs,” he ordered, as if he fully expected her to follow that order. She was rather surprised when she climbed completely before her legs widened, obeying him just like she expected. </p><p>Behind her, a shuffle reached her ear. She glimpsed back, and saw that he was packing a monster even bigger than she expected. </p><p>“Now, Madam Presley. Let’s see if your pussy can handle the checks your mouth continuously keeps writing,” he said, unable to keep himself from mocking her as he pressed his shaft against her entrance. Her eyes widened as she took the size of his shaft once more. </p><p>“That…” she said, her voice bruised. “That’s a big monster.” </p><p>“I’m sure a woman of your caliber could easily handle it, Madam,” Darion said, this time his mocking tone impossible to hide, telling Anna just how badly he played her. But any answer she might have died as he pushed forward, his shaft parting her core. </p><p>She was not a virgin, far from it. But his size wasn’t exactly easy to handle, and worse was his merciless attitude. She grunted in shock and pleasure while he pushed aggressively, invading her. </p><p>Anna felt like she was lost in her mind as she felt his great shaft disappear into her core, letting it happen rather than asking him to stop. She didn’t know how to assess that, but the pleasure was unmistakable. </p><p>As he continued to push, those thoughts fell to the wayside, invading her core aggressively, The phenomenal level of wetness she managed to acquire was the only thing that was keeping it from turning into a disaster. </p><p>She didn’t remember the last time she got this wet. </p><p>Yet, she found herself opening her legs even more, allowing him easier access. </p><p>“You’re not bad when it came to flexibility, especially for a woman of your age,” he commented. Any other time, a comment about her age would summon hell, but now, she just moaned despite the shame filling her whole being. </p><p>She was being dominated, and she loved it. </p><p>The existential crisis that triggered was immense, but not enough to ask him to stop. Even with the pain that accompanied it, it was the greatest pleasure she had ever felt, and she found it impossible to stop halfway. </p><p>She closed her eyes, enjoying the feeling, even when he flipped, and she found herself on her back, with her legs on his shoulders. “Flexible indeed,” he mocked as his hips moved, exploding against her ass, each hit echoing in the empty beach club. </p><p>And worse, she couldn’t even blame the alcohol for it as she didn’t drink a drop. It was pure pleasure, working wonders to create an even stronger haze…</p><p>Turning her into an observer in her own body.</p><p>“Please,” Anna whispered once she found herself halfway raised. </p><p>“Please what, bitch,” he said as he slapped her thigh, the sound echoing in the opening. </p><p>“Please, fuck me harder,” she begged, unable to suppress the shame that followed. </p><p>“As you wish, Madam Presley,” he said mockingly, each word hitting her harder than the spanks that accompanied those words, leaving her thighs bright red. </p><p>“Please, sir,” she whispered, hating the fact that those words were affecting her worse than the treatment she was receiving. </p><p>And, then the climax hit, far stronger than she was used to. Combined with the shame and heat, she collapsed. “Pity, you didn’t even make me cum,” he said, disdainful. “You’re lucky that Mia is here to finish what you started, Madam,” he said, and walked away. </p><p>Leaving a dazed and confused Anna Presley behind.</p>",

At first, I thought that she was a prisoner, but a detailed diagnosis showed that none of the spells actually kept her unconscious, just supported her life functions, and kept her alive. </p><p>At the same time, it drained some mana from Helga to maintain the wards, channeling some through a Darkness Spark — leftover from the large ward the headmistress employed —  to make sure both wards stood strong. </p><p>The caster of those spells was the same, likely the princess through one of her clones once again. The caster’s intent was good … but misguided, I realized, as while I was working on the wards, I watched the darkness ward slowly adding Divine Sparks to Helga.</p><p>That didn’t surprise me as much as it should have. After all, even before it finally deserted me, writing me off for dead or lost, I knew that my System was doing its best to use me as some kind of vector to gather more Divine Spark, and it wasn’t too shocking that it focused on my Companions once that was not an option. </p><p>Maybe it was what the princess was thinking. Helga would continue to absorb Divine Spark and channel it to the mysterious real owner, and it would help Helga in turn. </p><p>Unfortunately, from the shoddy construction of the wards, it was clear that she didn’t have much time to build the hideout … and that meant she also didn’t think about how the darkness ward would interact with the situation. </p><p>I was almost sure that, at first, darkness ward didn’t stop the spark from being drained. Unfortunately, that was a temporary situation. As the wards got stronger due to their connection with Helga, the darkness ward got strong enough to cut the connection completely. I was sure that those wards weren’t built by the same person who built the genius collection aspect.  </p><p>Which prevented the System from draining the Spark from Helga. A troubling situation. </p><p>But just troubling, and not desperate. After all, as far as I could understand, I was the closest thing to an expert on divinity, with the perfect toolkit to solve the issues. </p><p>I was tempted to cure her … but I decided against it. “No hurry,” I murmured. I needed to do this right, not quick. After some consideration, decided to focus on the wards at first. I cut Helga’s connection with the outer wards and took it for myself, feeling a remote connection with the Darkness Spark. </p><p>It was truly a pitiful fragment, barely half a point, but still, it was enough to convert the pure mana of the System with decent efficiency. And, it was even better with my overly purified mana, especially after I focused on making it as malleable as possible. Unlike the System-provided mana, I didn’t care to make it usable without transformation.</p><p>Still, I spent two hours carefully feeding the ward while also working on its structure. It was the first time I was working on such a complex darkness ward on my own, but I had some impressions from the past. More importantly, forty-five points of intelligence were no joke, and they allowed me to solve the complicated problems inherent in the structure with shocking efficiency. </p><p>And, two hours later, the area turned into an impenetrable area that the System couldn’t hope to penetrate, a small safe house that I could focus on immediately. </p><p>Only then, I allowed myself to walk toward Helga, and dispelled all the spells that were holding her in place before looking inward to her soul space. </p><p>It was a chaotic mess. Her original, System-granted soulspace was damaged beyond repair, and while I could see the hints of a new one trying to grow out of her companion node, it was nowhere near successful, damaged by the free-flowing Divine Spark fragments. </p><p>Fragments that were far more crowded than I expected … hundreds of points worth in my measures. And, the only reason that didn’t kill Helga already was the partial bond she managed to achieve with some of the Divine Spark … a shocking achievement. </p><p>Even as I slowly purified those connections, I tried to understand the nature of the Divine Spark that had been collected by her …  it was a different shape than the others, with a certain purity that was very similar to pure mana. </p><p>It was hard to identify the Spark, but the taste of it gave me a similar feeling to how Heglga thought. A desperate search for knowledge … the search for truth. And, unlike the other sparks I played with, it lacked the aspect of domination. </p><p>For convenience, I decided on a name. </p><p>Knowledge Spark. </p><p>With that decision, I started the slow, methodical process of capturing every single fragmented spark, purifying the excess, useless components. As, not every fragment carried her search for truth and knowledge as purely. </p><p>With those cleansed, the amount she had finally dropped below a hundred, the remainder taken by me. </p><p>{+349 Purified. Spark}</p><p>Not because of my greed, but because I wanted her to have something closest to the concept she managed to extract. The ward she had built to collect them had been very selective, and I didn’t want to ruin her plans by meddling too much. </p><p>Instead, I carefully modulated the absorption of the Divine Spark, while at the same time, I cleansed every little bit of the System and Companion process from her body, locking them behind a fake soulspace that would still give the impression that Helga was unconscious. </p><p>In case the wards fail they could detect her once again. </p><p>I didn’t need them polluting the complicated process of her first proper Divine step. </p><p>Another hour, and her eyes fluttered open. A fascinating sight, especially since I could see her eyes glowing with an intensity that I missed. “T-tell me it’s not a dream,” she whispered, her voice throaty. </p><p>I would have told her that, but it soon turned impossible. My lips were silenced by hers as she slammed her lips against mine with a desperation that shocked me, her hands gripping my hair as hard as she could manage without her stats. </p><p>I barely registered the pragmatic differences in her body as her legs wrapped around my waist, and she desperately grabbed me, doing her best to increase contact between us. </p><p>Who was I to disappoint my favorite nerd, I decided as I cast a simple spell, making my clothes melt off my body, leaving her alone and ready for more. </p><p>She clearly missed me as much as I missed her, as she moved her hips higher without the slightest hint of resistance, her thick thighs tightening around my waist, her core dragging around my length, getting wetter by each second. </p><p>She trembled desperately as she did so, not just excitement but also exhaustion, showing her haphazard recovery system hadn’t been very effective. </p><p>With a kiss, I flooded her body with pseudo-HP even as I let my hands drift down through her sides until they landed on her delicious thighs, supporting her up. “Better?” I asked. </p><p>She nodded enthusiastically, not trusting herself to talk, immediately returning to the kiss. </p><p>I just chuckled as my fingers tightened on her ass while I slowly lowered her down, ignoring my usual habit of teasing. Her excitement, once clear as a day, was too beautiful to darken with frustration after such a long departure. </p><p>She wanted to remind herself that I returned. “Faster,” she moaned as she pushed her trembling legs down, taking me deeper inside. She let out a guttural moan, and I found myself being pushed on the floor, Helga firmly sitting on my shaft. “I missed you so much, you bastard,” she exclaimed even as she moved back and forth, enjoying a panicked, hasty ride. </p><p>“I missed you too, my love,” I answered, her smile growing incredibly. She smiled brightly even as she danced back and forth above my shaft, her eyes firmly open as if she wanted to make sure I couldn’t disappear from under her. </p><p>That alone was enough to confirm just hard had been my disappearance. </p><p>I stayed under her, letting her ride me, completely on her terms, no matter how much her beautiful moans tempted me to take control. She deserved her reward certainly. I tightened my hands on her cheeks, enjoying their generous softness. </p><p>“Faster,” she moaned as she picked up speed, her eyes filled with a deep need, a burning passion. </p><p>Her desperate ride, combined with the long, involuntary celibacy she experienced, resulted in a desperate climax, and she collapsed against my chest. I kissed her lips gently. “I missed you, my love.” </p><p>“I missed you too,” she answered, even as I felt our bond establishing once again. </p><p>[Goddess Acquired: Goddess of Knowledge}</p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 45</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 33269}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 700  Mana: 2000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but feel nostalgic as I walked through. Even with all the changes, it was just like the past. Once again, I was disguised as a servant, walking around, desperate to hide my true identity. </p><p>The only difference was the nature of the threat. In the past, I was afraid that anyone could take me down … but now, it was different. I just needed to avoid the attention of the Eternals. </p><p>As I walked around, I took note of the changes. Amusingly, more than half of the teachers stayed, showing that they had no problems with the new management. Even more interestingly, the guilds were also here … and they were acting far more arrogantly. </p><p>Enough to actually insult the teachers. </p><p>A rather interesting change. </p><p>However, the classes also changed, paying even lesser attention to the content of the classes, making Silver Spires even more useless … and even the levels of the students were much lower.  </p><p>“I wonder why they didn’t just close it down,” I murmured. Maybe it was a trap … not for me, obviously, as they had no idea about my survival, but the girls. Considering they were wanted, it made sense. </p><p>Unfortunately, poking around the locations that could be accessed by servants didn’t give me any clue about their destination. I needed to be more adventurous. </p><p>First, I visited the ruins of the headmistress’ tower, trying to find any hint of a ward, a hidden clue, maybe a Divine Spark … but nothing stayed other than a bunch of rock. Whatever destroyed it did so with a rather intense display of anger, and if anything survived, I wasn’t able to pick through my magical probes — limited to avoid distracting the wards that surrounded the area. </p><p>Naturally, there was no hint of Divine Spark, which was not a shocking surprise. Without the darkness ward to protect it, the System would have long devoured it. </p><p>I needed to cast more aggressive detection wards … but I was having trouble doing so, afraid of getting caught. Especially since my mana signature was slightly different than the one that the System provided. </p><p>I didn’t know if they had the ability to catch, but either way, I didn’t want to go around throwing epic spells. </p><p>Maybe I could tap into a different source instead, I decided. </p><p>Then, as I passed near a warding class, where an incompetent teacher teaching an even more incompetent batch of students, I had an idea. Do I need to be the one to cast the spell? </p><p>Sneaking into the class while staying hidden under a shadow was trivial with my stats, and a blanket of illusion ensured it would stay that way. </p><p>I didn’t have to wait long for an opportunity. The incompetent teacher was building an unnecessarily complicated ward that would waste a lot of mana, so I stretched a tendril of mine, connecting to his soul space to pilfer a good amount of mana in the process. </p><p>Watching the ward stutter and die was a particular kind of fun. </p><p>Though, I didn’t pull back … because I had realized he also had a water magic skill. Just an advanced one, but I wondered if I could use it for my benefit. I pushed some of the mana I acquired from him … and from the other side, I received some freshly converted elemental mana. </p><p>Just what I needed, I thought with a huge smirk, and decided to extend that trick to the rest of the class; their attempted wards failing just as easily. </p><p>Not that I cared, but when I discovered another student having earth magic … so, I channeled the mana I stole through his skill as well. </p><p>{+1200 Mana}</p><p>Not a bad haul, especially since it was split between three sources, pure, water, and earth. </p><p>If I used it carefully, it should be enough to cast a decent detection ward. </p><p>However, as I played along in their soul space, I noticed something interesting. As they worked on their magic determinedly, I sensed the momentary appearance of Divine Spark. It was a subtle effect, barely more than a fraction of a point. </p><p>It reminded me worship of the elves and the resulting Divine Spark. </p><p>Of course, the existence of an occasional divine spark was not a shock. I had long deduced the reason the Eternals did their best to dominate the main material plane was the renewable Divine Spark generation. I guessed the reason they let the beasts survive was the same reason. </p><p>They wanted the people to live under constant pressure, and what better way to ensure that than a hostile environment, where the constant presence of numbers reminded them they just needed to fight a bit more to secure their freedom from the dangers. </p><p>A beautiful balance, I had to admit. </p><p>Yet, it wasn’t what caught my attention. No, most of the Divine Spark had been just devoured by the System … but a few drifted downward. </p><p>And disappeared. </p><p>Not devoured by the system.</p><p>“How interesting,” I thought even as I extended my mana slightly, trying to touch what was going on. I managed to catch a glimpse, but it took quite a while. Still, I managed to capture a hint of Darkness Mana, concealing the spark before it could disappear. </p><p>“Wow,, that’s a challenge,” I murmured, but rather than rushing forward, I stayed put, not wanting to scare away my only potential clue. Instead,, I stayed back, carefully tracking the direction of the darkness ward to extrapolate a direction. </p><p>It didn’t work, the directions were wild enough that, either the target location was on the move — wildly so —  or the spell accounted for that fact. </p><p>Luckily, I had other options. </p><p>First, I stole some of the Divine Sparks that were being stolen … and managed to inject pure mana in the depths of it, and injected my own Divine Spark into it. The ward protected it from being stolen, and my connection ensured that I could track it toward its destination. </p><p>It had traveled through a confusing path at first, but soon, it was revealed that the path had been the first layer of protective measures, and it steadily started to go underground. </p><p>“Finally, a destination,” I murmured as I finally left the classroom and followed the path. First, I arrived at the storage rooms in the basements. With my stats, finding a weak spot in the damaged wards only took a second … and I started using Earth Mana to create a tunnel once more. </p><p>“Fucking finally,” I murmured as I enjoyed the smooth journey. It had been a long while since I didn’t have to use rough arcana mana to replicate the task, and the difference in performance was incredible. </p><p>Still, I did my best to limit the mana presence while closing the tunnel behind me, afraid of getting caught — by Eternals, and by the owner of the Darkness ward. </p><p>I had to travel far deeper than I expected.  Only after I was two miles underground, I came across a protective ward, one that had been created by Darkness mana, making it very troubling to sneak in. </p><p>Troubling, but not impossible. I stayed at the edge for another hour, stealing slivers of Darkness mana from the wards, aware that it would be the only way to conceal myself from the other tools of detection. Darkness mana was excellent for it. </p><p>And, the irony of using their own weapon for this purpose was very interesting. </p><p>Soon, I gathered enough mana to create a beautiful cloak around me, and used it to slip through the initial darkness ward. For all its amazing qualities of maintaining concealment, Darkness mana wasn’t a good material to make wards. Once discovered, bypassing them was trivial. </p><p>Oh, whoever built it was smart enough to realize that fact and built a secondary layer under the first, but whoever built it wasn’t exactly competent. High-leveled, but not competent.  </p><p>“Probably the princess,” I murmured as I assessed the evidence. That made sense, as she had access to the darkness ward, and if necessary, high-level skills, and the combination would allow her to dig down. </p><p>But, I could also deduce that it was not for her own residence. They had already bonded with Darkness Spark, and unless things had changed radically, she wouldn’t be able to use the Sparks she had been stealing from the school. </p><p>With that in mind, I continued traveling down, bypassing the ward layers, taking note of the details. </p><p>Then, I arrived at the center of the wards, and I came across a familiar sight. Two familiar sights, even. </p><p>The first, and the less important, part was the crystal platform that the headmistress was using to suppress her divine spark continuously. However, not without some changes, as half of the supporting pillars were gone while the platform itself showed signs of damage as well. </p><p>All of those were just details compared to the more important aspect. </p><p>Helga was at the center of the platform, naked and frozen… </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 45</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 32920}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 1103  Mana: 2410}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess}</p>",

    "content": "<p>Megan stayed silent for almost twenty minutes, looking outside the window as I drove away, her trembling slowly subsiding while her expression turned more careful. </p><p>However, the lust I could sense in her continued to bubble in an impressive manner, tempting me to ignore her attempts to calm down and focus on the more fun aspects of her concerns. Yet, I kept back, giving her the space she needed to make sense of the situation. </p><p>She finally broke her silence a while later. “What the fuck was that?” she said with a sudden growl. </p><p>“Well, sweetie, that was a … miscalculation,” I admitted readily. </p><p>“A miscalculation,” she repeated, angry but not furious. “A squad of assassins trying to ambush mews a miscalculation.” </p><p>“Unfortunately,” I answered, though I didn’t give her much detail, thinking that it was a different situation. “It’s a rather messy situation that I had been forced without my consent as well, but there are some benefits as well.” </p><p>“But you don’t want to tell me about it,” she accused. </p><p>“Not exactly. I’m offering you a choice,” I said. </p><p>“A choice,” she repeated, her distaste clear. “How kind.” </p><p>I shrugged. “Unfortunately, life isn’t kind.” </p><p>She paused a while before she finally spoke. “What’s the choice?” she asked. </p><p>“Simple. You need to make a decision whether you want to learn more about the situation or not. If you reject, I’ll do my best to keep you away from the mess, but once you learn more, it’ll be impossible. Believe me when I say it’ll change your worldview completely.” </p><p>“You’ll do your best to protect me? That’s not good enough.” </p><p>I shrugged. “The only thing I can promise you,” I declared, doing my best to stay honest. </p><p>“And the truth is really as world-breaking as you are implying,” she said. </p><p>“Probably even worse, but even I’m just digging the surface. Unfortunately, it’s a recent development for me as well.” </p><p>She fell silent once more, this time lasting five more minutes. I continued to drive idly, feeling the conversation was too important to handle quickly. “And, were you planning to share that information if this hadn’t happened?” she asked. </p><p>“Probably not,” I answered. “I was considering it, but if you hadn’t actually returned to help me, it was likely that I wouldn’t have trusted you enough to actually reveal the truth,” I answered. Maybe I would have changed my mind, but it was certainly the case that her immense personal risk changed my attitude greatly. </p><p>“It wasn’t like I helped,” she answered, clearly feeling self-conscious about her lack of actual help. </p><p>That made me chuckle. “Oh, that’s certainly the case. You made my job much harder by returning,” I said. </p><p>“Well, at least you’re honest,” she answered, her blush getting even worse. “Why reward me if I hadn’t helped?” </p><p>“Because you took a risk to help me, of course.” </p><p>Amusingly, that made her look cuter than I had ever seen, and she didn’t say anything else. “Tell me,” she said. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, but rather than starting to speak, I continued to drive until I found a nice corner where we could stand. It was still cold, enough to make it troubling for her with her dress … but when she stepped out, she wasn’t cold. </p><p>“What’s going on?” she asked. “Why am I not cold?” </p><p>“A part of the story I’m going to tell,” I answered. “Are you sure you want to know?” She nodded. </p><p>“Good, First thing you need to know is magic is real, and so is the gods,” I said. </p><p>That was enough to make her angry. “I can’t believe all of this is a prank…” she started, angry, but that faded once she noticed a detail. I was floating, and so was her. “Impossible,” she gasped. </p><p>“I wish, but it’s not,” I said as I floated toward her. “Worse, I’m not the only one that has it,” I explained. “Our attackers were part of a magical entity, the Ancient Brotherhood.” </p><p>“And they attacked you because?”</p><p>“Because I angered Paul by defeating him earlier.” </p><p>“Paul who?” she asked, then it clicked. “That basketball player. He’s some kind of magician as well. And he’s petty enough to attack you because of a basketball game.” </p><p>“Not entirely petty,” I said. “There are some complications, but you can think that, under certain conditions, fame could be converted to magic.” </p><p>“That’s absurd,” she declared, but her declaration didn’t carry her earlier conviction. The fact that we were still floating went a long way to convincing her. “It doesn’t make sense that magic is real and useful,” she added. </p><p>“Actually, you’re not wrong,” I said as I passed my phone to her. “Look at the results of my research,” I said, giving her access to some of the aggregated results from my web crawler. She was smart enough to understand the implications.  </p><p>“Two years,” she whispered as she wrapped her arm around my waist and pulled me tight. I let her, know just how intense it could be.  </p><p>“Exactly,” I answered. “Whatever that’s going on, it started two years ago, and it’s slowly picking up speed. Apparently, there’s some kind of barrier that was supposed to keep magic out, but it’s falling.” </p><p>“It’s hard to take,” she whispered. “Even now, a part of me wants to believe that you just drugged me and I’m hallucinating.” </p><p>“Certainly easier to believe,” I answered. Her reluctance to deny the reality wasn’t too unrealistic. “But there’s an easier way.” She raised her eyebrow. “I can share my powers.” </p><p>“And, you would do that?” she said. “What do I need to do? Sign away my soul?”  </p><p>I chuckled. “Truthfully, I have no idea. You’re my first, think of it as taking my magical virginity.” </p><p>“You’re an asshole,” she said as she poked my side painfully, but didn’t pull away. Rather, she wrapped her arm even tighter. “And what do you want in exchange?” </p><p>“Well, you of course,” I said, and without a warning, latched on her lips. At this point, her acceptance was clear, and I could feel the System pushing the Acolyte status easily. Though, unlike my encounter with Coach Juana, I didn’t ignore the call, but pushed it forward… </p><p>As her tongue slipped into my mouth eagerly — I didn’t miss the fact that, even with the shock, she was aroused by the power I displayed — I focused on the reaction of the System. Instinctively, I could sense I had two options. I could empower Megan in a restricted fashion, under one of my domains, and it came with the understanding that Megan would stay forever restricted under that domain … maybe even changed by it in the process. There would be no growth for her. </p><p>If it wasn’t for her display of loyalty, that would have been, without a doubt, my choice. Yet, after that, I was tempted to choose the other path. The unrestricted.  </p><p>Of course, even that was not exactly unrestricted. She would be still bound by the System, which was under my control. That much was clear from the feedback I was receiving. But, unlike the other option, she would grow and change under her control, only guided by me. </p><p>I chose the second option. </p><p>[Acolytes: (Megan[])]</p><p>[ -50% Intent] </p><p>I felt half of my Intent drain immediately, flowing toward Megan, infusing her whole being. Her eyes popped open, but I kept my lips locked, concealing her moans. Her hands slipped under my shirt, caressing my naked chest. </p><p>I ripped her dress, revealing her beautiful body, revealing her incredible naked body underneath, my fingers quick to clamp around her nipples. The pleasure invaded her body, each second making it harder for her to reject the call of pleasure. </p><p>However, the physical touch was only one side. I could feel that she was turning into a conduit … the sense of connection I felt was beautiful. </p><p>However, through the connection, I had a very welcome benefit. The intent I was receiving increased further. The amount wasn’t too impressive … but I still smiled. Unlike my other attempts to collect the Intent, it was not reduced. </p><p>She acted like a lightning rod for the jealousy of many women. Some hated her looks, some hated her popularity, and a growing segment hated her daring to actually establish a business in her name. The men were not too different, hating her for being a bitch, a whore, and somehow daring not to sleep with them … ignoring the contradiction in their feelings. </p><p>It might have been annoying if it wasn’t for the direct benefit I received. Instinctively, I turned those changes rapidly into Intent, then used the same Intent to empower her. Under my fingers, I could feel her getting stronger, faster, more beautiful… </p><p>Once I pulled back, she was breathing hard, flushed. “So, sweetie, still not believing magic is real,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, you’re such an asshole,” she growled in anger … grabbed my hair and pulled me for another kiss. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as I appreciated Megan returning to help me as I charged forward, I had to keep my attention on the men jumping out of their car. </p><p>Even as they extracted themselves from the wreck, they were shocked that the collusion had ended up with their armored, bulletproof car being ruined. I might have chuckled at the show if they hadn’t left the car with their guns drawn. </p><p>It was a dangerous threat … though not enough to make me collapse in fear. I might have been more afraid before the System transformed to grant me extreme powers, but the current situation was different. I was more than confident enough to handle them from such a close distance. </p><p>“Put your hands on your head and go down—“ one of them started, his gun pointed at me, only to be interrupted by a gunshot. </p><p>One that came from behind me. </p><p>Even as I continued to rush forward, I couldn’t help but pay a fleeting glance to my back, and saw Megan there, out of her car, using her car door as cover as she raised her gun. A ditzy small 38mm that would only inconvenience the target unless it landed on an artery … and, considering her hands, trembling in fear, it would be a miracle for her to hit the broadside of a barn. “Drop your weapons, or next time I start shooting your head,” she declared. </p><p>Unlike her hands, her voice didn’t tremble, managing to almost hide the abject terror she was feeling. I had to admit, that I was truly impressed with her actions. Not only did she return for me, but also she pulled a gun to defend me despite the horrible odds. </p><p>Of course, both her approach and her weapon of choice were absolutely horrible for the situation, turning her into little more than a distraction. Still, I appreciated the move. </p><p>It might have been adrenaline, or it might been poor decision-making. But what it clearly wasn’t was not understanding the situation. The abject fear she was displaying showed that she was very much aware of one important fact.</p><p>She was risking her life in a desperate situation. </p><p>Of course, the situation wasn’t as desperate as she thought, and her help was more hindrance than assistance as it limited the actions I might have been willing to take … but regardless of the pragmatic assessment of the situation, I was touched. </p><p>I never had anyone put themselves at such a risk to help me. </p><p>I appreciated it. </p><p>So, in light of that, I decided to change my initial target from the nearest attacker to one that was at the back of the line, who had been aiming for Megan. As I continued to rush, I kicked a stone in my way, aiming toward his gun. </p><p>However, the crack that reached my ear was shocking. At first, I thought that I had hit hard enough to break my foot … but a glance downward confirmed that it was not the case. </p><p>Then, I realized a more interesting fact. The sound came not from my broken feet, but from the stone I kicked. Reflexively using my Intent to quicken the stone, it broke the sound barrier and flew as fast as a bullet … and hit my target. </p><p>I was glad that I targeted the gun-wielding hand rather than his head, as the rock flew as fast as a bullet, but it was considerably heavier, hitting his hand with all the momentum of a high-caliber weapon. </p><p>Destroying it completely. </p><p>“Sniper, take cover,” another attacker shouted in panic, ignoring me for a moment as they turned away, treating an imaginary sniper as more important than an unarmed man rushing toward them. A smart choice. </p><p>Wrong, of course, but still smart.</p><p>One of them dragged their wounded friend to the cover, leaving two to deal with. I caught one of them before he could even slip into the cover, and grabbed his arm. He turned, aiming his gun toward me with his other hand. </p><p>But when I flipped him with a basic judo throw and slammed him against his friend, that ended in failure. I grabbed his discarded gun — though I created a layer between my fingers and the gun to as not to leave a fingerprint just in case — as I aimed the gun toward the third one, who had been dragging his friends. </p><p>He froze. “Tell me, are you from the Brotherhood?” I asked. </p><p>“What are you talking about?” he said, his voice smooth and confused. I had to admit, I was impressed. If it wasn’t for my enhanced senses, enough to see his pulse getting faster at the mention of the Brotherhood, I might have actually believed it. </p><p>“Good, if you’re not from the Brotherhood, I don’t have to use you to send a message to Paul, and kill you without a problem,” I answered, the intimidation working wonders to convince him that I was telling the truth. </p><p>He was afraid, yet he didn’t say anything. </p><p>Impressive loyalty. </p><p>The Ancient Brotherhood might be even bigger trouble than I expected. It was why, when the other car stopped and the people started to get out with their guns raised, I acted merciful … and aimed exclusively at their knees and gun-wielding hands. </p><p>I didn’t kill them, but a shattered kneecap was enough to keep them out of commission for months. I wanted to send a message. </p><p>But I also didn’t want to leave evidence, so before I started shooting, I gathered my intent and used it to radiate, trying to fry any electronic device in a thirty-feet radius, which included all of their devices including any dash cam they might have, with the exception of my devices. </p><p>“I think that’s enough lesson for you lot,” I said as I looked at them. “Tell that little arrogant shit Paul that, when he sends his dogs next time, he’ll collect their corpses. Understood?” </p><p>Their leader nodded even as he clenched his leg, trying to stem the blood flow. I used my Intent to radiate just enough Recovery energy to reduce the bleeding a bit, so none of them would die of blood loss. </p><p>I didn’t know if it was the best way to handle the attack, but I couldn’t just let them go without harm … and killing them was an escalation I wasn’t ready to. So, I dropped the gun, letting them think that I was careless enough to leave my fingerprints on the scene, and walked away. </p><p>Of course, even without looking, I was using my Intent to measure their exact reaction, ready to intervene if they dared to attack me. None of them did, which was interesting. It wasn’t just fear. Likely, Paul wasn’t the only one with magical abilities they had been exposed to, which meant they were careful enough to realize that when I turned my back toward them, it might not just be stupidity that made me reveal such an extreme weakness. </p><p>Megan was there, watching me with a shocked expression, her beautiful face blanched white. “Come drive with me,” I asked her. </p><p>She looked even more shocked at my casual words. “T-this is a rental. I need to drop it back,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about that, Our friends here will handle that,” I said, then I turned back, looking at their leader. “You will, right?” I asked. </p><p>“O-of course, sir,” he said. </p><p>I turned to Megan once more. “You see, that’s handled,” I said as I gestured at her. “Now, come and we can leave,” I said to her. She looked at me, shocked, but she still started walking toward me, shocked. </p><p>I looked at her, no less surprised the moment she grabbed her bag and started walking. I wasn’t shocked by her steps, which were unsteady, and not just because of the shock. She was wearing stylish pumps, and the ground was hardly smooth enough to allow a steady walk. </p><p>Nor I was surprised by her amazing dress. She was wearing a red dress that complemented her hair color, but it was somehow both casual and sexy, enhancing her natural beauty and coming across as promising without revealing more than a hint of cleavage. </p><p>No, I was surprised by the sudden echo of arousal I had felt from her, one that came from lust. And, it was far more different than what Miriam had been feeling. </p><p>What Miriam had displayed was something simple and surface, an animalistic desire to be dominated roughly, with no after effect than just a simple touch. Megan had something different, one that managed to echo in my Lust Romain without the sense of inferiority Miriam displayed, her emotions echoing with many different layers. </p><p>To her credit, she managed to hide her churning emotions far more effectively than I expected while she covered the distance, and soon stood in front of me, her beautiful lips parted slightly. I opened the passenger seat, and gestured her in. </p><p>“Thank you, kind sir,” she said, though I could see just how much it took from her to reject the desire to kiss me. </p><p>Instead, she took her seat, and I took the driver’s seat … and we drove away. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Mia couldn’t help but feel frustrated as she stood at the entrance of the private club she had been invited by Madam Presley, ready to earn the goodwill she needed to make the deal.</p><p>Or, more accurately, asking her employee to make that sacrifice. She might have felt bad for asking an employee to do such a thing, but two things prevented her from feeling that. First, from the way Darion looked at Madam Presley, he clearly had no concerns about making that ‘sacrifice’.</p><p>Second, he had already extracted the price from her … in a very memorable encounter at her office. </p><p>If only that didn’t make her suddenly feel a sense of loss. After all, the only reason she agreed to that deal was that Darion was not her boyfriend, and she wouldn’t have felt anything once Madam Presley took him … no sense of loss. </p><p>But, after the office encounter, she was feeling differently. </p><p>“So, any last-minute thoughts?” Darion asked, his tone mocking. </p><p>“Of course not, why?” she answered rapidly. </p><p>“Well, maybe you changed your mind and decided to keep me for yourself?” </p><p>“Of course not. As I would ever want you?” she answered, doing her best to sound convincing. Though, from the mocking laughter he responded, it seemed that she wasn’t as successful as she wished. </p><p>“Let’s go before she gets suspicious,” he said, which was a nice sentiment. His hand, however, wasn’t as nice — or too nice — as it suddenly landed on her ass, mauling as he owned her. </p><p>“Keep your hand away —“ she started, interrupted by a squeeze and a moan, the latter coming from her. </p><p>“And make her suspicious. Don’t forget that we’re supposed to be lovers. Otherwise, she won’t be enjoying stealing me.” </p><p>Mia growled in anger, but as he pulled her, she started walking with him. “I’ll make you pay,” she warned. </p><p>He squeezed her ass again. “Oh, honey. I would love to see you try.”</p><p>Mia didn’t say anything else until they stood in front of Madam Presley. “Wow, this place is amazing,” Mia said, excited. “I can’t believe you have this place for private parties.” </p><p>“Benefits of success, sweetie,” Madam Presley answered. “I’m sure a smart girl like you would have a similar place one day.” Her smile turned mocking. “Actually, why don’t you go and enjoy the sea. The water is perfect at this hour…” </p><p>She felt a sense of humiliation, one that she hid by removing her transparent dress and revealing her beautiful body. “A good idea,” she whispered, doing her best to hold back the humiliation of sacrificing her boyfriend …</p><p>Even though Darion was certainly not her boyfriend. </p><p>***</p><p>“She’s beautiful, isn’t she?” the woman said as she looked at Mia. “You’re lucky to have such a beautiful girlfriend.” </p><p>Darion just smirked as he turned his attention to her, doing his best to look obedient, even though even a temporary action was enough to get on his nerves. Luckily, he would soon teach the rich woman that controlling him wasn’t as easy as she thought. </p><p>However, the beautiful body she displayed was enough to eschew the value of patience. He wanted to see just how far she would push. </p><p>“Oh, I’m certainly lucky,” he said as he let his gaze linger. </p><p>She smirked. “Did she talk about our little deal before we sealed the deal?” </p><p>“She mentioned that we have to seal the deal,” Darion answered, though he didn’t work particularly hard to look subservient. She was smug enough to write off his attitude as pointless. </p><p>“Good, I just hope you’re a giving lover,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry, Madam Presley. I have always been a fair lover, exactly as you deserve,” he said, enjoying alternating between the extremely crude and extremely respectful, letting her pick what she wished, knowing she would get the wrong message. </p><p>“Now, kiss,” she said as she raised her leg. </p><p>Darion decided to lean and place a soft kiss on her foot, even though it annoyed him intensely. He wanted to see just how far she would push … so he would know exactly how much punishment she deserved. </p><p>He thought that she would avoid punishment when she changed her position and gave him the view of her tight ass, but her next words changed his mind. “Lick my soles,” she ordered. </p><p>And he was certainly not willing to do that. </p><p>“The soles,” he said as he grabbed her ankle, and flipped her, enjoying her surprised expression. “How about if we move up on the line a bit.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, which was all she was able to say as he took a step and hovered above her, his fingers finding her wetness over her swimsuit. “That’s too quick—“ she started, only for a gasp to stop her. </p><p>“Come on, Madam, you wanted me. It’s only fair you get the full experience rather than watering it down. Don’t tell me you didn’t dream of me fucking you when you saw me and Mia at the office.” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she answered, which was all she was able to say before her moans got louder and louder. He continued teasing her core repeatedly, her moans getting more and more intense. </p><p>“Now, let’s get rid of this boring stuff and have some real fun,” he said, and got rid of her swimsuit. </p><p>Her naked body was tempting, but not as tempting as her panicked expression as she realized she lost control completely.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As Mary looked at the intertwined bodies of her host and her … friend, she didn’t know how to feel. Disappointment battled with arousal. </p><p>“I can’t believe I had slept through this,” she murmured as the said disappointment invaded her whole being. Not because she was suddenly worrying about Darion’s chastity — the way they met permanently removed that option, not that she was delusional enough to think she could tame a man like him — but because she missed watching the show. </p><p>Watching a shy older woman learning the taste of a proper fucking would have been an incredible show. She said that she missed it. </p><p>“Oh, I wonder what kind of an expression you have made, Miss Fatima,” Mary murmured, getting more and more excited as she imagined her bent over the couch, being taken, her body posed invitingly. It would have been an excellent opportunity to join </p><p>“Luckily, that’s not the only thing I could do,” she murmured as she got rid of her panties. Then, she let her hand drag down and let her fingers disappear between her legs, the touch enough to make her shiver intensely with the view in front of her. </p><p>Even if she was still a bit sore after the fucking she received the night before. </p><p>“I wonder just how loud your moans were, Fatima,” Mary moaned desperately as she played with herself desperately, her legs losing strength soon. She needed to eat something, she was revenously hungry … but not enough to stop her fun. </p><p>She barely managed to throw herself on the seat, enjoying the way her fingers disappeared into her core, her wetness incredible. She felt like she was lost in her mind as she played with herself like a desperate nerd who never had any fun.</p><p>But the last night felt so distant with the show in front of her, unable to qualify the situation she found herself in. It felt like a dream, one that she didn’t dare to wake off. </p><p>Not because she was afraid of Fatima’s reaction, unlike the last night. Then, she had been afraid of her reaction, thinking that if she had been caught, she would kick her out and forced her to find a new place. Paying for rent would be bad enough … especially since it would replace the mansion she was living in with a shitty one-bedroom apartment at best. </p><p>No, she was afraid of waking them up, because she was afraid of Darion. The pool adventure had been fun, but also left her throughly used, and she was afraid that, if she managed to wake Darion up, she would find herself dealing with a task she couldn’t handle. </p><p>It was much better to leave that amazing morning wood to the exotic beauty he was hugging.</p><p>But those thoughts quickly fell to the wayside as she continued to push, invading her core inch by inch with her fingers, the phenomenal level of wetness she managed to acquire was the only thing that was keeping the pain away.</p><p>She knew she should stop, but the struggle only made it better.  </p><p>Yet, she found herself opening her legs even more, turning into a show. She wondered what would Fatima say if she had gotten caught. </p><p>“I wonder if you get away running or join,” Mary commented, her hands desperately dancing on her body as she rode toward an orgasm … one that came far quicker than she thought to be possible. </p><p>But then, she never played with herself while enjoying such a spectacular visual feast. </p><p>Even with the pain that accompanied it, it was the greatest solo pleasure she had ever felt, and she found it impossible to stop halfway. </p><p>Turning her into an observer in her own body, until her cries exploded. </p><p>She expected Fatima to wake up, but she continued to lay on the couch, still sleeping. “Pity,” Mary murmured, slightly disappointed that the accident hadn’t happened. </p><p>As she walked around, she was still unable to pull herself from the gaze. “Maybe I should wake you up,” Mary murmured as she leaned forward, her fingers wrapping around his shaft, aware of the risk she was taking. However, the temptation to feel his monster, standing attention in the morning, was simply too tempting to ignore. </p><p>It twitched in her hand, and she froze for a moment, afraid — and excited — that she had woken up the sleeping giant. </p><p>It was not the case.  </p><p>“Too bad you missed the chance to fuck me, sir,” she murmured, and shame hit once more as she slowly pulled back. Just like a desperate virgin, she was teasing a sleeping man … For a moment, she thought there was an earthquake, but it turned out to be her trembling legs, and without the couch to hold on to, she would have fallen painfully. </p><p>“That was fun, visit again, and maybe this time, you can fuck me properly,” Mary murmured, feeling naughty as she walked away, aware that she could never dare to give that challenge if he was awake. </p><p>Then, she walked away … unaware of his naughty smirk, promising exactly that. </p>",

    "content": "<p>People were calling me before I could even get a chance to get into my car, though I was only interested in answering two. Coach Juana, and Megan. </p><p>I decided to answer Juana first. “How do you do, coach?” I asked with a cheerful voice. </p><p>“You are incapable of not creating a spectacle, are you?” she responded. “You gave me a huge mess.”</p><p>“Just as you wanted. I’m sure you won’t have any trouble with him anymore.” </p><p>“Likely, considering the board is preparing to ask for his resignation, leaving us with two major positions to fill,” she answered bitingly. </p><p>“Hey, don’t act like you’re unsatisfied. I’m sure it’s a sacrifice you’re willing to make sure none of the other coaches act out. And, you used me as a very devastating weapon, they won’t be,” I said, cutting the chase. </p><p>“Well, that still leaves us with the challenge of—“ she tried to say after a pause, realizing she had lost track of the argument.</p><p>“The challenge of finding a coach. Yes, I’ll take the role,” I answered, and she let out a relaxed sigh. “As long as the payment is appropriate, of course.” </p><p>“I’m sure there’s a lot of place in the budget—“ she started, but I cut her off once more.</p><p>“No, I’m thinking about a more personal payment, just like our bet.” </p><p>She fell silent for a moment, letting the moment stretch for a while. “Only if you win,” she admitted. </p><p>“Excellent, a deal,” I answered immediately, enjoying her shocked gasp. “See you later, my beautiful coach,” I added as I ended the call. </p><p>Then, I texted Megan, saying that she could call whenever she was available, and meanwhile, I used the opportunity to do a search on the Ancient Brotherhood that Paul and Arthur mentioned, but failed to find anything. </p><p>Or, more accurately, I had found too much, which equaled the same. There were simply thousands of mentions of Ancient Brotherhoods, all spread along many different cultures, regions, and entities. The name was simply too general. </p><p>Pity, as I would have loved to get some more information. </p><p>However, while I was doing my search, I also went through the reports my web crawler was producing, and analyzed them based on my advanced capabilities … and the results showed a marked increase of strange occurrences during the last three days.</p><p>Coinciding with the mention of the fallen guardian Paul mentioned. </p><p>Things were getting faster, meaning I needed to take some risks. Preferably with Acolyte business. I thought about the best candidate, and Laura jumped into my mind. </p><p>A quick call to her, however, revealed that she was currently back with her family due to an emergency, and she was not available. </p><p>Pity. </p><p>Which left only a few viable candidates. Arthur if I wanted to avoid revealing magic, but that had its own restrictions. Marcus was the best male in terms of trust… </p><p>Then, there were Coach Juana and Megan, two sexy ladies who helped me a lot, but trust was a complicated issue between us. However, both of them depended on me for their success significantly, which gave me a preferable hook. </p><p>While I drove, Megan finally called. “You don’t do anything by halves, do you?” she asked, echoing the earlier talk with Coach Juana. </p><p>“Of course not, where’s the fun in that,” I answered, earning a deep sigh. “Don’t tell me it doesn’t help you,” I added. </p><p>“No, that’s not the problem. It helps the sales immensely, but you just ruined my week with a lot of work,” she grumbled, trying to act frustrated, but I could hear the elation in her voice. The basketball match had already picked up a lot of media coverage, and my ‘inappropriate’ behavior was even a part of the discussion. </p><p>I was happy with that. A lot of people had very negative things to say about my inappropriate behavior online, but, considering the intensity of their negative feelings, I was very happy about the results. </p><p>“My pleasure,” I said. </p><p>“Since you’re that happy, you’re going to accompany me to dinner. We have a potential deal that could mean a lot of money, but the business partner needs to meet with you as well. Are you free?” </p><p>“Sure, just text me the address, and I’ll be there,” I said. I didn’t offer to pick her up, considering we were just ‘broken up’ and it wouldn’t look good for the story. </p><p>“Be there in an hour,” she answered. “And dress smart casual.” </p><p>I chuckled at her commanding attitude even as she ended the call, making a stop at my dorm to dress before I prepared to move. </p><p>As I drove, however, I continued to channel my Intent to my pet, curious about what would happen once it reached the next stage, a state that I would hopefully learn about soon. </p><p>[Black Tortoise (I - %73)]</p><p>The drive toward my destination didn’t take too long considering I had violated every single speeding law, but I was feeling reckless. It was a beautiful chance to stretch my psychical abilities after using command aura for so long. </p><p>I enjoyed the strategic aspects, but I still liked to challenge myself as well. And, the meeting was quite a bit distance away from the city, allowing me to properly cut loose. </p><p>Then, on the way, I noticed a very distinctive event. A familiar figure, Megan, driving an unfamiliar new and expensive car — though enough to recognize it as a rental, probably to impress the potential client. Unfortunately, the nature of the car was not the thing that caught my attention. </p><p>No, it was the two cars, both black SUVs, following her in a desperate chase. Even from the distance, I could see Megan’s face contorted in panic as she took a sharp turn, avoiding her followers despite their attempt to cut her off. </p><p>It was a close call, one that Megan avoided due to her surprisingly amazing driving skills combined with the impressive rental car. Pity that her car was already looking like it was on its last legs, far less resistant to collision than the SUVs that chased her. </p><p>I had a strong suspicion that those SUVs were bulletproof. </p><p>The safe thing would have been to turn back and avoid the chaos, but the moment I came across the show, I already had an idea about the real target of the evening. They were probably targeting me, and Megan was just an incidental target. </p><p>I was honest enough with myself to admit that I didn’t know what I would have done if I hadn’t been confident in my abilities. I had a tendency to be reckless, but also selfish. Luckily, I wasn’t afraid of the challenge — especially since I couldn’t feel even a hint of magic from the two SUVs — so that was a moot question. </p><p>Instead, I desperately drove toward them, and with a painful drift, cut the path of the first SUV while I did my best to imbue my car with Intent, with no idea about what kind of effect it would generate. </p><p>Luckily, I was confident that I would be able to survive the collusion even if didn’t help the slightest thanks to my physical enhancements. My car … that was a more difficult call. </p><p>Yet, as I infused the car with my Intent, I could feel some kind of connection with the car. It was subtle and sublime, but it allowed me to control the car with far more accuracy than I expected. </p><p>Which meant I managed to position the car at the perfect angle. Of course, colliding with a bulletproof SUV, I still expected my car to end up like an accordion, though it would have been a fair exchange to allow Megan to escape while entangling the aggressors. </p><p>I wanted to interrogate them. </p><p>To my surprise, it wasn’t my car that ended up like a badly completed jigsaw, but theirs. Mine survived with almost no scratch … and more importantly, I barely felt the bump, which was supposed to be impossible. </p><p>Then, I shrugged. It was hardly the most impressive thing I had seen magic accomplish. Then, I noticed another surprise. Megan suddenly slowed down and took a sharp turn, her expression of panic even more intense, clearly trying to help me. </p><p>An inadvisable action, certainly, but I had to admit, brave as well. Far braver than I expected Megan to display. Maybe I had underestimated her. </p><p>However, I didn’t have much time to waste appreciating, I thought as I prepared to jump out of the car. </p><p>I had some enemies to deal with.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Admittedly, as I let the team take the field, I felt more excitement than fear. Not just for the potential Intent gain — which was always a welcome side benefit — but also the challenge of facing such a competent opponent during a match. </p><p>For all the great challenges the opponent presented, it was still a five-man game, and I had my own unique advantages. </p><p>And, more importantly, I had the animosity between Paul and Arthur, the reason I let the situation collapse, as I needed Arthur to have that inglamarus position. </p><p>The play I was pulling, at least on the surface, was an isolation play, one that allowed Arthur to attack from the right side while the rest of the team pulled to the left easily. However, Paul locked him badly, not even allowing a gap to receive a pass.</p><p>I could see the amused smirk of the opposing coach, thinking that my tactics were collapsing as I panicked under overwhelming skill. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, that wasn’t the case. Under my command aura, the other four passed the ball rapidly, before letting Marcus push forward for an easy layup, giving us some score. </p><p>“Petty trick,” Paul growled as he rushed forward, easily bypassing both Marcus and Arthur despite their double-team attempt, responding in kind. </p><p>And, just like that, the game turned into a weird back and forth, our offense delivering a smooth assault every time, scoring an easy bucket most of the time, and rebounding on the occasions that they missed. Paul stayed locked on Arthur, more than happy to keep him from scoring. </p><p>In response, Paul ignored his teammates as he relied on his supernatural talents and rushed forward recklessly, scoring with an eerie efficiency, and, when the half came to an end, the score was close. </p><p>41-47. </p><p>A six-point difference shouldn’t have been good news, but it was.  Especially since I could see the intense dissatisfaction on the faces of their players. </p><p>Starting at the moment they checked their phone. </p><p>I wasn’t exactly wasting time while commanding a losing match. I used the bot accounts I created to trigger an extensive online argument, with a lot of fake posts insulting the starter players for being useless. After all, it had been a while since they scored a point, and their defensive performance wasn’t great either. </p><p>A few of them were already arguing with their coach, and that was without me using any kind of magical trick. With their struggle turning into a mess, I turned my attention to the next challenge … and from a distance, focused on the runes underneath Paul’s shoes. </p><p>I felt that, as long as I focused on it for a minute, I could destroy the rune completely, but that was not my aim. Instead, I targeted some of the most fragile parts, limiting myself to the fraying edges of it, one that would look like natural decay. </p><p>With the command aura still strong over them, my team didn’t bother with some nonsense argument, and instead focused on the tactics I was drawing. </p><p>The second half started with their point, but this time, I noted that Paul decided to ignore Arthur and defend the person who had the ball in hand, probably a concession the coach managed to earn as he wanted to open the gap. Unfortunately for him, his sneaky attack was impossible to connect under my watchful eyes, and they passed the ball quickly twice…</p><p>Which ended on Arthur’s hand as he positioned himself at the three-point line, scoring one for us before the defense could even react.  </p><p>44-47. </p><p>“It seems that you’re quite slow, this time, Paul,” Arthur said mockingly. </p><p>“You’re lucky that the rest of my team is completely useless,” Paul countered, too arrogant to care about the attitude of the rest of his team. This was a great mistake, as the others were already annoyed with all the posts about their uselessness, and the insult wasn’t exactly helpful.</p><p>So, when they passed the ball, they deliberately ignored Paul as they passed the ball among themselves. Not one to miss such an opportunity, I let the players move in a way that gave them an easy look, allowing them to score an easy layup. </p><p>The next ball, the same pattern repeated. Paul tried to steal the ball, but Arthur was already positioned, and scored a smooth dunk in response, once again mocking Paul.  </p><p>“Pass the ball!” Paul shouted, but his team ignored him once more, once again scoring … which was the death of any cooperation hope they had. </p><p>Our attack happened quite smoothly, but when they put the ball into the game, they certainly weren’t expecting Paul to actually cut and steal the ball. </p><p>Or, more accurately, try to steal, as just as he was about to grab the ball, I intervened with a little telekinetic push, and the ball went out of bounds. </p><p>“What the hell are you doing, you arrogant bastard,” their point guard shouted at Paul, shocked at his recklessness. Certainly humiliating, especially as they argued, we put the ball into the game and scored a quick three-point. </p><p>“That doesn’t count,” the coach argued. </p><p>“Nonsense, you didn’t call for a timeout. It’s not my problem that you can’t control your players,” I answered mockingly, watching as his face turned purple. </p><p>The next move of their players, once again passing the ball while Paul tried to intercept, hardly helped his mood. Worse for him, I let Paul intercept before he rushed forward and scored … which should have been good news for him. </p><p>Instead, it further broke down their team unity. </p><p>“Come on, guys, go and show them basketball is a team game,” I shouted, followed by some nonsense numbers, giving me the impression that I was controlling the game with pre-arranged codes rather than mental commands. </p><p>Soon, even the semblance of control broke down, their horrible defense allowing us to score easily. Worse for them, this time, we were even able to stop Paul as he tried to score. </p><p>It required triple-teaming him, which was a tactic that should have never worked as it left most of the team free to rush, but as their relationship dissolved into enmity, Paul chose to force an absurdly difficult three-pointer rather than passing it. </p><p>We grabbed the rebound, scoring an easy fast-break. </p><p>And, just like that, their offense split into two. Whenever the starters attacked, Paul deliberately stayed back, not even bothering to help them, but insulting them afterward, and the same thing also happened during Paul’s attacks. </p><p>Soon, the score reversed quite badly. </p><p>67-54</p><p>The coach tried to use his timeouts to instill some kind of control, but it soon turned into a shouting match between him and his players. I expected that to be the end of the spectacle … but then, when the starters passed the ball among each other and ignored Paul again, Paul intervened…</p><p>By slamming the player hard with a shoulder tackle, sending him sliding down while he grabbed the ball. </p><p>Before he could start his offense, however, another player rushed him from the back. Paul, thanks to his enhanced abilities, turned and punched him … which would have ended in a very painful manner if I hadn’t already weakened his strength rune. </p><p>Even with that, he had the decisive advantage as the starters attacked him. My team looked confused, but I just gestured for them to walk toward me, and we started watching the match. </p><p>Amusingly, while I wasn’t the one fighting, I still sensed the intense flow of intent, refilling my pool once more, which I channeled to my suspiciously competent pet to increase his progress. </p><p>[Black Tortoise (1. - %35)]</p><p>Watching as the coach rushed among his players, trying to intervene, was amusing. </p><p>Amusingly, the fight came to a ridiculous end. In the chaos, one of the players accidentally stepped on the back of Paul’s shoe, and made it slip out of his feet. </p><p>Which meant an immediate drop in his fighting capability … followed by a huge beating. When the players finally stopped, I walked to the sweaty coach. </p><p>“I’m enlightened coach, marvelous ability to control your players. I’m sure you’ll have an excellent talk with Coach Juana,” I said. </p><p>“I … what do you mean?” he tried to say, but I just pointed at the camera, reminding him that everything had been recorded. He blanched, quick to realize that, while being defeated was bad enough, as a coach, the disgraceful behavior of his team was hard to explain. </p><p>Especially with the extreme beating his star recruit received. </p><p>“Why didn’t you help?” He asked. </p><p>“Oh, coach, you can’t be serious. I’m just an upstart player, how can I know it’s not a genius training regime of yours,” I said, loud enough to be picked by the phone cameras, and left. </p><p>After the disgraceful show they put on, there was no need to finish the game.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>Unfortunately, even as I arrived at the door of my home, the challenge was yet to be over. On the contrary, it was just starting. </p><p>Luckily, once I managed to draw close, the presence of the main material plane was intense enough that I didn’t need to be afraid of getting lost again, so I let the connection with the ship — one of many that I could sense, using some kind of magical dock that was far bigger than the other planes — fade away, and let myself float freely at the dimension. </p><p>That removed the risk of immediately getting caught by the Eternals, but still left two problems. </p><p>First, the intense strength of the planar border, which was far stronger than any fragmented planes I had come across. I could possibly manage against it, but it wouldn’t be a simple challenge. But that wasn’t the most significant challenge. </p><p>No, that honor went to the elemental beings floating around the plane, fighting to penetrate through the dimensional barrier, with a density that shocked me. Even with the detection in Primordial Aether being hampered, I was still able to push forward recklessly. </p><p>That was not a confrontation I wanted to have … because, unlike the other beings, elementals looked rather an at ease with the Primordial Aether, not sharing the fragility of the other being. An interesting aspect of their behavior. </p><p>I circled the plane, looking for an opportunity. I could have tried to dodge the elementals, which seemed sustainable since they didn’t notice my presence, but I didn’t dare to just push through the planar border. I still remembered just how easy was for me to be detected in that light plane, and I didn’t want to risk something more. </p><p>The opportunity I was seeking, I found a day later. Several elementals, rushed through yet another breach, allowing me to slip through the breached border. </p><p>And, the moment I slipped through the border, I felt a connection between me and the System. Admittedly, it felt like it came from a seed, one that was long buried in me. </p><p>It was the system, trying to make a connection … yet, I could sense that it was the ordinary System and not my unique one.</p><p>“A bit late, buddy,” I thought mockingly even as I suppressed that connection, having absolutely no idea to connect with it. Even now, it was a complicated connection for me … but luckily, after everything, I had the ability to block it easily. </p><p>Yet, I let that seed alive, because there was a chance the System could still detect me without that seed. I remembered my cute dragon only being safe under the darkness ward. </p><p>The magical yet hopeless struggle of the elementals around us gave me a good idea about potential risks. Of course, there was a chance that it wouldn’t be the case … but then there was a chance that there would be. </p><p>I left the elementals to their desperate struggle and teleported away. </p><p>After one jump, I paused, and started meditating, trying to detect the location of my girls … only to have another failure. I could feel their presence, and the fact that they were alive, but that was the extent of my ability. I was not able to detect anything else. </p><p>A troubling detail. </p><p>“It seems that the disconnect with the System will impair me more than I feared,” I murmured. “Luckily, I still have my beacons.”</p><p>Unfortunately, that was not entirely without a challenge either. The main material plane was huge, far bigger than I had even given credit. Even when I was completely on the plane, I wasn’t able to sense my beacons properly. They were a distant lump at a faraway distance. </p><p>I slipped into the Aether plane, which, after the horrible challenge of Primordial Aether, felt like a holiday. It was even smoother than the Aether of the fragmented planes, though with absolutely no hint of mana, unlike the others. </p><p>The slow yet efficient suction of the System was rather obvious. I continued to travel, ignoring the temptation of stopping for some sightseeing. Even with my near-infinite mana — as I was still able to easily break down Aether — I didn’t want to take any risk. </p><p>Yet, soon, I became glad for that decision for another reason. The closer I got, the more distinct the presence of my beacons started to get. Yet, as I drew closer, I noticed the absence of some particular beacons. </p><p>Which I had left at Silver Spires. </p><p>I felt tense. Admittedly, the only reason I wasn’t panicking was that I could feel the existence of my girls in my soul, preventing me from coming to some unfortunate conclusions about their state of living. </p><p>After a long travel, I finally managed to find Silver Spires … or, at least, what was left of them. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was the ragged nature of the area. The towers, famous for their unique color, had been damaged. Half of them were destroyed — which included the tower of the headmistress — and the rest had suffered some significant damage, enough to turn them into ruins. </p><p>Just in case, I decided to walk the rest of the distance rather than risking teleportation, even to one of the safe houses I created, and instead decided to walk the rest of the distance, a little magical field around me enough to hide me from the monsters that surrounded me. </p><p>As I got closer, I could see more details. Unlike the towers, the walls were mostly intact, and manned by a surprising number of guards, defending the school against the monsters. </p><p>However, that didn’t fill me with confidence, not when I got close enough to notice their uniforms, which were not the distinct style of the guards of the Silver Spire. </p><p>They were wearing the colors of the royal family. </p><p>“What the hell had happened there?” I murmured as I approached, feeling tense. I had been confident that the girls would have been enough to handle the mess that they were facing, and seeing the evidence otherwise was not good news. </p><p>Still, turning and leaving was not one of the considerations. Even if the girls were not there anymore, the location offered me the best opportunity to find a clue about what had happened. Before I arrived, I found a caravan moving toward the broken school, and slipped inside, casting an illusion to blend. </p><p>It was temporary, of course, as I couldn’t be sure if there was someone competent in illusions at the walls. Not to mention, with the constant draining effect of the System, it was far harder to establish a convincing illusion, and I didn’t want to take the risk. </p><p>So, I stole a bunch of clothes even as I listened to the gossip, trying to understand what had happened. </p><p>What I learned was useful. Apparently, there had been a war at Silver Spires two months ago, with the Royal family sieging the place to punish them for hosting the Princess. I had no doubt that it was a bullshit excuse, as I doubted the princes could mobilize enough to take the place down while it was defended by my girls. </p><p>I had no doubt that the Eternals played a big role. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t despair, because it was not the extent of the gossip. No, instead, they were still gossiping about how lucky they would have been to somehow catch one of the several women who were being searched. </p><p>A list that included all of my girls without exception … though how they learned the name of my sexy dragon was a mystery. Things probably had gone worse than I expected. Still, the fact that the search was active was enough to give me even more hope about their relative comfort. They were still on the run, at least. </p><p>Of course, that left me with a difficult mission to search and discover the truth of the issue, a monumental task … thankfully, not impossible. </p><p>I didn’t have much trouble sneaking into the school, once again using one of the secret passages rather than using the main entrance, and my knowledge of the walls was useful. And, just like that, I was back in Silver Spires, where everything started. </p><p>Ready to find my targets.  </p><p>Rather than acting immediately, however, I started to observe my surroundings. </p><p>The search wouldn’t start easy, not when I was surrounded by an army of unfamiliar faces. Worse, from the way people were moving, I could see that they were stronger than I expected … with their stats far higher than the old state. </p><p>If they were wearing fancy clothes, I would have expected them to be a part of the royal family. But, no, they were clearly taking weaker positions. Which meant their origin was dubious. The Eternals were my best guess…</p><p>The search wouldn’t be easy indeed… </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 45</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 32920}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 1103  Mana: 2410}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess}</p>",

    "content": "<p>I teleported us to the location of the breach, only to see a large ship breaching through the planar border with shocking ease, causing almost no chaos. “Stay back and look intimidating, while my avatar handles the talk,” I warned Seldanna even as I gathered my mana around and cast the strongest invisibility spell I could manage. </p><p>At the same time, I let my avatar radiate a flood of nature mana and create two roots that grabbed the ship before they could retreat — impressive, but clearly not offensive. The avatar acted just like what I had seen in the memories, arrogant and reckless. </p><p>The amount of mana I spent on that display could destroy a city in seconds, a great display of power, yet it didn’t turn offensive. </p><p>The ship didn’t try to run away, recognizing that it was a display to impress rather than attack. I was glad, as I had no doubt they had many tools that would help them escape. While I had a plan in place to slip into their ship if that was their strategy, I much rather sneak in slowly. </p><p>Soon, the front of the ship opened, and someone appeared. “We are mere merchants between planes, great one,” he shouted even as he fell onto his knees. “We didn’t know that this dimension was under the control of a great being such as yourself. Please forgive us.” </p><p>My avatar didn’t answer immediately, and I used the opportunity to slip out of the plane, slipping out of the planar border. It was only the thick cover of nature mana that was constantly radiating off the avatar that allowed such a thing. </p><p>Once in the Primordial Aether, I drew the weakest protective layer I could draw around me as I moved toward the ship, betting for the chaotic nature of the Primordial Aether shielding me from their detection capabilities. </p><p>“And what do you trade that would make you daring enough to travel through the Primordial Aether,” my avatar spoke. </p><p>The self-proclaimed merchant pulled a box, and revealed a crystal, one that was stuffed with a Nature Spark of shocking quality, around two hundred points, a piece that would be challenging for even the gods to create, as absorbing and splitting them created significant challenges. </p><p>A considerable gift, and a very important strategic resource for a god that was just setting up his forces, allowing the creation of a strong and loyal warrior cadre quickly. Too bad for them it was completely useless for me. </p><p>“How daring, mortals daring to touch the blood of the gods,” my avatar spoke, the voice alone triggering an earthquake. “I remember a bunch of meddling kids during the great betrayal. It seems that those bunch of rats didn’t die off yet.” </p><p>I continued to swim even as I used my avatar to observe them, getting tenser as I did so. </p><p>The attitude of the Eternal was interesting … for all his surface-level subservience, he was arrogant. And, more importantly, he was not showing any sign of fear, as if despite being caught, he was confident that he was still in control.</p><p>There was a chance that his attitude was just unfounded arrogance, but that was hardly a risk I could take under the circumstances. </p><p>“You’re lucky that even a dragon might parley with rats under dire circumstances,” my avatar declared loudly. </p><p>“We’re glad for your wisdom, great one,” the merchant declared. “We offer you a great trade. An equal trade between the essence of those cursed undead. We want nothing more than the destruction of those abominations, and we will support you as much as we can.” </p><p>That was an interesting choice, I thought as I finally reached the outer hull of the ship, and connected myself using a tendril of mana. Carefully, I started examining the surface, but didn’t find a way that I could slip inside … luckily, I didn’t need it, not when I could just continue to hang on the surface. </p><p>Luckily, that was not needed. </p><p>“Acceptable,” I declared. “I have thousands times more of that cursed essence ready to be exchanged,” I added, and noted the expression on the merchant’s face. Not greed, like I expected, but victory. </p><p>Clearly, they had a different plan than just an equal exchange. I decided to interrupt whatever plan they might have. </p><p>“However, even a dragon could be brought down by the poison of the rats. You’re going to leave what you have here, and I’m going to examine it carefully. You can visit six months later for trade,” the avatar declared as it waved its huge tree hand. “I would love to leave my home defended while I go and destroy those undead for daring to invade my land,” I added. </p><p>An arrogant statement that seemingly revealed my strategy, combined with a small time request. Together, they would be enough to make the Eternals wait patiently. </p><p>At least, that was what I hoped … though I had quite a number of defensive measures if that was the case. </p><p>“That is more than acceptable, great one!” the merchant declared. </p><p>“Good, leave,” my avatar declared, once again accompanied by a great explosion of nature mana. “Come here three months later. A day earlier, a day late, and I’ll destroy you before attacking your pitiful organization.” </p><p>With that declaration, the ship started to move … dragging me along as I stuck on the outer shell …</p><p>Which triggered a long, boring journey. </p><p>In terms of monotony, it was even worse than the first time I had gotten lost. At least, then, I was struggling for my life, which meant I had to constantly pay attention to my surroundings. Here, I had nothing to do but wait. </p><p>I didn’t need to struggle to hide myself, because the ship was unable to extend any detection wards out of its structure as no mana other than Tantric could resist the intense bombardment of Primordial Aether for long, which they didn’t use. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same applied to me as well. The structure of the ship was incredibly solid, made of thick, interlocked mana and material, impossible to analyze without destroying. And, I couldn’t destroy it, not without actually breaching the surface. </p><p>So, I got stuck on the surface as they traveled in the primordial aether, visiting certain planes on the way. </p><p>Interestingly, every plane they visited actually had some kind of magical port allowing them to approach, suggesting some kind of semi-permanent access. Out of the eight planes they visited, six of them belonged to the undead, showing the extent of their spread. </p><p>Yet, two of them belonged to different entities. One of them was more of pure mana, suggesting a heavier Arcana usage, and the other, the current one, interestingly, light. </p><p>I wanted to try my hand at breaching the two, but considering their strong relationship with the Eternals, I decided against them. Still, the rapid succession of visits suggested that they were having a far better time finding their path in Primordial Aether. </p><p>Pity I was yet to acquire their method. </p><p>Maybe I should attempt to sneak into the dimension. Of course, to do that, I first removed my own Light Spark and put it behind several Tantric wards. I still remembered how the Necrotic god was able to affect it. </p><p>Then,  moved away from the magical construct the Eternals were using as a port, and moved toward the other side of the plane. Then, I brought a crystal from my hidden spot, one that was holding Necrotic Spark, using it to convert a great amount of necrotic mana. </p><p>In the depths of the Primordial Aether, generating about a million mana only took a few seconds. I could have converted more, but replicating the divine spells took a lot from me, even with my new endurance. </p><p>That was just insurance. </p><p>I approached the planar border, created a mana capsule, and pushed inside, which was as small as I could manage. It was a buried detection ward, one that would be able to slip through the current detection capabilities of my own planar border. </p><p>It allowed me to detect the interior — which was filled with harsh light mana. It was impossible for an ordinary human to survive there for even a second. Worse, I detected a greater problem. Only a few seconds of detection, and they reacted, bombarding it with long-range light magic.</p><p>Wanting to destroy my mark, I  smashed the necrotic mana I prepared, breaching the planar border. </p><p>The magical alerts exploded around, and immediately, an army of angels teleported to the border, ready to attack. </p><p>Worse, I could feel that Divine Spark was active and aligned, suggesting the presence of a god.   </p><p>Which was enough for me to abandon my attempts to push for more and retreat back to the port. This time, the Eternals stayed for a bit longer, no doubt exploring the reason for the sudden undead presence, but that was just an extra half a day.</p><p>Soon, we were on the way once more…</p><p>And, a day later, I was finally looking for a plane that was thousands of times bigger than the fragmented planes I had been encountering.  </p><p>Home…</p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 45</p><p>Endurance: 60      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 32920}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 1103  Mana: 2410}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess}</p>",

    "content": "<p>I let my dazed, naked ruin explorer have a chance to breathe after our searing kiss before getting her attention. “You just need to make a decision, sweetie,” I said as I caressed her thigh. “Do you want to have more time, or make a decision?” </p><p>I grinned at her uncertain expression. “I…” she said, almost as a whisper, just barely audible despite the silence of the ruins. </p><p>As the silence stretched, I moved to sit on a nearby rock. “It’s not that hard, sweetie. Three options. Yes, no … or you earn your delay, by starting to dance.” She looked indecisive still. “You’re the one that tempted me, sweetie.” </p><p>Audrum stood there in her naked glory, and I didn’t bother hiding my eager expression from her, or the fact it got wider as she let out a defeated sigh which she somehow managed to look sexy. As she approached, I watched her with my full attention. </p><p>There was no music, but she seemed to be uncaring of that particular detail as her hips started swaying steadily. Her hands ran up her hips, moving in front of her until they were raised over her head, giving her an alluring feeling. </p><p>She was clearly lying when she said she couldn’t dance. </p><p>“Not a bad start, sweetie,” I said while she turned, swaying as she crossed her legs to hide her wetness. A strategic move to restrict the full view of her beauty … which I let her continue. Her body swayed as she bent backward, far more than I expected her to succeed. </p><p>Her flexibility was important. No wonder it helped her in the ruins in case of an emergency. </p><p>I was happy to get the welcome side effects. “Wow, impressive flexibility,” I commented.  </p><p>“Oh,” she whispered in response to my compliment, but she slowly leaned more and more until she created a complete arc, her hands pressing the ground. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I commented as she slowly stood up, the excitement on her face impossible to hide as she dragged her hands over her chest and her hips once more, before sliding her palms down to her thighs. “Show me more, baby.” </p><p>“A-as you wish,” she stammered, her shy tone a great contrast to her confident movement as she turned her back to me and she started sliding down, grabbing her ankles while her bare ass pointed straight at me, revealing her core, which she had been working hard to hide. </p><p>She stayed there for a moment, shaking her ass for my enjoyment. And, when she stood up, she took a step forward and she was again facing me, even closer. </p><p>“It seems that you have already made a decision,” I commented as she started sinking down until she was crouched in front of me, spraying my legs as she moved even closer to my shaft. She looked at it with her lips parted. </p><p>She said nothing as her hands moved over my thighs and knees. ”Not yet,” she whispered slowly as she leaned forward close enough that I felt her breath over my shaft, but that was the closest she got before she started rising once more. </p><p>I expected her to pull back and took a step back, but she managed to surprise me once more. She continued to sway as she stayed in a half crouch, then moved closer. </p><p>And, just like that, she was rubbing her ass against my leg. I put my hand on her hips. She said nothing, just smiling as her hips never stopped swaying. She leaned back as she raised her hands through her hair, slowly letting it fall around her shoulders like a black blanket as she continued dancing to an imaginary tone.</p><p>Her hands slowly moved down to her chest, squeezing her tits hard. I reached to add my hands to hers, but she slapped them away. “I … I haven’t made a decision yet,” she said as she rose up once more. </p><p>She moved in front of me as her bare breasts swayed to her movement. It only stopped as she began stroking her breasts once more, then moving to her waist as she turned around. </p><p>Even from the distance, I could see her nipples standing straight out, begging for my attention. She must have realized that as well, as soon, as her nipples tightly held between her thumb and forefinger.</p><p>I had to admit, I was getting surprised by how blatant she was getting with her dance. What was supposed to be an excuse to give her a chance to make a decision turned into an erotic show, which I was quite happy about. </p><p>I didn’t know if it was a deliberate choice, or she was lost in her own excitement, but I was happy to get the fruits either way. She bent down toward me once more, and I locked to her bare breasts swinging freely in front of me. </p><p>This time, when I reached for her tits, rather than slapping my hand away, she lowered herself into my lap, rubbing her ass up and down my leg, simulating a nice dance. I pressed my palms against her breasts and massaged them. </p><p>As I squeezed them mercilessly, her hands moved over to mine. But, once again, rather than dragging them away, she helped me to massage her breasts. I was amazed that, even as I started pinching her nipples, her response was to lean forward to make me grab that even better. </p><p>Soon, she stopped helping me with her breasts, and instead slid forward, trapping my shaft against her naked body, rocking her hips, humping me without completing the fun. Meanwhile, my hands had free reign over her body. </p><p>With her head tilted back, she started to moan, her breasts thrust up. I leaned forward to bury my head between her breasts, my hands clenched to her soft flesh.</p><p>She just moaned loudly, her composure completely lost. </p><p>I was amazed. Lost herself in her moans, her hips began moving faster and faster, her entire body thrumming with anticipation as arousal draw closer. </p><p>I decided to help her a bit, and one of my hands slipped into her wetness, finger fucking her aggressively. “Oh, that’s too much,” she moaned. </p><p>“Really,” I mocked as she leaned back, though her hips stayed in place, moving back and forth as I continued to finger fuck her, even faster. “But I don’t care. Feel free to make a decision if you’re not happy with how the dance is developing.” </p><p>“I … not yet,” she whispered. </p><p>“But the time I gave you is already over. You need to do something more interesting if you want me to wait.” </p><p>“As you wish,” she whispered immediately as she departed my lap. For a moment, I thought she was calling a stop, but a glance on her face, contorted with pleasure, was enough to change my mind. </p><p>She fell onto her knees, her hand already wrapped around the base of my shaft. I used the chance to grab her breasts once more, massaging them slowly as her hips parted open. </p><p>I licked my lips, mesmerized as she leaned forward to show her appreciation. A loud groan escaped my mouth as her head started to slide up and down between my legs.</p><p>I watched in amazement at the sight in front of me, my naughty explorer sucking my cock without hesitation, amused by just how far she had come. She worked on my dick like she had been denied one for ages. </p><p>Maybe she was. </p><p>However, rather than asking her that, I decided to enjoy the enthusiastic show, still having trouble believing just enthusiastically she gobbled my shaft. </p><p>“You definitely look cuter with something in your mouth,\" I laughed, earning a furious gaze. But, that didn’t prevent her from working faster, leaning hard enough to take it to her throat. </p><p>I stood entranced as she ran her tongue up the base, her hands cupping my balls. “Better?” she asked. </p><p>“Oh, certainly more interesting,” I answered. She smiled as reached the tip, again engulfing the whole thing in her mouth, moaning the whole time as I guided her head up and down.</p><p>A spectacular fun … certainly worthy of the wait. Now, I needed to decide how to continue.  </p>",

I wanted to assess the potential of the newcomer before agreeing to let him play. </p><p>Stopping to play at this moment wouldn’t help my reputation … but it was much better than being humiliated by a magically enhanced player. </p><p>While I ‘argued’ with the coach, I extended my Intent senses carefully, trying to find the source of the magic I was feeling. I probed slowly, carefully, trying to decide how to delay the decision even more. </p><p>“Arthur, is that you?” declared the new player, smugness oozing from his tone. </p><p>“Paul, what a nice surprise,” Arthur said, though he probably sounded friendlier talking to someone who had just stabbed him. The coldness of his tone was surprising. Then, ignoring everyone, he went forward. </p><p>I had my distraction, though a bit differently than I expected. </p><p>“What are you doing here?” Arthur whispered as he dragged him toward the corner, thinking that it would prevent them from being heard. </p><p>“Why, I decided to change colleges, of course. I didn’t know that you owned this one.” </p><p>“Cut the crap, Paul. Tell me why are you here. I thought Ancient Brotherhood agreed not to spread to America.” </p><p>Paul chuckled. “Come on, brother in arms, as a member of the Ancient Brotherhood, you know that nothing can stop us.” Then, he stopped, giving a bigger chuckle. “Sorry, ex-member. How does a little group of misfits that decided to take you in after your failure is treating you.” </p><p>From the way Arthur’s fist tightened in anger, I could see that whatever the newcomer was referring to touched a nerve. I could have let Arthur attack him, and it would have solved the issue … but during their little argument, I managed to discover what I had been searching for. </p><p>Paul had runes, similar to what Arthur had drawn to his pads for the game, though they were far more elegantly designed. Even a glimpse was enough to confirm that they wouldn’t harm the user as much as Arthurs. </p><p>More importantly, I could sense that his body also contained magic. It didn’t feel like my Traits, which were far more pointed and conceptually stable. It felt more like a raw power source to fuel the runes further.  </p><p>Combined, I expected him to perform very well. As well as I could with several Traits between three to five. Add that to his skill, and a fight would have been an easy escape. </p><p>But why not test my capabilities a bit more directly. I sincerely doubted that another magical organization was here because of Arthur. They clearly hear me, so it was only right for me to test them in turn. </p><p>Just as Arthur was about to attack, I sent him a mental tug, which calmed him. He looked at me, and I shook my head, and gestured him to walk back. </p><p>“We’ll talk later,” Arthur growled as he took a step back, retreating slightly and giving the others a chance to put some distance between them.  </p><p>“A coward as always. Now that another guardian has fallen, the promised day is not too far away. What do you think you can do once another guardian falls and the last one fails to hold the truth. Will you run again?” </p><p>Arthur ignored it, which was a pity. The words that Paul was spilling were interesting, already revealing a lot. The fact that his organization was far bigger than Arthur’s, based in Europe, and the fact that they seemed to be aware of the upcoming so-called disaster as well — though seemingly welcoming it.</p><p>Like I needed another reason to hide the existence of the System. </p><p>I would have loved to poke more, but I decided to act subtly until I understood whether Paul was here as a part of a bigger plan, or was using the chance to annoy a rival. </p><p>“Since you don’t trust your players to defeat me, I’m okay with you adding another player, and acting like it’s not cheating,” I called, acting like it was an insult against the coach. </p><p>Actually, it was a subtle Taunt toward his players, making sure they would treat the newcomer as a sign of their shame. The less coordinated they got, the better.  </p><p>“Let’s not waste much time,” Paul said as he asked for the ball. The coach nodded, and Paul rushed forward, delivering a reckless, one-man charge, catching the defenders flat-footed. Not too shocking. None of them expected a professional quality player. </p><p>Well, except Arthur, but despite his best effort, he wasn’t as agile or strong. Without his runes, the physical difference was stark enough that he was left behind desperately as Paul dunked the ball loudly. </p><p>27-16.</p><p>Arthur asked for the ball, but I gestured from the side, asking them to pass it to Marcus. Arthur looked dissatisfied, which echoed in my Command domain and weakened my hold slightly. </p><p>Interesting. </p><p>Arthur looked like he had a point to make, but I gestured for him to play. It seemed that he needed a slight lesson. He went forward, but was defended tightly by Paul, he was already frustrated. He even looked at me. </p><p>Arthur asked for the ball, and this time I deliberately didn’t intervene, and Paul stole the ball faster than Arthur could adapt, scoring with another fast break. I let it repeat a couple of times more, until it turned to a suffocating streak. Fifteen unanswered points, twelve of them scored by Paul.  </p><p>27-29.</p><p>I called for a timeout. </p><p>“Now, who the fuck wants to explain what’s going on there.” </p><p>The answer was silence. I turned Arthur, who was responsible for the initial ball distribution as the point guard. I deliberately let him play a bit, just to remind him that it wasn’t as simple to rely on my help. “He … he’s too good,” one of the other players muttered.  </p><p>“No, he’s not!” Arthur growled, jealous, no doubt wanting to explain that he was cheating. </p><p>“Enough, I let you sorry bunch plays like that to see if you’ll remember if this a team game, but no. It seems that you all forgot that the moment you face someone with the slightest amount of skill.” </p><p>“But—“ one of them started, only to fall silent as my angry glare fall on him. He pulled back, shocked by my reaction. Admittedly, it was a touch unfair to push them, but it was the best way to make them listen.</p><p>“Tell me, do you want to win, or should we surrender.” </p><p>“We want to win,” they answered, including Arthur. </p><p>“Even if it means your personal score wouldn’t be as impressive,” I asked, and the others stayed silent, looking at Arthur, who was clearly the target of my words. </p><p>“I …” he started, suddenly looking deflated. </p><p>“I can bench you, and we can arrange a one-to-one match right after if you’re feeling confident,” I warned him sharply, which was a naked threat. There was no chance for him to win, which was clear. </p><p>Yet, he looked reluctant to accept the idea as well. “Think about it this way, he put all that effort to surprise you, probably because he wanted to get your place in the football team. Today’s show is just a surprise. A defeat today would make him waste his plans…” I said, and left the next part unsaid. </p><p>It would also probably harm the plans of the Ancient Brotherhood, the same organization that kicked him out. The vindictive expression on his face was beautiful. </p><p>“Yes, coach,” he said with a renewed passion, and I felt the power of the domain getting stronger. </p><p>“Good, now, about the tactics,” I said, drawing several of them quickly. It had passed the limits of a timeout slightly, but my opposing coach seemed satisfied to lord his superiority. </p><p>Excellent.  </p><p>“Stay focused on the game, this is a team game,” I called them one last time, and gestured for them to go back to the field. </p><p>The fun was just starting. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I returned to the main area, I met with a charged environment. Marcus and Arthur had arrived, likely recently considering they were still holding their bags, and the rest of my scrappy team was surrounding the two. </p><p>Against them, the starters had lined up, their centers taking the front with the hope of intimidating them, raining insults and threats in an equal manner, while the coach just watched. “… I’ll make sure you won’t be stepping into the court ever,” one of them declared. </p><p>The backup players seemed to be a bit intimidating, but Arthur and Marcus were enough to radiate confidence, preventing them from retreating. Being tackled daily helped them to ignore the physical intimidation aspect, and since they were not a part of the basketball team in the first place, the insults didn’t work. </p><p>Though, I noted Marcus carefully watching the poor guy who had just lost his girlfriend, clearly ready to turn that into a physical altercation. </p><p>All it would take was a touch of intent to turn that into a brawl that they started, and if I had any fear of losing, I would have used that. But, with my concerns about revealing some of my lesser abilities gone, the victory was far easier to attain. </p><p>“How amusing to see you relying on such cheap tricks, coach,” I said as I walked toward the old man. </p><p>The coach turned toward me, with a smug smile on his face. Too smug, even, which alerted me that something else was going on. “Then, you should be with your players rather than diddling cheerleaders,” he answered smugly. </p><p>For a moment, I thought that it was about making me admit what had happened in front of the cameras … but I didn’t sense any expectation in his expression. It was clearly not his trap. “Maybe you should have taught your students not to bet what they can’t afford to lose,” I said loudly, enough to alert the rest of the team to my presence. </p><p>And the starters immediately turned toward me, furious but smart enough not to rush forward. I gave them a wave and a chuckle, but that was all I did as I moved to the side, and went to the sideline I would occupy. </p><p>The team gathered around me. “Now, boys, are you ready to play?” I said with a smirk, letting Intent infuse them in the way I had learned from Tactics and Strategy Traits, creating a subtle yet connection between them, which made everyone shuffle subconsciously as they changed their stance … as if they were a team that was playing together for years and knew exactly how to work together. That went unnoticed by all of them …</p><p>Except for Arthur, whose eyes widened at the direct application. I hadn’t used that trick on him before, so it was the first time I was using it. Inadvertently, he looked at me, and I nodded in a decisive manner, signaling that I knew about his magical capability. </p><p>He looked slightly surprised, but accepting. After all, he already knew that I could use some magic — it was the reason he was sent — and he was also aware that, after his stunt with the runes, I would realize something. </p><p>After that silent communication, I started to draw several plays for them, one that was based on the earlier plays they had been drawing for me. Admittedly, that part wasn’t entirely necessary, I could teach them more complicated plans quickly … but that would be too suspicious. The hour-long session gave me enough pieces to work with.  </p><p>And the rest, I could just excuse as their improvisation. </p><p>“I want all of you to play extremely focused on the defense, man to man, and feel free to play a bit rougher if necessary, we don’t have a referee,” I said. The basketball players looked scared of that idea, but Marcus and Arthur looked far too enthusiastic. </p><p>“Shall we start, coach?” I called. </p><p>“Yes, little boy, prepare to be defeated. I’m not that useless kid Spencer,” he said, and both teams took the court. His confidence wasn’t surprising, but for some reason, it still annoyed me. </p><p>Since their center was much taller, they had no trouble winning the jump ball, and the moment they started, they passed the ball to their power forward, the unlucky guy whose girlfriend — well, likely ex-girlfriend at this point — had been entertaining me for the last hour.  </p><p>He rushed forward recklessly in a fast break, preparing to start the game with a spectacular dunk. While I pitied him slightly, I didn’t care about him as much as I cared about increasing my Intent, so I subtly ordered Arthur to defend him tightly. </p><p>Unlike the others, Arthur was able to recognize the slight mental inclination for what it was, and he followed it directly, cutting off his path. And, when the opponent rose, hoping to use his size to dunk, Arthur stopped him with a merciless dunk. </p><p>One of our players recovered the ball, passed it to Marcus, who was fast enough to pass the defenders before they could react, and scored an easy layup. </p><p>2-0. </p><p>“Nice start, boys,” I shouted as I clapped. “Just like that, they are weak enough not to defeat you one-to-one,” I shouted, abusing the fact that the match was still being live-streamed. They could have tried to apply some complicated tactics, but with them being dared in such an explosive manner, they tried to invalidate my argument about winning one-to-one. </p><p>With predictable results. </p><p>15-8. </p><p>And, more importantly. </p><p>[Intent Pool: 94.6%] </p><p>I was already thinking about how to use that Intent. Repairing was still not an attractive choice, not before I got a better understanding of the Domains. Luckily, after playing with the Lust for a while, the match was also allowing me to experiment on Command. </p><p>The more my team scored, the stronger I could feel the echo of the Domain, and the easier for me to order them. However, I was yet to discover a way that I could spend the Intent. </p><p>Another source was Acolyte. I could feel that imbuing someone as an Acolyte was possible … and at a distance, I could feel several echoes. It was a much better spending … but there, I had a different problem. </p><p>Trust. </p><p>I didn’t trust anyone, at least not enough to suddenly grant them magical powers, which might or might not be reversible. It was not a risk that should be taken without great consideration… or without great emergency. </p><p>So, I decided to cheat a bit, and focused on my pet. </p><p>[Intent Pool: 4.6%] </p><p>Totem Animals: (Black Tortoise [1 - %14])</p><p>At a distance, I could feel my pet was getting stronger. </p><p>Admittedly, I was already having some doubts about him. It was not unreasonable to think that it was the System that empowered it, and infected it with some kind of pseudo-intelligence, or maybe even true intelligence. </p><p>Yet, my doubts remained. </p><p>His appearance was rather suspicious now that I started to think about it. However, it was also his appearance that allowed me to discover some interesting usages of my Intent. Moreover, considering he was willing to defend me against the shadow assassins, wasn’t seem to be willing to immediately bring others to me, and unlike my guide, didn’t try to browbeat me into absurdly dangerous situations. </p><p>I was happy to let it slide.  </p><p>Meanwhile, my opponent had worse problems. “Stop it, idiots, start running some pick and rolls, it’s a proper match, not a street game,” their coach started shouting, annoyed by the gap that was being created. His team was already falling apart. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t feel the satisfaction as I watched him shout. There was none of the urgency I expected to see on his face, like he was still confident in his victory. It could be that he was confident that his team could recover … but it felt like something bigger.  </p><p>Curious, I thought, but left that alone, and instead focused on the game. </p><p>“Double-team him,” he shouted as Arthur rushed forward, using his physical advantages — which had increased after his runic trick, almost enough to count as Strength I — to rush into the paint and deliver short-range shots and layups. </p><p>Which got harder as two people rolled around him, blocking his path. He was strong, but not that strong.  </p><p>Unfortunately for them, Arthur was also a quarterback, which meant his spatial awareness was already not a joke, and he was always ready to throw a pass. Combine that with my Command trick, allowing him to be aware of the exact position of his teammates … it was trivial for him to find the player without a defender, waiting at the three-point line. </p><p>A smooth pass, followed by a smooth, unhurried shoot gave us three points more. </p><p>A great start, and the rest of the quarter passed at a similar pace, the gap getting wider and wider. When the first quarter ended, it ended with a spectacular gap. </p><p>27-14. </p><p>Unfortunately, when I looked at the expression of the coach, he was more vindictive than despairing, typing on his phone. </p><p>The reason soon revealed itself. Another player, one that none of the others recognized, walked to the room, though, the moment I saw him, I tensed. I could feel a very familiar presence on him. Magic. </p><p>“And, our latest starter, one that was recruited by me personally, is finally here,” the coach declared. </p><p>The game just got a lot more interesting.</p>",
