    "content": "<p>I smirked as Kevin stumbled toward us, trying to force his way through the crowd. </p><p>“Megan, I can explain-” he stuttered, only for his words to die halfway when he realized the positioning of her arm. A terrible lack of awareness, especially for a quarterback whose job was to process everything at his field of vision at once. “What are you doing here!” he said as he took a step forward in a way that he no doubt thought intimidating. </p><p>Unfortunately, he had three things working against him. First, as a principle, I was never afraid of the physical danger posed by a rich, spoiled kid. Second, even though he was a football player, a quarterback hardly created a physically imposing figure, especially since he was an inch shorter and considerably thinner than me. </p><p>Third, dressed in a bathrobe, his attempt was simply comical, enough to earn a wave of laughter from the crowd. </p><p>“What am I doing here?” I said, looking shocked. “I thought I was invited to the party. Aren’t I, Thad?” I said, making a comical show of surprise even as I waved to the hulking figure of Thad, who, as a defensive lineman, put an intimidating figure even with a big smile on his face. </p><p>“Of course you’re not invited,” he said, which made the crowd gasp in excitement, expecting a scandal as I kicked off, missing his widening smirk as Thad processed the sight. “Since when a member of the team needs an invite to step into the Den!” he shouted, which earned a huge cheer from the players around. </p><p>Well, half of the players, exclusively the defense, while the offense chose to look at me angrily. </p><p>Interestingly, the defense was predominantly spread around the left side of the courtyard and the pool, while the offense was ere on the right side. The bad blood between them had to b even worse than what I had assumed if even in a party, they were divided like that. </p><p>And I doubted my actions would help soften the relationship in any manner. Not when my first party appearance was accompanied by stealing the girlfriend of one of their players — one of the quarterbacks, the face of the offense, making the insult even more intense. </p><p>“You heard it, Kev. I need no invite. Is there anything else you want to say?” I said mockingly. It wasn’t the best zinger I had come up with, but it was amazing how the snickers of the crowd could turn into a stand-up quality heckle, especially when the audience was already buzzed. </p><p>“Megan, please, let’s talk,” he said as he took a step forward. </p><p>I was tempted to just punch him, but when Megan took a subtle step back, measured, just enough to maintain the distance while positioning me in between, I decided to follow her direction once more. I took half a step forward, and I was safely lodged between them, preventing Kevin from reaching Megan, like a heroic man defending his girl. </p><p>“Why should we talk?” Megan said. “We talked, and you said you are busy for the evening.” She let out a mocking laugh as she turned the girls around him. “And you clearly are, so I decided to break the pace and find a date to accompany me instead.” </p><p>“Shut up, you frigid bitch,” said a surprised voice as a girl burst into the field. She was a sexy redhead with an amazing body, said amazingness on a great display as she was wearing only a lacy bra as the top, turned transparent with wetness. Unfortunately, she still had her skirt on, preventing it from turning into a real show. “That’s what happens when you never put up for your man. He finds a real woman to satisfy him.” </p><p>From Kevin’s face, and the way her arms tightened around my arm, that was not the best thing to say. Revealing to the whole party that he wasn’t able to seduce his girlfriend to been hardly helped Kevin’s reputation. </p><p>From Megan, however, I only felt fury. A tight, compact fury, the kind I wouldn’t expect from a little rich girl. Up until that moment, it was just a game, Megan’s way of punishing her boyfriend to remind him to act more carefully. </p><p>That moment transformed it completely. Being accused to be the lesser woman in such a public fashion, using details pertaining to their bedroom life, was clearly not something Megan was willing to swallow. </p><p>Megan moved, and I prepared myself to take a step back, ready to give her space if she wanted to attack the redheaded girl. It was not a thing I really understood about the girls, attacking the other woman when the boyfriend was the one that cheated. A silly way to go about it, but I had more important things to worry about than understanding the mysteries of female fury. </p><p>Unfortunately, I realized too late that Megan shared my opinion on that subject. She grabbed my arm rather than lashing forward at the other girl. A moment later, her lips were on mine…</p><p>I always thought it was a cliche describing the first kisses accompanied by music. </p><p>Admittedly, it was less about any kind of emotional surge, revealing an unlikely romantic connection, and more about the DJ choosing the perfect moment to drop the beat before switching to a romantic song. </p><p>I was starting to feel like Kevin was not a well-liked person. What a surprise. </p><p>However, as I felt Megan’s tongue slipping inside my mouth, her ex-boyfriend’s relative likability and DJ’s common sense lost their importance. Her lips were soft, contrasting beautifully with the aggressiveness of her tongue. </p><p>My shock passed in short order, replaced by amusement. </p><p>Well, if Megan wanted to give her ex-boyfriend a show, I was more than happy to help. I let one of my hands slip down to her waist, slipping under her blouse to caress her naked skin even as I dipped her down, the other slipping into her soft hair to support her head. </p><p>She tensed for a moment, clearly not expecting me to take the situation and push even further, but under the circumstances, she couldn’t just push me back to maintain the kiss at her exact preference of intensity. </p><p>And, at the risk of sounding smug, I was not a bad kisser. On the contrary, as my tongue battled against hers, her tenseness melted. One of her hands joined the fray by replicating my move, sliding into my hair, but the similarity ended there. My hold was soft and gentle. She pulled my hair, enough to make me let out a gasp of pain. </p><p>That only made me kiss her harder. A little rough play was always fun. </p><p>I continued to kiss her, even as her other hand joined the fray, landing on my chest. Though, the moment she touched, she froze, giving the signs of being pleasantly surprised by my build, before trailing down with an even bigger passion. </p><p>“Stop it, you slut,” Kevin shouted, his voice boiling in impotent jealousy. I couldn’t help but pity him at that moment. I knew Megan for less than an hour, but even then, I was very much aware that it was literally the worst thing he could say. </p><p>And Megan didn’t waste a second before making him know that. Not by pulling back from the kiss and insulting him back, but by letting her fingers dip down even lower, landing on my bulge. </p><p>Her finger froze at the touch. </p><p>Let’s just say there was a reason for my preference for loose pants. </p><p>However, her freeze lasted only for a second before her fingers started to dance with a renewed vigor, enough to convince me that it was only partially about annoying her ex as much as possible. </p><p>“That’s enough, lovebirds,” another voice interrupted. If it was anyone else, I might have ignored it, as Megan was a delicious angry kisser, but since it was Thad, I decided to follow his direction, especially since I trusted him — well more to his distaste he felt against Kevin — to pick the perfect time to do so. </p><p>As I pulled, another mystery revealed itself. I was surprised that Kevin hadn’t charged to punch me, which would have been an excellent way to twist the narrative. But Thad proved a true defensive lineman and stood between us, his smirk telling that he was more than happy tackling Kevin outside of practice as well. </p><p>I pulled back, my arm still tight around Megan, pulling her tight against my chest. She didn’t seem to mind,  considering her hand was still lingering over my erection, pressing tight enough to make my baggy pants not an effective solution to the size of my bulge. </p><p>And after everything I had seen from her, I wasn’t surprised by her next words. </p><p>“You can have your little boy, I’m happy with a real man,” Megan said dismissively to the redheaded girl, who looked just as disappointed at the developments as Kevin. And to add insult to injury, her gaze stayed down Kevin’s waist region long enough to convey what exactly she was talking about. </p><p>Damn, I thought, unable to hide my wince. Even if I despised the guy, that was a deadly blow, especially since it didn’t have to be actually true. Unless he whipped out a total monster immediately, it would simply be a part of the gossip for the next few days. </p><p>Poor guy. </p><p>Kevin tried to stammer an answer, but Megan had already turned at me with a lovesick expression. Her expression was fake, naturally, but with all the hype going around, I was the only one that was close enough to notice so. For everyone else, she was ‘tamed’ by my monster. </p><p>His teammates — other offensive players, naturally — dragged Kevin back before he could make an even bigger fool of himself, sending deadly glares to me and Thad as they retreated. </p><p>The redheaded girl retreated along as well, with a great distaste. She had achieved her aim of taking the toy she desired, but that didn’t make her little ploy a complete failure. </p><p>After all, where was the fun, playing with a toy discarded by the other children. </p><p>As the offense retreated, Megan finally pulled her hand away from my crotch — though not without a hint of reluctance if I read the light dancing behind her eyes correctly — but still stayed at my side. </p><p>With the show she had provided, she had no choice but to do so. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The team house was not close to the stadium. It was situated in the dead center of the college, right between the sorority houses and other frat houses, on top of the only hill in the area, looking at the other student residences from its lofty position. </p><p>A location that was far too poetic to be accidental. </p><p>It was a large building, though wider than tall, constructed in the finest tradition of late nineteenth-century American architecture despite dating to the mid-sixties — a poor attempt to copy the aura of the older, more established universities. </p><p>But like everything in Sunset college, that only highlighted its gauche fakeness. The team house was the perfect example. What was imagined as a quiet, proud place to reflect dignity through its location on the hill was marred with an endless number of flags, ugly, poorly-drawn graffiti, and other blinding features. Disgustingly bright colors, and pointless words filled the walls hardly helped. </p><p>Though, ultimately, the poor decoration didn’t matter, not when the courtyard filled with a horde of people going in and out, competing for attention in colors, style, or the amount of flesh that could be revealed without being actively qualified to be pornographic. </p><p>Naturally, I didn’t have a problem with the state of the people, especially the way it pertained to the female half. Or two-thirds, if I were to be accurate, as it was clearly a female-majority event. </p><p>Considering the reputation of their parties, it would be overly optimistic to claim feminism as the driving factor for the gender imbalance. </p><p>From the uncaring glance of Megan, it was clear that she didn’t care about the mess as well, though she dressed much more high-class manner, easily separating herself from the other girls chasing the cheap thrills of bagging of a football player for a night.</p><p>What an interesting girl.  </p><p>Unfortunately, our lack of care wasn’t shared by the other passenger of our journey. “W-what is going on here?” my guide stammered in shock as she looked at the crowd, where some girls were already in their underwear, diving into the large pool — which must be a heated one, because it was too cold to do so otherwise. The garden was also decorated with an impressive number of open-air heaters, keeping the garden warm at the cost of an explosive electricity bill. </p><p>Luckily, Megan was carefully examining the crowd, her expression getting tighter with every player from the offense, but still searching for a particular one, while the music was loud enough to suppress my whisper, so I answered her under my breath, hoping she would be able to hear it despite the music. </p><p>“That’s the tradition, I’m afraid,” I whispered to my guide, who was watching the event with shock. “But it shouldn’t be the first time you’re seeing a naughty party, not if even the half of the things I had read about Dionysus was true,” I said. </p><p>“Why would you say that guy's name!” she shouted, her power radiating once more. But this time, it was different. It wasn’t the annoyance she had displayed when I mentioned Zeus, or the confusion when she tried to remember her own name. </p><p>It was pure, adulterated, terror. </p><p>“Sorry,” I muttered, surprised by her reaction. Why the hell a god of alcohol and parties would evoke such a raw terror in her where the reference to Zeus only created annoyance. </p><p>“I won’t come inside, call me when your party finishes,” she said, and disappeared. </p><p>It was nice to learn that she could actually disappear rather than always hanging in the background, though I wished that didn’t leave another big question behind. Not to mention, I had no idea how to call her back. </p><p>Unfortunately, the other person I had been sharing the car with spoke. “Did you say something?” Megan asked, her gaze still exploring the building. </p><p>I was about to give her an excuse, when I noticed a figure trying to bury himself into the pool, three girls around him. “Check the pool,  you might see something interesting,” I said even as my eyes met with Kevin, whose eyes widened in shock at being caught. Though, the shock wasn’t alone, as my presence in her girlfriend’s car clearly brought out quite a bit of anger as well. Too bad he had no chance of actually using that anger. </p><p>Not when Megan caught his gaze to give him a wave, though her expression was enough to freeze the heated pool he was in. </p><p>Damn, I thought. Being caught was bad, but being caught between three girls in their underwear, swimming in a pool after losing her car on a bet… </p><p>Before I could enjoy his misfortune, Megan’s gaze turned to me, still icy. If I hadn’t already realized she wasn’t one of the boring sorority girls, that moment would have been all the evidence I needed. </p><p>She didn’t scare me, but it would be a lie if I said I didn’t have goosebumps for a moment. And considering the way I grew up, that was a serious achievement. “You’re going to be my boyfriend for the night, or else…” </p><p>“It would be an honor, Your Highness,” I said mockingly, but I still left the car to open her car door. The situation was far too amusing to watch from a distance, not to mention, walking inside with the girlfriend of the quarterback was just the kind of thing that would create a spectacle. </p><p>Exactly the amusement I needed, with the stress of the unknown looming over me.</p><p>As we stepped out of the car, almost no one — with the great exception of Kevin, flailing in water as he tried to cut through the other people to get out — paid any attention to us, which didn’t change much when I walked toward the other side of the car. </p><p>For the people at the party, I was nothing more than one of the hangers-on arrived here to get some attention. The car I arrived at was beautiful, of course, but hardly the flashiest one between the veritable gallery that filled the field. </p><p>However, the silence rippled through the crowd once I opened the driver-side door, and Megan stepped out with all her glory. It wasn’t instant, like a movie. It was a couple nearest to us at first, desperately poking their friend to make her a witness as well. Two turned to three, which turned to five, then ten. </p><p>And I used the moment to finally give a good look at her body as she stood next to me. After all, I was going to play her boyfriend for the night. </p><p>She was a spectacular beauty. On that, there was no doubt. Her lithe body was a touch thinner than my general preference when it came to fun times, but luckily, her hips were wide enough to compensate for her natural deficiency — no doubt cured through endless hours in the gym. </p><p>If there was one thing social media was good for, it was to repopularize the value of a nice booty. </p><p>Her breasts weren’t big enough to be classified as large, but still big enough to keep one’s hands full once grabbed — too bad I wasn’t her real boyfriend, making it unfeasible to assess their softness. </p><p>Her body was beautiful, definitely top-notch, but the real impact came from the clothes she had picked. Killer, thigh-high boots to display her stunning legs, a short, stylish skirt — but not too short to be classified as whorish — and a nice blouse with a tasteful cleavage, maximizing the impact of her modest bosom. </p><p>Combined with her flowing blonde hair, beautiful face, and haughty expression, there was no doubt she was one of the most striking beauties at the school. </p><p>I could certainly do worse for a fake girlfriend, even without what her position represented. </p><p>Like any exponential growth, the silence grew wildly, taking less than thirty seconds to cover the whole courtyard. Even the music was suddenly lowered, proving that the DJ had the perfect instincts. </p><p>But that was nothing compared to Megan’s sense of timing. Only when everyone turned to us, she spoke. “I’m having a bit of trouble with these heels, sweetie,” she gasped. “Do you mind helping me walk?” she said in a cute voice that wouldn’t be amiss to a stupid blonde character in a sitcom. </p><p>“Not at all, honey,” I said as I presented my arm, unable to prevent a chuckle from escaping, amused by the coldness she had in the car compared to the fake silly cheerfulness. Maybe that was why Kevin thought he could just use her car without an issue. </p><p>And I didn’t need to receive her icy-cold glare to remember that she was not a pack of sweets. I winked at her before presenting my arm. She hooked, and I received her painful pinch in good humor. </p><p>She was the one that took the first step, and I just followed her pacing, trusting her ability to measure the senses of the crowd successfully. She fulfilled my expectations perfectly as she led us directly to the most crowded part, people splitting around us, their enthusiastic expression telling that they were ready for the drama. </p><p>As I watched Kevin stumble forward, hastily trying to put on a bathrobe, I could see that fun was about to begin.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“What are you doing this close to the stadium,” she asked even as she started driving, her attention on the road.</p><p>“Practice session.” </p><p>“Really, I haven’t seen you around before.” </p><p>“First day in the team,” I answered. </p><p>“Really, offense or defense?” Considering her friend — or boyfriend, more likely — was a part of the team as the backup quarterback, her question wasn’t entirely shocking. </p><p>“Backup middle linebacker,” I answered succinctly, and considering her nod, she followed the game enough to understand the game more than most sorority groupies who were more interested in the status of a football player than the actual game. </p><p>“You have a tough road ahead of you,  the training the defensive team goes through is nothing less than torture,” she said, though, the moment I mentioned that I was a backup, her interest increased slightly. Backup players, especially when played for defense, weren’t exactly at the peak of the social hierarchy of the school, they were leagues better than the practice squad. </p><p>The less said about the position of the chess players in the hierarchy, the better. </p><p>“I can’t say that I’m feeling fresh as a daisy,” I answered with a tired smirk. “I’m really glad that you stopped, by the way. After full training, the walk would have been a total drag. I’m Terry, by the way.”  </p><p>“Megan,” she answered. “Kevin always bitches about moving after a long training as well. Like tonight.” </p><p>“Really, I would have assumed a quarterback would have an easier training schedule.” </p><p>“Not the case. Like tonight, we were supposed to hang together tonight, but apparently, the team had an emergency study session.” </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said, my smirk widening, though she had missed that as she drove. Since I had been invited, I knew for a fact that the team had a party. I could just tell that, which would make her call Kevin angrily. </p><p>A move like that was supposed to be against the bro-code, but I had absolutely no problem with messing with Kevin some more, especially with such an excellent opportunity. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had seen the same song and dance many times. She would get angry, Kevin would give a few excuses about the last-minute change, or convince her with hundreds of other excuses. </p><p>That didn’t change my mind about messing with Kevin, of course. I might have let it slide the egging part, as none of them came even close to hitting me, and I always enjoyed playing against a rattled opponent. However, trying to get me kicked out of the team just because I managed to intercept his passes was a different thing.</p><p>I’m not really a vengeful person, but that didn’t mean I would turn the amazing opportunity that came to my feet. </p><p>“Actually, I didn’t know that. The guys from the defense said that there’s a party back at the team house tonight, but maybe the offense has their separate study session. Their coach looks quite strict,” I said, aware just how unbelievable it sounds for anyone that had seen two coaches. </p><p>“Oh, really?” she murmured, her tone icy even as she sent me a glare, suspicious of me. </p><p>I matched her smirk, realizing that despite what her blonde hair and her expensive outfit might have implied at the first glance thanks to decades of TV coding, she wasn’t an airhead. She was certainly sharp enough to understand the intent behind my words, as well as the deliberate wording I had chosen. </p><p>That glance was enough to tell me that Kevin’s idea of deflecting her was doomed to failure in the first place, though that didn’t change the enjoyment I had from my own involvement. </p><p>She immediately reached for the phone, but before she could call him, I spoke once again. Since I had started the fire, I had no problem pouring some gas on the fire to make it nice and warm. “Do you mind accompanying me to the party,” I said. “Just to pay back the favor of giving me a ride, of course.” </p><p>“Oh, I would love it!” she said cheerfully, like a housewife about to stab her husband. </p><p>I was about to ask her to stop by my dorm, but when she slammed the gas aggressively, I decided that, sometimes, the silence was really golden. Instead, I leaned back, enjoying the drive even as Megan pressed the gas. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I didn’t feel a momentary panic as she sped up, afraid of an accident, but the smooth way she shifted the gears, smoothly yet aggressively, calmed me quite a bit. It was the small details that drew the line between an expert and an amateur over her head, and Megan drove too well to be an amateur. </p><p>Maybe good enough to be called an expert, I thought as she took a sharp turn aggressively, drifting flawlessly without shedding any more speed than what was strictly necessary. </p><p>She was a way better driver than I was. </p><p>It was a maneuver that no car I could afford could make, requiring much higher torque than my little dinky wrecks could actually output. But that didn’t mean I have never used a better car — though legality in of my possession was under dispute. </p><p>I might or might not have hung around with a questionable set of friends when I was sixteen. </p><p>“So, is the car yours or Kevin’s,” I asked without prompting, five minutes into the drive. </p><p>“Why, can’t a girl enjoy driving something with decent horsepower?” she growled. It seemed that my statement hit in a different location than I had been expecting. </p><p>“Cool your cats, sweetie,” I said, my smile getting even wider. “If I didn’t think you could drive, I would have dropped off before that crazy sharp turn.” Once again, she impressed me with her instincts by looking at me expectantly, aware that I was just setting up another opening. “I was just wondering what kind of car Kevin owned? Another sports car?” </p><p>“No, he drives a sedan,” she said. </p><p>“I see,” I said, falling silent in a very particular manner. </p><p>“Tell me,” she ordered. </p><p>“I wouldn’t want to cause trouble between you two, maybe I should keep my mouth shut,” I said smugly, earning an eye-roll in response. “He might have made a bet with one of the defensive players, putting up a red convertible,” I said. “And I distinctly remember him saying his car, but...” </p><p>“I see,” Megan said, but her fingers around the wheel tightened even further. </p><p>“But maybe he has a different car in mind. Why don’t you text him and say you’ll go away for a surprise family trip, and see whether he’ll raise the issue of the car.” </p><p>She didn’t say anything, nor that she needed to when she grabbed her phone — thankfully slowing down as she did so — and typed a message. The response came quickly, and if the way her face tightened was any indicator, Kevin couldn’t manage to avoid the little pit I dug for him. </p><p>A pit filled with poisonous snakes and sharp spikes, but just a pit nonetheless. </p><p>Frankly, I had no idea what Kevin was thinking. Was he hoping to just give the car of his girlfriend and hope for the best, somehow delaying things until things exploded? Maybe he had the funds to buy another car, or needed a few days to convince his family for it. </p><p>Maybe he didn’t even have a long-term plan. He wouldn’t be the first man I had seen, making ridiculous decisions to delay the problem, hoping everything would somehow fall on his way. </p><p>“That was not nice,” came a voice chiming from the backseat, but I ignored it steadfastly other than meeting her gaze from the mirror, seeing a disapproving expression. </p><p>“So, what exactly he do to you?” she asked after another minute of fuming. Though, her anger was not fully contained, only suppressed and stored for a later explosion. </p><p>“Nothing much,” I said. “He just tried to get me kicked out of the team because of a few measly interceptions. Apparently, he doesn’t appreciate any kind of competition.” </p><p>“I see,” she said, though she relaxed after seeing I had a valid reason to have a beef with Kevin rather than somehow trying to use it as an opportunity to get with her. </p><p>She said nothing else, focusing on the drive. It was tempting to mention the egging incident as well, to see her reaction, which would no doubt be amusing at this point, but I didn’t want to disperse her anger before she could face her boyfriend — or more likely, ex-boyfriend. </p>",

    "content": "<p>In the end, I decided even as I pulled her hair back painfully and exposing her neck for my aggressive kisses, there was no need to complicate the situation. Emma was never one to handle the pressure successfully, making a more complicated ploy that required many complicated questions unnecessary. The pressure was the best option.  </p><p>Whether that pressure came in the form of political weight, pain, or pure pleasure. </p><p>I could see emotions cycling on her beautiful face as I littered her neck with kisses, panic, and pleasure battling. Though, it didn’t take long for the panic to disappear, leaving its place into acceptance, while the pleasure continued to grow. It was hardly the first time she experienced this particular dance. </p><p>I didn’t push her hard immediately, however. Instead, I pulled back, giving her a moment to cool down even as my hands sneaked toward her clothes, lingering on the edge of her beautiful breasts, giving her a moment to process the depth of the situation she found herself in once again. I didn’t want her to be distracted in a powerless whirlwind. No, I wanted her emotions to cool down, her mind to focus on the full extent of the issue.  </p><p>And, from the way her beautiful emerald eyes transformed, I could read that her confidence, already paper-thin in the first place, was shattering before I could utter a question. My first objective was already completed. </p><p>That didn’t mean I was going to take it lightly, of course. There was no overkill when it came to per-interrogation mood-setting, especially when it would allow me to finish the job I had started in the library earlier. </p><p>A panicked gasp escaped her mouth when, without a warning, I grabbed her hips even as I used a spell to pull my pants down, skewering her hard with my shaft, quicker than I normally would. </p><p>It was still a punishment session, after all. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised to see her silence, already tenuous, broken immediately as my shaft forced her tunnel to widen. She was sopping wet with anticipation, however, allowing it to slide in effortlessly. </p><p>She started moaning as I lifted her for a moment, only to slam her back down. At this point, her pride was too shattered for her to even fake a momentary resistance. A smirk popped in my face as I updated the objective for the evening — well, more of a morning. I still wanted to interrogate her, of course, but I also wanted her to actually beg for it before finally letting her cum. </p><p>Of course, before starting proper torture through denial, I first needed to bring her closer to the cliff. Luckily, after our repeated embraces, I knew the exact way to achieve that little objective. I grabbed her hips, though, at this point, I didn’t need to actually lift her up. She was more than happy to pick up speed, moving faster and faster with each second. </p><p>Just a minute — filled with her growing moans — was enough to bring her dangerously close to the climax. Her body must have been still primed since our earlier library adventure. “Faster,” she begged, even though it was her that was controlling the pacing at the moment. </p><p>It was a pity that her begging had the exact opposite effect. </p><p>A shocked yelp escaped her mouth even as I suddenly grabbed her waist and threw her on the bed, and she found herself laying down, prone. She tried to turn, but I pressed my hand on the small of her back, preventing her from flipping. “Is there something wrong?” she asked in a trembling tone. </p><p>“Of course not. I just realized that it was rude to keep you upright after such a long day of working hard. You earned your rest. Maybe even a beautiful massage session,” I said. </p><p>She stammered a garbled reply, cut halfway as I spanked her ass, reminding her who was the dominant party in our little twisted relationship. Despite the jolt of pain, her breathing quickened, showing just how close to the edge she was. </p><p>For that exact reason, I gave her a moment to catch her breath before I let my fingers move once more. Even worse for her, I could easily read the meaning behind the exact speed of her quickening breaths and twitching muscles, allowing me to keep her on the edge easily, without even resorting to magic.</p><p>At this moment, I could have subjected her to a soft massage, extending her torture gently. Unfortunately for her, she didn’t earn that. Instead, I slapped her ass again, hard, enough to earn another yelp before my fingers slipped inside her, pumping aggressively for a moment, bringing her just at the edge before pulling back, letting her come down. </p><p>“Please,” she whispered desperately, surrendering to my treatment instantly. </p><p>“Not before you answer a few of my questions,” I said even as I leaned closer to her face, half-buried into the pillow. “Like who was that mysterious maid that was accompanying you back in the library?” </p><p>“A friend…” she whispered, making an absolutely horrible attempt of deflection. </p><p>“Really,” I said even as I slipped my hand into her hair, pulling hard enough to earn a gasp. “She was a friend that you were helping to sneak into the palace, just for fun?” </p><p>“Yes—“ she tried to say, only to lose her words as I spanked her again. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie. If you’re going to lie, at least try to make it believable.” </p><p>“It was an agent of the mage guild,” she amended. “They are forcing me to help them?” </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked, acting as I believed her for a moment. “Why?” </p><p>“They work for a mysterious organization from another world, and they want to take control of the Empire,” she was quick to explain.</p><p>“And who is this mysterious organization?” I asked. I knew that she was trying to lie, but just because she was lying didn’t mean her words were worthless. Especially since I knew the exact truth she was trying to conceal. </p><p> “I’m afraid that you won’t believe me if I tell you,” she managed to gasp even as my fingers slipped inside her once more halfway, adding another layer to her distraction once again. </p><p>I smirked victoriously, aware that she didn’t have the angle to see it. She was already broken halfway. The next words that would leave her mouth were going to be spectacularly big, as she was clearly setting up a big reveal, hoping to distract me. What a futile effort. </p><p>The only question, whether she was going to use the truth, or a half-truth to distract me. </p><p>“Are you saying that there’s a probability of you trying to lie to me?” I countered, not bothering to hide my mocking tone. </p><p>“No! Of course not!” she said, quick to correct her words. “I could never lie to you.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said, despite knowing full well that she told that in an attempt to trick me. But, ironically, acting like I believed her declaration made it much easier for me to interrogate her. “Now, tell me.” </p><p>“The mage guild is working for elves,” she declared, twisting her neck as she said, a confident expression on her face. She clearly expected me to react explosively. </p><p>To her credit, I was surprised — though certainly not as much as I would have been before the discovery of an actual phoenix leading another faction — but I had no intention of actually showing my shock. “I see,” I said. “Do you have any concrete idea about their plans?” </p><p>“Y-you believe me?” she stuttered, the nature of her shock suggesting that it was actually closer to the truth. </p><p>“Why wouldn’t I believe you when I had already discovered their presence in the palace,” I said even as I let my hand slide on her back, conveniently resting on her heart to listen to her pulse. The sudden jump in her heartbeat as I said they were already in the palace suggested fear. </p><p>Which meant her claim about the elves was actually true.</p><p>“They had some wards in the palace, set up years ago,” I said, not wanting her to collapse in fear, especially if the source of said fear wasn’t me, even as I considered the implications of the elves. </p><p>Elves were nothing but a myth, but considering the same applied for Phoenixes, I wasn’t ready to write off their existence. Especially since their reputed magical excellence explained the existence of the mysterious wards in the palace very easily. </p><p>Of course, that left one important question. Why the hell elves and phoenixes — and probably other mythical existences — suddenly appearing around, trying to interfere. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I ignored the jealous glares of the guards as they escorted me back to my room, suggesting that, toward the end, we had made quite a bit of noise with Theodora. However, I had more important things than assuring the fragile egos of my guards, my mind already on my plans. When the guards finally assisted me back to my room, my table was piled with freshly-cooked food, no doubt as a reward for my latest victory. </p><p>Just like a farmer trying to fatten his prized sheep. No matter how proud the farmer was, ultimately, it wouldn’t change its fate in the end. </p><p>Luckily, they didn’t know they had a wolf hiding under the sheepskin, with no intention of allowing it to be slaughtered when it was time. </p><p>I just needed to sharpen my fangs, and the techniques I managed to steal from my trip were the best option. </p><p>My initial plan was to test those new techniques the moment I had returned from that fateful evening, but the ambush, and the sudden acquisition of a book about a whole new magical discipline,  not to mention the potential to tame a rare magical beast, distracted me from my other objective. </p><p> I sat down on the floor, my legs crossed as I tried to use one of the mediation techniques I managed to pilfer during my latest library adventure. It was a specialized technique for Sorcerers, developed specifically for non-combat-focused mages. </p><p>I had no intention of changing my focus, of course. In my circumstances, ignoring my combat potential was the worst possible idea. But there was one advantage for the other magical applications compared to combat, that they required a calmer, smoother mana control. And with my mana getting wilder and wilder with each passing day, I needed all the help I could get. </p><p>As the mana flowed from my core to my torso, swirling softly, I was happy to note that the flow was much smoother, even as I forced it to flow faster. It was much better than the meditation techniques I had found in the lost city, both in terms of function, and in terms of quality. </p><p>Since I doubted a random patrician house would have better techniques than the man who had managed to invade and loot most of the known world, as well as raiding most of the other patrician houses as well as the treasury of Rome during the civil war, it was clear that the lost city only included the techniques Caesar intended to share with his army, rather than the true treasures of House Julia. </p><p>Even with the quality-fitting nature of the newly acquired meditation technique, however, it was was by no means an effortless activity. My core was thumping fast, like it was my heart and I had just run for half an hour. Not because it was straining, but because it was trying to flow even faster. </p><p>Since my Ascension, I was having trouble with limiting my mana output, the exact opposite of any other struggling mage, trying to maximize their mana impact. Luckily, that lack of control was yet to reach a point that affected my combat effectiveness, but the development itself was worrying. </p><p>Though, it wasn’t as worrying as the sudden warmth that covered my right arm. I let the transformation happen, and just like that, glistening scales covered my arm, turning it into a monstrosity. </p><p>“It’s spreading even more,” I murmured even as I noticed just how much it spread, reaching high enough to cover half of my bicep, signaling that I was in dire need of a solution. </p><p>Pity I was yet to find one. </p><p>After I suppressed those scales, I turned my attention back to my mana flow, flowing smoother thanks to the new technique. All that remained was to test to see whether it impacted the elemental spells I cast. </p><p>I raised my hand, summoning a small flame, to check if there was any change in the wild nature of the spells. I was trying to create a small flame, like I was trying to light a campfire. Instead, I ended up in a raging explosion, directing itself toward my face as if it was trying to burn me, rebelling against my touch. Curious, I switched into different spells, testing the other three elements. </p><p>The results were still the same, the elements were literally fighting against my control. And, interestingly, more controlled mana flow made the control issues even worse, like nature itself was trying to take advantage of the limited mana I put behind the spell to lash back even harder. </p><p>Even more interestingly, the more I maintained control of the elemental spells, the more I could feel some kind of pressure thickening around me, the air itself getting stale, almost suffocating. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said as I switched once again, this time testing my lightning abilities. A little flux flew between my fingers as an acrid smell filled the room. Considering the relative obedience of lightning, I expected it to work smoother, so, when it ended up burning my fingertips, as if it was rebelling against me as well, I was surprised. </p><p>For a moment, I was scared, like my only reliable element was lost to me as well, but the sudden weakening of the oppressive feeling that surrounded me suggested something else. I let my mana flow wilder, more aggressively, only for the lightning to flow smoother, without pain. </p><p>Ironically, it was easier to control lightning without control. </p><p>I couldn’t help but remember the moment of ascension, where I had to suffer through the oppression of the four elements, only to be saved by a sudden lightning strike. </p><p>However, the problem persisting after changing my mediation technique — even getting worse — in the process, suggested that whatever plaguing my control was clearly not something that could be solved by a meditation technique that gives more mana control. Not that I expected it to be a solution, but I was hoping that more control would at least give me more time. </p><p>I certainly wasn’t expecting the reverse to be the case. </p><p>For the next few hours, I had cycled through other techniques I managed to find, hoping that they would help, but the best result I was able to get was to keep the problem stable. None of them actually allowed me to have better control over the elements than simply overpowering the spells — which was not exactly a problem with my excessive mana reserves thanks to the dragon’s heart I had swallowed — or helped me to reverse the transformation that was going on in my body. </p><p>Of course, even pushing excessive mana wasn’t a consistent solution, because for the elements, with the notable exception of lightning, the more I used them, the more they started to rebel. The water spells I tried started to bubble aggressively, coming out violently steamy, while the fire spells flickered, threatening to extinguish one second, while exploding aggressively the next. </p><p>Whatever malfunction that happened during my Ascension made sure that the fundamental elements were still rejecting my existence. </p><p>When I finished my tests, it was already evening. With a sigh, I stood up, casting a spell to hide myself. I needed a distraction, and visiting my prospective pet was the best option. </p><p>Sneaking past the guards was easy to arrive the modified stable that held the lion was easy. There were a few guards and caretakers around, and one of them even had some magical abilities — though not enough to make him a combat threat — a sleep spell was all that needed to make them a non-issue. </p><p>I was so glad that my non-elemental spells weren’t suffering from the same problem, keeping my utility options open. </p><p>“Hello, buddy,” I said as I walked toward the cage that held the Nemean lion. It growled threateningly, but I just chuckled even as walked to the cage, and I let my control slip on my arm once more, this time completely. </p><p>Watching the beast that was scary enough to intimidate a small army flinching away was always a nice moment. I flared my magic once more, and the door to the cage opened, but when I stepped in, rather than trying to escape, the beast retreated to the corner, growling. </p><p>“Calm down, little kitty,” I said even as I threw a piece of meat to him. He growled suspiciously, but that didn’t prevent him from eating the juicy piece of meat. At the same time, I cast a spell, essentially fixing the sudden flood of positive emotions he received from eating magically, along with the instinctive fear he was feeling toward me. </p><p>It was the whole reason I was able to use a simple taming technique against such a beast. If anyone else dared to copy that, the only thing they would have been achieved was to link the idea of a delicious meal even deeper into the beast, which meant the beast would turn them into the meal at the earliest opportunity. </p><p>Especially since a magical male lion didn’t have convenient herd behavior to tap into, turning his taming into a real challenge. It would have been much easier to apply the same trick to a wolf, for example. </p><p>“Good boy,” I said after he finished his meal, and threw another piece of meat, and after a couple of repeats, I decided to test it some more.</p><p>I walked even closer. He growled a bit, but when I reached to scratch under his chin, he didn’t dare to attack, just stiffening in fear. But after a couple of spells to calm him down, his threatening growls were replaced with deep, satisfying growls. </p><p>Taming my first beast was processing excellently. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I returned, I found my dragon sitting on a chair, wearing a different dress. This time, it was an intriguing mixture of blue and white. Surprisingly, it had a large slit going through the side, revealing most of her beautiful legs, while the dress itself wrapped tightly around her body to display her curves excellently. </p><p>The view was too beautiful not to be deliberate. </p><p>“Was everything in order with the wards?” she asked, unable to hide her nervousness as she looked at me. </p><p>“No problem at all,” I answered with a shrug, not feeling the need to go deeper into the details. With our enemies solidly on the fake tracks I had created, there was no need to sour the delicious atmosphere I managed to develop. </p><p>I didn’t say anything as I walked to another seat, leaning back and closing my eyes rather than interacting with her, despite the clear invitation her dress represented. </p><p>Sometimes, you needed to pull back to make sure the hunt went without a hitch. </p><p>And she clearly didn’t appreciate the silence, if the frustrated hitch in her tone was any indicator. “What’s the plan? Are we going to just stay here and hide?” </p><p>“Exactly. It’s clear that they are not here permanently, and the wards they put are not the type you can maintain for weeks and weeks without having side effects,” I said. “If they wanted to stay, they would have used something more selective.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” she questioned. “Those crazy abominations can’t be really predicted by logic, they do things senselessly, like the raid that forced me into this horrible world.” </p><p>I opened my eyes, pinning her under my gaze. “Either we go out and kill all of them, or we wait. I don’t know you, but the first option isn’t really attractive for me, but feel free to go for a hunt if you want.”</p><p>Her silence was enough as an answer. Of course, I could have shared the little discussion I overheard, but for the moment, keeping her in the dark was the safer option. </p><p>Especially since a small faction in Eternals was deliberately hunting her, which made me question whether her presence was accidental in the first place. Maybe the raid wasn’t just a coincidence, but an intentional ploy to drive her here. </p><p>That faction was determined to kill her. All that needed to be answered was how much. </p><p>“It’s a defeatist attitude,” she said. </p><p>“If it is, it is,” I said with a shrug, not reacting to her juvenile taunt. I was too experienced to fall to her transparent attempt to goad me into explaining the situation in a more detailed fashion. Interrogation, especially the subtle, unofficial kind that was going between us, was a game of calm minds and false fronts, where the cooler heads ultimately prevailed. </p><p>Nothing she had done gave me the impression that she had the nerves to handle a subtle dance like that. </p><p>After I shrugged off her taunt, she fell silent, unable to say anything. The silence stretched for minutes as I leaned back once more, enjoying the opportunity to rest. I didn’t have the luxury of sleeping, of course, and it wasn’t just about missing the opportunity to seduce my unexpected guest. </p><p>I simply didn’t have the luxury of stopping to observe the detection wards, in case they stumbled upon the correct route after their repeated failures. </p><p>“What if they don’t go away in a few days?” she decided to speak after a few minutes, disturbing my rest. “Are we going to stay cooped inside?” </p><p>“We can think that when that happens,” I answered, this time not even bothering to open my eyes even as I heard her standing up, walking toward me. </p><p>“Maybe you should continue transferring mana,” she suggested. “There’s more chance of us getting away if I get stronger.” </p><p>“You need to wait a few hours for my fingers to recover,” I said, deliberately not mentioning the alternative I had suggested earlier. I expected her to argue, but hearing her footsteps getting closer surprised me. For a moment, I expected her to sit on my lap as I suggested. </p><p>Unfortunately, after a hesitant stagger, she turned and walked back, showing that while the prospect of more mana was tempting, it wasn’t tempting enough to push her to make such a radical move. At least, not since she had the opportunity to cool down after the massage in the pool. </p><p>Fucking bastards, I thought. If it wasn’t for their sudden presence, ruining the mood, she might have already decided to try the suggestion. Instead, she sat on the opposite side of the room, waiting for me to act. </p><p>Her silence didn’t last long. “So, what are your combat capabilities?” she asked, barely five minutes later. I wondered whether it was a draconic trait, or it was more about her personality.  </p><p>“Nothing too spectacular,” I answered. “A little elemental, a little knife fighting. I’m mostly a warding expert,” I said, underselling my abilities slightly. No need to reveal the full extent of my abilities, not when there was still a chance of her aligning herself with the headmistress tightly. </p><p>I had no idea about their relationship, and at this point, I didn’t have the luxury of betting on it. </p><p>“You’re not a combat mage?” she asked, but I could sense the way her tone flickered, her gaze turning dismissive. I barely held back myself from shaking my head dismissively. She was clearly one of those people — well, dragon — that dismissed anyone that didn’t focus on front-line combat, even when my extraordinary abilities had saved her life twice. </p><p>“No,” I said. “By the way, you didn’t even tell your name yet.” </p><p>“You’re right, I didn’t,” she said, her smugness clear, like she had achieved a big victory. I might have assumed it was a great insult to ask a dragon her name, but the pedestrian nature of her smugness suggested that it was a childish snub rather than a big cultural taboo. </p><p>I had no intention of arguing about it with her, of course. Being underrated and dismissed was always a useful trait. Instead, I continued to release some mana, though much less than the earlier treatment in the bath. </p><p>[-53 Mana]</p><p>It was just enough to maintain the mana density of the room even as she devoured it consistently, using the lingering connection between me and the floating particles of mana to get an even better understanding of the transformation that was going on in her body. It was a slow-going process from a distance, but as the time passed, I was slowly getting convinced that whatever was going on was either instinctual, or practiced enough to turn something habitual to the level of breathing. She only needed to pay attention when she was dealing with an excessive mana flow, like my ear </p><p>Of course, her transformation wasn’t the only thing that was occupying my attention. No, most of my attention was on observing the Eternals that were doing their best to handle the maze I had created, their spells getting stronger and stronger with each passing hour, suggesting increasing desperation. </p><p>Too bad for them that the more forceful they were being, the easier it got for them to get lost in the labyrinths I had created for that exact purpose, their mana blanketing the background, making it even harder to notice the subtle traps I had established. </p><p>None of those traps were offensive in nature, of course. Killing them didn’t work for my interest, not when it would give them and the mysterious elder behind them an excuse to stick around and search for it, maybe even bring more power from the mysterious organization after losing a few of their members. </p><p>Since they didn’t know why they were tasked to kill the dragon in the first place, it didn’t even make sense to take the risk of capturing one and interrogating them. As much as I would appreciate the chance of getting more information about the Eternals, I was trapped in the limits of two overwhelming wards they had established. </p><p>Not exactly the time to be adventurous. </p><p>Instead, I lazed around, saying nothing. My guest looked at me questioningly several times, clearly expecting me to push for more so that she could shut me off, but I decided not to give her the pleasure, even when she implied she might be willing to receive another massage. </p><p>Then, the wards disappeared, as sudden as they appeared. “Finally,” she as she stood up, already starting to transform as a pair of wings shoot off her back. </p><p>“Wait,” I said, and, to her credit, she did so, though her wings stayed on her back, suggesting she was capable of transforming halfway, which had some interesting implications for fun times. I took note of it for the future. </p><p>“What!” she said angrily. </p><p>“We need to wait for a few hours, to make sure they are gone,” I said, not revealing to her that I could still feel two people still digging around the fake tunnels I had created. </p><p>“I’m not a coward,” she said. </p><p>“Be my guest if you want to get caught for the third time,” I said with a dismissive gesture, knowing it would sting her pride. She growled in anger, suggesting that if I dared to say those words in a time where the memories of her imprisonment weren’t fresh in her mind, she might have reacted much more explosively than her current mood. </p><p>She said nothing, but she sat back, which was all I needed as an answer. I sat down as well, even as I flared my magic, ordering two fake dragons I had created in quick succession, drawing our potential attackers away. I didn’t inform her of that particular fact, of course, as the sight of her pouting face was too entertaining to miss, especially when it contrasted with her beautiful, revealing dress… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 7750 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Determined to seduce the transformed dragon that shared a bath with me, I decided to move to the next step. I carefully slid my hands forward, once again caressing her calf before arriving at her inner thigh, enjoying her flawless skin. </p><p>I was tempted to part her legs, giving me access to the treasure that lay at the end of my beautiful journey, but I managed to hold myself back. After all, despite her cute looks, I didn’t forget the dangerous monster that lay under it, making the push inadvisable. </p><p>Instead, I dragged my hands over her legs up and down, the rhythm broken by occasional circular movement as I did my best to awaken her desires even as I continued to feed.</p><p>[-832 Mana]</p><p>The whimper that answered as her tenuous control over her own voice started to slip, followed by purrs of pleasure as I explored her inner thighs suggested that I was on the perfect track, even though my gentle movements were bringing me closer and closer to the danger zone. </p><p>Considering her petite body, it wasn’t exactly a long distance. </p><p>Interestingly, as I got closer, she started to move in comfort, raising her hips as if she was trying to fasten my treatment. It was an instinctual reaction, because the more mana I transferred, the more distracted she started to get. </p><p>Her transformation process clearly required her active attention, at least when I was transferring as much mana as my regeneration could supply. </p><p>I wondered how she would have reacted if I pushed aggressively. Would she have reacted with another painful punch, or she would accept my intrusion as long as it meant more mana. Pity I didn’t have the luxury of testing it. Her cooperation was too critical to risk.  </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean I was resigned to the situation. Instead of pushing my fingers forward into her inviting tunnel, I stopped. “So, how was the massage,” I asked even as I leaned back, making a show of stretching. </p><p>“Why did you stop,” she asked? </p><p>“Expelling mana continuously is a tough task,” I answered with a shrug. “My hands are starting to hurt.” </p><p>I barely held back a chuckle at her disappointed hiss, clearly unhappy about the sudden ceasing. “You can’t be serious,” she stated. </p><p>“Of course I am,” I said. “My mana reserves might be limitless, but the same isn’t true for the capacity of my skin. After a while, it starts hurting, and if it doesn’t stop, my skin burns,” I said. Which was technically true. It was also true that I could cure those burns easily with Biomancy, but since I wasn’t an idiot, I kept that particular fact for myself. </p><p>“But I was just about to complete a stage in my transformation,” she said, her tone petulant. Seeing her petite body buried in water, her blushing face contorted in a childish expression, it was impossible to believe that she was a mighty dragon. </p><p>I shrugged again, doing my best to hide my smirk. “Unless you’re willing to sit on my lap to increase skin contact, so that I could transfer even more mana, there’s nothing I can do.” </p><p>I expected to earn an aggressive reaction by those words, maybe even a punch, though I assumed it was a worthy punishment to add the seeds of some future closeness. </p><p>The thoughtful expression on her face surprised me. </p><p>“It’s… unacceptable,” she murmured, though the delay between her words, along with their listlessness, was rather suggestive. It had a tone of disbelief, as she was clearly smart enough to realize that I might be stretching the truth for my own ends, and she was clearly not experienced enough in the matters of the flesh to accept that as a fair trade. </p><p>Under normal circumstances, at least. </p><p>When the same implied offer came from her two-times savior, especially after an extended soak and massage that clearly awakened some unfamiliar emotions in her body, it was a completely different story. </p><p>“If you say so,” I said, deliberately not pushing for more. I just closed my eyes and leaned back, enjoying the bubbling of the water even as I let some more into the water. </p><p>[-93 Mana] </p><p>Much less, of course. And after the earlier flood she experienced, giving a touch of mana was clearly a better way to torture her than depriving her completely. Especially since it gave her a reason to stay in the pool. </p><p>After a few seconds, I felt the mana getting drained slowly. I cracked my eyes, watching her carefully. The frustration was clear on her face, clearly not enjoying the sudden change of pace. I stayed in the pool, slowly radiating more and more mana, just enough to keep my appetite whetted. </p><p>Pity that she wasn’t weak-willed enough to actually surrender to the desire before another critical trigger sent a warning. Luckily, it wasn’t the actual route I had picked but one of the fake routes I had established just in case, but even the fact that they had discovered it meant that they were looking for the dragon with more deliberation than I expected. </p><p>It also meant that they knew dragons had the ability to transform, but that wasn’t too shocking. </p><p>“I need to leave for a moment,” I said as I suddenly stood up, revealing my naked, glistening body to her gaze. I was happy to note that her gaze stayed on my body for more than a few seconds. </p><p>“Why?” she asked. </p><p>“I need to check the surrounding wards, to make sure everything is working properly,” I said. I didn’t tell her the truth, because, without her, I could ambush them much easier. </p><p>She didn’t exactly give me a sneaky vibe. </p><p>With that, I dressed quickly — but not quickly enough to prevent her from getting a decent glimpse of my body — I was back into the tunnels. From what I was receiving from the detection wards, I assumed that there were five people in the tunnels, but luckily, they didn’t stay as a group, but split into many directions, prioritizing time over security, assuming that in an area under their control, there was no risk doing so. </p><p>It was a bad assumption. </p><p>Reopening the tunnels I had collapsed earlier was the easiest way of reaching them, but if I had done so, I would end up finding, but if I did so, I had to retreat back, which would lead them directly into the safe house I had established. </p><p>Instead, I started creating a new tunnel even as I lamented the number of underground construction work I had to do recently, reaching a ludicrous level. </p><p>The detour that I had to take delayed me a bit, and when I finally got close enough to them, two of them were together. </p><p>“Any of you were able to find it?” one of them asked. </p><p>“Dead end. How about yours?” </p><p>“No, none of those tunnels reaches anywhere, are we sure she didn’t go back to the surface?” asked another. </p><p>“Not likely,” the second one stated. “Even if she had been transformed, it’s almost impossible for her to slip through the wards if she was on the surface. Dragons are not exactly sneaky.” </p><p>“Then, where is she? We have checked all tunnels, and we still can’t find her. Maybe we should stop?” </p><p>“Do you want to explain to the Elder that we have screwed up one task she assigned to us?” the first one asked, his voice tense. </p><p>“No way in hell, she’s scary,” said the second one. There was still a thick wall of earth between us, preventing me from seeing them, but I was sure that he was shivering in fear. Whoever they were talking about, she was clearly scared. </p><p>“Then what are we going to do, we don’t have a lot of time left. We can’t just disappear for hours without some very pointed questions.” </p><p>“We just need to continue searching until the Trial ends,” the other one. “And if the worst happens and we can’t return until the challenge ends, we just need to bribe them more to look away.” </p><p>“You’re right, we still have a day before the trial ends. That should be enough to find and kill her.”</p><p>Footsteps reached my ear, suggesting they started walking away to restart their search, though the second one stopped after a few steps. “Do you know why we’re trying to kill her, other than the obvious?” </p><p>“I don’t, and I don’t recommend you to start digging about the reasons for her actions, or for any elders for that matter. Not if you want to continue living, at least.” </p><p>With that, they started walking around, leaving me alone to search. With a sigh, I moved even deeper into the distance, trying to decide what to do next. The discussion I had stumbled on forced me to change my plans even more. </p><p>The fact that they were trying to kill her was not a surprise, but the fact that only a small fraction of them was trying to do was suspicious. It was a pity that the ones that were trying to kill her clearly knew little about her. </p><p>It meant there wasn’t a lot I could do that right now, though that didn’t mean the trip itself was completely a waste. I created two dragon simulacrums that could be triggered from a distance, in case they started to draw closer. Knowing that their actions were limited as they tried to conceal themselves from their allies gave me several more options to distract them. </p><p>[-2731 Mana]</p><p>Unfortunately, it also meant that killing them was a bad idea. Luckily, they were kind enough to inform me that their time was limited. After establishing some more extra tunnels to waste their time even more, I went back to my shelter. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 5322 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as their visit had been fun, the departure of the girls had a nice perk. It allowed me to focus on my exercise schedule in a way I couldn’t have done if they stayed here, their innocent sexiness and a misplaced sense of competition distracting me continuously. </p><p>And as a quarterback that was about to join a competitive college team, I didn’t have the luxury of skipping practice. Not if I actually wanted to play.</p><p>I prepared myself for a long, grueling day filled with monotone exercise — especially difficult since I had no teammates to help me push through the boredom and exhaustion when things turned bleak. Blasting some rock music at maximum helped, but only to a point. </p><p>I started with a light, warming three-mile run, preparing to move to some footwork exercises after finishing. But when I stopped for a little break, I reached for my phone to change the song, I found a message awaiting me on my phone.  </p><p>From Carrie. </p><p>“Huh,” I murmured as I opened the message, wondering if it was anything important. Only for that to turn into surprise as I processed the message. Or more accurately, the picture attached. </p><p>A view of her in the mirror, wearing an extremely small cheerleader outfit that looked ready to burst and disintegrate at a sharp move. ‘To make sure you’re motivated,’ read the message. </p><p>‘Oh, I’m motivated,’ I answered as I pulled my shirt off, sending a sweaty, half-naked shot back.</p><p> She first responded with a few suggestive emojis, then a message. ‘Keep up the training, and I’ll make sure you’re motivated. Maybe even a true reward if you can finish all your program in time.’</p><p>Which was definitely something I needed help with. I had offhandedly mentioned that I was having trouble completing my training program without delays during the last night, while catching our breath between our fun repeats after Sarah had gone to bed. I certainly didn’t expect her to remember that.</p><p>And certainly didn’t expect her to take action to help, not in such a delicious way. </p><p>So, when I moved to my footwork training, I had a smile on my face, one that renewed whenever I took a break, only to find a new photo waiting for me. She wasn’t wearing any special costume for the other ones, instead of sending them from a large table she was sharing with Sarah while they worked on their homework. </p><p>Still, a carefully positioned camera and a few strategically popped buttons worked wonders to turn a moment of studying into a sexy premiere of an erotic movie. </p><p>It helped that I knew exactly what lay underneath those clothes, the memories fresh in my mind. </p><p>I responded with another shirtless one, much to her pleasure, which turned into a fun thing to distract me from the exercise. Doing painful repeats with ever-increasing weights was much more pleasant with the knowledge of another surprise pose was waiting for me. </p><p>They were not always sexy — well, they were not always fully focused on sexiness. Soon, some of them started including Sarah on the background, looking from the doorway or from the end of the corridor, giving Carrie the stink eye.</p><p>Sarah was always in the distance, enough to make her think that Carrie might have missed her presence. </p><p>Carrie’s wink suggested otherwise. </p><p>So, around the third hour into the training, when I checked the phone and saw messages from two different senders, I wasn’t surprised. </p><p>But I was certainly excited. </p><p>My excitement was rewarded when I clicked Sarah’s one, only to receive a picture from her, her shirt absent, showing off her sexy underwear. The wardrobe was open, suggesting that she had just changed into them. </p><p>Smart, I thought with a smirk even as I enjoyed the photo. Extensively. She was clearly leveraging the fact that they were in her house, allowing her access to her wardrobe, unlike Carrie who was limited to her bag.</p><p>That revealed she had brought that cheerleader costume with her to the last night, but we didn’t have the opportunity to try it on. </p><p>It would have been a great tragedy… If the replacement events hadn’t eclipsed a little sexy costume many times. </p><p>I had no complaints about Carrie’s sense of priority. </p><p>‘Oh, definitely not. Two is always better than one,’ I wrote to Sarah. And since I didn’t want to be unfair, I attached a new picture of my naked torso. Endless exercising was exhausting, but the effect my muscles had on ladies was always a nice bonus, enough to make the pain a worthwhile sacrifice.</p><p>‘Excellent,’ Sarah wrote back, sending a winking picture in response. And if in that picture, her bra slipped a bit, enough to give a delicious glimpse of her nipple.</p><p>Well, it must be completely accidental, right? </p><p>Only after that, I checked Carrie’s message, which showed another cleavage shot, but with a big smirk on her pouty lips. ‘How did you like this time?’ her message read, and considering her pose wasn’t particularly more impressive than her previous one, there was no doubt about what she was talking about. </p><p>‘Amazing, but you might need to work a bit harder,’ I said, and attached Sarah’s photo along with mine. </p><p>The response came in seconds, her shirt removed, her bra on full display. And while her current underwear was considerably less sexy than Sarah’s, her incredible bosom and the deliciously thick body were more than enough to close the distance. </p><p>‘Send that to her and see what she thinks,’ she wrote, though the mischievousness of her statement made the following string of devil emojis rather redundant. </p><p>Considering the amount of skin Carrie had already displayed to Sarah, sending an underwear picture was hardly something scandalous, though I was still amused by the way Carrie was using me as a medium. </p><p>Not that I was complaining, of course. There were worse fates than sending some sexy pictures to another sexy girl, goading her to send even sexier ones. </p><p>‘You might need to work harder,’ I wrote to Sarah along with the picture. </p><p>At this point, her fancy retaliation was expected, which came in the form of another photo. And since she realized even her fancy sexy bra was unable to match Carrie’s very impressive bosom, she had got rid of her bra completely, replacing it with one arm. </p><p>‘Sexy,’ I answered, responding with another picture of my own, lifting a heavy kettlebell to accentuate my muscles even more. </p><p>Sarah’s picture marked a new level of escalation. When I stopped for another break, I received a similar one from Carrie, her bra discarded, relying on her arm to cover her bosom. However, this time, I didn’t even need to send that to Sarah to push her, because her picture was not only absent of a bra — or any kind of clothing for her top — but she also limited herself into lacy red panties, a skirt short enough to reveal her underwear selection, and thigh-high boots to display her toned legs in the best light.</p><p>For a pair of nerds, they really knew how to push their best assets forward to get an advantage against the competition. </p><p>Even if the said competition was intentionally developed in Carrie’s case, asking me to share her sexy photos with her friend as well. Weirdly, she enjoyed pushing Sarah more and more, but never to a point of allowing Sarah to actually defeat her. Whenever Sarah managed to capture a particularly sexy picture, Carrie answered with a great escalation. </p><p>And she had assets to support such an escalation.</p><p>However, as much as their pictures made my exercise more entertaining, that didn’t change its physically demanding nature. As I entered the last hour of my program, Carrie sent another message. ‘How’s the schedule?’ she asked.</p><p>‘Still on track, but the last part is literal torture,’ I answered. ‘And I was just thinking to give you a real reward if you can complete it.’</p><p>‘Well, if there’s a reward in the end, I’m sure I will be able to finish it on time,’ I said.</p><p>‘Promise?’</p><p>‘As long as you promise the reward will be worthwhile,’ I sent back. </p><p>‘Oh, believe me, you’ll find it worthwhile…’ she wrote back, but when I asked her to clarify, she just sent mysterious emojis. No more pictures, no more words. </p><p>And just like that, my exhaustion lost its significance. </p><p>The promise of a reward from Carrie carried a lot of weight. Especially after the events of the previous night — not to mention the fun breakfast — as a benchmark. With her confidence about the impressiveness of her gift, along with her ridiculous talent for escalation, I was expecting a lot of fun things. </p><p>I have sent updates to her about the progress of my training. Just as I finished, and prepared for the last part, the extended stretching session to cool down and make sure my muscles stayed reasonably elastic, the door rang. </p><p>I moved there, appreciating the opportunity for a breather even as I got ready to greet Carrie, wondering whether she would bring Sarah along, or come alone. But when I opened the door, Sarah was not there. </p><p>Nor Carrie was there.</p><p>However, while their absence confused me slightly, it wasn’t followed by disappointment. The reason?</p><p>My surprise guest was Naomi, one of the other girls from Carrie’s little band of nerds. A sexy brunette with an excessive interest in yoga and related stuff, with a cloudy light brown skin that implied some mixed ancestry, just enough to add some exotic flavor to her already amazing beauty. </p><p>The fact that she was loose sweatpants and an equally loose large t-shirt might have reduced my enthusiasm if it wasn’t for the delicious life lessons I had learned from Carrie. </p><p>Though, her beauty was not an answer to why she was in front of my door. Well, considering Carrie’s latest message, the general idea was not that hard to decipher, but not the specifics. I decided to act safely. </p><p>“Hi, Naomi, how can I help you?” </p><p>“Um,” she murmured, blushing. She wasn’t that shy when I met with her during lunch earlier, but considering I was still half-naked and sweaty, I decided to give her a break. “Carrie told me she had talked with you,” she murmured, blushing. </p><p>As much as I wanted to ask the obvious and sexy question, I decided it might not be the best idea. “She probably sent a message but I didn’t see, why don’t you tell me instead,” I said with a big smile. </p><p>“She said you needed help with stretching, maybe with some yoga,” she said hesitantly, her social inexperience evidenced by not even bothering to ask for my number. </p><p>Not that it was a big problem, if Carrie and Sarah were any evidence. Even slightly. </p><p>“Oh, yes, that I mentioned her. You’re so kind, actually coming here to help me. Please come in,” I said, glad that she couldn’t read the subtext of my growing smile. </p><p>Just as I closed the door, my phone buzzed. On the way back, I grabbed it, reading a message from Carrie. </p><p>‘Have fun.’</p>",

    "content": "<p>My tenseness slowly drained as I left the secret hideout of the phoenix behind. Despite the relative casualness of the conversation, during the whole duration of it, I was extremely tense. After all, just one mistake from my end, misreading one critical shift of emotion, and it would have turned into an explosive confrontation. </p><p>Still, I wasn’t able to relax completely. Her presence, along with the implication that there were others already in the dark families, turned the already complicated situation even worse. </p><p>However, despite the immensity of the situation, I decided to go back and rest. After everything that happened during one long day, I deserved it. All that needed to decide was where to rest. </p><p>My cell was always the safest option, but unfortunately, it was the least comfortable one as well. With Isolde imprisoned, and with Emma and Aria fully aware of the story, it only left the Queen, and with everything going on, she hardly had time to make an unscheduled visit. </p><p>I was tempted to go lay next to Aria, enjoying her soft, passionate embrace, but in the end, another destination won over. </p><p>Emma. </p><p>Emma’s bedroom had two advantages. First, she was still busy with her latest mysterious mission, which meant I would have an opportunity to restore my stamina. Second, and more importantly, once she arrived, I could not only interrogate her about her mission and the mysterious phoenix, but also see whether she had any knowledge I lacked. </p><p>And as a bonus, I could make her serve me as a punishment even as I interrogated her. </p><p>Decision made, I slipped into the palace once again, the defenses might as well be nonexistent after discovering several secret passages leading in and out. Soon, I was in Emma’s bedroom. A quick shower later, I established a couple of alert wards just in case, and lay on her bed. </p><p>Sleep was easy to attain… </p><p>And waking up was even easier, I thought groggily even as I felt a disturbance in the wards, alerting me. It was good to see one of the survival skills I hadn’t utilized much since I got my throne being useful once more.</p><p>Falling asleep and waking up quickly was an excellent tool to keep fresh during dangerous missions, or situations like warfare.  </p><p>At this ungodly hour that separated the night and the morning, I didn’t expect anyone other than Emma to visit, but with the situation getting more and more complicated, there was no harm in being careful. </p><p>I had dispelled the spell only after Emma entered the room, looking far too distracted to notice my presence even without the shadows. “Good morning, red,” I said with a mocking tone. </p><p>“G-good morning,” she stammered as she looked at me, her expression of shock beautiful. After the day she had, she was clearly expecting to rest as well. </p><p>Too bad I had other ideas. </p><p>For a moment, I said nothing, just enjoying the lingering expression of shock on her beautiful face as she looked at me, like she was trying to convince herself that it was a hallucination. Soon, it was replaced with a desperate realization as she realized she had to explain yet another instance of betrayal to me. </p><p>Honestly, at this point, her political betrayals had almost devolved into a comedic theater. </p><p>“You look surprised, why?” I said. </p><p>“I-I’m not,” she stammered. “It’s just that, it’s a bit late for a talk. Maybe we could talk after I slept.” </p><p>“Sorry about it,” I said with mock sincerity. “But it’s not going to take a long time. You can prepare for your bedtime even as you explain who was your latest mysterious backer.” </p><p>“N-no need,” she stammered as she blushed. “I can explain quickly. I don’t want to keep you from your rest as well.” </p><p>“Oh, such thoughtfulness, but there’s no need. Feel free to start stripping,” I said, my tone sharpening at the last word. I wanted to test the limits of my controls again, now that she might be feeling a touch rebellious after she had found yet another backer. </p><p>“O-of course,” she murmured even as she cast a spell to drag down the zipper of her dress. A sigh escaped her mouth, suggesting that she was already surrendering herself back under my control.</p><p>She turned her back before letting the dress fall. It slid freely until it stuck around her knees, revealing her beautiful silhouette, leaving the task of hiding her beautiful body to her corset and panties. Another spell, and her corset ended up the same way, leaving only her sexy panties to cover her body. </p><p>When she turned back to face me, her arm was around her chest, though unable to completely hide her cleavage, still showing some bruises, the signs of our earlier library adventure. </p><p>“Nice,” I murmured, even as I pointed to her panties, earning a beautiful sigh even as she pulled her hands away from her chest, dragging them down as well, revealing the unrestricted sight of her beautiful body, still shy despite everything that had happened between us. </p><p>Repeatedly. </p><p>“Now, why don’t you be a doll and pour me a drink, so that we can start talking about your latest betrayal,” I said, not bothering to weaken the situation. </p><p>It wasn’t surprising for her to stiffen suddenly, as no one enjoyed being called a traitor. Even if it was true, several times in that case. </p><p>Luckily, her anger was quick to drown under her developing submissiveness. It seemed that some authority and a sharp command was all that was needed to make her follow my orders. </p><p>Not that she had any option but to follow them in the first place, not if she wanted to hide her rapidly-increasing number of mistakes and outright betrayals. </p><p>She was trapped by her own lies and mistakes, forced to keep me happy to have even a hope of surviving the weight of her own mistakes. </p><p>“Quickly,” I ordered. “My throat is dry.”  </p><p>A rebellion tried to spark into life on her face, as I treated her like a maid, but it proved to be short-lived, surviving only for a second before getting doused by reality. She took a step toward the small bar in her room, her legs trembling, in shock and in anticipation in equal amounts. </p><p>“Good girl,” I murmured, and my compliment managed to earn a tremble, showing the depths of her growing submissiveness. </p><p>“As you wish,” she answered, verbally underlining her submission, her tone beautifully pliable. </p><p>She took a large step toward the destination, something I had a problem with. “Slower, beautiful,” I ordered. “Give me a show.” </p><p>That managed to earn an angry glare despite her submissiveness, but that was her limit. Her momentary rebellion died immediately as our eyes met, and it was followed by a saunter in the distance, in a visually pleasing manner. </p><p>Her naked ass swayed with every step, creating a beautiful sight that. I licked my lips to get rid of the sudden dryness. </p><p>There was a certain pleasure in using one of the strongest combat mages in the Empire as an erotic maid, serving me naked, and the revenge components made the situation even better. She filled the glass halfway, the delicious smell of expensive liqueur hitting my nose — though not expensive enough to worthy to be presented as a high-class supporter of the royal family, another snob from the Queen. </p><p>The implications about that intentional snub, and the impact on her betrayal vacated my mind as soon as her return journey started, her assets bouncing softly with each step, her breasts, just right size to fill my palms, firm enough to defy the commands of the gravity. I let my gaze slide down, caressing her beautiful skin from a distance, skimming her flat belly before focusing on the carefully shaved treasure between her legs.</p><p>I raised my gaze only after she closed in enough to pass me the glass. “Thank you, sweetie,” I said, intentionally stretching the last word to tease her. Poking her to test her submissiveness was a special kind of fun. </p><p>Anger flickered on her face once again, but once again, it was short-lived. “It’s not a bother, sir.” </p><p>“Smart girl,” I chuckled even as wrapped my arm around her naked waist, pulling her on my lap. She crossed her legs in an effort to hide even a bit of her modesty. Just a word was enough to prevent that from working, but I let that little defiance survive. </p><p>The sight of her with her legs crossed, her skin illuminated with the faint light coming from the window, the first rays of sunlight streaming through the thin curtains. </p><p>She looked delicious enough to eat. </p><p>I said nothing, letting the silence stretch as I took occasional sips, enjoying her presence on my lap, caressing her spine gently occasionally. I deliberately didn’t ask any questions, which was slowly making her tenser and tenser. From her expression, I could read that she was busy trying to cobble together a story. </p><p>It wasn’t just her beautiful yet conflicted face I watched, however. I paid equal attention to her body, my hand resting on her back softly, enjoying her soft trembles, curious what kind of story she would come up with. </p><p>I needed to come up with a decision on how to progress. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After Thad dragged me toward the defensive team, bringing me face to face with the coach, the moment was almost anti-climatic. “I found you a good backup lineman, coach,” Thad said enthusiastically, just loud enough to earn a few glances from the other players. </p><p>The old coach gave me a stern look, and I forced myself to catch his gaze. </p><p>The coach was an old man, almost in his seventies, though that didn’t take away the threatening glint in his eyes. </p><p>Dangerous man. </p><p>“Why?” he asked, trying to sound dismissive, though the glint in his eyes didn’t disappear. </p><p>“Nice defender, vicious,” Thad explained. “Also, he managed to intercept or block two-thirds of the passes as we practice. We can use that mentality in our team.” </p><p>“I don’t need flashy wannabes,” the coach said, looking at me like he expected me to defend myself. I stayed silent, smart enough to realize any attempt to talk back would work against my benefit. The coach was clearly old-school, and talking back to him wasn’t the smartest. </p><p>My silence earned a nod. </p><p>“I’ll think about it if he can manage to stick until the end of the training,” the coach grumbled before he turned and started working on his papers, like he hadn’t already discussed that with Thad earlier. But, considering the gazes of the other players, they clearly had a reason for their little play. </p><p>Then, he left, leaving me smirking despite the bone-weary exhaustion. </p><p>*****</p><p>The rest of the training passed monotonously despite its exhaustion, more about simple repetition than complicated tactics, a good day to join. </p><p>And as I finally drove away from the stadium — much later than everyone else because after the shower, I had to spend another hour in the office of one of the coordinators, giving all my information, allowing them to process my preliminary admission to the team, pending a long meeting with one of the conditioning coaches to give the last stamp of approval — I had a huge smile on my face.  </p><p>The day was much more amazing than I could ever realistically hoped for, which, admittedly, I owed a lot to my Heroic Traits. The baggage they came together with might have been annoying, but their usefulness was hard to doubt. </p><p>Unfortunately, the sudden stretch of good luck I had enjoyed had clearly annoyed the fate, who decided to strike by one of her usual methods. A thick layer of smoke, bursting free from the hood of my car.</p><p>My horribly old car. </p><p>“Perfect timing,” I growled as I opened the door. My guide floated out from the passenger seat, looking at the smoke curiously. </p><p>“What happened, something with the enchantments of the carriage?” </p><p>“Something like that,” I murmured, not in the mood to explain to her the intricacies of mechanical engineering, or the way technology worked inherently. I might have prioritized it if she had the ability to touch anything, but since she was incorporeal, there was no risk of her accidentally burning the room by misusing the toaster. </p><p>As I examined the smoking engine of my car, my guide continued her pointless chatter. “It was nice that you managed to get a place in the team,” she said gleefully. “That stadium is huge. I’m sure you’ll have a lot of attention, maybe enough Intent to start giving you some proper level of heroic traits.” </p><p>I wanted to examine the engine more carefully, but her offhand comment somehow managed to steal my attention despite the spreading dark smoke. “What exactly do you mean by proper strength?” I couldn’t help but ask. </p><p>“You know, enough to achieve some elemental tasks, like little Heracles,” she said. “Mortals seemed to be impressed with his feats of strength enough that his ascend to the demigod status went smoothly.” </p><p>I was so glad that I asked, even as I reflexively hid my face in my palms, trying to suppress a frustrated cry. Maybe I should try to explain to her that if I suddenly displayed that level of strength, the only thing I would earn was an endless stay in the lab, to disappear forever.</p><p>Interestingly, however, her distaste toward Zeus didn’t extend to his children, even the male ones. Though, if the mythology was even remotely accurate about his womanizing ways, hating his children would have been an exhausting affair.  </p><p>Too bad that she had given me no indication that she would handle a serious conversation yet. “I thought the System assigns the traits automatically, based on the activity and the impression?” I asked instead. </p><p>“Yes, but the amount of Intent changes the magnitude of the Traits,” she said. “So, with little Intent, like the amount you gained from the tournament, it was barely enough to give you some mental improvements. Barely enough to count as an improvement. If we gather more, you’ll be able to have some proper Traits, like strength or agility. Maybe even develop an Incantation if the audience is adequately impressed.” </p><p>“Can you trigger them earlier? Maybe every day, before it accumulates too much?” </p><p>“I can, but why?” she asked. </p><p>It was time for a little trickery. “I was always been a big fan of Athena, especially her impeccable discipline and mental strength, so I want to be like her. If I gain too many physical Traits first, I’m afraid I would turn up like … Ares.” I remembered her referring to Athena on good terms. </p><p>“Yes, Ares,” she murmured, her nose wrinkling in distaste. “He is a good boy, but a little too loud to hang around, not to mention too rash. You should take Athena as a role model. She’s the best,” she said with a nod. </p><p>I just nodded, letting out a relaxed breath. Talking with her was a tense affair, and her outward charm made it even more difficult. She was like a cute teddy bear with a suspicious clock inside, ticking suspiciously. And I couldn’t even check it properly, afraid of it exploding. </p><p>Once again ignoring the mostly-invisible cutie dressed as a dominatrix next to me, I turned my attention on the engine of my pitiful old car. It certainly earned its retirement a long time ago, but I had been keeping it alive through repeated interventions that defied nature. </p><p>As I examined it — which swallowed almost a quarter of an hour — I came to two conclusions. First, thankfully, not only the problem was fixable, but I could fix it myself. Second, it was a tedious problem that required disassembling a serious portion of the engine. </p><p>A couple of hours of work at a minimum, likely half a day. </p><p>With a sigh, I slammed the hood close and grabbed my duffel bag. I had a long walk ahead of me, especially if I wanted to arrive at the party at the team house.  </p><p>Pity I had no friends close enough to ask for a ride, and I hated owing favors, even trivial ones, to acquaintances. </p><p>“Can’t you fix it?” my guide asked. “Maybe I should teach you some magic to help?” </p><p>I ignored her suggestion. My life was fucking confusing enough before adding magic into the mix. Even if she could teach me — and at this point,  unfortunately, magic was not something I could simply write off as superstitious nonsense — with the memory troubles she was having, she was hardly the ideal tutor for even basic arithmetic, let alone magic. </p><p>If magic was a simple thing to cast, the myths — a concept that taking seriously was logical under the circumstances — wouldn’t be filled with stories of spells going terribly wrong. </p><p>Before I could even walk a hundred feet away, however, a car stopped next to me. </p><p>“Car problems?” asked a cute voice, and when I looked at the driver’s seat, I saw a familiar face, driving a red convertible, though I failed to recognize her immediately. </p><p>“I decided to enjoy a walk through this amazing view,” I said, gesturing the great empty field between the main campus and the stadium even as I examined the blonde girl, trying to remember where I had seen her. </p><p>Then, it clicked. </p><p>She was the girl at the entrance of the convention center, accompanying our dear backup quarterback as he egged the tournament. </p><p>A frown appeared on her face. She clearly didn’t appreciate my flippant response, rightfully so. If I were her, I would have already continued to drive. Luckily, she proved herself a better person than me — despite her passive assistance to a certain asshole as he committed an act of vandalism, treating it as the peak of the wit — not that it was a huge achievement in the first place and asked, “Do you need a ride?” </p><p>“Unfortunately, I do,” I said, gesturing to the smoke still coming out of the hood. “I would appreciate it, especially since I’m in a hurry.” </p><p>“Do you want to wait for the road assistance to arrive before leaving?” she asked. “In case someone tries to steal…” she said, but fading halfway as she registered just how much of a junk it was. To her credit, she didn’t say it explicitly.  </p><p>“Yeah, burglars have better things to do than doing me a favor,” I said with a chuckle as I threw my bag into the backseat. </p><p>“What a nice young woman,” my guide said cheerfully as she slid back to the backseat, next to my bag. I didn’t answer her, not wanting my gracious helper to think that I was crazy. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was good that my little princess — an actual one with connections with the Imperial Family rather than just a fancy noble with titles to boost her name — was too distracted by her loss of virginity as she sank herself into my shaft, her eyes firmly closed to enjoy the feeling. </p><p>I appreciated it, as it gave me a chance to think.</p><p>From a certain perspective, I wasn’t wrong. After all, I had already guessed she was an unlucky noble who found herself on the run due to house politics, and during her escape, lost her already limited support during her escape, until she had become prey of the slavers. </p><p>I just didn’t expect her family to be the Imperial one, the only entity that was stronger than the Patrician houses that I was trying to infiltrate. </p><p>That wasn’t to say the Eastern Roman Empire was stronger than the Republic, but in the Republic, the highest power was distributed among not only several Patrician families, but also to the rest of the Senatorial class — quite a number of them coming from lower families, including some commoners that distinguished themselves through military service. </p><p>In comparison, the Imperial family’s power was much more centralized, but as the story of Theodora suggested, that centralization also made them a target. Even in Britannia, I had heard when Emperor Zeno had been deposed in a bloody palace coup, with some very dangerous consequences for his supporters. </p><p>Theodora’s identity meant that she was on the top of that list, either to be captured and imprisoned to make sure she could lead no rebellion, no matter how unlikely, or discreetly executed. If it was earlier in my journey, when trying to escape a few pirates were consuming my full range of abilities, I might have run away with a scared cry. </p><p>At this point, while repeatedly infiltrating Patrician houses to access their libraries, it would be weird if it was my reaction still. Especially since, while the Imperial Family might be stronger than any single Patrician house, they were also hundreds of miles away, making them significantly less dangerous in comparison. </p><p>Ultimately, the decision was clear. </p><p>Although, I was honest enough to admit that the enthusiasm Theodora was showing as she jumped up and down on my lap was making that decision much easier. Also, it made it much easier to focus on the way her beautiful tits were jiggling rather than the long-term implications of a runaway member of the previous Imperial Dynasty. </p><p>She was absorbed by the explosive sensations of her first time, failing to notice the small mental break I had to take due to the incredible nature of her reveal, but she was quick to notice when my hands landed on her breasts, preventing their enthusiastic jumps even as I squeezed her nipples. </p><p>An enthusiastic moan escaped her mouth as her eyes opened, catching my gaze through the mirror. “Look at yourself,” I whispered into her ear. “Is this the face of an imperial princess?” </p><p>She said nothing, but the panicked gasp she let out as her eyes widened was beautiful. “No!” she gasped. </p><p>I chuckled. “Don’t tell me you just realized the implications of your answer,” I said with a chuckle. She nodded in panic, but when she tried to pull herself off my lap, I waited until she was almost successful before pushing her down, skewering her even deeper than she had been playing herself. </p><p>“No changing the seat,” I whispered even as I hugged her waist, enjoying the way she shivered against my touch. “Just tell me what’s the problem.” </p><p>“What’s the problem?” she repeated, her shock was clear. “I’m hunted by the whole Empire. Isn’t it enough?” </p><p>“Obviously not, considering I’m happily enjoying the way you’re wrapped around my shaft rather than running away, or whatever paltry bounty the old general might offer,” I said, even as I lifted her up, only to slam her down again, earning a delicious moan. “Constantinople is a long way away.” </p><p>“It can’t be that simple.” </p><p>“It is.” </p><p>“Not all people that would love to capture me lives there,” she countered, though her hips rocked gently even as she said so, showing despite her panic, the pleasure was not forgotten. “Any of the senators would love to have me as a bargaining chip against that traitor, or give me back for a favor.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Why are you still focusing on that? Are you trying to make me sell you to one of those snotty assholes?” I said, even as my fingers danced on her soft skin, enhancing her pleasure further and further. </p><p>“Of course not,” she whispered. “But I don’t want you to misunderstand the danger you’re in because of me.” </p><p>“Oh, such a thoughtful princess,” I whispered even as I grabbed her chin gently, making her turn. “But don’t worry. If I’m reckless enough to disguise myself as a slave to raid Patrician houses, I’m reckless enough to keep a beautiful princess to myself despite the risks,” I added, just before I leaned forward to capture her lips. </p><p>Her beautiful lips were hesitant to respond, making it an awkward kiss at first, her lips frozen in shock, still trying to understand the enormity of her slip, and my reaction. </p><p>Though with her core still tight around my girth, her hips rocking subconsciously, it was hardly stole anything from the eroticism of the moment. </p><p>I let the kiss continue, my lips slowly moving as I tried to coax her lips to join the dance. It took several breaths for her to react. Hesitant and slow at first as she tried to process the monumental mental shock she was struggling with, but soon, her primal desires started to overwhelm her concerns. Her lips started to answer. </p><p>I pulled back a minute later, leaving her gasping and panting. “Wow,” she gasped. “That was…”</p><p>“Delicious,” I completed her words, happy that her focus on the political side of the issues disappeared. She was still excited, flushed, and trembling, but when I leaned against her lips, she responded much stronger. </p><p>It was the time to push the envelope a bit, I decided as I gently grabbed her face, my tongue pushing forward aggressively. Her lips opened immediately,  inviting inside. Her tongue tried to copy mine, starting a battle, only to be dominated aggressively. </p><p>Not that she had any problems with it, if her hips, rocking faster and faster was any indicator. </p><p>The whining plea that escaped her lips despite the kiss was even more beautiful. I let my hands drift down, caressing her beautiful tits in the process before I arrived at my ultimate target, her beautiful, tight ass. </p><p>A gasp escaped her mouth as my fingers sank into her flesh and assisted her movement, turning her gentle rocking into a furious dance, ramming my shaft into her harder and harder, her body responding to each thrust with growing enthusiasm. </p><p>A shocked gasp escaped her mouth when I pulled out of her suddenly, only to throw her on the bed, on her hands and knees before taking her from behind just as quickly. “Who’s a good princess?” I growled even as I held her hair. </p><p>If I was going to take the risk of harboring a fugitive princess, I was going to enjoy it immensely. </p><p>“I am,” she moaned. </p><p>“Louder,” I ordered even as I slapped her ass, only for her to tighten even more. </p><p>“I am a good princess,” she moaned, even louder, as I invaded her insides with increasing aggression, tightening more and more to earn her ultimate reward, spanks landing on her skin more. It was delicious to see just how fast her arousal and hero worship to fold into total submission. </p><p>My own princess. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The discovery wasn’t the best news to receive, but I continued to massage the foot of the sexy dragon I was determined to seduce rather than exploding in panic. </p><p>Just because they had discovered the fake nature of the body didn’t mean I need to burst into panic, not when there were several layers of defense between me and my destination. And even if the worst came to worst, I had my escape tunnels ready, and the hideout was primed for a disastrous explosion. </p><p>So, I turned my attention back to the sexy, emerald-haired curvy beauty, whose eyes started to flutter as the pleasure from the foot massage hit her just the right way. </p><p>Just because she believed she was in control didn’t mean that she was actually in control. On the contrary, my experience showed me that it was the best way to lose the initiative. The leverage I had due to her clear need toward my mana only made things more delicious.  </p><p>I continued to imbue the waters with my mana, of course, but not enough to interest her to devour it actively, just to maintain a warm, comfortable bath for her, reducing her alertness even more. Under the skillful treatment of my fingers, her legs started to tremble beautifully. </p><p>Unfortunately, the smoothness didn’t continue for the other challenge. I had received another disturbance in my passive wards, this time suggesting that four people had discovered the remains of the tunnel I had created downward. </p><p>The passive wards weren’t the most precise measurement tools, but even with their clunky detection capabilities, I could sense that the four were much more competent than the people that were currently going through some weird combination of challenge and examination. </p><p>Whoever was trying to find our location, was clearly not accidental. </p><p>Still, their progress wasn’t enough to change the current position. I might react if the only reason I was trying to seduce her was the pleasure, but she represented an important, independent source of information for me, and properly ‘softening’ her for interrogation before my next meeting with the headmistress was a critical requirement for my ultimate success. </p><p>I needed to understand why the headmistress was asking for her before deciding whether to report my mission as a success or a failure. </p><p>Instead, I let another flow of mana to her body, this time even thicker, enjoying the way she trembled under the renewed flow. </p><p>[-513 Mana] </p><p>Her eyes widened as she processed the impact of the mana flow, together with just a lingering touch of arousal, but too soft for her to actually be confident. “Is there anything wrong?” I asked. “I can keep the mana flow weaker if that’s what you prefer?” </p><p>“N-no, I can handle it,” she murmured, even though a hint of frustration passed through her face, no doubt directed at her lack of control. </p><p>However, it wasn’t as interesting as the sudden suspicious movement of her legs. The continuous bubbles were in place to block my view, but it wasn’t hard to imagine her legs subtly rubbing against each other while trying to look normal, suggesting a level of familiarity with self-satisfaction even in her human form. </p><p>I licked my lips, trying to get rid of the sudden dryness, even as I let my fingers move outside the agreed spot, caressing her ankle for a fleeting moment before returning back. </p><p>[-692 Mana]</p><p>That earned a glare, but the intense flow of mana proved sufficient to keep her silent. Instead, she shuffled in her place in a more noticeable manner, her naked shoulders shining under the soft, crystal lights of my hideout. </p><p>I dimmed the lights slightly, making the atmosphere even more amorous, while my fingers danced over her skin. </p><p>The gentleness of my touch contrasted greatly with the aggressiveness of the Eternals that was currently busy trying to dig down the tunnel. Interestingly, they weren’t being as aggressive as possible, which implied that they were trying to keep their actions concealed, but not to a level of keeping hidden from the main detection ward. </p><p>How interesting, I thought before shifting back to my main quest of taming a dragon, trying to face the question of how to handle her. The easiest option was to push her hard, aggressively, invading her body with a deluge of pleasure until her emotions turned into an endless whirlwind, unable to resist even the most liberal push. </p><p>Unfortunately, that strategy did not fit well with my long-term goals, especially with someone with a clearly explosive temper. I didn’t want her to submit to me in a moment of passion where she could easily blame me. No, I needed her calm and fully aware as she asked for more, not only to receive more mana, but to receive pure, adulterated pleasure. </p><p>Luckily, from her gaze under her fluttering eyelids, I could see that it wasn’t going to be as hard as I first feared, suggesting that I either miscalculated her resistance to pleasure, or her familiarity with receiving massages — or at least, the expert kind that I was capable of. </p><p>Either way, a smile popped to my face as I let my fingers wander down, subjecting her calves to the same treatment, loosening her muscles under my expert touch even as I rewarded her with another flood of mana, trying to keep outflow high — but not high enough that my regeneration unable to compensate for the endless flow. </p><p>[-672 Mana] </p><p>However, when my fingers disappeared underwater, caressing her soft thighs underwater, it earned a warning glare from her.</p><p>“You’re feeling quite tense,” I said even as I started caressing her lower thighs with the assistance of some healing magic, working great benefits. “I can stop if you want?” </p><p>“No, keep going,” she surrendered not too soon after, unable to resist the pleasure of the massage. And, to her credit, considering the adventure she had suffered through, from undead ambushes to near-death struggle against the Eternals, she had definitely earned her relaxation. </p><p>She was tenser than a newly forged sword. </p><p>Of course, even with that, I doubted that she would be this willing to submit herself to my touch if I hadn’t saved her from certain death, twice. </p><p>Heroics still had its perks. </p><p>After some caressing, I returned my fingers back to the middle of her sole for an encore, earning a surprisingly erotic grunt of pleasure in the process. Of course, even as I enjoyed the displays of pleasure she was revealing, I didn’t stop examining the process of conversion around her bones, trying to identify the exact mechanism. </p><p>Unfortunately, it failed again, forcing me to focus on her quickening breaths and twitching muscles, the relaxing presence of my ever-flowing mana making it much easier. </p><p>And more importantly, I wasn’t above a bit of cheating, using Biomancy to convert some of the water into special massage oil that would stay on her skin, softening her against my touch even more, and the reduced friction helping me greatly. </p><p>This time, I kept my attention limited to her sole and her calf, which threw her expression into a beautiful conflict. There was nothing she could say about my limits, but a part of her clearly wanted me to return to her inner thigh, boosting her pleasure even more. </p><p>I stayed limited there for another five minutes, enjoying her quickening heartbeat, noticeable through her skin, using it as an opportunity to get a better sense of her pacing. </p><p>And then, a subtle gasp escaped her mouth, one that was too soft to be heard without my enhanced senses. I smirked victoriously, even as I let my touch move to her lower thigh once more, challenging her bruised silence. </p><p>[-421 Mana]</p><p>Her determination to stay silent was broken under the flood of mana, faster than my estimation. </p><p>However, before I could take an action, my attention was once again grabbed by the invaders in my tunnels. They had finally reached the large cave where I had my talk with my newest acquaintance. Interestingly, it seemed I wasn’t the only one that was happily using the presence of the defensive ward for more aggressive casting, as their mana intensity surged. </p><p>Soon, they had discovered one of the fake tunnels I had left as bait, and started traveling, luckily to the opposite direction to my base. That fake tunnel would eventually come to an end, of course, but it meant I still had time to stretch my time. </p><p>And I intended to stretch that time as much as I manage, I thought even as I turned my attention back to the beauty that was trembling under my touch. </p><p>I had a dragon to tame. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 6692 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>After the little danger with Mana Gems, risking revealing my ignorance, I decided to let her take the lead in the conversation. “So, what kind of accident caused you to be lost in here?” </p><p>“An unfortunate one,” she stated with a frown, though that frown didn’t last long as I filled the pool with more of my mana. </p><p>[-613 Mana]</p><p>She took a deep breath, the mana density of the artificial pool decreasing significantly. “There’s not much to talk about, I was flying around in the Desolate Outlands for a mission, when I accidentally came across a raiding party of those Eternals, and I had to jump into the dimensional rift that they came out, and found myself in this accursed place.” </p><p>Interesting, I thought, her words giving me yet another information, suggesting the Eternals was conducting more aggression than I expected, underlining my lack of information even more. </p><p>Therefore making the sexy dragon in front of me, busy absorbing mana, even more important. I slipped even more mana to the pool, curious of the speed she continued to devour my mana. How big was her mana capacity?  </p><p>[-942 Mana]</p><p>So, while she continued her story — which, unfortunately, focused on the details of her fight against the undead rather than the details of her life — I decided to follow what exactly she was doing with all the mana. </p><p>I expected to follow the mana into a reservoir, similar to the core that held our mana together in our soul space, ready to be used, but that turned out to be a complete inaccuracy. </p><p>It wasn’t that she didn’t have any reservoir. She had many, spread around her body, but I doubted that even their collective reservoirs would hold a thousand points of mana. And she had already absorbed more than that, yet continued to absorb. </p><p>[-1282 Mana] </p><p>  Curious, I let even more mana infuse the water, but this time, watching even more carefully, maintaining an active connection with the flow. </p><p>Distracted by her own story and the comfort of the bath, she missed that particular detail, and I was free to follow the trail of the mana. I followed it until her bones, only for it to disappear at that point. </p><p>My eyes widened at the sudden disappearance, though luckily, I was able to hide it as a reaction to a particularly exciting part of her story. Inwardly, I focused my full attention to the exact moment of disappearance, to see whether she was somehow sending it to a different dimension. </p><p>The answer turned out to be no. The more accurate definition was that her bones were absorbing the mana, but it was assimilated with such a great speed that I had almost missed it. Curious, I paid careful attention to the point of absorption, and after a while, I noticed her bones were slowly transforming under the renewing flow of mana. </p><p>The transformation itself was quite mysterious. While I wasn’t free to use my Biomancy abilities directly on her to assess the problem more carefully, I could get a rough understanding of the transformation that was going on her bones, and whatever the exact nature of the transformation was, its magnitude was impossible to deny. The power they radiated, the potential it implied, impressively significant. </p><p>Interestingly, it wasn’t a quick transformation. Far from it. All the mana she had absorbed barely allowed her to transform a fleck of her bones, making me question just how much mana she would require for the complete transformation. To properly assess that, I needed a better understanding of what was going on, or a deeper analysis — which was hard to achieve without alerting her. </p><p>Still, my guess was easily in the millions. </p><p>“So, you have no idea why the undead suddenly decided to ambush and chase you that aggressively?” I asked, after she had mentioned the fifth ambush she managed to defeat before her eventual capture. I had already assumed it was less about the ritual, and more about the deal between Zokras and the Eternals. </p><p>“It was probably for the ritual they were doing?” she answered lazily, confirming that she had no idea why the Eternals were showing a special interest in her. I believed her, because I doubted that, in her relaxed state, she could slip into a lie. </p><p>I hummed, letting the silence rule the situation even as I tried to decide what to ask next. It was a difficult one. Unfortunately, her lengthy explanation about the ambushes she had gone through didn’t really help me, not in terms of understanding her limits…</p><p>And certainly not to understand why someone was so determined to kill her. </p><p>I let the silence stretch for a moment before I asked the next question. “So, what was the mission that made you end in Desolate Outlands?” </p><p>“Just a regular mission from the tribe, trying to get some resources for a potion,” she answered, then frowned. “The mana is getting a bit thinner, why don’t you release some more?” </p><p>“Unfortunately, I’m at my limit,” I answered, which earned a frown immediately, showing an explosion was not too far away as well. I rushed to finish the explanation, just to bait her. “Unfortunately, carefully imbuing the water constantly without making it explode is exhausting.” </p><p>She was quick to take the bait. “So, that’s the challenge of releasing that’s difficult, not the mana.” </p><p>“Yeah,” I answered. “It’s much easier to do through direct physical contact.” </p><p>“Is it?” she murmured a question, tensing slightly, smart enough to realize the direction that statement could easily evolve. “Any special place, or just skin-to-skin contact.” </p><p>“Any skin contact is sufficient,” I answered her. “Though the back allows the easiest process, hands and feet work just as well.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured. I said nothing for a moment, just enjoying the lingering expression of careful consideration on her face, as she clearly measured the sudden nature of the offer. The innocent nature of my offer, however, went along to reduce alertness, especially with a lot more mana tangling on the other side of the rope. </p><p>“Just my hand, right?” she asked a moment later. </p><p>“A hand is more than enough,” I said, doing my best to suppress my naughty smile that threatened to pop out. </p><p>“G-good,” she said, unable to hide the sudden stammer in her tone, showing that, despite her general aggressiveness, she was not familiar with the casual physical contact. However, more mana was clearly an enticing prospect. </p><p>Whatever process she was using to power up instead of the System and leveling up clearly required a lot of mana, and now that she had found a renewable mana source, she was tempted to compromise on her personal modesty slightly to get even more of it. </p><p>Just as I liked. </p><p>“Hmm,” she murmured. “You’re not worthy of holding my hand,” she murmured even as she scooted closer to me, the constant bubbling of the water still hiding her body, and soon, her foot pushed out of the water. </p><p>“As you wish, your dragoness,” I said with a smirk, amused by her forced insult as she tried to undercut the weight of the touch even more. She wasn’t the first haughty woman I would tame bit by bit, but her true nature as a dragon certainly made it the most daring one. </p><p>I said nothing when she glared at me, just grabbed a hold of her foot, pressing my fingers on her sole. </p><p>[-273 Mana]</p><p>“Mmm,” she murmured as I slowly infused not only mana, but also some healing energy through her skin, making the touch even more comfortable as I unleashed my massaging skills, enjoying the softness of her skin. </p><p>Having an alternative form to protect her human-like body from the ravages of the environment was certainly handy. </p><p>It wasn’t surprising to see her stiffening suddenly as the pleasure hit her. “Why are you rubbing it?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, it helps to infuse mana quicker, but if you prefer the slower way…” I said, keeping my fingers still, but deliberately limiting the mana flow in the process. I even transformed the mana a bit, letting Arcana-natured mana slip through, to create the sensation that could be described as thorny.</p><p> To her credit, she resisted the contrasting sensation a bit, almost a minute, before she relented. “If it’s easier for you, feel free to move your fingers,” she said, like she was making a great sacrifice for my benefit. </p><p>Well, she was in the process, but luckily, she was unaware of the full extent of said sacrifice. “As you wish, your dragoness,” I said, even as I let my mana flow more. </p><p>But fate saw to it that I couldn’t have a comfortable break where I just seduced a sexy dragon, because just as I started to intensify my mana flow, I felt a disturbance on the alert wards I had left on the fake dragon body. </p><p>Someone had just discovered its true nature. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 6823 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Mm, it smells amazing,” Carrie said as I carried a large tray, filled with a monstrously huge omelet and many supporting protein-rich condiments. </p><p>As she walked to the dining table, straining her bathrobe in all the right places, she looked amazing as well, but considering Sarah was walking behind me, I neglected to mention that. Not because I was afraid of making Sarah jealous — as it was far, far too late for that — but because I recognized the sudden mischievous glint at Carrie’s eyes. </p><p>I sat down, waiting for the show that would no doubt be about to come. </p><p>Why bother putting any effort into teasing when I could just lean back and enjoy the fruits of their weird competition? </p><p>Carrie didn’t disappoint me, and rather than taking a seat, she walked to Sarah, who was just putting a pot of coffee on the table. </p><p>“You naughty whore,” Carrie suddenly said, her voice tight. </p><p>“W-what?” Sarah stammered in shock, taking a step back in panic, thinking that she had been caught. She hadn’t been caught, though that was only a technicality. Being caught meant there was a point Carrie was unaware of what had been happening behind the kitchen counter.</p><p>Unaware of that particular interesting nugget, Sarah was afraid. </p><p>“You are very naughty,” Carrie said, taking another step forward, and when Sarah tried to retreat, she had found herself pressed against a wall. “You have been stuffing herself with desserts while preparing breakfast,” Carrie continued with a  sudden cheerful tone. </p><p>Sarah failed to adapt to the sudden change, especially when Carrie swiped her finger to her lips, coming up with a very distinct white liquid. Sarah’s eyes widened in fear as Carrie put her finger in her mouth, afraid of Carrie recognizing the taste.</p><p>“Hmm, delicious, though a bit salty,” Carrie said with a playful innocence before turning and leaving Sarah alone, who was busy trying to suppress her panic attack. Though her fear did some nice things to her nipples, especially with her bra removed in our earlier game. </p><p>Carrie’s innocent acting was too exaggerated, suspicious enough to be easily caught by Sarah if she was in a mood to focus on anything but her own fear. </p><p>A pretty mean move on Carrie’s part, though by no means undeserved. </p><p>But that turned out to be only the beginning of Carrie’s ploy. Rather than pulling a chair, she plopped on my lap, moving back and forth to settle on my lap, which, naturally, awakened my hardness to full power in quick order. </p><p>Sarah might have gotten jealous considering what she had been doing minutes earlier, but she was too relaxed what she thought as to be a close-call to care about that. “Coffee?” she asked instead, quickly serving it as an excuse to change the topic. </p><p>She didn’t want her best friend questioning her about the mysterious dessert she had tested on her lips. </p><p>“Thanks,” Carrie replied simply. But her movements as she reached for the coffee mug were nothing but simple. She leaned forward, leaving my lap for a moment, which was completely unnecessary as she could have reached without moving. </p><p>But that was not a thoughtless move, not when she had used the opportunity to pull my towel off. I expected her to drop it off on the floor, where Sarah couldn’t see from her seat, but she surprised even me by throwing that on a back of an empty chair. </p><p>Perfectly positioned for Sarah to see. </p><p>“By the way, have you finished the project for AP English class, we have to present that in Monday class,”  Carrie said, like sitting on my naked lap was something completely ordinary. </p><p>Sarah looked at her in shock, though the effects of our kitchen adventure worked wonderfully to prevent that shock from turning into anger. </p><p>“Sarah,” Carrie said, her smirk widening even as she started to rock back and forth gently. “You have finished your part of the research, right?” </p><p>“I did,” Sarah answered.</p><p>“Excellent,” Carrie said. “Then maybe we can put it all together this afternoon, before leaving,” she said. </p><p>“M-maybe not,” Sarah answered, noticing the way Carrie’s subtle rocking slowly picking up speed, smart enough to realize that the more they stayed, the more Carrie was going to torture her with her ‘sneaky’ horniness. “I have something urgent to do back home, we can do it afterward!” </p><p>“Oh, what urgent thing?” Carrie asked with a smirk even as one of her hands slip under the table and pulled the skirt of her bathrobe up. It was still on the way, but the area it covered was being reduced every passing second. </p><p>I decided to help Carrie, and lifted my foot, sliding directly between Sarah’s legs. Her skirt prevented direct contact, but considering she was not wearing her underwear, the impact was considerable. </p><p>Especially since Sarah was still burning with arousal after our latest kitchen adventure. </p><p>“Why are you moving your leg,” Carrie asked as she twisted her hips even more, her smirk widening. Smart girl, giving me an excellent excuse. </p><p>“Just a little cramp,” I said before turning to Sarah. “Don’t let me break your important discussion. You were telling something, Sarah,” I said. </p><p>“Just an urgent thing,” Sarah deflected, not appreciating the necessity to speak as her core got teased. My massage made it even harder to speak, adding arousal into her frustration and jealously. </p><p>I caught Sarah’s gaze while Carrie closed her eyes, and winked at her. Sarah smirked victoriously, once again enjoying the impression that she was pulling an impressive trick in front of Carrie, unaware of the escalation that was happening under the table. </p><p>And stuck between weird jealous competition between two nerdy girls, I was very happy. </p><p> Especially when, Carrie managed to pull her bathrobe up completely, allowing our naked bodies to touch, a strategic movement of her hips all she needed for her wetness to swallow my erection. </p><p>It was a credit to her growing experience that she didn’t moan explicitly as she took most of my length at once, which worked wonders to keep Sarah unaware of the escalation that was going under the table — though, the strategic massage of my foot helped that particular nugget impressively.</p><p>She even started to smile confidently, once again thinking that she was the one that was pulling one over her friend.  </p><p>Honestly, Sarah’s confident smugness as she misunderstood the situation was almost as delicious as the way Carrie tightened around my girth, so thick that even Carrie noticed the change of her expression, despite her own struggle to keep her expression smooth. </p><p>Carrie’s response was spectacular. She put her weight down, taking my full length. It made her grunt in pain, but she was smart enough to take a sip of her coffee, and blame it for its hotness. </p><p>I had my huge omelet to finish, allowing me to hide my expression by chewing, something that started to be more and more necessary as Carrie’s hips picked up speed if we were to continue enjoying Sarah’s misplaced confidence. </p><p> Luckily, she was far too fascinated by her own achievements to pay closer attention to us — well, our facial expression, as her gaze was awfully interested in the way Carrie’s body was jumping up and down, or my muscular arm. </p><p>… while the connected hand continued to climb on Carrie’s naked thighs, leaving a trembling surrender in its wake. Neither Carrie nor Sarah seemed to be interested in continuing their discussion, both too distracted by their physical pleasure. </p><p>I let that slide, accepting their departure as a fact. As much as their presence was fun, I still have a day full of exhausting exercise. </p><p>Which didn’t mean I couldn’t enjoy the last minutes of the breakfast fully, especially when Carrie lifted herself up momentarily, giving me a slight scare, before slamming herself back across my length, swallowing the full length again, her bathrobe dislodging enough to completely reveal her tits — though the table still enough to hide the full extent of our activities, leaving Sarah smug in her own victory.</p><p>Her gaze got more and more focused on our revealed flesh as time passed, until the pleasure got too much, forcing her to close her eyes to fully enjoy the orgasm hitting her, leaving her panting and moaning. </p><p>Carrie might have mocked her, but the show Sarah was putting, along with her tightness, triggered my explosion as well, allowing her to close the last bit of distance. She bit her lips, trying to hide her moans, replicating Sarah’s expression, while I gasped relaxedly, pulling my foot back as well. </p><p>Sarah was the first one to speak, recovering faster than Carrie. “Oh, I see that you have an accident,” Sarah said mockingly as she assumed my relaxation came from a dry lap dance. A rather inaccurate assessment, but that didn’t prevent me from marking that. </p><p>She earned a true punishment. </p><p>For the next time, of course. “Accidents happen,” I said even as I moved Carrie to the next seat and wrapped my towel around my waist. “Anyway, I need to start working out,” I said, leaning for Carrie for one last fleeting kiss before leaving, leaving the girls alone for whatever pointy discussion they might have before leaving. </p><p>Just as I was about to take a step into the stairs, I turned to them with a smirk. “By the way, it was an amazing game night. We should definitely repeat it.” </p><p>“Oh, definitely,” came the twin response, their glare competitive. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Why not go all the way, I decided after thinking for a bit. For all the power that was under her control, she was arrogant. Her magical potential ensured that any attempt to manipulate her magically, even just indirect tricks, was doomed to fail. </p><p>But I didn’t let it affect me the slightest. Her clear inexperience meant I still had a plethora of subtler forms of manipulation. </p><p>For example, seduction. </p><p>Unaware of the decision I had made, she continued to focus on the security of the Eternal Core. “You’re sure it’s well hidden, right?” she asked, trying to act calmer, but I could see the fear dancing in her eyes still. “If you’re lying, and that upstart whore finds it, your fate will be legendary!” </p><p>“No, it’s definitely very secure,” I guaranteed. “I’m willing to bet my life and my kingdom for it,” I said, however, I was struggling to contain my smirk. Her threat had accidentally revealed to me the reason for her to avoid the dark families. She clearly had a rival that was working, probably under an official assignment, making her a rogue operation. </p><p>As if I needed any more evidence for her political lack of awareness. </p><p>“Good,” she repeated as she stilled. “You should release this so-called Dark Lord you mentioned so he could go and get the Core for me. I need it.” </p><p>“As you wish, my lady,” I said as I leaned forward. “However, there are still a few hours until I could sneak back into the palace without being noticed. Is there anything else I can do to help?” </p><p>“You can tell me just how capable those dark families, especially Fyre Eternal,” she said, which was an interesting choice, but from what I could read, those families had at least one, or maybe more rivals of her, and she wanted to be prepared. </p><p>If I had revealed my true identity, it might have made sense. However, the fact that she was focusing on that aspect despite me trying to use the identity of the late king was certainly suspicious. I would have expected her to be more on guard against the other mysterious faction. </p><p>Still, I started giving a detailed breakdown of the dark families. Not completely honest, of course, as I fudged their power upward a bit, just to make sure she felt intimidated about their potential, but not to a point it would sound unbelievable. The more fearful she felt against her rivals, the more opportunity I had. </p><p>However, increasing her fear toward her rivals was just a bonus. No, my real objective was something different. </p><p>I wanted to understand her reactions. </p><p>My approach toward seduction was much different than Lancelot's, smiling like an idiot and hoping it would work. No, I first wanted to understand her preferences and her desires. Of course, that was hardly a simple thing. </p><p>Luckily, thanks to Lancelot, I already knew that smiling like an idiot, hoping that she would fall for me relentlessly wouldn’t work, meaning I had to another attempt. Luckily, thanks to Emma, I knew being excessively submissive wouldn’t work as well. </p><p>There was no guarantee that she looked at Emma as a sexual prospect, but if there was one truth about attraction, it was very rare for a woman to feel attracted to anyone she looked at contempt. </p><p>Unfortunately, trying to take an abrasive pose wouldn’t work as well. She was not only too powerful, but also she was confident in her power.</p><p>Maybe too confident.  </p><p>In the end, I settled in a calm, non-confrontational power pose, accepting her power over me, but not letting that make me fold like Emma. Hardly the most attractive pose,  but sometimes, not getting scored was more important than scoring. </p><p>It was a rare feeling, something I hadn’t had to deal with since my ascension to my position. Even after I had been captured, it didn’t completely remove their instinctual fear and respect against me, and, counter-intuitively, those were easy emotions to convert to attraction. </p><p>Then, as the explanation continued, I started experimenting with micro-expressions and stances, reading her unconscious physical reactions. At this point, her focus on my words as I explained the various powers of the Dark Families worked wonders, allowing me to experiment carefully. </p><p>Interestingly, I had received the best reaction from not hiding my appreciation in her body, at least not completely. She seemed to be happy as I looked at her like I was stripping her in my mind, but with a caveat. Making even the slightest subtle move was enough to destroy that inclination. </p><p>She clearly enjoyed the carnal attention, but only if I showed I knew my place not to take any action. </p><p>So, as I continued explaining, I tried to maintain fleeting eye contact, dancing the thin line between reflecting my desire and challenging her. </p><p>Amusingly, it was making her blush slightly, a blush that reminded me of Emma rather than Fernhand, at least in terms of the experience that it implied. Such an incredible opportunity. </p><p>How very much interesting. </p><p>So, I maintained my steamy gaze dancing between her beautiful body and her eyes.</p><p>Unfortunately, while she was getting aroused, it wasn’t the burning kind, needing only a whisper for her to drop her dress. Not all seduction worked instantly, succeeding with a flick of a finger. Soon, I came to the end of my explanation. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured, trying to sound calm, but I could see that she was worried, clearly unhappy with the relative strength of the Dark Families. I had oversold their strength quite a bit. “I need to think a bit.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said. “Is there anything else I could do to help?” </p><p>“Not for the moment, no,” she said, dismissing me away. I would have preferred to stay, but unfortunately, she wasn't someone I could sweep off her feet. </p><p>At least, not in the first meeting. </p><p>I left the room, and as I walked away,  I could feel her magic wrapping around gently, showing that she was tracking me. I activated my shadow spell once more, but this time, I deliberately didn’t use the Blade of Shadows. </p><p>There was no harm in being underestimated. </p>",

With no Thad around us to impress for a party ticket, he was more than willing to skip his turn. </p><p>Another receiver lined in front of me, but he chose to avoid my angry gaze, which was even better than I expected. There was something precious in owning the enemy mentally. “Keep your mind in the game,” Kevin shouted, but his petulant tone hardly helped his newest teammate to keep his calm. </p><p>After a barely convincing fake outside, he started running a slant route, which was rather unimaginative in terms of the play.

One advantage of playing casually was that there was no referee to call for pass interference. </p><p>I was still expecting a hard contest for the ball, but when I took a step forward, the receiver stopped contesting, allowing me to get another easy interception. I threw the ball back to the center, but when I turned to wait, my guide spoke, her enthusiasm clear. </p><p>“Oh, they are discussing you. I’m sure you’ll make the team. And in this stadium, I’m sure we will receive a lot of Intent,” my guide suddenly cheered, making me send a glance to Thad and the coach, only to see that it was the case. They were still talking, their gaze carefully on the play. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, not wanting to commit to it, or give a sign that I noticed their increased attention. </p><p>But I didn’t underplay my actions either, not even when Thad returned with a wide smirk, like he had a secret we didn’t know. </p><p>After that point, it was a downhill disaster. </p><p>A disaster for our smug quarterback, of course. Four forced fumbles and two interceptions later, the victory was clear, especially when the other cornerback also managed to deflect the ball several times as the opposing receivers lost their will to contest, not ready to face a loss in their first training. </p><p>And the inaccurate throws, getting worse by each repeat as Kevin got more and more frustrated hardly helped.  </p><p>“I think we can call it a game,” Thad said after I managed to deflect yet another pass, turning the bet into a joke. </p><p>Kevin clearly hated the suggestion, but compared to the need to throw more, it was the palatable option. His helmet, hitting the floor loudly, was enough as an answer. </p><p>He left with a frustrated cry, not even bothering to pick up his helmet. </p><p>Thad chuckled as he watched him leave, though his good mood was understandable. </p><p>The guy just won a car. </p><p>“Okay, I like what I see,” Thad said. “Six new players for the practice squad.” There were seven of us. The receivers froze instantly, assuming that since the defensive players made him win a bet, one of them would get the kick. </p><p>Then, Thad surprised everyone else by slapping me on the shoulder, hard. “Welcome to the team, we can use a vicious little bastard like you.” </p><p>I struggled to hide my frown. Not due to his words, as being called a vicious bastard was certainly a perfect description of my personality. A point of pride, even. </p><p>No, my frown was about my invisible guide, cheering intensely at the news. I liked the opportunity to be a part of the team, but the whole point of me coming here was to use the practice squad as an excuse to delay things while I could do some research about the mysterious situation I found myself in. </p><p>I didn’t reject the offer, of course. Not only it was my childhood dream, but also, I didn’t have much hope to find anything useful by researching. Searching the net about the disappearance of Greek gods didn’t seem to be a fertile source of information.  </p><p>“What a nice offer, when can I start,” I answered, matching his smirk. No need to dwell on the negatives. And, I had a feeling that dealing with the mysteries of the Divine System was going to be a stressful affair. </p><p>An opportunity to beat other people in a socially-acceptable situation was certainly appreciated. </p><p>Thad sent the other players to the practice squad, while gesturing me to follow. “Why the hell you’re not already a part of the team?” he asked as we walked. “We could have certainly used a backup like you the last year.” </p><p>“Not strong or fast enough to impress the scouts, at least not enough to make them take a chance on me,” I said with a shrug. “So I joined the chess team.” </p><p>That made him stop, his expression shocked. “You’re joking,” he gasped. </p><p>“Nope,” I answered with a shrug. “It’s one of the sports that actually gives scholarship, so when I failed to take the jersey, I decided to take an easier route.” It was certainly not the easier path if it wasn’t for the ridiculous PR attempt of the college, trying to sell an intellectual image to suppress their party school reputation. </p><p>Even then, I was only able to get it because no serious chess player would trust a new program. But there was no point sharing that particular detail with a defensive teammate. </p><p>“I don’t believe it,” Thad said. </p><p>“Well, you can ask Kevin whether he remembers me from the morning, when he egged the tournament.” </p><p>“Oh, I see,” Thad said, his smile widening as he realized I had an actual reason to ruin his day. “And here I was, thinking he stole a girlfriend of you or something? You were certainly vicious enough for that to be the case.” </p><p>“I don’t like weaklings,” I said. It was a bit excessive to call a teammate, but considering the clear bad blood between two teams, it didn’t seem like Thad would mind. </p><p>I was right, he just laughed again as we walked toward the area where the defense was practicing. However, we weren’t able to arrive, when a snotty voice cut our talk. It wasn’t a young snotty voice, however. </p><p>We turned, and saw Coach Spencer, with Kevin a few feet behind him. The coach looked at Thad. “You can go back to practice, I need to have a talk with our new player.” </p><p>From the way Kevin smiled, in a way he no doubt thought as intimidating, it wasn’t hard to guess what happened. He had gone to bitch about me to the Coach, and Coach decided to do him a favor by kicking me out of the team. </p><p>I wouldn’t have gone crying if he succeeded in that, though I would certainly make Kevin pay at one point, maybe even extending it to Coach Spencer if I could find an opportunity. </p><p>Just because I wasn’t sure how to feel about the opportunity didn’t mean I would let others attack me with no consequence. </p><p>However, that turned unnecessary when Thad interjected. “No need for it, Coach,” Thad said with a smirk. “I decided to recommend him for the team.” </p><p>Coach Spencer, with his fragile ego, clearly didn’t appreciate it. “You can’t do that,” he lashed out immediately, his vicious glare targeting me. </p><p>“Really, do you want to talk that with Coach Bill? I’m sure he would appreciate your opinion before deciding who to play in defense.” He smirked. “Please do, we failed to take a video the last time you tried giving your stupid opinions.” </p><p>Damn, I thought. The blood between them was even worse than I had thought.  </p><p>Coach Spencer’s anger spiked even more, and his gaze toward me suggested that, from this point forward, I had two entitled rich assholes instead of just one, one being the head coach. </p><p>Such an exciting development. </p><p>“Don’t bother coming back to the practice team when that old goat rejects you,” Spencer growled before turning back with a frustrated twirl and walking away. Kevin followed him, though he was shocked that his genius plot had failed. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” Thad said as he looked at me. “He is an annoying fucker.” </p><p>“They are not the first rich assholes I had to deal with,” I said with a shrug. The worst he could do was to kick me out of the team, and if Thad’s reaction was any indicator, it wasn’t a very likely outcome. Even if it happened, hardly the end of the world for me. </p><p>My shrug earned another laugh from my new teammate. Then, we continued toward the practice area of the team.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>The sight of Theodora licking her lips as she looked down was simply delicious, especially even her enthusiasm failed to hide the hint of hesitation. </p><p>I wasn’t sure about the source of that hesitation, maybe a lack of experience, maybe my displayed identity as a barbarian. Or maybe, I corrected as she looked up, worship shining in her eyes, it was just the desire she was feeling toward her savior. </p><p>And while she looked up,  I enjoyed admiring the unobstructed view of her fit, lithe body, the treasure that she decided to give to me freely, a moan following up as my hand landed on her shoulder, adding some pressure to pull her closer. </p><p>“You have spent a small treasure arranging this meeting. It would be a pity to waste it. Let’s give you your money’s worth,” I whispered throatily, rubbing my shaft against her lips.</p><p>A flash of shame passed through her gaze, but the speed her lips parted suggested the hold the shame wasn’t strong enough to keep her back. Not when she made a concerted effort to cover the head of my shaft with lengthy worship, like savoring a valuable dessert. </p><p>Her movements were hesitant, but her strategy was solid, making me think that it was the first time she was doing it, but it wasn’t the first time watching — not that it was shocking considering what went in the noble parties behind the closed doors. </p><p>However, her lack of practical experience didn’t mean she was lacking in motivation. She moved forward, swallowing half of my shaft at once before hitting her limits. </p><p>Well, what she considered as her limits. </p><p>She pulled back after a couple of attempts, a growl that was the mixture of pleasure and frustration as she looked down. “Not a bad first attempt,” I said with a chuckle, which was all needed to replace her frustration with determination. </p><p>She leaned down once again, pushing herself forward, devouring more of my shaft, accompanied by her gasps. </p><p>“Great enthusiasm, but little success,” I whispered with a chuckle, which earned a frustrated glare off her, though with half of my shaft in her mouth, it hardly conveyed the intimidating impact she was looking for. “Luckily, I’m willing to give you some accelerated training,” I whispered. </p><p>She mumbled an answer, which was not really audible with my shaft still in her mouth, but her expression was enough to convey her acceptance. </p><p>“Excellent. It might be a bit rough at first, and requires a lot from you, but I’m sure a little hardship is nothing for you,” I explained even as I tightened my hands behind her back. “Open wide.” </p><p>Theodora was quick to follow my order, opening her mouth more than I expected her to be capable, allowing me an excellent path. </p><p>And I pushed forward mercilessly, a beautiful gag escaping her mouth even as she realized just how far  I was planning to push. But rather than trying to push back, she accepted the invasion obediently while my shaft forcibly reshaped her throat. </p><p>She trembled in shock, but my firm grip held her in place. Her gags followed by moans, her hands clamping around my legs to reflect her growing interest, even stroking them affectionately, while I controlled the pace of the moment. </p><p>The way her throat clamped around my shaft was nice, while her breaths pushed her chest out, displaying her breasts beautifully, tempting me to pull one of my hands away from the back of her head to fondle her breasts instead. </p><p>She just shuffled, giving me better access, even as she took my shaft in repeatedly. Then, just as she was getting in the mood, I pulled back. “So, sweetie, how was your first attempt?” </p><p>“I don’t…” Theodora murmured, daze mixed with arousal, a slight slurring coloring her tone. “I don’t know what came over me.\" </p><p>I dragged my finger over her nipples, making her shiver. “That was not an  answer, sweetie.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured. “Maybe?” </p><p>“I need more than just a maybe, princess,” I said, amused that this time, she didn’t flinch being referred to as a princess. She stayed silent. “Honey, there’s no shame listening to the song of your body. There’s no one around trying to fit you into a little box to sell just how appropriate you are. You can be honest.” </p><p>“I … I did,” she murmured, somehow having more struggle admitting that than she had deep-throating my shaft. “I enjoyed it.” </p><p>“Excellent news,” I said even as I sat on the bed once more. “And since not only you have enjoyed it but also received a crash course in applied pleasure, why don’t you show me just how much you appreciate me.” </p><p>  “As you wish,” she said, though, I was shocked by the sudden smirk appearing on her face, like a ward had been triggered. She stood up, her body already swaying to an imaginary song. </p><p>The way her body moved was perfect, mixing ability with desire, telling me that there had been a lot of dance classes in her more comfortable days, probably a part of the traditional education she had received, or a hobby she followed on her own. </p><p>Regardless, with the way her sweaty olive skin caught the light, her core getting wetter and wetter, the sway of her naked body was simply glorious, seduction incarnate. Whatever compunction against dancing nude in front of me she might have had been destroyed by her aggressive training, she moved her body entrancingly, her hands traveling all over her body to sell her curves.</p><p>“Damn, you’re a wonder of magic,” I murmured even as I let my hand caress her skin, amazed at just how hot and seductive she looked. </p><p>Her body swayed, her hips swinging to an imaginary beat, tempting me with her call. I leaned forward and put my hand on the outside of her thigh. “It’s not allowed to touch the dancer,” she said, but she said that smugly, making no attempt to pull back. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said even as I dragged my hand up even as I pulled her closer, so that when my hand landed on her tight ass, she was dancing between my spread legs. I was tempted to actually push her back and tease her for that comment, but after everything she had achieved in such quick order, she deserved a proper reward. </p><p>She must be happy with the pace, because she made no alteration to her pace as I pulled her dangerously close to my shaft, even occasionally rubbing it against her inner thigh. Her moans were her only reaction. </p><p>Lost in a haze, her earlier commitment to no touching was abandoned completely when she grabbed my wrists, giving them to her breasts, bending her body to caress my body with her hair while I massaged them. </p><p>She must be enjoying the treatment, because she put her elbows to my knees to lean forward, giving me an even easier time massaging her breasts while her hips swayed hypnotically, so beautifully that I actually conjured a full-body mirror behind her, enjoying the glistening view of her pussy, covered with desire.</p><p>I bit my lips, trying to suppress my desire to just pull her to my lap. </p><p>She noticed my gaze going to somewhere else, and started speaking with a frown. “What could be more important than—“ she started as she turned, only to fall silent as she realized I was looking at the mirror behind her. </p><p>A mirror that gave her the perfect glimpse of her face, contorted with desire, almost like a pleasure slave. </p><p>“Isn’t this a wonderful view,” I said even as grabbed her hips and pulled her on my lap, though making sure that I didn’t slip inside her. I grabbed her legs and parted them open, revealing her sopping wet core, before dragging a finger over it. “Do you think it was wrong for me to look at your reflection, when it gave me such a beautiful view of treasure?”</p><p>Theodora said nothing, nor that she needed to with the way her hips already rocking against my shaft. I slipped a finger inside, and a delicious moan escaped her mouth while she leaned into my chest, giving me an even better angle to finger-fuck her. </p><p>Her hips rocked, but her earlier seductive rhythm was forgotten, replaced by a desperate pace, showing her increasing arousal as she rode both my hand and my shaft. Her growing arousal around my fingers was unmistakable.</p><p>A while later, I pulled my hand away, leaving her pussy spread wide, and drenched with desire. “Do you want me to fuck you?” I whispered. </p><p>“Yes,” she murmured deliriously, showing she was already on the edge of the pleasure, and very much enthusiastic about pushing forward. “Fuck me.” </p><p>“I will,” I whispered, deciding it was a good time to interrogate her a bit more about her identity. My initial aim was to keep her at arm's length, but considering I was going to trust her a sea voyage that might as well be deadly if she tried to sabotage it, a little more information about her wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>Just in case. </p><p>“Okay,” I whispered into her ear. “Just one condition,” I said, flaring my magic to make her daze even stronger as I positioned her above my shaft. She tried to slam herself down, but my hands prevented her from succeeding. “Tell me who you are, who you really are.” </p><p>“I’m…” she stammered, waiting for a second despite her daze, which was enough to show that the secret was even more important than I first gave credit for. Unfortunately, before I could take an action about that, her reluctance broke under the combined assault of her hero worship and her pleasure. </p><p>“I’m Princess Theodora, the oldest daughter of Emperor Zeno,” she gasped. My fingers lost their strength in shock for a moment, an opportunity she had leveraged excellently to sink herself onto my shaft… </p><p>The previous Emperor, actually. The one that had been killed in a palace coup by one of his generals, Basiliscus, who was the current Emperor. </p><p>I just had to ask! </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Let me go first, to make sure wards are working properly,” I said, even though I was able to feel the wards working perfectly. I wanted to prepare the room for someone in her ‘noble’ stature. </p><p>Her identity as a dragon clearly didn’t prevent her from enjoying luxury, and greeting her with something better than dirt floors might be the better idea. Luckily, the wards around my hideout allowed me to cast much stronger spells in the process, allowing me to make some radical home improvement at the cost of some mana. </p><p>[-1821 Mana]</p><p>Earth Elemental magic, combined with my craft skill, allowed me to work with surprising elegance, though my precision Stat certainly helped quite a bit as well. All that needed to decide was to pick the material. </p><p>After some consideration, I decided to go with a combination of marble and crystal. A part of that decision was the ease I could create those materials through elemental spells, but the other part was the way the headmistress’ room was designed. </p><p>Since she was also coming from a long way away, I hoped that the fashion was at least somewhat similar. It was a long stretch, of course, but at least it was decent a choice. </p><p>For the floor and walls, I picked simple white marble, though I made sure to put several scenes of battle and other pictures etched, copied from some of the older books I had found in the library, hoping that they would be familiar to her. Several candle-holders stretched out of the wall, but instead of having actual candles, they had simple flames, connected to nothing, floating freely. </p><p>For the ceiling, I used more crystal than marble, with lights hidden behind half-transparent crystal layers to create a subtle yet intricate light show while also keeping the room warm. </p><p>For the furniture, I relied exclusively on the crystal, keeping its general structure and the texture to the crystal platform the headmistress had in her room. And as a final trick, I created a nice pool at one corner, filling it with warm, bubbling water. </p><p>And as a final touch, I added the trick I had used after the battle against Zokras, and enchanted the water with healing energies and mana, some of it slowly vaporizing to fill the room, creating a gentle, comforting atmosphere. </p><p>I paid the room one last glance, making sure it didn’t resemble a battlefield safe house in any form, and satisfied with the result. It was a miracle, especially with less than a minute spent. Only then, I opened the door again, and inviting my guest in. </p><p>“This way, your dragoness,’ I said, giving a perfect butler bow. It was supposed to be a sarcastic bow, but the nod I received in response as she walked in, letting her gaze wander on the decorations seemed more genuine than I expected. </p><p>She was even more entitled than I thought. </p><p>“Hmm, not as horrible as I expected,” she murmured even as she murmured, but I noticed her eyes widen as she walked closer to the pool, bigger than I expected. “Why can I sense that much mana here? Don’t tell me that you have a Source here!” </p><p>I never heard what a source was, but from her reaction, it wasn’t hard to guess it was some kind of natural or artificial location that radiated mana. Unfortunately, I had never actually heard something like that. The closest thing to it was the Mana Gems, radiating constant mana. </p><p>Clearly, it was important to her, enough to make her sound enthusiastic rather than her usual uncaring tone. </p><p>“Unfortunately, we don’t, but I decided to make the room more comfortable by pushing some mana, to make it more welcoming. I hope it’s not the case.” </p><p>“Yeah,” she murmured. “I forgot that you abominations receive your mana from that disgusting travesty against nature,” she murmured, before continuing with a sharp tone. “Turn your back again,” she added. </p><p>I did, but like before, it didn’t prevent me from devouring the sight of her beautiful body as she kicked off her shoes and dress, this time water slowly devouring her body. Pity that the white bubbles hid her body. </p><p>However, once again, her offhand comment sent me thinking. The apparent lack of mana on the environment, and receiving it from the System — or at least, that was what I assumed by travesty and abomination — was another interesting thing. Maybe the system didn’t only continuously devour the Divine Spark in its borders, but mana as well, before giving it back through the connection. </p><p>The system being responsible for mana distribution was not a surprise, as there had never been enough environmental mana around the environment to support my power. If there was that much free mana, there wouldn’t be a need to use the magical reagents from the monsters to power the wards. </p><p>Of course, I hadn’t thought about how the others received mana without the system, but from what she indicated, it was a resource that was available freely. </p><p>I wondered if that flaw affected the headmistress as well. Though, with the wards of the school under her control, it wasn’t very likely. She could easily siphon some of the excess mana to have an advanced version of the bath my dragon guest was clearly enjoying. </p><p>“May I turn my back,” I asked respectfully, like I hadn’t been watching her, only to receive a hum. </p><p>She was already buried deep into her neck, humming in comfort, while the mana in the pool drained noticeably. Though, considering I had barely injected two hundred points of mana, it wasn’t exactly an indicator. </p><p>“I can push some more mana into the pool,” I said, surprised by her reaction, much more enchanted by mana than the effort I put on the decorations of the room.</p><p>“Really?” she asked, clearly enthusiastic, her eyes shining even more. </p><p>“As long as you don’t mind me in the pool, of course,” I added, never one to miss the opportunity to share a bath with a sexy woman.   </p><p>“Is this necessary?” she asked, her enthusiasm clearly reduced. </p><p>“Well, the more contact I have with water, the more efficient it’ll be. Of course, if you don’t want an efficient service…” </p><p>She sighed, but her lack of an answer was good enough for me to take as an answer. Unlike her, I didn’t warn her about my upcoming nakedness. And maybe, flexing my Charisma to look more impressive as well. </p><p>“What are you doing! Warn me first!” she gasped. Her face blushed as she exclaimed, which put an even bigger smile on my face. </p><p>It was good to know she was attracted to human males, at least enough to blush. </p><p>“You can always close your eyes, your dragoness,” I said, but that didn’t prevent her from keeping her open. She averted her gaze, but not enough to completely miss the sight. </p><p>A surprisingly cute reaction, even with her glowing emerald eyes. </p><p>However, when I slipped in the water, she was able to turn her gaze back to my face, suggesting while direct nudity was enough to fizzle her nerves, that didn’t extend to sharing a nude bath as long as bubbles were there to hide our bodies. </p><p>Luckily, I had the perfect way to distract her. I enchanted the water with some more mana, earning another soft moan. </p><p>[-182 Mana]</p><p>It wasn’t a great amount, but that didn’t prevent her from enjoying the sensation, suggesting that it wasn’t just power. Her reaction reminded me of someone that stepped into a warm room after working in the snow for a long time. Even if there was no risk of freezing, the warmth would give immense pleasure. </p><p>I was happy about it, as the more comfortable she got, the easier it would be for me to interrogate her about the life outside the System’s area of influence without making her suspicious. </p><p>“It must be a good difference after a long time of struggle without any decent source. How long it had, a couple months?” I asked as she enjoyed the treatment. </p><p>“Thankfully, not that long. Barely more than a week,” she said with a shudder. </p><p>I might have blamed her reaction for being spoiled, but considering the situations I had saved her from, it wouldn’t be a fair assessment. </p><p>Moreover, it was interesting the absolute lack of fear or paranoia after that dangerous events, implying that danger was a familiar companion. She was clearly not unfamiliar with battle, but her tactics could definitely use some benefit. </p><p>“I can imagine,” I said. “So, how did you get enough mana to still cast mana without the help of the System?” </p><p>“I had to hunt those crazed beasts, of course,” she answered, though the shudder she gave off suggested it was hardly a pleasant feeling. “That’s the only way of getting any mana in this detestable place.”</p><p>“You weren’t lucky enough to find a Mana Gem?” I asked. </p><p>“Mana gem?” she asked, surprised. “Is this some kind of mana storage? Are they just laying around?” </p><p>It was an interesting reaction. Mana Gems were rare, but hardly something that would be a mystery to someone in her level if I was reading about her social status even half-accurately. Unless it was known by a different name. </p><p>Or there was no Mana Gem outside. </p><p>“Something like that,” I said, dismissing her question casually even as I injected some more mana to the pool, distracting her with pleasure. I didn’t want to explain more in detail, because it was a surprisingly dangerous proposition, risking revealing my lack of information, which would make her realize she had much bigger leverage.  </p><p>I wanted to interrogate as much as I could manage before she realized that. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 5389 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Maybe I shouldn’t be too critical,” she murmured, unable to hide her frustration. “After all, even for … someone … like you, you have worked hard.” </p><p>I was amused by her sense of entitlement, assuming herself to be my clear superior even after I had saved her life twice. “As you wish, your dragoness,” I said as I gestured the tunnel. “Please, ladies first.” </p><p>But before she stepped in, she gave me a suspicious look. “Shouldn’t you go first, you’re the one that knows the route.” </p><p>“If you can handle dismantling the tunnels without alerting the enemy as we move forward, making sure our enemies don’t catch us, all without actually triggering the traps I had embedded, I can go first,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>She clearly didn’t appreciate my glib answer. Frustration danced over her face for a few seconds, making me wonder whether I was pushing her a bit too much. But when I looked up worriedly — a fake worry, of course, as the opponents had long gone away, tricked by the little scene I had created — she decided that little digs or the sequence of the walk were not that important.  </p><p>She started walking down the tunnel, and I followed, stretching my mana to slowly and carefully destroy the tunnels, making sure that not only I didn’t let out a flare of mana, but also making sure that if someone noticed the fake nature of my gift and tried to dig down, they wouldn’t be able to trace the path correctly. </p><p>Of course, I didn’t destroy every tunnel with the same skill, as if someone had already arrived down here, searching for a clue about our destination. I made sure to destroy the tunnels that were pointing away with much less care — or a different kind of care — so that if they had actually arrived at this point, them following a fake path would give us the time to retreat.  </p><p>It was a boring, tedious task. </p><p>Luckily, I had the perfect view to give me some enjoyment. The deliciously thick hips of my new companion were dancing back and forth with each step thanks to the ridiculously high-heeled shoes she was wearing. And while she was short, her curves were just delicious enough to compensate for it. </p><p>And the rough floor wasn’t helping any, making her stumble occasionally. She didn’t fall down, of course, not with her supernatural agility, but the occasional stumble was impossible to avoid. Still, that hardly helped my enjoyment of the show. </p><p>“What a shoddy tunnel,” she murmured. </p><p>“Sorry, your dragoness,” I said with exaggerated seriousness. “The next time, I’ll try to find some high-class marble to dig through.” </p><p>“Don’t call me that,” she said, turning just enough to give me a stink eye. </p><p>“Well, I don’t have your name yet, your dragoness.” </p><p>“And you won’t have it if you act like this!” </p><p>“As you wish, your tall and imposing majesty,” I answered, even though I received another punch in response. </p><p>[-52 HP]</p><p>She let it slide with one punch, falling silent as she walked, while I smirked, happy with the short discussion. Her responses gave me a lot of clues about her background, and the levers I could push.</p><p>It would be nice to talk to someone other than the headmistress about the Eternals, especially since the dragon didn’t hold any power on my only base, unlike the headmistress, who hold the power in my only power base. </p><p>She might be a dragon, but clearly, she was also some kind of noble, at least in terms of societal expectations, which guaranteed at least some kind of accuracy in terms of the information she might have. And despite that, her immature reactions were far too emotional for her to be any kind of dedicated agent, making her weak to subterfuge. </p><p>The skill she had shown against the combined assault of the Eternals was significant, of course, especially considering she lacked the extremely efficient shortcut provided by the system. However, her skill didn’t have any implications in terms of her social status, especially since I had no idea about their power balance. </p><p>Apart from her magical skills, the ease she transformed, and the quickness she had changed into her dress and her shoes, implied that it wasn’t a rare affair for her to use this form on social occasions, which had an interesting number of implications. </p><p>However, I didn’t waste too much time in the land of assumptions. Instead, I turned my attention to the results from the detection wards, observing the battle on the surface, which was going on with occasional frequency, people battling against each other, people fighting against beasts, even the occasional beasts fighting against other beasts… </p><p>“So, how are you finding your accommodations in our nice neighborhood?” I asked even as I pulled down another segment of the tunnel, timing it perfectly with a stumble, optimizing her frustration. </p><p>“It’s the worst place I could ever imagine. Just a little accident, and I’m away from home, in a land filled with upstart barbarians who think themselves strong just because they could kill a few monsters, captured by a bunch of disgusting skeletons with delusions of grandeur, who dares to defile the bones of my ancestors. Then, I get away, and a few days later, I find myself in some kind of training deathmatch, hunted by those incompetent abominations.” </p><p>She turned to face me. “Yes, I’m loving my new home.” </p><p>“Sorry to hear that,” I said, shaking my head, trying to hide my surprise. If I was reading her answer correctly, she came from a long way away, and if the dismissive tone she was taking toward killing a monster to get stronger, maybe far enough that the system didn’t affect her. </p><p>Which meant, she came from the lands that were still ruled by the gods.</p><p>Without the power of the System, the only thing I had was the scraps of the Divine Spark I managed to steal from the headmistress. I doubted that was enough for a trip. That fact alone was enough to mark her as a valuable source of information.  </p><p>It was easy to fall into the illusion of whatever was happening in the distant lands was unimportant, that the only thing that was important was what was happening under the control of the system. </p><p>An illusion that the training adventure I had accidentally stumbled upon destroyed completely. </p><p>I had no idea how many people would be pulled out as a consequence of the training session, but unless it was as low as one or two in a hundred, the Eternals, as an organization, was clearly stronger than I was expecting. </p><p>And with the way they designed the event, I would expect at least one in ten to survive, maybe even going as far as one in two if my estimation was correct. And moreover, the cost of raising them was likely not that high, otherwise, they wouldn’t be taking the risk of possible candidates dying. </p><p>To be able to treat the death of several level-thirty combatants as an acceptable casualty, they had to be strong. Really strong. </p><p>Of course, that forced me to revise several critical assumptions in terms of their involvement. At first, the support they had provided to the undead army and the rivals of the Crown Princess in terms of Mana Gems, rather than getting directly involved. I had assumed that it was because of a lack of power. </p><p>But all they needed to do was to deploy these wards around Silver Spires and conduct their test around the school to destroy the school-like aftermath.  </p><p>I might have assumed that I had read their involvement wrong, but the presence of three assassins sent to capture Titania invalidated that track prematurely as well. If they had no care about it, they wouldn’t have three warriors ready to capture Titania. </p><p>That still left one likely option. They clearly preferred not to interfere with the activities of the Empire for some reason — though, considering the slow collapse the Empire was suffering, it was definitely a questionable call. </p><p>However, it was also clear that some of them believed otherwise, intervening to help Zokras, the princes, even sending some agents to kidnap Titania. </p><p>Interestingly, that assumption also explained the sudden absence of a follow-up after they lost their three agents. The Eternals were clearly not an organization to be scared of that loss, but if a smaller faction of them was responsible for those activities, it made sense of them not sending a follow-up. </p><p>They clearly had a limited number of agents, at least the kind they could use for illegal missions. </p><p>However, I wasn’t able to think a lot about that, because we finally arrived at my shelter. </p><p>We had a lot to talk about. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 6831 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I turned to Penny, who was still holding Nancy’s bound wrists, an uncharacteristically determined expression on her face as she enjoyed the glorious experience of revenge. “Why don’t you tighten your hold a bit more?” I suggested. “Let’s add some real pain to our game.” </p><p>Then, I turned my gaze to Nancy and added. “As long as you’re not scared, of course,” I said, just enough dismissal in my tone to trigger her. </p><p>“Of course not, bring it on-” Nancy said proudly, her competitiveness triggered, only to follow with a pained gasp when Penny forced her to on her knees without a warning. </p><p>“Feel free to beg for help if you’re feeling distressed,” Penny said. </p><p>Nancy looked like she was about to say something, but I interjected. “Excellent pose, keep it,” I said even as I moved closer, taking several pictures, reflecting Nancy’s defiance and Penny’s sadistic pleasure. “Now, let’s try something different. Penny, keep one hand on her wrists, but put your hand on her throat and squeeze a bit, just enough to give the impression of dominance. After all, you’re a warrior that captured a nasty thief.” </p><p>Penny followed the request, squeezing just hard enough to give her redheaded friend — for a given value of the word — some trouble without leaving a mark. I was considering what to ask next even I recorded the glorious moment, when Penny surprised me by going rogue. “You deserve punishment, you worthless thief,” she said even as she tightened her grip. </p><p>Then, she surprised me even further by leaning even more, and pressing her lips against Nancy’s neck, nibbling softly. </p><p>I said nothing, just continued to record the moment, surprised by Penny showing actual initiative. Nancy wriggled helplessly, but with a defiant expression soon replaced her shock, determined to hold her ground. </p><p>A determination that got challenged when Penny’s fingers slipped away from her throat and started working on the buttons of her shirt, increasing her already impressive cleavage even further. </p><p>“It must be nice to be able to walk around all day without a bra or any kind of support without a bra,” Penny whispered into her ear with a surprising viciousness before returning her job of kissing her neck. </p><p>Nancy froze at the insult, so much that Penny’s fingers, continuing down her shirt, unbuttoning across the length to reveal the bosom she had just insulted. Nancy had anything to be ashamed of on that subject. Her breasts, perky and just large enough to fill my palms with no room remaining, were definitely beautiful. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, it was hard to compare against the girl that was currently molesting her from behind in that aspect. When it came to the beauty of her breasts, Penny was simply a class of her own. And just to drive that point further, Penny reached to her costume, removing her armored top with a surprising smoothness before pressing her breasts against Nancy’s back. </p><p>Her naked breasts, as she had elected not to wear a bra thanks to my intervention. </p><p>“Yes, you’re lucky,” Penny whispered again to her frozen target, her fingers finding Nancy’s breasts, squeezing hard enough to earn a gasp. </p><p>As Penny caressed and squeezed Nancy’s breasts, I drew circles around them, taking the sight of the exotic development, enjoying the moment even as I tried to hunt a few photos I could add to the mix without being too revealing. </p><p>Watching them from behind, with Penny’s beautiful ass raised up as she crouched, straining her tight costume to the limit, I was tempted to pull them down and teach her a lesson about being too sexy. </p><p>But, after some personal struggle, I managed to hold myself back. If I did that, there was no way for us to arrive at the convention on time. And after our deal, Nancy wasn’t the only one that needed the event to be a success. </p><p>Instead, I limited myself to enjoying the amazing sight even as I continued to record the delicious moment. Penny continued to attack her neck with a relentless, rhythmic motion, while Nancy shuffled more and more. </p><p>My tightening pants definitely didn’t make the moment any more comfortable, however. </p><p>Then, Penny pushed her limits even more, shocking me with her daring. She leaned back, but when Nancy tried to stand up, Penny’s hand was on her shoulder, preventing her from succeeding. </p><p>She walked around her before crouching in front of Nancy, with her costume around her waist, revealing her glorious tits to Nancy’s gaze once more, but this time, from close quarters. “You’re really lucky,” Penny whispered as she caressed the underside of Nancy’s breasts. </p><p>It was a mean thing to do, but considering her actions, Nancy definitely earned that today. Then, Penny removed Nancy’s wig — and I grabbed it before it could hit the dirt — before grabbing Nancy’s hair, hard. </p><p>Removal of the wig meant that I could not take any more pictures to be included in the convention package. </p><p>Not that the absence of a wig was the only thing that disqualified the scene from being unsuitable for public consumption. Penny pulled Nancy to her chest, burying her face between her breasts. “See, aren’t I very unlucky. Imagine the back pain I feel every day,” she said, though her gleeful, victorious tone was hardly a good fit for complaining. </p><p>When she was finally let go, Nancy was panting desperately, her face contorted between anger and jealousy, though, when she realized I was watching from behind, not bothering to hide my desire, arousal was quick to be added to the game. </p><p>She clearly enjoyed the opportunity more than normal. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, leaning forward, still taking pictures — though straight to my own personal archive. “Now, take her nipple on your mouth, Nancy, and start sucking hard.” </p><p>Penny’s eyes widened at the sudden reversal, but Nancy was quick to follow my request, happy to find an excuse to discard her self-imposed restriction. She started biting and sucking aggressively. </p><p>My blonde model had lost her control for a moment, panicking at the sudden reversal. After all, while she was quick to enjoy her dominant position, her confidence was paper-thin. However, a gentle caress along her spine was enough to fuel her confidence artificially. Her hands retaliated to Nancy, caressing and squeezing her half-naked body aggressively. </p><p> Meanwhile, I casually dropped my touch down Penny’s hips, enjoying the warmth of her skin even as my fingers climbed upward to her core. </p><p>Just to make sure her confidence didn’t waver. No ulterior motives. </p><p>Not at all. </p><p>Electrified by my touch, Penny picked up speed. “Now, kiss,” I ordered, picking my moment correctly to press for more. Penny, ever the obedient little model, didn’t even consider before shifting her position and capturing Nancy’s lips with an aggressive assault. </p><p>“You can stop when you feel you can’t handle it anymore,” I said before Nancy could react, which, once again, worked just as excellently to prevent any negative reaction Nancy might have. </p><p>I just pulled back, enjoying — and recording — the sight of Penny’s tongue slipping into her opponent’s mouth in a clumsy aggressiveness. And Nancy was too competitive to ever reject such an assault, her tongue counter-attacking mercilessly. </p><p>Their breath started to fasten as the realization of what they were doing started to sink in, but neither was in a mood to stop, one out of obedience, the other out of competitiveness, even as the tension slowly reached a level of a time bomb, ticking ominously. </p><p>I stood on the side, my camera working repeatedly, recording every delicious hint of their shifting expressions, their tits pressing together to create a sight of a masterpiece… </p><p>“That should be enough, girls. Any more, and we will be late,” I said. The way they jerked back, quick, relieved, and more than a bit aroused, was delicious. </p><p>I said nothing else, letting an uncomfortable silence stretch into the opening, even when I freed Nancy’s wrists, and watched the girls put their clothes back on and fix their make-up, deliciously silent. </p><p>A silence that stretched for the next several hours, as we drove the convention center, slowly transforming into sexual tension and frustration, mixed with some pure jealousy and other complicated stuff that grew between them. </p><p>And when the convention actually started, that tension turned into an excellent thing to draw people to draw our stand. Their interaction was tinged with a growing tension, which worked wonders to draw a constant crowd of horny boys around our stand. </p><p>With me actually intimidating any boy that didn’t buy a book from loitering around, the books sold with a great speed, without even bothering to offer the bonus set of tasteful pictures. Though, considering the fun we had taking those, it was hardly a waste of time. </p><p>And Nancy could always use them as marketing material. </p><p>Instead, I offered them to take a picture of them with the girls, charging extra for each photo. They weren’t very much interested in the quality of the photos, but with selfies not allowed, it worked wonders to create an extra revenue channel. </p><p>When the convention finally ended, we had no more books, and were completely exhausted. However, the thick wad of cash in my pocket was more than enough to compensate for that change. Nancy was naturally smiling hard, happy with her first great success as a writer, selling out a thousand physical copies in one day. </p><p>“Damn, do you girls feel exhausted as well?”  I said, earning matching nods. Amusingly, despite posing together all day — or maybe, because of it — the tension was still thick between them. </p><p>And I had no intention of missing the great opportunity it presented. </p><p>“Driving all the way back will be hard,” I said. “Why don’t we stay here for the night, and we can drive back tomorrow.” </p><p>“We can’t,” Nancy answered, smart enough to realize my objective, but lacking the confidence to argue against it directly. “All the decent motels are filled with people that came for the convention. And I prefer not to sleep in a garbage dump.”  </p><p>Unfortunately for her, that was something I had prepared for, as I definitely didn’t want to sleep in a garbage dump as well. “Luckily for you, you don’t have to,” I said with a smirk. “I have some contacts with the city, and they arranged a room at the Hill.” The Hill was the most expensive hotel in the town. </p><p>Luckily, I still had a lot of reward points from my glory days. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Realizing that the mysterious Phoenix lady was searching for the same little artifact the Queen was searching for was a dangerous proposition. Standing in the bullseye of a mysterious entity that radiated magic even as she stood was hardly the best news. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the worst news either. Possessing their objective meant that I could control their progress. Especially since Lancelot, thanks to his excessive desire for glory, decided to hide some very important details from her, which allowed me a great deal of freedom in determining my strategy. </p><p>And as I watched Lancelot desperately explain his contributions while the Phoenix looked down at her dismissively, I came to a decision. </p><p>A reckless one, one that would have been called a stupid plan by most people. </p><p>I was going to bargain directly with the mysterious Phoenix. </p><p>There was no doubt that it was a risky decision, one that run against my natural instincts of minimizing the risks. Trying to bargain with a completely unknown agent was a dangerous affair, especially one that eclipsed me in power significantly. </p><p>Unfortunately, risky didn’t mean unnecessary. </p><p>It was one thing most people misunderstood about the nature of the risk, that it needed to be minimized all the time. Sometimes, the situation moved too fast, too unpredictably, that it required a reckless leap for even a hope of maintaining a semblance of control over the situation. </p><p>The appearance of two mysterious magical entities, both clearly stronger than the combination of Dark Families and the Empire, more than enough to qualify as a situation moving quickly, forcing me to pick a side — to steal some of their speed of course, as my loyalty was not for sale. </p><p>It was reserved for personal use only. </p><p>Unlike Lancelot, who finished his explanation why despite failing to find the location of the core, he had displayed a great deal of heroism, an expression reminding me of an enthusiastic puppy. He clearly had no problem changing his loyalty because of a sudden change of affection — making his earlier monologue to Isolde about his so-called lack of reward misleading at best. </p><p>Like I needed a reason not to like the blond asshole. </p><p>Clearly, my dismissal was shared by the Phoenix lady, because the only thing Lancelot earned was a barely dismissive wave of a hand, though if Lancelot’s wide smirk was any indicator, he failed to read that detail particularly. “All I hear is excuses. Go and find it,” she ordered, going as far as casting a silencing spell on Lancelot when he tried to argue. </p><p>Only then, he realized that his charm wasn’t working the way he was used to. His frustration at women suddenly not falling to their feet just because of hero status was amusing — not that he knew what to do when the women showed any interest in the first place, considering their lack of experience before I decided to help them with that particular deficiency. </p><p>Lancelot turned to leave, while the phoenix turned to Emma. “You know your next mission as well. Make sure you plant the runes to the locations on the map,” she said as a map floated toward Emma. At a glance, I was able to recognize the general layout of the Mage Guild, but before I could get a better look, Emma folded the map and left, Lancelot following with a blank expression. </p><p>Leaving me alone with the Phoenix lady. </p><p>“Is this a private party, or anyone could join?” I said as I stepped out of the shadows, dispelling the magic that was hiding me even as I put a wide smirk on my face, doing my best to exude confidence. </p><p>Her reaction was interesting. </p><p>Her wings of flame flared, radiating magic enough to drown a weaker man, forcing me to rely on the shield’s effect to look unaffected. Still, despite her initial reaction, she continued to sit, looking dismissive, like everything was under her control. </p><p>A reaction that didn’t surprise me considering what I was able to read about her personality until the moment. </p><p>The number of constructs meant that she had access to great riches, and her magical power turned her into a solo weapon of mass destruction, but despite her powers, I wasn’t desperate, because of three great factors. </p><p>She was spoiled, alone, and clearly in a great hurry. </p><p>Her spoiled nature was obvious from the way she spoke, carelessly treating Lancelot and Emma, two assets she had acquired just a day ago, an attitude that wasn’t calculated. It reeked of entitlement, the kind that only occurred when someone had servants around following every little order since their childhood. It was an attitude I had often observed in some of the more annoying scions of Dark Families. </p><p>She was alone, because the walk around her base revealed an endless amount of constructs — which was clearly something more attainable for someone in her status and power — but no servants, no warriors, no guard. With her personality, if she had others around, she would have used them as a guard. </p><p>Most importantly, she was clearly in a great hurry. Not just because she had forced Emma and Lancelot to act at a speed that would risk their mission — which could be easily dismissed as bad strategic awareness — but because she had acted herself, despite the clear distaste she felt dressing as a servant. </p><p>For someone as spoiled as her to act, there was clearly some great urgency forcing her. </p><p>Though, one negative thing about her poor personality was that I had no idea about what I was supposed to read into her hurry. It was clearly important to her, but the implications of my situation were a complete mystery. </p><p>All that analysis made my move less of a great disaster, and more of a measured push, like a gambler trying to turn the game into a well-timed gamble. It still had the risk of turning into a total disaster, but it gave me a good chance to climb up. </p><p>And her reaction, still on her seat, just radiating a threatening amount of magic, confirmed that my choice wasn’t horrible. </p><p>“Who are you?” she asked in a calm tone, a tone I might have respected as great composure if it wasn’t its dismissive nature of her tone. Apparently, she wasn’t impressed by my sudden appearance. </p><p>It was a difficult question. For a moment, I was tempted to pull the same merchant trick I had pulled against the Queen. Unfortunately, with the level of dismissiveness she displayed toward Lancelot and Emma, I had a feeling that, if I dared to declare myself as a mysterious merchant, I would receive a fireball in response. </p><p>Under the circumstances, honesty was a very good option. </p><p>“I’m the King that was supposed to be dead, your Highness,” I said. Honesty was a very good option. </p><p>But not the best one. </p><p>Not to mention, it wasn’t even too far from the truth, at least for a given value of it. After all, I was regularly having sex with the queen and telling her what to do. I even had some plans to fund the treasury. It should count for something, right?</p><p>“Isn’t the king supposed to be dead?” she asked, though clearly dismissive. </p><p>“It is what I wanted others to believe,” I explained. “After some mysterious force started sabotaging my throne room with their mysterious magic, I decided that the best thing to do was to keep a low profile.” It was a good explanation, not just because it explained the sudden disappearance, but also automatically put me in opposition to her enemies. </p><p>“So, you’re a coward,” she said dismissively. </p><p>“If you wish to call it that, your Highness,” I said, realizing she had missed the nuance I was trying to sell her. She was more lacking in political awareness than I had been expecting. </p><p>“Unfortunately, courage is the domain of the strong and the dead. I don’t belong to the first group, and I have no plans to join the second one. But at least, locked between two great powers, I know who to serve.” </p><p>Even as I said that statement, my mind was working with great speed, trying to piece together every single piece of information I was able to piece together during the last few days. </p><p>She looked at me the same dismissive gaze she threw to Lancelot, but the way her tenseness drained — which was limited in the first place — shocked me. She clearly accepted my story at the face value. </p><p>Maybe I underestimated just how spoiled she was. </p><p>“What can you offer me?” she asked, not even asking me any follow-up questions about my intent to serve. </p><p>“I can offer you information, like Lancelot was pretending to do by telling lies.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” she said, the flames on her back getting higher.</p><p> “He doesn’t know where the Eternal Core is, and he’s just using some clues provided by the Dark Lord they had managed to capture a couple months ago.” </p><p>“And how do you know that?” </p><p>“My secret hideout is quite close to his cell, and we managed to build a rapport,” I said, quick to create yet another imaginary connection. “He told me that he had no intention of giving them the location, and even if he did, they had no way of acquiring it. It’s deep in the dark lands.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” she said, leaning forward, but I didn’t miss her sudden tenseness, the first fearful reaction since I had entered. “Where?” </p><p>Her tenseness surprised me. It was the first sign of panic she had displayed. Combined with her lack of support despite the existence of a Dark Family that literally worships the Phoenixes, I decided to take another risk. </p><p>“It’s very smart, actually. He apparently hid under the base of one of his rival Dark Families, Fyre Eternus.” </p><p>“No!” she gasped in shock, the flame burning even more, covering her body. Power radiated endlessly from her, giving me a very uncomfortable boner in the process. </p><p>I had a certain preference toward dangerous women, and she was the most dangerous one I had the pleasure of meeting for a long while. </p><p>“Tell me it’s well hidden!” she ordered. </p><p>“Don’t worry, your highness, no one other than you even know it’s even there. He’s good at hiding stuff.” </p><p>“Good,” she said, her tone getting calmer in the process. </p><p>Meanwhile, I was trying to decide what to do next. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The implied mention of other nobles might have triggered her jealousy, but since that jealousy combined with her hero worship reflected in a very enjoyable manner, I wasn’t particularly beat up about it. “Actually, your merchant identity will help me even more. I need you to arrange a voyage to Egypt for me.” </p><p>“Egypt, why?” she gasped in shock. Understandable, as it was hardly the easiest journey imaginable, nor Egypt was the safest location to visit. </p><p>A lot of that was about the complicated nature of its political standing. Technically, it was a subordinate kingdom, but between centuries, its effective status bounced between being a literal province and a competing kingdom, and the constant power struggle between the Eastern Empire and the Western Republic, with constant switches of the mastery, was hardly something that would make it any easier. </p><p>Currently, the spectrum was closer to independence, with a generous dash of ongoing rebellion, making it a difficult location to travel as a Roman citizen, and even more challenging for a tribal barbarian. </p><p>“I’m starting to suspect that the thing I’m looking for might not be in Rome,” I said, deflecting the question, my fingers massaging her inner thighs making wonders to prevent her desire to follow up. “But there are some clues pointing to Egypt. I might need to commit to an emergency journey there, and having one prepared wouldn’t be too difficult.” </p><p>“It’s not something that could be put together in a day or two, not without raising suspicion. And I’m not sure I can afford it without other investors.” </p><p>“Why, it’s just a ship?” </p><p>“No, with the number of the pirates spawning, anything less than a fleet has no chance of going forward.” </p><p>I smirked. “Don’t worry about that, with me on board, there will be no problem.” </p><p>“Are you sure? Some pirates actually have mages on board, and even if they didn’t, fighting against several ships might be too difficult.“ </p><p>“Don’t worry your pretty head about that. I just need you to arrange a skilled captain with flexible timing and a speedy ship. As long as you can handle that in a few weeks, it would be enough for me.” </p><p>“I can easily arrange a ship in less than a week, but are you sure—“ she tried to continue, only to be silenced by my finger on her beautiful lips. </p><p>“Don’t worry your pretty head about that,” I said even as I pushed my hands under her dress. “But are sure you can afford even one ship. With this meeting, and your residence, you had a lot of expenses. The items I gave to you must be near depletion. Should I arrange something for you?” I asked. </p><p>“No need,” she said, though her blush suggested there was an interesting story behind that. </p><p>“Oh, really. That quick. Don’t tell me the magical ingredients I have given you sold for even more than I had been expecting.” </p><p>“Not that. I might … have made a few bets,” she murmured, her hesitance showing exactly who was the target of said bet. Not that I had problems with it. Using the extra knowledge for betting was just the smart thing to do. </p><p>“Oh, daring to bet on your savior,” I growled into her ear playfully even as my hands moved high, freeing her body from the oppressive wrapping of her beautiful dress. “That deserves a punishment!” </p><p>Theodora was shocked at my sudden move, finding herself without her dress without a warning. And considering she lacked any kind of lingerie underneath, leaving her body completely bare, her shock was understandable. </p><p>However, her shock didn’t mean she tried to pull away from my lap once she processed her nakedness. Her gaze already shining with surrender, it wasn’t shocking. Even when it contrasted with her true identity — while she hadn’t admitted yet, clearly related to some kind of high noble in Constantinople. </p><p>Of course, she wasn’t the only high noble that tasted the benefits of my attention. Both Olivia and Atia were high nobles, belonging to Patrician families with several living ex-Consuls. Even one of the two reigning Consuls was an uncle of Atia, highlighting her position even more. Even if Theodora was back in Constantinople, her position would be lower than Atia, likely significantly so. </p><p>However, there was a big difference. For Olivia and Atia, I was nothing more than a slave, marking me a temporary fun dalliance, a more intimate kind of entertainment than my fights in Colosseum. </p><p>My relationship with Theodora was completely different, something she was very much aware of if the way she trembled in my lap in excitement was any indicator. </p><p>While Theodora didn’t know my true identity and the full extent of my power — a trust that she was yet to earn — she was aware that both my status as a slave was a farce, and I was actually a competent mage, which was something that made me someone worthy of note regardless of my place of birth and power. </p><p>Surrendering to me despite that awareness, especially when she deliberately cut herself from her own source of power, was a tacit surrender. Though, considering she owed me her freedom and her current relative comfort if not her life, maybe it was understandable. </p><p>“So, about your punishment,” I said with a soft whisper, caressing her naked leg even as her gaze widened, anticipation growing wide. Her expression alone told me that she had spent more than one night dreaming about the moment we almost shared back in the slaver’s tent. </p><p>“Yes,” she gasped, surrendering readily under my gaze, shifting her position so that her legs were on both sides of me, her hands landing near my pants, ready to drag it down, waiting for my words. </p><p>Someone was enthusiastic. </p><p>Pity that I had a different idea on how to progress. I said nothing, deliberately delaying the order she was waiting for. I put my hands on her shoulder, caressing her waist and the small of her back almost absentmindedly. “On second thought, maybe I should forgive you. You haven’t earned that. Tell me about the merchant connections you have established.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” she stammered, panting softly. “Maybe…” </p><p>“Of course I am,” I said with a chuckle. “Tell me.” </p><p>She started explaining, while I kept her on my lap, slowly caressing her body, but limiting myself to her thighs, back, and neck. Anywhere that was a lesser priority in terms of sexiness, but still sensitive enough to drive her arousal to the next level. </p><p>And it worked just as I hoped. She started shuffling in her seat — which was my lap — which was enough to show her growing desire and the corresponding discomfort even without her fingers tightening around my shoulders. </p><p>To her credit, despite that, she continued to explain the details of her achievements. And her achievements were quite a bit more than I expected. She already had dozens of people hired, working for her, the organization completed, permits acquired, and the necessary bribes paid. </p><p>She was even able to select several products to focus on, with a detailed explanation for each, including their economic potential, the risk involved, the potential market. She even went to the level they were prioritized by existing stronger trading organizations to make sure it wouldn’t encroach on her business. </p><p>Overall, it was a level of meticulousness I didn’t expect from a high noble about trading, a task that was usually dismissed as a worthless activity worthy only for low-class people. </p><p>So much that she actually deserved a reward. Though not immediately, as the way she was squirming on my lap desperately, too shy to actually ask me to go forward or take initiative to go her own despite her nakedness. </p><p>I continued to listen while she continued to explain, going deeper into the details of her organization, each more interesting than last, almost as much as her beautiful naked body. I followed up with questions about the locations of her businesses and her residence, which she explained enthusiastically. </p><p>That part was not empty talk. With my identity as a gladiator in the middle of a turf war, I was at risk even before adding my aggressive invasions of Patrician houses — and their daughters — making the situation even more dangerous. </p><p>Having a safe house I could use in case of an unforeseen emergency was not a bad idea. </p><p>Meanwhile, her explanation continued. Her legs started to tighten helplessly, to a level of distracting me from her explanation. </p><p>Extending her sweet torture even more was tempting, but I decided against it. First, she had deserved her reward. Also, torturing her silently too long was suspicious considering the function of the room. No one was listening directly — something I made sure by repeatedly checking it magically — but that didn’t mean no one was near enough to hear an explosive moan of pleasure. </p><p>And no moans were bad, not only for my reputation, but also for keeping the suspicions of my so-called owners at bay. </p><p>“I was wrong to think you deserved a punishment,” I whispered into her ear, and she tensed, worse than my extended teasing had achieved, a tenseness that only disappeared when I finished my statement, “you deserve a reward.” </p><p>Just like that, her fears disappeared, though, admittedly, it might be less about the impact of my words, and more about my fingers finally touching her core, caressing gently. </p><p>She licked her lips even as she tried to contain her moan, my fingers dancing over her most sensitive spot, each second driving her pleasure deeper. I wondered just how long she might have resisted the call of the pleasure. </p><p>Too bad I lacked the time to explore that without making my so-called owners suspicious. “We need to make sure you look reasonably pleasured. Otherwise, my boss might be suspicious. Are you willing to make that great sacrifice?” </p><p>“I am,” she gasped immediately. </p><p>I pulled my fingers away, but before she could even show a hint of disappointment, I pushed her down, forcing her on her knees. I admired the sight of her lithe, fit body. The way she parted her hips readily, begging for my invasion with her delicious gasps. </p><p>And I had no problem delivering that invasion. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Kevin was quick to start practice passes with his receivers, trying to make sure they had a rudimentary timing in place. Admittedly, he wasn’t half bad, and with each pass, he was getting more and more excited, sold in his victory. </p><p>Meanwhile, the atmosphere was much tenser on our side, even as Thad run through the tactics. Though, I had to admit, despite the initial impression a tall, loud, and muscular guy might generate, Thad was shockingly careful when it came to tactics. </p><p>Though, despite the detailed explanation, he wasn’t exactly filled with confidence.  “Which one of you wants to go first?” he said, doing his best to keep a positive attitude. </p><p>I wasn’t impressed, but the same didn’t apply to my solo teammate. “I do,” he said even as he took a step forward. Though, if I was able to read his enthusiasm correctly, he was more interested in the ticket for the party rather than helping out Thad. </p><p>He glared at me aggressively, ready to fight for the position. </p><p>“You’re the cornerback, you’ll be faster, go ahead,” I said with a nod, giving the initiative, though it was what I preferred in the first place. </p><p>I wanted to see how Kevin threw under pressure.  </p><p>Thad allowed us to watch Kevin throwing the last few practice passes to his receivers while adding some last-minute comments. “He’s not going to have a lot of variations to his routes with new receivers,” Thad explained after watching. “So he will avoid bullet passes to tight windows, relying on touch and lob. The same goes for passes over twenty yards. He won’t be able to time it. So, try to stick to your opponent close, and expect a hard break to the side somewhere between five to fifteen yards.” </p><p>I nodded as I listened, carefully watching Kevin’s throwing motion. Not just the trajectory of the ball, but the way his gaze lingered, the way he shifted his weight, and even the way his arm tensed whenever he tried a fake. </p><p>As much as I hated to admit, Kevin was a good quarterback, at least for the backup, though it was hard to truly say without the pressure from the defensive linemen trying to take off his head. The ball flew smoothly, to the target. </p><p>Thad let out a dismissive gasp whenever he threw a fancy pass comfortably, showing that he had shared my opinion about the low value of his performance without a defense trying to prevent him from succeeding. </p><p>I continued to watch carefully. </p><p>Not only the quarterback, but also the receivers, the way their arms moved, the angle of their bodies while they faked an attack, their hip twists, even the way their foot shifted slightly whenever they tried to have a break. </p><p>I had learned the art of observing in the streets, fighting with the other boys. And believe me, trying to read the movements of a drug-addled robber while he flipped his knife was much easier to read than a young boy trying to throw a ball with the perfect technique. </p><p>“Let’s begin,” said Kevin. “I can’t wait to have some fun with the Mustang.” </p><p>My unfortunate partner lined against one of the wide receivers — the best one as shown by the training — ready to launch. One of the other receivers took the position of the center, to snap the ball back. Without defensive linemen, to make it fair, we agreed to keep the time-limited to three seconds. </p><p>And then, we were ready to start. </p><p>Roughly, there were nine common routes for a receiver could take, two short, four mid, and three long routes, however, in our case, most of them were irrelevant. The long routes were certainly not valid due to receivers’ inexperience working with this particular quarterback, and similarly, out and comeback routes, which required the receiver to run about ten yards before turning toward the sidelines aggressively, was also unlikely, because it required the receiver to run away from the quarterback, making the pass more difficult to time. </p><p>It essentially left four routes to worry about, flat, which was a straight short cut to the sidelines after around five yards, slant, which was an angled cut to the inside, usually around thirty degrees, allowing the receiver to get the ball around the eight-yard mark. </p><p>There was also a curl, in which the receiver had to run ten yards before making an angled turn inside, but unlike slant, moving closer to the quarterback rather than away. Then, there was the dig route, running ten yards before making a straight ninety-degree turn inside, running parallel, giving the quarterback the longest window. </p><p>Even among the four, I expected slant and dig routes to dominate their choices, because they were by far the easiest passes to achieve in one-on-one practice — unlike the game, where another linebacker or safety would move down to assist if the receiver ran too far away from its initial location.</p><p>People underestimate just how much thought goes for every little play. A receiver-corner competition might look like a pure physical competition, but it was not. It was a real-time strategic challenge. </p><p>Less complicated than chess, naturally, but the speed of the action and the randomness due to skill were more than enough to compensate for the relative simplicity. A defender had to read the foot placement of the receiver, the way his center of weight shifted, his hips, trying to read the direction, while making sure it wasn’t just a feint but the actual direction. And even then, half a second of a delay was enough to turn a successful attempt into failure. </p><p>However, not everyone approached the game with the same diligence, and my teammate seemed to be one of them. He failed to read the necessary details, so even as he managed to stay in front of the receiver for the first eight yards comfortably, displaying that his physical capabilities were superior.  </p><p>Unfortunately, when the receiver faked an out route, he committed too hard, trying to impress Thad by trying to get an interception rather than just blocking the pass — which, under the rules of our current game, would count for more. </p><p>It would have been good, but when the receiver instead cut into a dig route, he was already two steps behind. And when a quick pass was concerned, there was no difference between two steps and eternity. A soft touch pass, and the offense scored the first point. </p><p>“Good job,” said Kevin, but his gaze was already on Thad. “Let’s see what our linebacker would do.” </p><p>His tone lacked recognition. He didn’t even remember me from the tournament, when he memorably egged the tournament building. </p><p>There wasn’t a guy more deserving of the lesson I was about to deliver. </p><p>My opponent lined against me. I lined half a step outside what I was supposed to do, making an inside route almost trivial. Despite the helmet limiting my field of view, I could see Thad shaking his head in disappointment, ready to write it off the attempt. </p><p>I tensed, like I had just realized my big mistake. Kevin called for the ball, trying not to give me a chance to recover my stance. The receiver was already leaning for a slant route at the first step, preparing himself for a showy catch. </p><p>Rather than trying to stay close to him, I took a large step forward just as the ball was about to leave the fingers of the quarterback, which, under normal conditions, would have been a horrible, choice. Any decent quarterback would have faked a throw while the receiver changed the direction, achieving a simple score. </p><p>Pity that neither had been expecting such a shift, resulting in an interception. “You need to be more careful with the ball, Karl,” I said, using a wrong name just to add some insult to the injury.</p><p>The gasp of anger he let out was spectacular. I smirked as I flicked the ball to the receiver who had been acting as the center, leaving my place to my teammate. </p><p>“Not bad, newbie,” said Thad, though unlike what I was expecting, he didn’t cheer. He just nodded seriously. </p><p>“Lucky move,” Kevin growled, not appreciating my success. Admittedly, his frustration was justified. Failing in such a spectacular way in such a simple exercise, against a newbie trying to get into practice team… If it was a simple incomplete, it wouldn’t have mattered. </p><p>An interception, however, was a completely different beast. And in a short route, against a newbie… </p><p>It was definitely humiliating. Enough to receive some cheers from the defensive squad. </p><p>“If you say so,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>“Hey, show a bit more enthusiasm,” Thad said, though rather than the explosive laugh I expected, he smiled, putting his hand on my shoulder.</p><p>I didn’t get annoyed by the sudden change of attitude. Football was a results-driven sport.  Success earned appreciation, no matter what form, and for defense, the interception was the second most glorious achievement, second only to a strip-sack, stealing the ball, with the delicious addition of smashing the other quarterback to the ground. </p><p>I could have simply accepted the compliment, which was the smartest, but only if my aim wasn’t to annoy Kevin even more. “Why should I?” I said, trying to sound genuinely confused. “Isn’t he just the backup quarterback? What’s there to be proud?” </p><p>Thad’s voracious laughter exploded at the same as Kevin’s nasty curse. He snarled, and I smirked, happy with his failure. </p><p>Just because I liked football didn’t mean I had to like every player, especially annoying assholes who thought egging a chess tournament was the peak of wit. </p><p> And it wasn’t sheer enjoyment that was driving my actions. The quarterback was like a general, all about timing, technique, and calm decision-making. If there was one thing that never worked for a quarterback, it was uncontrolled anger. </p><p>This time, the cornerback was successful in reading the route, sticking close to him successfully. </p><p>It was a difficult pass, but definitely not hopeless. However, in his anger, Kevin threw the ball harder than necessary, which bounced off the hands of a receiver. </p><p>“You see, nothing to be proud of,” I said to Thad like it was a given, which evoked the same reaction. A curse from Kevin, and a burst of laughter from Thad. </p><p>Sometimes, I could be a vicious bastard. </p><p>I positioned in front of the receiver, tense enough to explode. My new opponent run the same slant route, but this time, I let the hands of the receiver touch the ball before I tackled him. Not full force, which was rarely the smartest thing during practice, but still hard enough to make the receiver yelp in shock, not expecting it to get physical. </p><p>And when he turned to argue, I hit him with a dark smirk, the kind that actually tapped into the benefits of the Intimidation Trait. After painful collusion, the Trait worked even better than I expected. </p><p>He wisely held his tongue, and I turned back to Thad. </p><p>“Damn boy, that was vicious,” he said, before his smirk widened. “I like it!”</p><p>I shrugged, happy with the benefits of the Intimidation skill. Considering I actually applied intimidation as an integral part of my chess strategy, it would be pretty ridiculous not to do so against people I was actually allowed to hit with flying tackles. </p><p>Pity my other two Traits were chess-only, preventing them from being useful under the circumstances. </p><p>In the next round against the other defender, Kevin proved that his position as the backup quarterback was not entirely without merit, and actually managed to slip a good pass in a dig route despite the tight window. Unlike me, the cornerback didn’t try to tackle the opponent to the ground. </p><p>It was my turn again. This time, I stood directly in front of my opponent, which made it hard for him to reach for any kind of mid-range route due to physical contest. </p><p>He wasn’t the one that I hit earlier, but he had been watching it. For a properly conditioned player, that tackle was nothing, but against practice squad candidates that hadn’t played for a couple of years, it was much more intimidating. </p><p>And sometimes, the anticipation of pain was even worse than the pain itself, glaring him hard enough to scare him further. </p><p>I really loved the Intimidation Trait.</p><p>I stuck close, he failed to reach a ball he could have caught easily. </p><p>However, interestingly, when I turned to talk with Thad, he was not in his place. I looked around, and found him talking with the defensive coach… </p><p>An interesting choice, considering he had a car riding on the bet.</p>",

    "content": "<p>However, how to progress to the next step depended on the fate of the battle on the surface. </p><p>I turned my attention to the detection wards even as I continued to heal her, trying to understand the changes. The battle was still ongoing, but with a lower intensity. </p><p>The group of three tried to retreat, the group of five followed after them, and the berserk one split his attention between the two groups. With that, they moved away, leaving the fake body on the ground without even bothering to check closer, taking its fate as given.</p><p>Interesting development after putting all that effort to defeat her. </p><p>With them drifting away, but the immediate danger was gone. But I didn’t hurry up to share that nugget with my guest. </p><p>“Well, it had been a good talk, but they discovered the tunnel and coming down. And I’m exhausted healing you. I should be going. Best luck to you,” I said as I stood up, even taking a step toward the tunnel. </p><p>The tunnel was too small to contain her. I wanted to see what she would do under the risk of being left to her devices. </p><p>‘Wait!’ she wrote. ‘Are you going to abandon me?’</p><p>“I don’t want to,” I said, stretching my acting capabilities to the limit to actually look sad. “However, healing you exhausted me. And you can’t exactly follow me through the tunnel, can you,” I added, pointing at the tunnel that was barely enough large enough for her head. </p><p>‘Still, you can’t!’ she wrote. </p><p>“I don’t want to, but after all that healing, I’m hardly at a point of joining another battle,” I said, having no problem misleading her about my mana capacity. “Too bad you’re too big to follow me,” I said. </p><p>There was a point to the dilemma I was forcing her. The way she had explained her own situation, carefully skirting over the reason for her presence, both in terms of her capture by the undead, and her objectives in the Mount Dread, was enough to show that she had a good idea about the value of information. </p><p>I was trying to goad her into offering something valuable, enough to ‘convince’ me to rework the tunnels, enough to allow her to pass. I could have directly blackmailed her for it, of course, but that would set a tone I wanted to avoid.  </p><p>She didn’t say anything for a moment, before gesturing me to stop, her pasture determined. I expected her to offer a bargain. ‘Turn your back, and don’t look,’ she said instead. </p><p>I followed her order, and turned my back, my eyes closed. Amusingly, she thought that it would actually prevent me from watching her in a room covered with my own runes. </p><p>With my back turned to the dragon, I stretched my magic to see what was going on behind me. Partially because, even after saving her life twice, I didn’t trust her enough to ignore the flare of magic that was going behind me. </p><p>Although, that wasn’t the full explanation. There were many ways of detecting the nature of magic that was going behind me. Direct visual confirmation was hardly required. </p><p>My instincts — the same instincts that were telling me that the dragon was female despite having no real reason to think so — poked me to watch it to catch a show. </p><p>I watched as her magic covered her skin, turning her into a glowing silhouette of a dragon, before she started shrinking. It was not a spell I recognized. I forced my examination ability, trying to get a feel for the mana pattern, trying to understand what was the spell she was using. </p><p>It was certainly not elemental, and despite the glow it created, it wasn’t light magic. Despite the way her body shrinking with great speed, it wasn’t a Biomancy spell either. Not even close. I stretched my mana, letting it touch the glowing aftermath, trying to get a better feel. </p><p>Only to realize it wasn’t a spell at all. It was hard to explain as I didn’t fully understand what was going on. The closest I could categorize was a healing spell, and that was only because of the effect, rather than the working principles. She was using the unaltered nature of her magic to pull her real form.</p><p>Weirdly, that didn’t make her dragon form any less real. The simplest analogy was like flipping a coin. The faces were different, but it was still the same object. </p><p>However, I abandoned that trail of thought when the glow abated, and revealed her other form. A regal beauty that would have fit perfectly in any noble event if it wasn’t for her bright, emerald green hair. Her eyes matched the same emerald tone. Not her irises, but all of her eyes, glowing with an emerald glow, giving her an exotic aura. </p><p>And her nakedness, revealing a short yet deliciously curvy frame. Her hips were wide, almost to the point of being termed excessive if it wasn’t for their glorious perfection, enough to reveal her extraordinary origins. Unfortunately, the treasure between those hips was hidden due to the way she had positioned her legs. </p><p>I could have changed the vantage point of my magical observation, but I let it slide. It was good to have mysteries. Instead, I let my attention wander upward, her smooth and inviting stomach at first, followed by equally huge breasts that dangled on the edge of being too big on her small frame, yet somehow, looked deliciously sexy instead. </p><p>Unfortunately, that nakedness didn’t last long, as she easily conjured a spectacular dress to cover her nakedness. However, the dress wasn’t the first thing she conjured. </p><p>She first conjured a pair of elegant shoes, ones with excessive heels, adding almost four inches to her height before she conjured her dress. </p><p>She said something which I failed to understand. “You have to use my language,” I said. “I have learned that language from the book, and unfortunately, they don’t come with a pronunciation guide.” </p><p>The way she sighed somewhat reminded me of Cornelia, dismissive of anything she saw under her rightful prestige. “You can turn again,” she said, her accent noticeable enough to echo her previous words. </p><p>I did so, only to meet with her expression shifting expression, a smugness that expected a big reaction from me — though the ease I could read her expression was interesting. It meant that not only she shared the classical human mannerisms in this form, but also she had little experience in controlling them. </p><p>I decided to tease her a bit, and the great care she had put in conjuring these elevated shoes before she even conjured a dress for herself gave me the perfect excuse to do so. “You’re a bit short for a dragon, aren’t you?” </p><p>And just like that, her smug expression shattered, replaced by pure fury. “How dare you!’ she exclaimed, magic already gathering in her hand. </p><p>“You know the wards that preventing their detection has a limit, right?” I said with a dismissive tone, like I didn’t even care about her growing attack. It was deliberate, and not just to see her cute expression. If she couldn’t control her anger in such a situation, it meant that I needed to handle her more like a hostage than a partner of opportunity. </p><p>Luckily, she seemed to have some self-preservation, as her magic dispelled quickly, replacing itself with an angry stamping of her foot instead, which hardly made me take her more seriously. “Don’t call me short!” she threatened, her tone carrying the echo of a growl. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I took several steps forward, until I stood in front of her. She tensed, expecting an attack. Instead, I put my hand on my shoulder, before dragging it toward her, showing that she was not able to reach my shoulder despite her shoes. “I beg your pardon, your dragoness, you’re definitely taller than me.” </p><p>Her furious shriek was amusing enough to compensate for the sudden punch I received in my stomach, throwing me back several feet — though mostly because I didn’t bother to resist. </p><p>[-46 HP]</p><p>I received the blow to test her further. And despite the pain it created, I could see that she actually held herself back and didn’t hit as hard as she could manage. </p><p>“You pack quite a punch for such a … tall person,” I said, with no intention of relenting. This time, it was purely to tease her, with no intention of assessing her. She didn’t answer, but the way she bit her lips as she raised her hand suggested that I might have pushed her as much as I could manage before she exploded completely. “We need to move, before our friends arrive,” I said. </p><p>“Do you expect me to crawl away like a rat just because of some rabble?” she said as she looked at the tunnel in distaste. But before I could point out that she was free to stay here and wait for the arrival of the enemy, she was already walking toward the tunnel. </p><p>Clearly, her pride wasn’t important enough to risk her survival. Not that I was surprised by it, as she had been against using the tunnels, she wouldn’t have transformed to her human form in the first place. </p><p>I shrugged. “Of course not, you’re a great, prideful dragon. The last thing I expect you to escape.” I smirked. “Feel free to stay and deal with that rabble,” I said with a widening smirk. </p><p>Her frustrated expression was simply beautiful. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6226 / 6324 Mana: 6831 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was curious about the sudden and unbidden transformation in one of my opponents. It wasn’t the first time I noticed that transformation, but the other times, I was only able to observe it through the passive detection ward, making me miss the details. </p><p>It was the first time I watched the process directly, not that it made the mystery any easier to solve. </p><p>There were no spells targeting him, no great trap, nothing. One moment, he was fighting together with his allies. A second later, they lost all reason to the point of targeting allies and enemies without rhyme and reason, with no sense of self-preservation to limit them. And it wasn’t just an alignment shift. They were literally fighting on reflex, with no actual objective. </p><p>However, with reinforcements on their way, I didn’t have a lot of time to waste, certainly not enough for experimentation. </p><p>I needed to save my damsel, and escape. </p><p>The incompetence of my enemies came useful at that moment, especially when three unskilled mages were pushing as much mana they could to their spells in a desperate attempt to put some distance between themselves and a berserk warrior. </p><p>Unfortunately, with their lack of skill, they might as well trying to use clouds as a shield. </p><p>Then, something even worse happened. Their spells entangled, about to create a dangerous commotion that would likely kill all of them. </p><p>They should really thank me, I thought even as I stretched my mana and took control of their spell — conveniently, their combined mess of a spell going chaotic was an excellent way of hiding from the omnipresent detection ward. Barely for a few seconds. </p><p>That was all I needed. </p><p>First, I melded my mana and reached for the chaotic spell that was about to explode. Trying to steal control of an opponent’s spell was as dangerous as trying to grab the sword of a charging warrior. Luckily, it was considerably easier if the charging warrior was a three-year-old and barely able to lift the sword itself. </p><p>I didn’t suppress the spell, or make it even more destructive. I shaped its direction, targeting the dragon, and in the process, saving the lives of the three unfortunate guys trying to deal with the betrayal of their ally. </p><p>My aim wasn’t to kill the dragon, of course. The moment the spell hit against her already-damaged wards, threatening to demolish them completely. And my scaly acquaintance had no chance but put her full focus on maintaining the wards, even as the raging fires covered the full range of her defensive wards, scorching the mist completely.</p><p>And conveniently, blocking both magical and visual detection. </p><p>Focused on her task, the dragon didn’t notice the net flying toward her until it wrapped around her completely and turned her into an unlucky critter. </p><p>A shocked roar escaped her mouth, but that was all she could have done with the net suppressing her mana. Exhausted with her desperate defense, it was much easier than I expected. </p><p>Of course, that wasn’t the extent of my tricks. I pressed my hand on a large piece of rock, and rapidly transformed it into a facsimile of a dragon that had been just burned under a deadly inferno, even using Biomancy to create some fake scales, burnt flesh, and cracked bones on the surface. </p><p>[-2352 Mana]</p><p>It wasn’t my best work. Not only materials were missing, but I only had a second to create a work of art - a macabre one. Still, it looked convincing enough to pass ordinary muster, with people distracted in their little game, and their out-of-control spell still hiding my presence.</p><p> Just as one lasting touch, I destabilized the defensive wards remaining in the area, the resulting explosion mixing into the blast of the chaotic inferno. </p><p>Then, I rushed back into the tunnel, triggering the runes I had inscribed along to collapse the tunnel and erase my path, dragging the huge net, along with my prey. </p><p>I was prepared to attack the dragon — non-lethally, enough to make her fall into her consciousness, just to make sure she didn’t make a commotion to destroy my attempts at hiding. Luckily, she turned out to be smart enough not to react when she had been saved from immediate mortal danger. </p><p>When I finally stopped at a hiding spot nearer the protective ward, supposed to work as a defensive structure, the dragon looked at me calmly, silent, even her breathing even. </p><p>“Long time no see,” I said with a smirk. Not a lot of time had passed since our last meeting, but it certainly had been a busy period, at least for me. And if the number of missing and damaged scales on her otherwise shiny emerald body was any indicator, it hadn’t exactly been a holiday for her. </p><p>She looked at me expectantly. Seeing she wasn’t about to lash out, I loosened the net around her and let her go. </p><p>Her wings opened and she took a threatening stance, like she was about to lash out. But her magic stayed calm. It was a smart move, she was posturing in a way that leveraged her physically-intimidating qualities perfectly, but without being overtly threatening. </p><p>She was trying to equalize the playing field. </p><p>Too bad she was trying to play the game of posturing against an expert. </p><p>I was the king of posturing. </p><p>I just smiled and sat down, a chair that might even be classified as a throne rose from the ground and met halfway. Another exaggerated move, telling her that I understood her move, but was not particularly impressed. </p><p>A dragon ducking her head shyly, realizing her trick had been seen through in a second, was an amusing sight. </p><p>“We can posture some more, or I can heal you while you tell me what’s happening here. Which one do you prefer?” I asked. </p><p>The way her threatening posture disappeared even as she stretched her front claw toward me was my answer. </p><p>I placed my hand on her scales, and sent a rush of healing energy into her body, healing the surface wounds, and even purging some leftover necrotic energy from the previous ritual in the process. </p><p>[-1032 Mana]</p><p>However, the healing only cured a portion of her wounds. She was in an even worse condition than I had expected. </p><p>Of course, even that surface-level healing wasn’t entirely altruistic. I was also using the opportunity to examine her soul space, or more accurately, where her soul space was supposed to be. </p><p>There was no soul space. Though, after the lengthy history lesson from the headmistress — along with the detailed assessment I had managed to give her during the transfer process — the lack of it wasn’t a shock. </p><p>For a moment, she was immobile, uncertain what to do. A metaphorical clock ticked in the corner, while the small cave I had carved with my magic was illuminated soft light of the glowing lights of the wall, shining beautifully on her emerald scales. </p><p>And since she seemed unwilling to start her story, I actually conjured a clock, ticking very pointedly. </p><p>The sigh of a dragon was an impressive show. But her apparent distaste didn’t stop her from explaining. Not by speaking, but once again by drawing glowing letters in the air with her claw, using the same ancient language she had used in our previous encounter. </p><p>Interestingly, she had no problem understanding my modern speech. </p><p>‘I was minding my business when suddenly, the Knights of the Eternal Vigil appeared, warding the whole mountain, locking me inside, before they opened many cages, filled with monsters,’ she wrote. </p><p>I just nodded, gesturing for her to continue like I was aware of that particular fact, barely holding back myself from calling her an idiot. </p><p>The fact that she was able to detect the cages meant that she was using magic even after the detection ward was established, because otherwise, with the domineeringly-thick mist of Mount Doom, directly seeing them was not an option. </p><p>However, it was interesting that she had mentioned the Eternals with their full, correct name, casually like they were already a known factor. However, the implications of her history knowledge weren’t as important as their immediate urgency. </p><p>“Do you have any idea why they are dropping those animals?” I asked even as I sent another wave of healing energies into her body. It helped to use the time more efficiently.  </p><p>[-213 Mana]</p><p>And if the healing energy was making her warm and comfortable, and more likely to slip something carelessly before she could realize, well, it must be a complete coincidence.  </p><p>‘Maybe training,’ she wrote. ‘They were definitely not as strong as they were supposed to be. Maybe this is the way they train their new members.’ </p><p>Another statement, that if honest, implied more about her lack of relative knowledge about the System in general. They certainly didn’t need to make such a huge commotion to train their new members, not when a few weeks of practice would teach them all they needed to know. </p><p>However, the sudden berserk state they seemed to be suffering was a more interesting aspect. I remembered the soul spaces of the three I had ambushed back in the town Titania was defending. In particular, the jagged, damaged state of their soul space, with skills and achievements pushed almost in a haphazard manner.  </p><p>Clearly, like me, they had a way of helping people to push through their level limit and level up at the same time. Considering the number of people that were flying on the surface, they clearly had a higher capacity in creating artificial high-leveled warriors. </p><p>Unlike mine, however, their approach clearly had some disadvantages. Maybe one of these side effects was a mindless berserk rage. </p><p>And if that was the case, it made sense for the Eternals to lock all of them in a huge ward, with a constant detection ward to monitor their movement just to make sure they didn’t leave behind a berserk warrior once they departed. </p><p>While I had dismissed their combative capability, it was only in comparison to my capabilities. It didn’t change the fact if let out, those men would turn into natural disasters, destroying towns and cities on their way, cutting their defenses like butter. </p><p>I didn’t bother explaining my chain of thought to my scaly friend, of course. “Probably training,” I said dismissively. </p><p>‘After that, I tried to run away and hide, but before I could create a hideout, they managed to use their ward to find my exact location an hour later, and started sieging me.’</p><p>I nodded even as I continued to heal her, my mind on how to handle the situation. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324 / 6324 Mana: 4231 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>There was a beautiful sense of domination coming from playing with a beautiful brunette girl with a tight body, especially when the said girl was not free to moan as she wished. </p><p>And Sarah was certainly not as free as she wished to moan as my fingers climbed upward her beautiful once again, this time even more threatening, considering their last task had been pulling down her panties, divesting her the only piece of protection that stood between her core and my naked touch, however insufficient would her soft lace panties would have been. </p><p>Her gaze bounced between me and Carrie, panic clear on her face. But that panic didn’t target me, at least not in the form of a request asking me to stop. I knew that, because even as she looked to her friend in a panic, her legs widened, allowing me better access. </p><p>I was tempted to push her down, especially since nothing prevented me from doing so. We still had several minutes before the food was properly cooked, giving us just enough time to have quick, explosive morning sex. </p><p>Pity I had to act like I was trying to hide from Carrie. </p><p>And, admittedly, watching Sarah’s attempts to give an aura of calmness — and fail it spectacularly. She was lucky she had a good friend, willing to act stupid deliberately to ignore her mistakes. </p><p>“Oh, where’s Chad?” Carrie suddenly asked, making Sarah yelp in shock. “Did you hit your foot again?” Carrie asked with a chuckle. </p><p>“Y-yes,” Sarah stammered. Answering had been more difficult than she had been expecting, because my fingers, in a complete coincidence, chose that moment to rush upward, caressing her wetness. </p><p>“Maybe another invisible coffee table?” Carrie asked mockingly, but Sarah ignored her joke directly, too focused on my treatment. “So, where’s Chad?” </p><p>“I’m down here, cleaning a wet spot,” I said with a chuckle even as I pushed my head under Sarah’s skirt, and used my tongue to caress her wetness. Since Sarah clearly was not in a mood to answer, I helped like the nice guy I was. </p><p>“Oh, make sure to clean completely. We don’t want a dangerously slippery situation,” Carrie answered, not bothering to hide her chuckle — or maybe trying and failing. Understandable. Sharing innuendos while her best friend was being pleasured behind the kitchen counter was a humorous situation. </p><p>In a very hot way. </p><p>I considered pulling back to make another joke, but the delicious taste that filled my mouth as my tongue danced around Sarah’s softness was enough to decide otherwise. </p><p>My fingers didn’t stay away, of course. They stayed on her thighs, caressing softly to make her feel pleasure even more, enjoying the softness of her toned legs in the process. </p><p>She shivered helplessly, a muffled moan occasionally escaping her mouth, helping me to imagine her desperately biting her lips. Carrie had mercy on her friends, and didn’t ask any more questions about the suspicious sounds she was making. </p><p>But delicious as her taste was, staying under her skirt to lick her was wasting the potential of the moment. It was why I stood up suddenly and leaned against her ass after pulling her skirt up. The fate of my towel made that move even more erotic than it had any right to be. “Oh, Carrie, do you want any cereal for the breakfast,” I asked even as I leaned against Sarah, my shaft lodged into Sarah’s tight ass. </p><p>“Let’s have it on the table just in case,” she answered. “Maybe I’ll crave it.” </p><p>Sarah didn’t say anything, too occupied by the way my shaft rubbed against her ass as I moved. Instead, she looked at me, and sent me a glare filled with arousal, though her crossed eyebrows implied that she might have intended that as a warning, before her body managed to hijack the message her mind was trying to send. </p><p>Her hips, rocking against my movement to maximize the impact, hardly helped her to give a clear message. </p><p>My hands landing on her waist, slipping under her blouse, hardly helped her to maintain control. As I continued to grind against her naked ass, I caressed her belly gently, before moving upward high enough to caress the underside of her bra. </p><p>“Chad,” she whispered in panic as she grabbed my wrists and pushed them down, afraid because my hands were too high. Enough to be seen by Carrie if she ever glanced to our way. </p><p>“Well, if you’re unhappy about it, why don’t you go down and pay me back for my services?” I offered her. I was ready to grab her shoulders and push her down to leave no doubt about what I was talking about, but that proved unnecessary, when she fell on her knees and turned to me, her lips already parted.</p><p>Someone was more enthusiastic for a taste than I had assumed. </p><p>As her lips wrapped around my girth, Carrie turned toward me, her enthusiasm about Sarah’s disappearance clear. “Oh, now Sarah is gone.” </p><p>“She’s down here, handling a problem she created,” I answered, which made Sarah quicken her service even more, before taking a break to let out a small chuckle, assuming Carrie was the target of my little innuendo, unaware she was the target. </p><p>I might have used the opportunity to tease Sarah a bit more, but Carrie chose that moment to join the game in a more direct manner. She sat on the dining table, her bathrobe wide open, giving me an excellent view of her naked body.   </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I had seen Carrie naked, of course. But the fact that Sarah was on her knees, locked between my body and the kitchen counter, her beautiful lips engulfing my shaft with a warmth that continuously crept upward as she pushed her limits while Carrie provided that show… </p><p>Spectacular. </p><p>After last night, I was aware that Carrie’s absurd shyness had been long conquered, but even with that. But watching her fingers slip inside her while her other hand was busy caressing and mauling her spectacular breasts delivered the idea with no room to mistake. </p><p>Oh, she still blushed, her gaze wide with adrenaline, clearly fearing a sudden reaction from Sarah, but she didn’t stop that from enjoying the moment, or displaying her curvy body to my gaze perfectly. </p><p>“Make her gag,” Carrie whispered, too soft to be heard, but I was able to read her lips, especially since she decided to support her message with animated miming. </p><p>Who was I to deny the request of the princess? I pushed my hips forward, forcing Sarah to swallow the entirety of my shaft without a warning, which earned a delicious gag. </p><p>Carrie decided to push even more. “What’s happening?” she asked in a casual tone.  </p><p>“Sarah decided to swallow something that disagreed with her,” I said, even as I grabbed her head, preventing her from escaping, ramming into her throat again and again. Then, I looked down, catching Sarah’s begging yet aroused look. “Play with yourself,” I ordered her. </p><p>“She could be gluttonous from time to time, even if that causes her problems,” Carrie answered, her laugh a beautiful crystal. </p><p>Sarah didn’t care about Carrie’s mocking. Without having the full picture, she missed Carrie’s pointed joke, focused on following my request. She pulled her skirt up immediately, obediently following my orders as her fingers disappeared inside. Gags escaped her mouth despite her best efforts, but luckily, she was far too distracted with her own pleasure to realize the excuse I had given to Carrie was hardly believable. </p><p>I leaned down a bit, just enough to allow me to slip my hand under her shirt once more. I reached to her back, a flick and a pull divesting her from her bra before sinking my fingers to her naked tits. </p><p>Meanwhile, my favorite blonde had stood up once more, doing her best to replicate a stripper. Her body was definitely up to the task. Unfortunately, her dancing abilities didn’t match a stripper, much clumsier. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. Her relative clumsiness, when combined with her enthusiasm, turned that into a delicious show, especially when she continued to finger herself even as she moved back and forth, her hips swaying beautifully.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Sarah was still gagging and gasping, but grabbed my legs to pull herself forward even deeper, swallowing my full length again and again, doing her best to bring me to climax. </p><p>I could feel I was getting closer, so I grabbed her head with both hands and started impaling her mercilessly, her gags rising in volume. </p><p>Carrie responded with another moan, which gave me the last push I needed to complete the progression, filling Sarah’s throat with my seed. Unprepared, she failed to contain all, staining her lips and her shirt with my mark. </p><p>She looked at me, begging, though I didn’t know whether she was asking me to stop or asking me to send Carrie away so that we can properly enjoy various kitchen surfaces. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, keeping her on the edge was far more fun. “The omelet is ready,” I said with a chuckle as I pulled back, leaning down to grab my towel — and swiping her underwear in the process — while Carrie fixed her bathrobe and sat back.  </p><p>Sarah took a second to fix her clothing, though her shock as she realized her underwear was missing was simply beautiful. She looked at me angrily, but unfortunately for her, Carrie’s nearby presence prevented her from fixing the situation. </p><p>I chuckled as I walked toward the pan, to finish preparing our delicious breakfast. </p><p>We certainly deserved it.    </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Peirous, Peirous, Peirous!” shouted the hundred thousand Roman citizens that filled the seats of the Colosseum as I stood in the arena once more, stabbing the last of the dozen crazed lions that had been arranged for my latest challenge. </p><p>I raised the bloodied spear, earning their endless, bloodthirsty cries of approval, each move earning their cries as I left the arena. However, not everyone shared the enthusiasm of the audience.</p><p>Particularly, the members of the Bestiary School on the other side of the arena, their glares colder than a mountaintop in the middle of the winter. Hardly a surprise considering I had killed their heir, who was supposed to inherit the school.</p><p>And just to make the insult even worse, my public show of taking down the Nemean Lion without killing it damaged their reputation significantly, not only showing that they couldn’t properly control the beast, but also, after using the beast as a core aspect of their prestige, a single gladiator taking it down. </p><p>Without even killing the beast. </p><p>It wasn’t just their reputation that had been damaged. From what I could gather from the gossips, there were already discussions about limiting the number of dangerous creatures they could keep in the borders of the city in case of another breach. </p><p>I doubted such a law would pass, as Gladiatorial schools had a very important part of the city, but that didn’t mean they could have ignored the law. They had to call a lot of favors and spend a fortune in bribes to make sure that it wouldn’t actually pass. </p><p>“Great work,” Pico said after I finished cheering the crowd and retreated back into the tunnel, leaving my place for the next gladiator, not even a scratch on me. </p><p>Today’s appearance was nothing more than an appetite-wetter, something Antonius arranged to tap into the stories of me fighting against the Nemean Lion. I had no doubt Bestiaries school hated the idea of sending lions against me, a bitter reminder of my earlier victory, but with their political standing…  </p><p>With the beast was under the control of the Dacian School, it wasn’t hard to guess what end game Antonius was building toward. A great show, me against the Nemean lion, that would end up in me killing the beast, likely with a magical weapon strong enough to break through its skin, in a moment where the seats were filled with the noblest guests possible. </p><p>Likely in a day sponsored by one of the great generals or senators that was trying to make their mark in the political scene, as, in Rome, a public spectacle might actually be more effective than a victory in a distant battlefield. </p><p>Too bad for Master Antonius and his likely supporters, I had other intentions for the fate of that beast. </p><p>“That’s what I do,” I answered to Pico with a shrug as I threw the spear, and before it hit the floor, a servant grabbed it, probably to prepare it as a memorabilia, to be purchased by an upstart noble with little battle achievements in their name. </p><p>I was about to leave the arena, when Pico gestured me toward a side corridor, the one that led toward a primitive yet comfortable room that more precious gladiators used between their bouts. “Huh, I thought I only have one bout today?” </p><p>“Well, you have a different kind of bout that is waiting for you,” Pico said with a dirty smirk as he elbowed me in the ribs conspiratorially. </p><p>Clearly, Antonius didn’t waste a second before monetizing my newfound reputation. Though, Pico’s smug smirk confirmed that it wasn’t an old noblewoman that was trying to spice up her retirement, or even a plain noble girl trying to spice up her life. </p><p>No, if he was that enthusiastic, there was no doubt a beautiful woman that was awaiting me. With my latest boost to fame, she also had to be rich enough. Not one of the Patrician houses, though, at least not unless our mysterious guest wanted to keep it hidden for a reason. They wouldn’t abandon the comfort of their estates without a very good reason. </p><p>Maybe Atia, I thought with a smirk. She seemed too shy to arrange a party like Olivia did in her own estate. </p><p>However, when the door opened, putting me face to face with a familiar olive-skinned beauty, I was surprised. </p><p>“Long time no see, Theodora,” I said with a smirk after I pushed the door close — and cast a detection spell to alert me in case someone tried to eavesdrop on us magically. “It seems that you’re doing well, if you can afford to have a meeting with me.” </p><p>“It wasn’t easy,” she murmured, trying to give a regal, impressive view. Admittedly, if it wasn’t for her flickering expression and growing blush, she would have been successful. Unlike the last time I had seen her, wearing nothing but rags and dirt, she wore a tasteful green dress, silk, the hue chosen to perfectly compliment her light olive skin, a few careful cuts enough to give a glimpse of her beauty without being too revealing. </p><p>And her face, beautiful even when covered with dust and dirt due to her incompetent attempt to escape, was certainly benefited from the careful application of soft makeup, elevating her beauty to a higher level. </p><p>I said nothing as I took a step forward to close the distance, putting my hand on her cheek, only for her attempts to look confident fold immediately. Her reaction was understandable despite her noble raising. </p><p>In her eyes, I was the hero that saved her from a lifetime of slavery where she had been displayed as a trophy. </p><p>I chuckled at her sudden silence before sitting down on the only bed in the room, not neglecting to pull her on my lap in the process. “N-no,” she stammered, shocked by the sudden escalation, though her body seemed to disagree if the way her hips shuffled to find a better seat. </p><p>“In case someone decides to check,” I whispered into her ear. We both knew it was just an excuse. What she had purchased naturally came with privacy, but she was more than happy to let that detail slide. Her reaction showed that I had been a part of more than one dream for her. “So, why don’t you tell me what have you been up to since our last meeting.” </p><p>“I have-“ she started, only to stammer as my hands caressed her stomach over her dress, its thin silk fabric barely doing anything to blunt the impact. “I have managed to sell almost half of the materials you have managed to give me, and rented a decent estate outside the city, posing as a rich daughter of a minor noble, making their mark as a merchant. I tried to pose the daughter of someone more influential at first, but after a couple close calls, I had to settle for a lesser role,” she explained, getting tenser as she reached the end of her explanation.  </p><p>I understood the source of her reticence. Roman society was hardly an equal opportunity environment, and merchants, even the rich ones, were always treated as the lower class, even if they had the noble title. According to the tradition, there were three acceptable ways to make money for a proper Roman noble. Farming — through slaves and plebeians, naturally — killing people, and, weirdly enough, receiving bribes.</p><p>Not exactly logical, but I had long stopped trying to make sense of the way Roman society worked. The reasons had always been a mystery for me, even when I had learned every intricacy to make sure I could survive. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, it’s even better for you to be a merchant,” I whispered into her ear even as my fingers slid down, caressing the lower parts of her thighs, where her dress failed to properly cover. The moan she let out in response was delicious and filled with anticipation, suggesting that she had more than one heated evening where she dreamed about me. </p><p>“Really?” she asked even as she leaned against my chest freely, enjoying my muscles. “But disguised as a merchant, even a noble one, I can’t actually connect with the Patrician families,” she explained. It was unnecessary considering as a bastard noble, I was more than aware of the hierarchy between the various aspects. </p><p>Though, Theodora still assumed I was a genius barbarian warrior with some magical talent, hence her attempt to explain. </p><p>As much as I was impressed by the loyalty she was showing to her promise despite her obvious highborn roots linking to Empire and Constantinople — something I was not tempted to poke unless there was a reason to do so  — she had proven herself through a real challenge before I could open up to her more. </p><p>“Don’t worry about the Patrician families, I managed to arrange a contact with them,” I said, then with a temptation, I added. “A sexy one, even.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” she murmured, anger flashing in her beautiful eyes even as jealously invaded her tone. Which was fun, even though the touch of danger it implied. A jealous woman was dangerous unless her jealousy was directed carefully. </p><p>“Really,” I said, not bothering to hide my amusement even as my hands traveled up, slipping under her dress. </p><p>Luckily, I was an expert on managing such jealousy. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Luckily, poor impulse control was not a trait of Dark Lords — well, at least the ones with any success to their name other than a pointless invasion of the borderlands — and I was able to resist the temptation to kill the blond asshole. </p><p>Instead, I stayed behind him, concealed in the shadows, listening carefully. </p><p>“Why are you doing this, Lancelot?” Isolde asked desperately. “We have already made so much progress. Another trip, and our mission will be complete.” </p><p>“Then what?” Lancelot answered with a suddenness that betrayed his explosive anger. “Another mission? Another errand before we receive the promised reward? No reward, no riches, just another mission.” I would have sympathized with his anger more if he wasn’t already slated to marry with the only princess of the Empire, putting him in an excellent position to inherit the throne — or even usurp it if he was feeling impatient. </p><p>It seemed that Lancelot wasn’t aware of the extremely lacking state of the treasury, which underlined just how little Sapphire actually trusted him. Not that it was an unfair move if his reaction, or his current status was any indicator. </p><p>Ironically, his lack of attention on his fiancee had some important consequences — courtesy of me, their ever-helpful guest — had already made his hopeful career progression impossible. </p><p>If he had known about his fiancee declaring her love for me, I would understand his reaction. However, Lancelot was yet to be aware of that development, which made his decision rash at best, though more likely, extremely suspicious. </p><p>However, stopped paying attention to his whiny temper tantrum when he pulled his dagger. Not because of the threat it implied, as he was just swinging it around to underline his frustration. </p><p>The dagger itself. </p><p>It wasn’t a new dagger. He had been carrying that for a long time, including their successful assault to my castle which started the whole mess. However, since it was a side weapon, he had never it out, and considering it didn’t have a strong magical presence, I never paid particular attention to that. It was just an accessory, the kind nobles wore to a party to look dangerous without actually being so. </p><p>The blade itself with covered in runes, runes that combined with a suspicious similarity to the wards of the throne room. </p><p>Not suspicious, not at all. </p><p>I didn’t suspect Lancelot of casting the wards, of course. Not only he had never shown any magical ability, but also, the wards in the palace were old, old enough to be cast when Lancelot was a mere child. </p><p>Unfortunately, that didn’t mean there was no link between Lancelot and these wards. Like I needed something else to make that decision. </p><p>On the positive side, it helped me to solidify my next action. So, when Lancelot stopped his angry rant about how it was unfair for Isolde to betray him — by not immediately following his betrayal against the Empire, though Lancelot seemed to unaware of the irony — and left the cell, leaving Isolde, I followed him rather than staying and talking with Isolde. </p><p>Isolde was clearly unaware of the reasons, and even if she did, I doubted she would talk to me moments after her imprisonment. </p><p>“You’ll understand soon,” Lancelot said before closing the door, though I had long sneaked into the corridor. I followed him deeper into the building, though this time, not shocked by the number of combat constructs filled the corridors, even though, the deeper we moved, the stronger they started to get. </p><p>When he finally entered a large study, one that was occupied, I followed him, still wrapped in shadows. </p><p>But the moment I stepped inside, the door slammed shut… </p><p>Leaving me with locked with my heartbeat, rising enough to be qualified as panicking, a level that I hadn’t felt even when I was sitting in my throne room, with the full realization that I was under the combined assault of the dark families and the Empire.</p><p>The reason for my panic, naturally, wasn’t Lancelot. Unless he could gather his full party and receive the support of the Dark Families at the same time, he wasn’t a threat to me. </p><p>Emma, who was also in the room, didn’t scare me either. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same didn’t go for the third occupant of the room, the same I met in the palace, wearing the least convincing maid disguise I had ever seen, far too beautiful and confident to be even slightly convincing. </p><p>What I didn’t realize was, compared to her true form, it had been an incredible disguise. </p><p>Not because she was ugly or hideous. On the contrary, she was even more beautiful than her disguised form. Perfectly proportioned face, an amazing, flawless pale body underlining her beauty, contrasting greatly with her flaming hair. </p><p>And by flaming, I just meant her hair was a beautiful crimson, not that her hair was actually currently burning. </p><p>Which would have been a pedantic clarification in almost all circumstances, but considering her most striking figure was a pair of flaming wings behind her, it was a necessary clarification. And that wasn’t just a spell, but a part of her being. </p><p>I skulked in the shadows even more, doing my best to let my magical presence melt into the shadows. </p><p>For the first time in a long while, I was actually scared, because, with every flicker of flames of her beautiful wings of flame, power radiated into the room. And if that was what she was sitting lazily, I certainly didn’t want to see her true expression. </p><p>However, even scarier, I had seen drawings of her kind, on the records Fyre Eternus, of one of the major dark families — one of the families I suppressed in order to become the dark lord. Those records weren’t supposed to be open to anyone outside the family, but I had managed to read by sneaking into their library. </p><p>In particular, it was a part of their secret family history, explaining how they had been chosen by otherworldy godlike phoenixes, empowering them to rule the world. </p><p>At that time, I had dismissed it, assuming that it was just a reason to give themselves a ridiculous reason to feel superior to others, and the drawings of beautiful people with flaming wings was either the imagination of an artist, or the trick of a competent mage, duping their gullible family members. </p><p>But standing face to face with the real deal, that was quick to flow away. It was no trick, especially after I had already seen her using a disguise — and didn’t the excessive magical power of her maid disguise make sense in hindsight. </p><p>She was the real deal. </p><p>A phoenix. </p><p>I did my best to stay pull the shadows around me even tighter as I repositioned slightly, my back against the door, just in case the worst happened and I needed to beat a hasty retreat. My fingers tightened around the hilt of the Blade of Shadows, relying on its unique magical nature to hide perfectly, while my left arm shifted slightly, positioning the Shield of Ether ready in case of a sudden burst of magic. </p><p>Facing a being of magic that was supposed to be just a story or a part of ancient history, I was glad to have an accessory famous for resisting magic in my possession.  </p><p>I only halfheartedly listened as Lancelot give a report of his latest adventure — considering it was my own hideout, I knew everything he was explaining in the first place — instead of letting my gaze explore the room, recording the detail of the layout.</p><p>Including a glass of wine radiating a scary amount of mana.  </p><p>Of course, compared to two hulking armor behind her, their aura was strong enough to make me nervous even if there wasn’t a mystical being with wings of flame in front of them. Magical bodyguards, clearly, though the number of gemstones arrayed around their breastplate despite having no magical purpose was another interesting detail. </p><p>Like the magical constructs weren’t expensive enough, they were also decorated with a veritable treasure. Just the gems were enough to multiply the current treasury of the empire. They were positioned as bodyguards, but with the power she was radiating, they were more like decorations. </p><p>Pointless expensive decorations, even. </p><p>And her confident laziness, her glare dismissive as she looked down on Lancelot who was continuing to explain the situation, suggested she was very much aware of that fact. </p><p>I continued examining the room, including a bookcase filled with leather-bound books, promising some interesting secrets, a desk that was made from wood glowing with excess magic it contained, and other accessories. </p><p>It was hard to read their magical functions due to the completely different magical tradition they were based on, of course, but just by their layout and relative strength, I could see that they weren’t designed for combat purposes, but for sheer visual impact. </p><p>A rather interesting choice for a dangerous mission in the heart of the enemy, even with the power radiating off her. Yes, she was strong, significantly stronger than me, but not enough to fight against the whole capital, even with all her constructs. </p><p>Or at least, that’s what I thought. I sincerely hoped it wasn’t wishful thinking. </p><p>Meanwhile, Lancelot finished his detailed report of their adventure. Interestingly, an embellished version of the story that explained how he managed to cut through endless magical challenges bravely — with absolutely no mention of Isolde’s help, and more importantly, the detailed map I had drawn for them, making the challenge much simpler. </p><p> Since he was facing the other side, I wasn’t able to see his face, but his body language told me an interesting story. </p><p>Apparently, our blond hero was trying to impress her, unaware of the dismissive nature of her gaze. I might have thought that it was his confidence that was making him ignore her lack of interest, but maybe it was his absolute lack of skill when facing women. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time he had grossly misread the situation. </p><p>Then, after he finished the explanation, the mysterious phoenix lady spoke. “So, you haven’t found the Core yet.” </p><p>Of course, she was searching for the same thing that was in my possession, making me a target for a completely unknown player. </p><p>Of course it was… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Coach Spencer stood in front of us, pushing his chest out in a way he assumed to be an authoritative stance, though only coming across as smug. </p><p>“I’m not going to waste your time with a long speech. You’re here to be a part of our glorious football team, and I’m coach Spencer, who will manage the guys lucky enough to earn that right of helping the actual heroes of our school prepare.” </p><p>I barely held myself back from shaking my head in dismissal. Around me, I could see several frowns appearing on people’s faces at the accidental insult. No wonder the practice squad was looking for more members. </p><p>“Who here played football before at least a year?” he asked, unaware of the effects of his words. I raised my hand, along with six others. “Position and time?” he asked. </p><p>“Wide receiver, three years in high school,” said the first player confidently. “But I joined the college as a point guard for the basketball team?” </p><p>“Why the change?” the coach asked, though I could catch the derision in his tone. </p><p>“I received a full scholarship for basketball,” the boy explained, unable to hide his pride. Though, considering he was trying to get into the practice squad, he had likely received the news that he would be cut out, so he was searching for an alternative sport. </p><p>His pride suggested that he saw moving from the practice squad to the actual team as a given. It was the reason he told his role in the basketball team without prompting in the first place. </p><p>Big mistake, I thought even as I noticed the way the coach’s frown tightened. Coach Spencer was clearly an entitled asshole, and the worst thing to do against an entitled asshole like him was to hurt his fragile pride. </p><p>The way our unlucky friend highlighted that his identity as a basketball player, implying that basketball was a better sport than football was enough to earn that. </p><p>Of course, his point was not unjustified. Football might be the more popular sport, but it was also more injury-prone and painful. Not to mention, at a player level, it certainly earned more. That didn’t prevent football coaches from getting hurt when their preferred players chose to play basketball. </p><p>Somehow, they were surprised that students preferred a sport with more money, longer career, less injury — and the attractiveness of not being allowed to be tackled by a grown man in excess of three hundred pounds made of pure muscles running at full speed. </p><p>Still, while the general saltiness of the football coaches about being the second choice was one thing, the reaction of an entitled asshole was something else. “Good, a promising candidate,” he said, his words poisoned with anger. Somehow, the guy smirked, missing the tension, making half of the squad look at him in shock. </p><p>Some people couldn’t be educated. Our newest WR was for a life of pain. </p><p>Two other guys spoke before it was my turn. “Linebacker, two years in high school,” I said. </p><p>“Why the change?” he asked, though the moment I mentioned that I was a defensive player, his expression tightened again. </p><p>His ego again, I realized. Considering the way the defense worked excellently, while his offense was in shambles, it wasn’t hard to guess his pride was tarnished again. “I wasn’t good enough,” I simply said, accompanied with a slight slouch that implied defeat, hoping that I read the reason for his annoyance correctly. </p><p>And since it earned a dismissive glance rather than an angry one, it seemed I managed to defuse the correct fuse. His attitude was clear, if I wasn’t good enough for high school, I certainly wasn’t good enough for college. </p><p>I took that dismissal as a win. </p><p>My guide didn’t share the same attitude. “How can he simply dismiss you!” she gasped in shock, looking at the coach, who, luckily, couldn’t see her, not wasting time before moving to the next one. “Defend yourself,” she ordered passionately, waiting for action. </p><p>Fucking impatient guide, I thought, my annoyance reaching a point her amazing cleavage failed to take the sting. I dipped my head down before whispering. “I’ll show him with my abilities,” I whispered. </p><p>The guys next to me heard it, but luckily, they assumed I was trying to psyche myself. </p><p>Coach Spencer continued to assess people, asking about their past experience, occasionally making them run through certain drills to test their abilities, before separating the ones with significant ability, from the others. </p><p>Interestingly, he had separated three defensive players with the best experience into the discarded group, claiming one was too slow, one was too undisciplined, and one was too tall. Though the basketball player that angered him earned the same treatment as well.  </p><p>When he finished, he picked seven players, five offensive and two defensive. “Not bad,” Coach Spencer said even as he separated us. “The rest will work with me for another half an hour to show me their potential.” </p><p>Then, he looked toward the area main team was practicing. “Kevin, Thad, come here!” Two players, one a muscular blond-haired guy, the other much thinner. A lineman and a quarterback, I guessed. </p><p>The fun thing, I remembered the black-haired one from the morning. He was the one that egged the convention center while shouting insults. </p><p>Such a great example of poise. </p><p>“Yes, coach,” they said loudly, but their lack of respect was clear from the looseness of their stance. Though, while the black-haired ones read like laxness, the blond-haired guy’s attitude read like defiance. And from the way Coach looked at them, he didn’t miss that disrespect. </p><p>Interestingly, he didn’t lash out. </p><p>Clearly, whoever pulled the strings to get him the job wasn’t strong enough for him to lash out against the defensive players, which meant the defensive coordinator was not someone he could touch. </p><p>Unfortunately, that also meant that he was going to lash out at the defensive players at the practice squad even more. </p><p>Not exactly the hallmarks of a great coach, but hardly the greatest nepotism either. </p><p>“I will watch the newbies running drills. Those seven claim that they are good enough to get into the practice team. Test them, and see if any of them actually good enough to earn a place as a backup.” </p><p>There were seven of us on the line. The other six looked at each other, dismissing me completely, taking my statement about not being good enough at the face value. </p><p>The receiver he had separated looked at the coach like he wanted to complain. “You stay with me, basketball boy,” said the coach with great vindictiveness. “You’re even better than the others, you’ll help me train the newbies.” Apparently, while he didn’t like his smugness, it wasn’t a point of discarding him like potential defensive players. </p><p>“But-“ he started. </p><p>“No talking back to your Coach, or I’ll kick you out immediately,” he shouted, making the boy blanch in fear. The quarterback just smiled smugly, enjoying the sight, while Thad shook his head in disgust, but didn’t intervene. </p><p>“Come with us,” said the thin one, gesturing us to follow. As we walked, he spoke. “I’m Kevin, the backup quarterback,” he said with a smug tone, like he was declaring himself the King of America. </p><p>“And I’m Thad, lineman, a defensive tackle,” the larger boy said, whose voice, thankfully, wasn’t disgustingly oily. “Let’s see if you have what it takes to fulfill Coach Spencer’s high expectations,’ he added, loud enough to be heard by the coach in question. Though the glance he threw at Kevin even as they walked side by side suggested that the Coach wasn’t the only person that earned his annoyance. </p><p>“Since we have both defensive and offensive players, why don’t we do just do some practice throws, maybe even have a small bet, Thad? For fifty rounds?” </p><p>“Of course,” Thad answered. “How about if I take your sweet convertible for the weekend.” </p><p>“God, I didn’t know you were a chicken,” Kevin answered, loud enough to be heard by nearby players, who clearly belonged to offense. “How about we play for the keys, mine against yours. I always wanted to have your classic Mustang.”  </p><p>God, no wonder they were in a continuous losing streak, I thought, if the players were this busy trying to pull childish ploys against each other. </p><p>It was a bullshit bet even without the fact that the coach didn’t allow the best defensive players from taking the game. </p><p>The one-on-one drill was a simple concept. In the case of defensive backs versus receivers, it means trying to prevent the pass from connecting, either through blocking, or through interception. However, sprinting in full power was an exhausting affair, enough to make five-versus-two a deadly advantage. </p><p>Thad clearly intended to reject it, but then, Kevin revealed his ploy. He raised his hand, and the nearby offensive players started making chicken sounds, clearly planned. </p><p>And unfortunately, defensive linemen, the enforcers of the team, were not famous for their calmness. Thad seemed to be particularly bad. “I’m no chicken, bastard. You’re on!” </p><p>While his quick acceptance — and the fact that he was driving a classic Mustang in the first place — suggested that he came from a well-off family, ultimately, it was definitely not something that could be written off simply. </p><p>And the sudden realization on his face suggested he realized that fact the moment those words left his mouth. Still, he looked at Kevin’s smug face, then sighed in defeat. Apparently, while his car was valuable, it wasn’t as valuable as his reputation. </p><p>Such fun team dynamics, I thought with a shake of my head. </p><p>Kevin dragged the three receivers to his side, while Thad walked toward us. “Okay boys, do your best and keep the score even slightly close, and you’re invited to the party at the team house.” He seemed to be accepting defeat.  </p><p>The other player looked enthusiastic at the opportunity to join the party, like I would have felt just the day before. Good food, unlimited alcohol, and most importantly, horny sorority girls trying to add another football player as a notch to their bedposts.  </p><p>We were in a football-dominant party college. Those parties were legendary. </p><p>I had more important things to worry about than a party. Normally, that would have been all I needed to keep my head down and act invisible. Thad’s mustang was hardly my problem. </p><p>However, Thad must have been a lucky guy. The attitude of the coach and the egg-throw in the morning, the courtesy of his precious backup quarterback, was just enough to annoy me. </p><p>They didn’t call me Assassin for my great ability to forgive and forget. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The magical presence of my target was nearby. </p><p>Unfortunately, my preferred method of flying mount was not an option. Not with the detection ward ready to catch the moment I stepped out of the little web of protection I had created under the shadow of its defensive counterpart. </p><p>So, I continued to move the slow way. Creating a complicated set of tunnels. And even worse, I had to create some of them much larger, just in case I had an opportunity to save my scaly acquaintance. </p><p>Saving her was a target despite the potential risks, because the headmistress needed me to capture the dragon. However, my motive was not fulfilling her order, or even selling the illusion of a loyal soldier. </p><p>No, I wanted to save the dragon — if I could do so without putting myself under certain danger —  because the headmistress’ request implied that the dragon was important for her. Which meant, the dragon either had some kind of link with Divine Spark, she had some information valuable for the headmistress. </p><p>Or she had a completely different significance, which might make her even more important. </p><p>Regardless, she was important for me, because her presence promised leverage that could be used against the headmistress.  </p><p>The nearer I got, the more accurately I could detect the details. </p><p>As far as I could tell, there were eight distinct sources of energy, which would have been enough for me to turn back and retreat, leaving my scaly acquaintance to whatever unfortunate fate that awaited in the hands of a mysterious organization responsible for the ongoing disaster that was slowly destroying the civilization. </p><p>Luckily for her, I could also detect their formation and the current targets as well. And that told me one important thing. The battle wasn’t a siege where seven members of the Eternals assaulted the dragon, trying to take her down. </p><p>If that had been the case, from the level of power I could detect, she wouldn’t have lasted even a minute. </p><p>No, even from a distance, I could feel four parties spread around, each fighting against each other. The first party was, naturally, the dragon herself. She was away from every other opponent, several wards surrounding her in a desperate attempt to create a defensive bulwark, one that was being eroded aggressively. </p><p>The intricacies of the wards would be enough to prove that she was more than a mere beast even if I hadn’t communicated with her before. </p><p>However, intelligence was not sufficient alone when being sieged by several high-leveled enemies, even when those enemies were lacking in skill. Power was also needed, an asset that she was clearly lacking. </p><p>She wasn’t weak by any sane definition of the word. She was still strong enough to take down Cornelia, or one of the death knights of Zokras, in less than a minute — though I would pick Titania for a victory with a comfortable margin. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, that level of power was hardly enough under the circumstances. She was only holding on because of external factors. The relative lack of skill of her attackers didn’t match their incredible power. And the enmity among themselves. </p><p>Her attackers were split into three factions, though these factions were not equal in number, or in power. The biggest group consisted of four members, three mages and a warrior. They were at the center of the group, their main focus on attacking the dragon. Even with their unskilled approach, they would have taken the dragon down with relative ease. </p><p>However, the second group was actively trying to prevent them from succeeding. </p><p>The second group consisted only of two members, one mage and one warrior, likely with a ranged specialization. They were staying quite a bit distance away from the first group as they did their best to interfere with the first group’s attacks against the dragon. However, they were distant enough that, if the first group decided to attack them, they would be able to retreat. A simple plan, but effective.  </p><p>That didn’t mean they were on the side of the dragon, because they were also attacking the dragon whenever the dragon had an opportunity to sneak away. </p><p>Clearly, they shared the same objective, but they were fighting for the honor of taking the spoils.  </p><p>However, the real interesting thing was the fourth party. It was a lone warrior, yet he was attacking all three at the same time, without any rhyme or reason, completely berserk. I might have mistaken him for a monster in the middle of a blood rage if it wasn’t for his distinct signature marking him as completely human. </p><p>Just mindlessly berserk. </p><p>How very much interesting, I thought even as I continued my laborious journey.  </p><p>If there was one good thing about a chaotic four-way magical skirmish, the spells that were being thrown around with reckless abandon were the exact thing I needed to conceal my own magical signature, essentially hiding under the shadows of their spells to quicken the tunnel-creation process. </p><p>And it was a good advantage, under the assault of two groups — even with them restraining each other — the dragon was getting closer to defeat. Layer after layer, her wards were getting destroyed, with her speed to recreate unable to match the speed. </p><p>I started tunneling even faster. </p><p>[-231 Mana]</p><p>When I was finally able to poke my head, about a hundred feet away from the defensive cave the dragon had picked for her desperate last stand, only one detail about the battle surprised me, though not a big one.  </p><p>The members of Eternals were wearing three different types of uniforms, though each had the symbol of a silver ankh on their chest, only the color of their shirt different. The small group of two was wearing a green shirt, while the large group had two different colors, three of them wearing black and one wearing blue. Interestingly, the one that was currently raging was also wearing a blue. </p><p>Maybe the Eternals weren’t as unified as I thought. Of course, that was the best case, as there might be many different reasons for that difference in color, like operative teams, maybe even simple fashion preference.  </p><p>I stayed concealed, watching carefully for an opportunity. I wanted to save the dragon, but not at the cost of revealing myself. </p><p>I cared about getting leverage over the headmistress, but not at the cost of directly opposing a literal army of high-leveled combatants. </p><p>Luckily, that didn’t mean I was completely helpless. For example, when one of the mages dressed in black threw a huge fireball strong enough to destroy her remaining wards, I sent a concealed string of mana to destabilize it, making explode before it even reached the halfway mark between them and the dragon, making them receive the bulk of the attack. </p><p>Admittedly, it hadn’t been a particularly difficult job. Not when it was already getting more and more unstable as it flew toward the dragon due to excessive mana the caster pumped in its structure. And that was another indicator of their lack of experience, failing to cast even such a simple spell correctly, despite from a pure potential perspective, being able to put more raw power than Cornelia could display.  </p><p>The spell exploded close to them. Unfortunately, they had their own protections — crude, but with enough power behind them to make them formidable — making the fireball barely an inconvenience for them. </p><p>It might have been different if the smaller group had been able to take advantage of the mistake, but they were equally clumsy, choosing to send a huge chunk of ice bolt after charging it fully rather than relying on a quick attack to leverage the opportunity. </p><p>They were not only incompetent in terms of using magic, but also they were tactically unaware. </p><p>As I watched them, the berserk warrior finally started to show the signs of mana depletion, and the next time he attacked the group of four — he had been bouncing between all three targets repeatedly — the group of four turned their attention to him, killing him quickly. </p><p>Interestingly, none of them showed the slightest hint of hesitance, including the one that was wearing the same color uniform.  </p><p>However, even when they were killing a mindless and weakened opponent, their movements were lacking. Both in terms of spell selection and coordination, to a point that their spells interfered with each other significantly. </p><p>With that lack of skill on display, I was confident in taking all of them in a few minutes.</p><p> Unfortunately, it was clear that those strong but unskilled mages were not my only opponents. Not even close. The amount of skill they were displaying was too limited to establish the wards around us, not even if they had miraculous artifacts to help them. </p><p>Which meant that there were others with more respectable skill levels — like the ones I faced back in the city where they were targeting Titania, or even more skilled —  responsible for managing the wards. </p><p>And even that wasn’t even the full extent of the challenge I was facing. </p><p>With my luck, there was always more.  </p><p>Barely a minute after the berserk warrior had fallen, another complication joined the mix. A group of three just entered the range of my detection, moving with a great speed, uncaring of the magical expense. They were coming from the direction of the smaller group. </p><p>At the same time, the smaller group changed their behavior significantly, and stopped targeting the dragon, focusing their attack on the group of four, even slowly closing in the distance. </p><p>Another significant tactical mistake, which told me that not only they were not used to using strong magic, but also, they didn’t have much tactical awareness. </p><p>They might as well just cry reinforcements. </p><p> Even the group of four, despite their limited tactical acumen, realized that. Their reaction, however, was interesting. Rather than trying to retreat, they intensified their assault on the dragon. </p><p>For some reason, they were trying to take down the dragon before the reinforcements arrived. Maybe they trusted themselves to defend against the five with the dragon taken down, or maybe they had another aim. </p><p>Regardless, with the inclusion of more reinforcements, I was ready to cancel my plans. Information was something precious. </p><p>My life was more precious.  </p><p>However, before I could retreat back to the tunnel, another interesting development made me reconsider my plans. One of the four, the warrior wearing black, let out an explosive cry, and he started to act in the same mindless berserk manner. </p><p>A second later, he was attacking his previous allies in reckless abandon. </p><p>A crazed warrior loose between three mages in arms reach, a recipe for disaster in any measure.</p><p>Also, just the opportunity I needed.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324 / 6324 Mana: 6192 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Under the difficult circumstances I found myself in — again — what I needed more than anything was information. And to do that, in such a large field, with mist thick enough to block anything outside a fifty-feet radius, the only reliable method to do was establishing a detection ward of my own.  </p><p>A detection ward, under normal circumstances, was not exactly challenging, especially when done from an already secured base. Unfortunately, the situation was far from normal. </p><p>Most detection wards worked in the same principle, sending tightly-controlled strings of mana outside to analyze the surroundings and communicating with the main array. Unfortunately, the overwhelmingly-strong detection ward that covered the sky not only could detect anyone not actively suppressing their mana — or hiding behind a set of concealment wards of their own — but also they could detect the subtle mana from the detection wards. </p><p>They were ways to prevent that, based on the way the opposing ward was working. Unfortunately, the current ward I was facing was simply too strong, too over-compassing for those tricks to be viable. </p><p>Luckily, not all detection wards relied on sending out mana. Some of the more obscure wards worked passively. They weren’t used much because their detection capabilities were significantly lower. They were usually placed in distant locations, as some kind of outer detection, and only then, passive structures were used because their mana consumption was much lower. They were also significantly worse in distinguishing the nature of different mana sources. </p><p>Luckily, their weaknesses didn’t make them completely useless against the circumstances. Not with the potential of the people I was facing against. Especially since I didn’t expect them to waste any effort trying to stay concealed. </p><p>Why should they, when they had conveniently surrounded the area with an impenetrable ward and a near-omniscient detection ward? These were not exactly the critical setup phase of a stealthy operation. </p><p>The moment I established the ward, I was able to detect two sources of mana that were passing dangerously close to my shelter, confirming my guess. </p><p>The way they radiated power passively suggested that they were strong, I tensed for a moment, thinking that my concealment wards were not enough to block their detection capabilities. </p><p>Luckily, their route was incidental, and they had disappeared from my detection field after a few seconds. However, that left me another question. </p><p>The passive detection ward only covered a minuscule portion of the mountain, barely a sliver, due to its inherent disadvantages — and the constant glow of the defensive ward that surrounded the mountain, blanketing out the detection capabilities of the ward due to the constant magical glow it created, hardly helped. </p><p>Immediately detecting two opponents, strong enough to give me significant trouble, was not a good indicator of the number of enemies around. So, either I was unlucky, or there were far more enemies than I had been expecting. </p><p>Another flash power appeared from a different direction, tangentially passing my base before disappearing from the range. And then, from another direction, came yet another energy signature, this time two of them. </p><p>There were more enemies than I had been expecting. </p><p>Much more. </p><p>“Fuck it,” I murmured. </p><p>I had one day to rest. Just one fucking day, since I had to defend two different cities simultaneously against a coordinated undead attack — and almost killing myself in the process. </p><p>There was one positive thing, one little silver lining. </p><p>With their incredible investment and the number of warriors they had deployed was completely unnecessary to capture a dragon. The dragon actually being much stronger was not a likely possibility. </p><p>That might have explained the reason for the wards they had established, but the weird movement pattern of my opponents didn’t make sense from the perspective of people trying to systemically search for one extremely strong target. </p><p>No, they had a different reason. </p><p>Of course, that raised an important follow-up question, whether the headmistress was aware of that detail and used the situation to send me to a dangerous situation, a remote execution. </p><p>Though, a bit of thinking told me that it was unlikely. I had no reason to think the headmistress could track me — if she could, I wouldn’t have been able to sneak into her bedroom to peek at her — and my arrival to the mountain was too fast for her to rely on for me to be locked inside. </p><p>Not to mention, if she wanted to kill me, she had much more efficient ways of setting up a sure-fire ambush.  </p><p>Unless I had any solid evidence, I was willing to operate under the assumption that it was my own luck that forced the circumstances. Considering everything that happened, the current circumstances weren’t exactly unbelievable. </p><p>I needed to act, however. The Eternals were clearly going to move around a  lot — whether they were looking for something, or for other purposes — and hiding in one location, hoping to stay undiscovered was not the safest strategy. </p><p>Not with my luck. </p><p>However, I couldn’t just leave my hiding spot, hoping to stay concealed. I needed to find a way to move around without being detected. </p><p>Suppressing my mana continuously was not sustainable for hours, not because of the discomfort it would create — and it would be annoying — but because if I faced any danger, I would either have to rely only on my physical combat abilities to handle it, or I would reveal my position. </p><p>Not a good solution, since my whole melee fighting abilities were based on strategic discharges of mana to deliver explosive damage. Facing against a strong enemy without that trick was certainly not something I wanted unless I had no other option. </p><p>“Maybe an old trick would help,” I murmured even as I stretched my mana directly on the ground, carefully creating a tunnel while making sure it was still under the concealment ward. </p><p>It took almost a minute for me to hit the glowing defensive ward, but that was not surprising. As much as I would have loved for them to forget covering the bottom of it, it wasn’t exactly shocking. </p><p>Breaking through the ward was not an option, but luckily, it wasn’t the reason I had come here. I was there to check one important thing, that whether the constant glow of the ward interfered only with my own wards, or interfered with their own as well. </p><p>And much to my happiness, I discovered that it actually did. </p><p>Maybe they didn’t even think someone was crazy enough to set their presence so near to their wards. It wouldn’t be the first time I abused a clear design mistake of the defensive wards. </p><p>“Finally something for my benefit,” I thought even as I started creating a complicated web of tunnels — not neglecting to add small explosives, false turns, and many other tricks to make sure those tunnels wouldn’t be tracked easily if they were discovered. However, unlike the last time I had pulled that trick in the undead base, I didn’t cover every inch of the tunnel with explosive runes.</p><p>This time, it was about staying hidden and hiding my retreat, not leaving a destructive gift while I retreated. </p><p>Tactics needed to adapt when total retreat was not an option. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t just establishing those tunnels to escape. No, I was adding some passive detection wards, spread about a couple hundred feet away from each other, giving me a better view of what was going on. The radiating presence of the surrounding ward reduced their effectiveness, but luckily, not completely prevent it.  </p><p>Unfortunately, a more complete view didn’t immediately solve my problem, for one important reason. </p><p>The more I could detect, the more confused I got. </p><p>First, closer to the peak of the mountain, there were more enemies running around — and flying around — to a point that I had to update my estimations upward. Several dozen enemies were a certainty, and maybe there were even in low hundreds. </p><p>Hundreds of level-thirty and above combatants were not something that was easy to handle. </p><p>The second confusing thing, was that they were fighting against each other, sometimes suddenly starting to fight after traveling together for a while, for no direct apparent reason or rhyme. Though whenever they started fighting, it started with a weird flare of magic from at least one of the parties. </p><p>However, the most interesting thing was the total lack of skill they were displaying. Of course, it was hard to assess such a thing accurately from the limited perspective of a passive detection ward, but every single spell they used was simple, almost as bad as my first casting attempts. Pure telekinetic power waves, fireballs, and flying pieces of rocks. </p><p>The only thing that separated them was the huge power they were putting behind the spells, turning every attempt into a deadly danger regardless of the lack of skill in its nature. </p><p>How interesting, I murmured. I was about to retreat back into my own hiding spot, when I felt another flare of magic on the edge of my recently-expanded field of detection. I was about to ignore it, as it was yet another incompetent flare of magic, but it was immediately followed by a familiar type of spell. </p><p>A familiar spell that a situational ally had used before in my presence. </p><p>An ally with a certain scaly skin condition. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324 / 6324 Mana: 5902 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Penny was quick to follow my request. She put on her wig before walking toward the lakeside, her hips swaying alluringly. </p><p>Nancy wasn’t as quick. </p><p>She stayed in her seat. Though it wasn’t a rebellion, and even if it was a rebellion, it was a silent one, lacking the necessary presence or confidence. It was the after-effects of her confusion, not helped by her growing arousal. </p><p>Our earlier show had left a mark on her, and the rough dirt road drove that mark deeper into her psyche. </p><p>“Are you sure it’s a good idea? Maybe we should skip it?” she murmured. </p><p>“Nope,” I answered with a smirk. “It’s a good opportunity to put you in the mood of the characters for the convention.”</p><p>“But what if we are late?” </p><p>“We still have ninety minutes before the convention center opens. More than enough to make sure we’re on time and set up everything correctly.” </p><p>“Still, a photoshoot? Do we have enough time?” </p><p>“Since you’re already in costume, definitely so. If we’re lucky, we might even get a few decent poses we can give as a bonus with the books.” </p><p>“Bonus photos,” she said, her eyes widening. </p><p>“Of course,” I said. “It’s a fantasy convention, after all. I’m sure the prospect of sexy photos would help you sell more books to the male-dominant.” I paused some, for a dramatic effect. “Of course, if you want your first convention to be a total failure and waste all the money you have spent, that’s your call.” </p><p>Her expression stiffened, enough to make me think maybe I had pushed too much. Luckily, the books she had published with her own money were piling next to her, giving her a physical reminder about all the money she spent. It was enough to sway her decision into indecision. “Do you think it’ll work?” she asked. </p><p>“Of course it will, the attraction and anticipation is the greatest marketing tool,” I said. That statement even had the rare benefit of being true. People built companies worth billions around the idea implied promise of happiness radiating from the carefully suggestive pose of a sexy model. </p><p>And while building a huge company based on a few photos was a definite overreach, I trusted my skills enough to push their already existing sexiness to the next level. “If you listen to me, we can sell the majority of the books here.” </p><p>“A majority,” she said with a dismissive scoff. “Why not all?” </p><p>I let my smirk widen. “Oh, we can definitely sell all of them, but that would require a touch sexier than you might be willing to go,” I said. </p><p>“I won’t do nudes,” she jerked immediately. </p><p>“What a naughty idea,” I said in mock outrage, and she blushed. “Of course not,” I continued seriously. “What do you think am I, a hack? Outright nudity is a terrible way of selling. The whole point is building anticipation.” Also, I had no intention of sharing their nude form with others. Sexy, suggestive photos were acceptable. </p><p>Outright nudity was certainly not. At least, not except any other female that was sharing — or about to share — my bed as well... </p><p>“Oh,” she murmured, shocked by my vehemence, but soon focused on the main point. A point that had great implications on the future of her career.  “Do you really think we can sell all of the books?” </p><p>“Oh, we definitely can, as long as you’re willing to pay the price,” I said. </p><p>“What price?” she asked, already tense. </p><p>“I want to a cut of the total sales, of course,” I said, which surprised her. She was clearly expecting something more direct. More sexual. </p><p>I could have asked that, of course, but the past proved that — for more than once — I didn’t need to bargain for that to happen. But I needed the money, and since I was already going to a convention, there was no harm in trying to take a slice from the pie. </p><p>“How much?” she asked. </p><p>“How about thirty percent?” I asked. </p><p>“That’s too much, ten is more than enough.” </p><p>“Let’s meet in the middle. Twenty,” I offered, which earned a nod. It was more than the services I was offering her deserved, but not by a large margin. Luckily, she was not in the mood to push for a harder bargain. </p><p>Not that I wasn’t confident that I could defend my point, but a hardier bargain would take several minutes, wasting time that was much better used for the fun stuff. </p><p>“Let’s move, we don’t have time to waste,”  I said. </p><p>With that, she finally grabbed her wig and left the car, walking next to Penny, who looked spectacular under the morning sun, her armor glistening. Together with her wig and her pose, she truly looked like a valkyrie. </p><p>In contrast, Nancy embodied her character much less accurately. Though, considering she was supposed to be a skulking thief, that inaccuracy was certainly not a problem. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I followed them. “Let’s start with something simple, like a hug.” </p><p>“A … hug?” Nancy stammered. “But it doesn’t make these characters hug. They don’t like each other.” </p><p>“And that’s a problem, how? This is just some warm-up poses, to make sure you two warm up to each other, before we start more thematic pictures.”</p><p>Nancy nodded, while Penny, as usual, followed my request immediately and hugged Nancy’s waist, pulling her to her bosom. Nancy didn’t appreciate the snug position she found herself in, clearly comparing herself to Penny, and coming short. </p><p>After several shots, I ordered them to change pose, going through several rapid poses in several succession, both trying to grasp the light layout of the environment to best represent their traits, and letting them get used to being in front of the camera together. </p><p>“Tell me about the characters,” I asked Nancy while they were following my orders. </p><p>“Sure. The warrior has born in the middle of-“ she started. </p><p>“We don’t have the time for a full story, honey,” I cut her off. “Just give me a brief breakdown of two characters. Are they friends, enemies, rivals?” </p><p>“R-rivals define them best, I guess,” Nancy stammered, caught shocked at the sudden cut. “The story starts with the warrior capturing the thief, before they start working together as a part of a wider group, trying to take down-“ she tried to explain. </p><p>“Excellent, that’s all I need,” I said, cutting her off again. This time, it wasn’t to annoy her, or achieve some kind of advantage, but for more practical considerations. We simply didn’t have enough time to waste in descriptions that wouldn’t help at the moment. </p><p>Normally, I would have extended that moment for a good half an hour, to make sure the models weren’t feeling self-conscious and get in the role properly. But we had no option if we wanted to arrive at the convention center on time.</p><p>Luckily, with those character explanations, the tension between them was not a problem but a feature.  </p><p>“So, let’s start by giving up some character. Penny, stand in front of Nancy, your faces need to be apart exactly by an inch, and look at her as angry as you can manage.” She tried, but deliberate anger wasn’t her best effort. “Try to remember how it felt when Nancy deliberately hurt you during makeup just because she was jealous.” </p><p>That worked wonders to bring that flash of anger I was hoping for. Even better, a genuine shock flashed through Nancy’s face, selling the idea I was seeking even better. </p><p>“I didn’t,” Nancy stammered as she tried to look away, which gave me another opportunity to catch a good pose. </p><p>“Keep looking at Penny, don’t avoid her,” I ordered. “And Penny, grab her chin. Tender, but enough to give an impression of power. Don’t forget, you have just caught this lowly thief under your power. She’s under your power, completely.” </p><p>“I like it,” Penny said, her smile widening, with a surprising amount of danger radiating beautifully from her gaze. </p><p>She was such a little paradoxical treasure. Totally submissive and silly, but with a surprising capacity for intimidation once explicitly ordered. </p><p>Such a little pet to enjoy. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I walked closer, taking a few shots, Nancy’s fear genuine as she found herself pinned under Penny’s surprising flash of intimidation. Which worked excellently for my purposes to sell the character, even better than I hoped. </p><p>I decided to lean on that aspect. I pulled off my belt. It was a credit to our relationship that neither girl reacted that the slightest, though that stability didn’t continue when I passed the belt to Penny. </p><p>“W-what do you have in mind?” Nancy stammered in shock even as Penny grabbed the belt, her eyes widening, her supposed redhead courage melting immediately. </p><p>“Don’t worry, she’s going to use that as a rope, to tie you up properly. Just put your hands behind you,” I said to Nancy. I waited until she actually followed that and Penny wrapped the belt around her wrists before I turned my gaze to Penny. “Try not to hurt her … too much,” I said. </p><p>“W-wait,” Nancy stammered, but a pained gasp cut through her mouth as Penny tightened the belt even more. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured even as I took several photos, even better than the last. “Don’t worry, Nancy, the photos are amazing,” I murmured. “They are going to make you a very successful writer.” </p><p>With that, I asked them to give several variations of the captured scene, more than enough to give the buyers as a freebie. Nancy’s panic combined with Penny’s anticipation, some pictures turned out amazing, so much that, after five minutes of shooting with Nancy’s hands tied gave me more than enough material to be given as a bonus. </p><p>I checked my watch before looking at them again with a smirk. We still had some time for a bonus photo set. Their smiles — enthusiastic for Penny, and hesitant for Nancy — told me that they were very much aware of the direction it was headed.</p><p>And even better, we still had some time to kill. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Of course, that gentle hopes ultimately disintegrated under the weight of reality, forcing me to switch back to chess from football. </p><p>The reason. I realized that no matter how many attackers I had tackled, no matter how many passes I had intercepted and quarterbacks I sacked, I barely got any attention from the college scouts, while my worse playing teammates received much more attention. </p><p>A disparity that grew even more as their growth spurt overshadowed mine. Not a big gap, but that that level, running forty yards in four-six rather than four-eight, or benching two-twenty instead of one-ninety was a huge gap. </p><p>So much that, my tactics and mental abilities were simply ignored. </p><p>I didn’t accept that at first, of course. </p><p>I had assumed that I could overcome that. I was the star new player in my first year, and while I started to lose that status at the beginning of the second year, where my peers started to eclipse me physically, I hoped that I could overcome it. </p><p>But teammates who could never play as well started to get longer and longer meetings with the scouts while I went ignored, I learned a painful lesson. I realized that no scout would risk his reputation for a physically inferior player. </p><p>It was unfair, of course. But unfairness wasn’t something I needed any reminder about. So, rather than risking my last years hoping to find an open-minded scout that would take a chance on me, I decided to switch back to chess early enough to get a partial scholarship. </p><p>A strategy that worked, allowing me to attend college due to an unholy combination of student depths, scholarship, and part-time work. </p><p>Still, as I watched the defense team slowly leave the locker room and take the field, it was hard to claim I wasn’t feeling bitter. </p><p>After all, sports was the one persistent hope for every inner-city kid, hoping sports would balance out their unlucky hand in the beginning. Learning that, no matter how much I worked my physical capabilities wouldn’t allow me to take the next step was a bitter realization.</p><p>Bitter enough that, if I wasn’t trying to trick my mysterious guide, I doubted that I would have taken a step into the field. </p><p>I was bitter, but not bitter enough to prefer angering a thousands-of-years-old mysterious magical being over trying to join the practice squad. The extra scholarship was a nice bonus. </p><p>Luckily, the defense team left the locker room and took the field, pulling me out of the depressive place my thoughts had sunk into. I prepared myself to mock the loose discipline of the defense team… </p><p>Only to be surprised completely. </p><p>Unlike the offense, who looked like a bunch of bandits despite their explosive physical traits, they looked like a well-oiled army, moving between drills with mechanical precision. And whenever they failed, it earned a number of burning curses from an old man standing in the middle of them. </p><p>The defensive coach, no doubt. Exactly my kind of an old goat as well, if the way the defense team had been working was any indicator. </p><p>Meanwhile, a younger coach — in coaching standards, probably in his earlier thirties — was walking among the offense team, joking and laughing among them. Probably the assistant coach for the offense or something, I decided. Whomever he was, however, he was clearly a failure. </p><p>Then, another man walked toward us, with a tag on his chest marking him as the physical trainer, the guy responsible for the general strength and speed improvements of the team.</p><p>A good idea to give the first test for the practice team candidates, to make sure we wouldn’t keel over after a little three-mile run before passing us to the real coaches. </p><p>And just like that, an hour passed, the people around me cursing and crying as we run for another torturous dash training, making it even harder for themselves. </p><p>I smiled despite the pain. I always liked pushing myself physically, and despite my unwillingness to relive the pain of rejection, the physical part of the training was an old friend. </p><p>Normally, this part of the training would have barely taken half an hour, but we already completed an hour. Clearly, they were extending to peel out the weaker links. </p><p>Survival of the fittest at its best. </p><p>And it was a smart decision. More than one candidate left the field with grumbles, cursing that it was unfair to work that hard just for a ten percent extra scholarship for their school fees. In the end, there were little more than thirty people left for the next stage. </p><p>“Enough, take five,” called the physical trainer when we almost reached one and half hours, and left us on the field.</p><p>“Man, what a hardass,” murmured the guy next to me, but I just ignored him, waiting for the practice coach team to arrive. </p><p>We didn’t wait five minutes but fifteen, and at first, I assumed that it was another test, before I realized who the coach was walking toward us. </p><p>It was the same coach that had been walking among the offense players, chatting with them like they were friends rather than trying to discipline them, and I realized that maybe it wasn’t another test. </p><p>Maybe it meant we were about to deal with a bad coach. </p><p>I examined the coach as he walked forward. A man in his early thirties, wearing clothes clearly too expensive to be bought by the salary of an assistant coach. Considering his earlier display with the offense team, despite their lax discipline, it didn’t help my first impression. </p><p>I kept my mouth shut, of course. Not even he started speaking. No need to annoy myself for the sake of a clearly incompetent assistant coach. </p><p>“I’m Coach Spencer, the Head Coach of Sunset Pirates,” he said with an abrasive tone. </p><p>Just like that, I understood why the team was currently building a legendary loss streak. Coach Spencer’s high-class accent, clear lack of experience, his expensive clothes, and even more expensive watch all shouted one of two possibilities.</p><p>Nepotism, or bribery. </p><p>Or maybe a combination of both, I thought, but before I continue with that line of thought, he spoke again. “Since the weaklings are gone, we can start the assessment,” he said dismissively, like we weren’t worth his time. </p><p>Yet, he was still insistent on assessing us as the Head Coach rather than just delegating it to the other coaches. It was horrible news, though that went a long way to explain why they were suddenly looking for new practice squad members in the middle of the playing season. </p><p>Some of the other students came to the same decision as me, but lacked the foresight to suppress their reaction. “Is there something funny!” Coach Spencer exploded immediately, looking at the nearest one responsible for the snicker. </p><p>“N-nothing,” the boy managed to stammer. </p><p>“Do you think I’m the janitor, boy? Call me coach,” he shouted, quick to lash out. </p><p>Excellent, I thought with a sigh, though making sure that particular expression wasn’t caught by our dear coach. </p><p>It was a wonder how people made that mistake, but there was a difference between being tough and being a bitchy asshole who thought who shouted loudest meant toughness. And the petulance in his tone firmly put him in the second category. </p><p>An ugly, dangerous combination with the watch on his wrist, more expensive than a car. And I wasn’t just talking about my own junk car, but an actual, expensive sports car.  </p><p>Perfect, I thought with a subtle shake of my head, letting my shoulders loosen just a touch more, not wanting to get the attention of the entitled asshole coach. Ultimately, he was the Head Coach, which meant he would spend not much with the practice squad after flexing a bit. </p><p>I just needed to keep my head down for a while. </p>",
