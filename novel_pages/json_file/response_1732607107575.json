    "content": "<p>As I left the headmistress’s room, my first direction was the walls, and saw soldiers and mages, trying to mobilize for battle. </p><p>Though, if I didn’t know better, I would have thought that they were trying to reenact the actions of a bunch of headless chickens as the mobilization efforts failed utterly. Even as I watched, one soldier carried a bundle of food to a pile, but the moment he put it down, another soldier arrived and carried it back. </p><p>Yet, not even for a moment, I attributed that to incompetence. The guards of Silver Spires were not the greatest, but they were far from the level of casual incompetency they had been displaying. </p><p>There was one thing that could easily explain the situation. Conflicting orders. </p><p>Guessing the source of those conflicting orders was even easier. The spies were acting even more brazen. </p><p>I sighed even as I leaned back against the wall, pinching the bridge of my nose as if the pain would help me come to a decision faster. </p><p>It wasn’t the existence of the spies that surprised me. I knew of their existence for a long, long time, but I didn’t focus on cleaning them. A part of that decision was about the lack of time. I always had more important things to focus on. </p><p>Yet, another part had been the use of their existence. I was confident to hide my own actions and the full extent of my power from those spies, and in that case, those spies actually turned into a liability against the enemy. </p><p>As long as they survived, the enemy was under the impression that they knew what was going on. The moment those spies were lost, they would know the existence of an unpredictable factor, and start reacting accordingly. </p><p>It was that fact that was troubling me even at the moment, making it a difficult decision. </p><p>I paused a moment, letting my mind focus on all the attack reports I had collected, trying to factor in the spies acting without the fear of getting caught. </p><p>“What’s the point of trying to keep the cards hidden,” I decided. I wasn’t sure the enemy was finally using their full capabilities, but without a doubt, they were using enough force to reveal a considerable portion of the capabilities I had been hiding, enough to show them their spies had been useless for a long time. </p><p>Cleaning the spies was not hard, but it was time-intensive work, especially doing it in a way without creating a big crisis. It would have ruined my plans…</p><p>If I didn’t have a convenient assistant, with abilities and capabilities that were perfect for the task. I paused for a moment to change my outfit to the mysterious man, then I stopped by Mariel’s office to take something that would help immensely during my next step… </p><p>Before I moved toward the Royal Quarters. </p><p>With my growing familiarity, passing through the wards had been trivial, just as it was trivial for me to avoid the soldiers moving in hurriedly. Unlike the soldiers outside, they were moving with speed and precision as I saw Delia incarnation of the princess raining orders on them. </p><p>A soft caress of mana showed that it was not the princess that was disguised, but controlling remotely. </p><p>They were mobilizing, but it looked like the princess was preparing to leave rather than defend. She clearly saw what I saw with the spies, and decided that the smartest thing was to draw her own path. </p><p>It was indeed smart, but directly against my objectives. I decided to give her a better option. </p><p>The connection between the puppet and the princess was subtle, but not subtle enough to make it difficult for me to actually track her. I quickly moved, and found the princess alone, her gaze shut. </p><p>I stood in front of her, easily avoiding her wards to stand in front of her, and tapped her head. “Wake up, sleepyhead,” I said cheerfully as she jerked in fear, which was justified, as I could have easily killed her. </p><p>She was able to suppress her fear quickly as she noticed the identity of her attacker. “G-good morning, sir,” she managed to say, delivering it perfectly after the slight hitch in her tone at the beginning. “How can I help you?” </p><p>Her eyes were interesting, reflecting anger and fear in equal amounts, with a dash of arousal sprinkled in. Clearly, my earlier visit had left a mark. </p><p>“I’m here to offer you a deal,” I said, which made her eyebrow quirk considering my word selection. “Yes, you are free to reject if you want, with no consequences,” I added. </p><p>“I trust you, sir,” she said, though I could see her disbelief, which was not entirely inaccurate. Luckily for her, I was actually telling the truth, and actually wanted to entice her rather than forcing her.</p><p>After all, I didn’t know just how long this struggle would take, and it was much easier to trust her if she was fighting for an amazing reward rather than being forced. Especially with the delicate nature of the task, I was going to assign to her. </p><p>“Good, I’m sure you noticed the little scuffle that was going on outside as those annoying flies decided to target my cute junior,” I said, then reached to caress her cheek, making her tremble with the sudden pleasure, the small trick I used letting her skin flare with pleasure. </p><p>“Yes, I did, sir,” she said, but didn’t comment further. </p><p>“That is giving me a bit of a problem. You see, I don’t want to intervene directly and show her my lack of trust, but I also don’t want her to fail.” I made a show of shuddering. “You see, I don’t want her to get sad.” She nodded. “That’s where you come in. You’re going to help her to the best of your abilities, and make sure the school doesn’t collapse under attack.” </p><p>She stood still for a moment, giving me a chance to continue before finally speaking. “And, since you said that you’ll give me an option, I’m assuming there’s a reward,” she said, softly yet confidently. </p><p>Just not confident enough to hide the fear she was feeling. Still, I was impressed. It was not as easy to actually challenge someone with such a power imbalance, and it was even harder to do so with the soft manner she had done. </p><p>Her political instincts were truly impeccable, which made me confident about the next task. </p><p>“I’ll have two tasks for you, and as a reward, I’ll have two rewards,” I said as I put my hand on her shoulder. “The first task is the simple one. I want to you stay in Silver Spires, and help my junior direct the defensive efforts, and the resettlement of the refugees,” I said. </p><p>“Refugees? What refugees?” she asked. </p><p>“There will be a general retreat, but it’ll probably take a while to be declared officially, but start preparing for it. As a princess, you have the reputation and required the ability to actually command that many people,” I said. </p><p>“And the reward?” she asked. </p><p>“The thing you want,” I answered. </p><p>“The throne,” she murmured in fascination. </p><p>“Exactly, the lesser reward is the throne,” I said. </p><p>“L-lesser reward,” she stammered. Her emotions started from anger, which I didn’t take seriously considering my words could easily be taken as an insult to her family. Then, it clicked with her that, when someone as strong as I was displaying had the qualifications to position that. “And, what do I need to do for the greater reward?” </p><p>I looked toward the window with obvious distaste. “This place is infested with annoying cockroaches that are constantly troubling my junior, and management is not her forte. I want you to get rid of all those annoying bugs that feed information to others, no matter which organization. Guilds, other princes, royal family … and most importantly, those annoyances that dare to call themselves Eternal, even if they spawn like frogs and die as easy as flies,” I said, deliberately letting my tone fill with emotion. </p><p>Yet, I deliberately showed annoyance rather than hate, showing that it was just the numbers that troubled me, and not the power they represented. It wasn’t true, of course, but the more the princess believed my power, the more committed she would be to proving herself. </p><p>“I can do that, but it would not be easy. I will make too many enemies,” she said, but this time, she didn’t mention a reward. Smart. </p><p>“Second reward is very simple. I’ll give you power enough to make it very problematic to actually exact revenge,” I said.</p><p>She looked at me, clearly unconvinced. But even as she opened her mouth, I leaned and captured her lips, flooding her body with mana. </p><p>For some of it, I used my simple trick and gave her as Experience. It was enough to make her eyes widen, as she was already at her modest level cap of six, which was particularly bad for someone in her position. </p><p>Of course, her abilities with the Darkness spark allowed her to compensate for that, but if there was no need to compensate, things would have been much more different. </p><p>[-1380 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Tantric]</p><p>I didn’t have the luxury to spend mana, but it had been a long while since I had been leveling up someone that weak, and the efficiency was simply impressive. In a moment, she had climbed to level ten, gaining four levels. </p><p>“I-impossible,” she gasped as I pulled back. </p><p>“Oh, if you think that’s impossible, I wonder what you’ll say about this,” I said as I leaned again, amused that, this time, she had jumped to meet me halfway. But this time, my mana didn’t target the borders of the soul space, but the little corner that was hiding the Darkness Spark.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 7821 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [115/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>At this point, I was familiar with the operation of Silver Spires to know exactly where to look to get a comprehensive view of the situation, and it was not the commander’s office. </p><p>My destination was not one of the command rooms, but a less important location. The communication room. </p><p>Responsible for collecting and aggregating every single emergency message the school received from the surrounding towns. </p><p>I did so, because while accessing raw information was time-consuming, it was certainly not as time-consuming as trying to unravel the warped reports of the ones responsible for analyzing that information. </p><p>I needed to spend some time to get rid of all spies there, but it was one of the tasks I was procrastinating repeatedly, more important — or more entertaining — tasks taking priority. </p><p>I cast a sleeping spell on the people that were manning the room to keep my intrusion hidden. The spell was ingenious, not only sending them to sleep, but also ensuring that they wouldn’t realize that they had a five-minute gap in their memories. </p><p>It was a good idea to keep the source of my information hidden. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean every single message was reliably correct. Far from it, and not because the ones that sent those messages were actually enemy agents. No, they were ordinary guards defending their town, which probably assumed exaggerating the threat would allow them to receive help quickly. </p><p>“Not all of them, at least,” I murmured as I went through the first few messages, seeing exaggerated action reports, describing monster hordes attacking from the north and west that was far too big to be believable. Then, I moved to the next one, which described a fresh undead army attacking from the south. </p><p>My frown was already deepening at this point, then, I read one report in the South, about a great forest fire with supernatural origins, forcing the town to evacuate. </p><p>I started going through the reports even quicker, but my earlier disbelief was abandoned. My stats allowed me to go through all information easily, but the results didn’t help my mood the slightest. </p><p>I realized the Silver Spires were under siege once more, and, if even a fraction of the information I could read here was accurate, it was a far bigger threat than Zokras had ever presented, even with the assistance of the beast hordes. </p><p>I didn’t even bother speculating about the source of the attack before I burst into action, sending magical messages. Two of them went to a great distance, utilizing the teleportation trick — as I had managed to understand the mechanics enough to send a small, sealed package without going myself as long as there was a beacon —  to Titania and Helga, warning both of them to be alert for an attack. </p><p>The risk of a coordinated attack was simply too great. </p><p>With that warning, both teams knew what to do. </p><p>The third message went to Oeyne, asking her to drop everything she was busy with, arm herself, and go to the headmistress’ tower, ready to intervene in case of an ambush, and ignore every order that didn’t come directly from the headmistress. </p><p>Another message went to Janelor, asking her to be ready for any potential intrusion. </p><p>Then, after some pause, I created another lengthy message to Helga — too big to be safely teleported — and hid it in my room, in Helga’s favorite book, with a small ward to alert her once she entered there, explaining the important facts and developments I had managed to discover, the secrets of the Eternals, the Princess, the headmistress, and the dragon, giving her the chance to keep things under control in case of an emergency. </p><p>I had a bad feeling about the intensity of the situation, and I wanted her to be ready in case I had to pull away from the school temporarily. </p><p>I didn’t send a message to Mariel. </p><p>I went back to her room directly, and find her still lying on the bed, but she had several reports in hand, and was reading through them with a serious expression. The moment I entered, her wings furled around her body, hiding her nakedness from me while her blush intensified further. </p><p>Tempting. If the crisis that I was facing was any simpler, I would have loved to spend twenty minutes enjoying the benefits of her shy reaction. </p><p>Pity the situation felt far too dangerous to enjoy such a delay, not when several sources of attack had been triggered. </p><p>“The situation is grim,” I said. </p><p>“It seems so,” she said, but her intensity certainly didn’t match mine. I would have loved to assume it was about the mood she was in after my extended efforts to keep her happy, but I knew that it wasn’t the case. </p><p>“Let me check those reports,”  I said as I pulled them off her hand. I had no doubt that, just yesterday, that would have created a great negative reaction of her, maybe enough to make her attack me. This time, she just blushed as our fingers touched momentarily. </p><p>Pity the situation was too urgent to tease her about that. </p><p>Instead, I focused on the report. The contents were horrible enough to justify my quick trip to the massage room. The threat was undersold greatly, the unquenchable forest fire reduced to a simple fire, the undead army reduced to just an accidental remnant, and the monster hordes diminished. </p><p>Oh, they did so in a way that would keep them safe, mentioning the same aspects that initially made me doubt their validity, but they carefully avoided mentioning the number of messages from different sources that drew the same picture, which increased their reliability significantly. </p><p>As expected, they were offering a conservative action plan. I had no doubt that they would change the recommendation in a few hours, once it was too late to intervene with most of the armed forces. </p><p>Forcing the real elites to leave Silver Spires. </p><p>I frowned, wondering who was the target of the plan. Titania, Mariel, Janelor, the Princess? </p><p>Or maybe me, which would make my next action rather idiotic, but sometimes, it was best to react immediately. </p><p>I pulled a quill toward me and started doing corrections on the page, before passing it to her to read. She did so, her expression getting tighter, which didn’t help when I passed the next few reports. </p><p>“How sure you are about its necessity?” she asked, her voice grave as her nudity momentarily forgotten. </p><p>“I’m sure enough to be actually afraid of the consequences,” I said.</p><p>“Maybe I should go and —“ she started, but I didn’t miss the enthusiasm in her tone under her seriousness. Understandable, as our ‘treatment’ told us that for the first time in a very long time, she was free to act outside the suppression wards without directly imploding. </p><p>“No, there’s a chance that you’re the target. We can’t afford it.” </p><p>“I don’t think that they would do so after all that time —“ she said, but I used the opportunity to kiss her lips, using the opportunity to cast a spell on her, a Biomancy spell to enhance the daze she was feeling. </p><p>She would have easily resisted it if she wasn’t far too occupied by the way my tongue invaded her beautiful mouth, moaning softly. As much as I enjoyed her sound, it wasn’t just about the pleasure. </p><p>[-2830 Mana]</p><p>I used it to deliver a great amount of mana in a flood, and unlike the other attempts, it carried the maximum amount of Tantric effect I was able to manage, hastening her Divine Spark transformation significantly.</p><p>Enough that I was confident she could operate outside the wards for several minutes without a significant side effect. But that was the limit even if I didn’t want to save some of my mana for the upcoming conflict, as the Divine Spark I transformed still needed to actually bond with her body to be useful, which was not instant.  </p><p>I cast the spell to make her dazed, because I didn’t want to reveal just how much control I had over the process. When I pulled back, she was still gasping in pleasure. </p><p>“I don’t want to risk you,” I said, and she nodded shyly, still under the effect of the searing kiss. “I even arranged a trusted bodyguard warrior for you, you can trust her to block others until Titania return.” </p><p>“W-what should I do, then?” she asked. </p><p>“Give the order to evacuate all the cities, and pull the population back to Silver Spires, I don’t think we can defend against the attack otherwise. I have a feeling that it’s just to the first wave.” </p><p>“We can’t just house all of them here, we don’t have the facilities,” she said. </p><p>“Then, we set up a city outside the first one. It wouldn’t take too long to set up a secondary set of wards, I’ll create the basis before I leave,” I said before I pulled the map, and pointed several towns to the North as we started discussing the evacuation efforts. </p><p>I wanted to target the ones that were too far away from Silver Spires. Those towns were critical to establishing a trade line, but I had a feeling that trade wouldn’t be a priority concern for a long while. </p><p>“Those towns should receive the first orders to retreat,” I said. </p><p>“But they are too far away from us, the reinforcements won’t be there on time.” </p><p>“I know,” I answered. “That’s why I would go there personally to make sure the evacuation works as intended.” </p><p>“Alone!” she gasped in shock. “It’s too risky—“ she started, only to be interrupted by another kiss, but this time, without the mana infusion. </p><p>Under the circumstances, I didn’t have the luxury to waste time, so I pulled back after silencing her. “That’s better than the alternative, don’t worry, I know how to defend myself,” I said to her. </p><p>It earned a hesitant nod from her, and we turned our attention back to the evacuation plan, and how to arrange setting up the refugee areas. </p><p>Luckily, Oeyne was not only a bodyguard. As an accomplished blacksmith, she was a good candidate to handle the communication between the Guild Members and the headmistress despite the bad blood between them. </p><p>Especially once Titania returns to take the role of a bodyguard. </p><p>Five minutes later, we had a beginning of a plan. </p><p>I would have loved to stay and direct the organization myself. Unfortunately, I had a trap to set at the north. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 6933 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I let the kiss extend, and it wasn’t only the great pleasure it had given me that made me keep my lips in place. </p><p>No, I used our closeness to let my magic slip into hers, getting a comprehensive diagnostic on her body — a process that had gone much better than I expected thanks to the nature of our connection, allowing my mana to slip into her body with the same ease her own mana did. </p><p>Giving me a perfect view of her current state. </p><p>And the diagnostic was … she was well. Better than well, even, as I expected some kind of damage left by the mana that went feral on her. However, on the contrary, there was not even the slightest damage in her body left as an after-effect. </p><p>Which was hard to believe, as if I experienced a similar loss of control with a spell, the consequences would range from temporary loss of my casting ability … to permanent loss of … well, my life. </p><p>On the contrary, not only she didn’t have even the slightest hint of damage, but she was actually showing signs of powering up. </p><p>Just another sign of the extraordinary, logic-defying nature of the living fire. </p><p>What an interesting phenomenon, I decided as I stopped diagnosing, confirming there was no magical reason for her not to repeat. </p><p>However, I didn’t pull back from the kiss, instead letting my hands dance over her body. I was horny — as there was a limit for how long I could resist her shimmering naked body while she spent the better part of the last half an hour sitting on my lap — but it wasn’t the reason for that. </p><p>No, my thoughts were simpler. Since our ‘closeness’ was the reason she was able to break the block she was suffering in the first place, there was no harm in a repeat before another attempt. </p><p>She wrapped her legs around my waist as I pushed her toward the nearest tree. Though whether she was in the same mind for the benefits of ‘exercising’ before another transformation attempt, or she just wanted some pleasure was doubtful. </p><p>I extended a kiss for a long time, and when I pulled back, she was gasping for air, her skin glistening with fire once more.</p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but glimpse at the tree behind us, expecting it to already smolder. Yet, the tree was growing, at a noticeable speed, its leaves getting greener. While, flowers were appearing under her feet.</p><p>Showing that, I was misunderstanding the capabilities of the living fire even now. </p><p>Yet, even a part of my mind was busy with the theoretical implications of it, I let my hand slide down, running down her breasts and onto her thighs before delving inside her wetness. </p><p>Her moan was spectacular even as her hand landed on my body, quickly working on my remaining items of clothing to make me match her in nudity. </p><p>As a reward, I pushed my hips forward, replacing my fingers with a different part of my anatomy, earning a beautiful moan as a reward in the process. It was a quick, reckless shove, but the noises rising from her showed she had no problem with the rapid invasion. </p><p>Her wetness was quick to accommodate my girth as I let my hips move recklessly, my hands on her shoulders, pinning her against the tree. Her wings started to flicker as the pleasure invaded her body, growing larger to touch the nearby trees, the forest gaining a new lease of life. </p><p>I was glad for our connection, as, without it, I would have retreated, fearing a sudden transformation. Instead, I enjoyed her supernatural warmth as I slammed inside her again and again, with no pause between beats.</p><p>“Harder,” she moaned, showing her lack of dissatisfaction with my roughness. Her tits jiggled under my reckless assault, which worked wonders to raise my desire to match hers. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I made a gesture, and two chains rose from the ground and wrapped around her arms, pinning her against the tree. My hips continued their reckless assault while I leaned down, biting her breasts hard enough to leave a mark. </p><p>Interestingly, her great healing factor didn’t immediately cure the mark I left on her skin, leaving it to contrast against her perfectly pale skin, even as the flame dancing on her skin touched my tongue, tickling gently.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!” she moaned, her eyes firmly shut as she enjoyed the assault, even as I pushed myself to the limit, thrusting so fast that she failed to catch her breath between her cries. </p><p>\"I'm cumming,\" she managed to mutter, wasting the precious air she managed to steal between her moans, but I didn’t take that as a sign to slow down. Instead, I brought my teeth around her nipple, the sudden jolt of pain enough to push her over the edge. </p><p>She tightened around me even as her flames intensified, but I didn’t stop the assault even for a moment, wanting to push her to a delirium hard enough for her to forget herself. </p><p>I had a feeling that, she would have better success in that unique place between pleasure and unconsciousness, and if not, I could always block her mana again. </p><p>When she opened her eyes, her gaze was blank with pleasure as she looked at the sky, her moans endless. </p><p>The rapid invasion of her body continued as her pleasure grew to a new stage, each second teaching her a new meaning of ecstasy. Her wings of flame grew bigger, even more, majestic than her transformation attempt like she was using pleasure as fuel. </p><p>Her skin was long covered with flames, but they were getting more and more intense as well. Not to the point, it created the silhouette of a bird, but still majestic, almost like she was halfway in transforming.</p><p>It confirmed that my strategy was the correct one, especially since her face lacked the panic and alarm that she had during her last attempt that forced me to abort it. </p><p>I kept my focus on her face to catch any signs of alarm, afraid that I might push her too much for my own great pleasure. </p><p>Especially since she wasn’t the only one benefiting from it. As we continued, the connection between us started to get stronger, with a corresponding increase in my reserves. Just another few percent, but in my situation, it was still a miracle. </p><p>The concrete sense of getting stronger pushed my own pleasure even further, dangerously close to an explosion. I squeezed my teeth to suppress the sensation, doing my best to last until Cinder could reach a second climax.</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I noticed Isolde getting closer once more, but this time, her tenseness was more about the intense jealousy she was feeling rather than fear about unknown magic. A point to be addressed, but not right at the moment, not when Cinder was occupying my full attention.  </p><p>I pushed in even more aggressively, her moans and her blank expression showing she wasn’t too far away from a second climax, allowing me to relax in terms of my own limits. Soon, I exploded inside her, her moans growing beautifully in the process.  </p><p>“Now, transform,” I ordered even as I exploded into her, triggering another climax. She looked at me blankly, right at the edge of unconsciousness, but that didn’t prevent a ghost of a huge bird from coalescing around her as I injected the last drop inside her.</p><p>I pulled — several steps, just in case — and started to create a ward just like the last time to block the explosion in case she lost control again, and I needed to intervene. </p><p>Isolde didn’t trust magic, but between standing behind it and trusting Cinder’s wild transformation, there was no question about which one was more reliable. </p><p>“Beautiful, right,” I said as I watched the flames gather around Cinder, but I grabbed Isolde’s waist and pulled her in front of me, my hand slipping into her pants. “Not as beautiful as your wetness, of course, beautiful,” I whispered into her ear, chuckling. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she whispered, but that didn’t help her to contain her moan.</p><p>I chuckled, amused by her prickly exterior, but even as I teased her, my attention was on Cinder, the flames around her getting more and more … real, even though it was not the best term. </p><p>Then suddenly, at one point, she stopped being a beautiful woman surrounded by flames, and actually become a bird of flame, the power and heat radiating, even though that flame only made the surrounding plants grow more and more. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I murmured even as I started casting more and more wards while she took flight, but my target was the wards surrounding the meadow. They were not geared to suppress such a spectacular view, forcing me to reinforce them. </p><p>Yet, even as I did so, I focused on Cinder, radiating a power of majesty that made a mockery of her name. </p><p>Fascinating…</p>",

    "content": "<p>However, as much as teasing Megan had been fun, my words about needing a walk to gather my thoughts were not an excuse. </p><p>Walking helped me to gather my thoughts, and I had a lot of things to think about, the premier topic being the next steps of action now that Coach Bill was gone. </p><p>Completely abandoning the football team was certainly tempting, as dealing with all those rich, entitled kids, and an even richer and more entitled coach to rule the team. Without Coach Bill to shelter the team, I had no doubt that it would turn into an unbearable hell. </p><p>Yet, the incredible flood of Intent I received as the people cheered boundlessly, was not something that I could easily sacrifice. To finally awaken my Guide even if I couldn’t find a way to push my traits over five. </p><p>I needed her awake, because I needed the information she could provide. Her memory might be spotty, and her personality might be inconsistent, but that didn’t change the fact that, unless I managed to stumble up to some kind of wondrous ancient tome that conveniently explained the mystery I found myself facing, she was my only source of information. </p><p>To a lesser degree, I needed to stop her constant absorption. Without that, I could easily develop different traits. As the chess tournament showed, the attention of several dozens of people was more than enough to give me some Traits</p><p>And while they only provided relatively small, incremental benefits, I wasn’t at a point of turning my back on any kind of incremental benefits, even the weakest ones. </p><p>Making her recovery a priority, meaning I wasn’t in a position to miss all football season. </p><p>Even missing a match hurt, but at this point, it seemed to be inevitable. </p><p>I continued to walk toward my dorm, the roads were mostly empty this hour. My thoughts and emotions were as tumultuous as a thunderstorm as I thought about the challenge that was foisted upon me, pushing a scowl on my face.</p><p>Then, that sensation disappeared, replaced by much more intense and immediate emotion, one that was marked by a rapid thumping of my heart and a crawling sensation on the back of my head. </p><p>Mortal danger. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I had felt such a sensation. Growing up in the streets, I faced many situations that would have likely ended up sending me to my final destination, or, at a minimum, a grievous injury. </p><p>Yet, it was the first time I felt so without the slightest appearance of danger. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the System and my Guide, I might have ignored that as a figment of my imagination, as walking in the middle of the night was hardly an issue. </p><p>Instead, I ducked and rolled forward — which I did with a shocking ease thanks to my Agility. </p><p>A smart decision, as it turned out, as I felt something passing over my head, something that cuts through the air with a suspicious whistling sound suggesting a cutting edge. </p><p>Just low enough to hit my neck if I hadn’t rolled forward, with likely very deadly consequences.  </p><p>Before I could even finish the roll, I started analyzing the situation. First, who was trying to kill me — as there was no doubt what would have been my end if I hadn’t rolled forward — and how the hell they sneaked close enough without me noticing in such an empty road. </p><p>Also, who the fuck used a blade to kill someone. It wasn’t like guns were a hard commodity to reach. </p><p>Yet, as I completed my roll and came face to face with my attacker, I received my answer. </p><p>Mostly because face-to-face was a misnomer. My attacker didn’t have a face, or any other features. </p><p>It was just a shadow, pitch black and flickering, roughly in the shape of a man. The only thing that didn’t flicker aggressively was the blade it was holding in its hand. A pure block of darkness, still radiating a cold feeling of sharpness. </p><p>It didn’t take a genius to realize that touching that blade was a bad idea, so, when the shadow attacked me, I rolled back, doing my best to avoid the attack, far quicker than its attack seemed to require. </p><p>It turned out to be a good idea, because it managed to stop halfway before swinging it toward my belly, seemingly unaffected by pesky concerns like momentum and other rules of physics. </p><p>The creepy way it moved was enough to send a crawling sensation through my heart — even more than the fact that it was clearly trying to murder me. </p><p>It was simply unnatural. </p><p>I wanted to just turn and dash away, but unfortunately, I had no idea about the speed it could display, so instead, I chose to dodge, its attacks. </p><p>I dodged as wide as possible, but not without committing the moves fully, watching his attack patterns. And, even as I did so, I couldn’t help but feel glad for the fight I had started earlier. </p><p>Without the boost from the unarmed trait I received, I had little hope of resisting that confusing pattern of assault. Yet, with its assistance, I managed to get a sense of its movement, giving me to understand of its capabilities. </p><p>Capabilities like its speed in a straight line, which was markedly faster than I could achieve even with the assistance of my traits. </p><p>“Stop, please, we can talk,” I said. Not because I actually expected it to be open to a deal, but because I wanted to see whether it would react to my words. </p><p>It didn’t, nor did it change its attack pattern, just slashing toward the direction that it could score a hit easiest. Combined, it didn’t give me an impression of sentience. </p><p>“Time to test,” I murmured even as I baited it to attack upward, while I lashed out with a kick, only for it to pass through its body without any effect. </p><p>Then, I pulled my phone, and turned its flash to the maximum, hoping that bright light might have an effect on it. </p><p>It didn’t. </p><p>The third strategy was to delay it as long as possible, hoping that it had a duration, but a minute later, I changed my mind. I didn’t see any noticeable slowing down.</p><p>Even with the Endurance and Recovery, my body had its limits, especially for something as intense as mortal combat. It was more intense than boxing, and without convenient breaks to fill the distance. </p><p>And, when I tried to block the knife, first with a branch, then with a rock, neither of them worked, not even slowing down as the knife cut through them like butter. </p><p>“Time to take some risks,” I thought even as I tried to reach the system while I baited it with another kick, hoping that the feeling of being connected to the System would somehow give me the ability to resist it. </p><p>It didn’t. </p><p>“To my next trick,” I thought as I frown, hoping that it would work. If it didn’t, my best hope was to escape and steal a car, hoping that it couldn’t move just as fast — or appear from thin air again just like it did earlier. </p><p>I tapped into the intent flow, one that I was receiving continuously thanks to the earlier fight, and channeled it. However, this time, my target was not the system itself, but somehow channeling the flow to my body. </p><p>The first few attempts were just failures, putting me dangerously close to the probability of being skewered as I got distracted by the process. </p><p>Luckily, mortal danger had a way of allowing people to achieve the impossible, and I felt a flicker around my hand. It was a simple, ethereal feeling, one that could be easily mistaken for the cold wind dancing on a sweaty palm, but I wasn’t at a point to mistake that feeling for something so mundane. </p><p>Recognizing the opportunity for what it was, I pushed that hand into the chest of the creature, sliding through its chest, and this time, I felt the slightest resistance. </p><p>And just like that, the shadow dissipated. </p><p>Yet, the blade stayed, hitting the floor, still radiating ominous darkness, enough to make me worried to touch it. So, I poked it with a branch and dragged it to a ditch before covering it with some dirt. </p><p>It was safer than throwing it into the garbage, or worse, carrying it with me. </p><p>With that gone, I looked around, wondering whether there would be a follow attack, but luckily, that seemed not to be the case. </p><p>Yet, as I dashed toward my dorm, I couldn’t help but feel tense. </p><p>Being assassinated by shadow creatures, sent by a mysterious enemy that might or might not be the mysterious darkness an absentminded angel mentioned in passing did that to someone… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“That was not bad,” I murmured as I left the emergency meeting at the dean’s office, one that lasted almost six hours as the Dean and Coach Spencer raged at us for daring to act irresponsibly. </p><p>Naturally, I had been the target of their distaste, but unfortunately for them, they weren’t as intimidating as they assumed themselves to be, and I easily disregarded their pointless rage to focus on something more productive. </p><p>Their attitude might have scared me a bit if it wasn’t for the live stream. An orphan with no money was the excellent scapegoat for such a big scandal, even if I had been the hero of the last football game. </p><p>Especially since Dean cared more about other things than winning, if the assignment of Head Coach was any indicator. </p><p>Yet, as the meeting continued, the intent I received started to get more and more intense rather than slowing down, showing that it was getting even more viral. </p><p>It kept them from making a decision, afraid of the public backlash. </p><p>It was already night when finally came to a decision. Or, more accurately, a nondecision, as they decided to suspend me and Kevin for a while for instigating the fight, while they came to a decision. </p><p>Of course, according to the school rules, they needed to actually suspend the whole team for joining the fight, but that would mean no player for the next week’s game. </p><p>And just like that, walked out, uncaring of the pointed glare of most of the players. At the entrance, I found Megan waiting for me in her car. </p><p>Interesting. </p><p>“Do you need a ride,” she said as she pulled the car.</p><p>“Not as much as you,” I said with a smirk, enjoying her cute blush as I took my seat. </p><p>Then, I turned to catch Kevin’s gaze and waved at him, then the rest of the offensive players, which didn’t exactly help to balm the less-than-positive feelings they had toward me, ruining their triumphant moment. </p><p>Of course, Kevin also received similar gazes, and unlike me, he looked much less prepared to actually handle the such weight, wilting under the collective anger. </p><p>But that was all the attention I gave to his plight as Megan pressed the gas and I drove away. She stayed silent for a moment, giving me a chance to rest, which I appreciated. Not that I was tired, but I used the opportunity to close my eyes and focus on the System once more, triggering it once more to refresh my gains. </p><p>[Unarmed III, Acquired]</p><p>The gains were good enough to put a smile on my face, enjoying the subtle warmth that spread into my body, one that was getting rather familiar. </p><p>“You look chipper,” Megan commented as she continued to drive. “I’m guessing they let you out without punishment.” </p><p>“Even better,” I answered as I opened my eyes once more. “I’m not allowed to play the next game.” Megan quirked an eyebrow, questioning me about that subtly. “It’s good, because it’s the first week without Coach Bill, and apparently, Thad and Carter. It’ll be such a disaster.” </p><p>“And then, they have to reinstate you,” Megan answered. </p><p>“Well, especially if we put a couple videos, that my lovely girlfriend helping me to train, using her precious time to keep me fit so we can serve our school better,” I suggested. </p><p>“And leaking some photos about your difficult training, I’m guessing,” Megan added, trying to sound disinterested, no doubt to frame it like a favor. </p><p>“Well, I’m sure Kim would love to help if you’re busy,” I said, my smile leaving no doubt in her mind to show just how much it would benefit the celebrity personality she was doing her best to create. </p><p>“Asshole,” she murmured, which might have been more intimidating if it wasn’t for the blush that covered her face, no doubt the memories of the night before rushing to her head. She drove in silence for a while. “By the way, they towed your car while you were away,” she said. </p><p>“Parking violation, or the moving company Thad used,” I said. </p><p>“The second,” she answered. </p><p>“Not a problem, it was a borrow in the first place. I have at least a week to find an alternative now that I don’t have to go to the stadium every single day.” Though, as I did so, a frown appeared on my face. </p><p>Not because losing the car, as that was going to happen sooner or later, was how loaners worked. It was the reason I didn’t keep anything important inside in the first place. </p><p>I was more distracted by the great speed of operation. They just had a meeting in the morning, and Coach Bill’s decision had just been declared. Yet, they were moving away quickly enough not to take a car. </p><p>Of course, there was a chance that it was something that they had arranged a while ago, and Carter and Thad had been keeping that under wraps, but that didn’t make much sense either. </p><p>If that had been the case, not only Thad would have mentioned it, but also Carter wouldn’t have given all that trouble to develop me to the new mike — as my achievement of actually playing during that weekend game was completely out of his calculations, making that pointless. </p><p>It was weird.</p><p>Weird enough that I might have started exploring the reason, if I didn’t have more important issues. </p><p>Like the best way to gather more Intent while the team was on a break, preferably doing something that would actually give me some additional abilities. </p><p>“You’re a car enthusiast,” I said as I looked at her. </p><p>That earned a bland glare from her. In lieu of an answer, she pressed the gas a bit, before taking the next turn with a sharpness that would have crashed a less skilled driver impressively. “Really, what did you make thinks so.” </p><p>“Cool it, sweetie,” I said, but I was unable to hold back a chuckle. “I was thinking of finding a classic, maybe something from the fifties, and repairing it,” I said. “You know, for some style.” </p><p>That earned another glare, this time reproachful. “And the budget you have for it is,” she muttered. </p><p>“Practically nonexistent,” I said with a big smile, not feeling even a hint of shame admitting that. “So, it better be real junk.” </p><p>“And, where are you going to repair that junk,” she asked. </p><p>“I’m sure you know a garage that wouldn’t mind letting me borrow the corner they operated, of course,” I said with a smirk. “You know, cashing that favor I earned by playing along.” </p><p>“You already cashed that in last night,” she said. </p><p>“No, sweetie, that was about our little photoshoot, don’t mix things,” I answered. </p><p>“You drive a hard bargain,” she said. </p><p>I chuckled. “Oh, don’t tell me that you don’t benefit from it as well. Think of it, the new power couple of the school, shuffling between a beautiful classic and a modern sports car.” </p><p>“Finding a car on the cheap, arranging a garage… It sounds like a lot of work, more than a simple favor like that deserves,” she finally answered. “Especially since I have to actually arrange the garage.” </p><p>Of course, her statement was not a final comment, but the opening salvo in a long bargain. Too bad for her that I had no intention of playing around. “If you say so,” I murmured. “I’m sure Kim wouldn’t mind helping me to find an old bike.” </p><p>The angry glare that she threw to my side was balm to my wounded little heart. “Fine,” she spat out. “But don’t come to me crying when you ruin the car that I find you with your unskilled hands. My favor is complete regardless of how spectacular your failure is.” </p><p>“Oh, what did I deserve to lose your beautiful trust.” </p><p>“I have seen the state of the garbage you called a car,” she answered. “That’s enough for me not to have the slightest expectation. </p><p> I just smiled at her. She was not wrong, entirely, as while I was decent when it came to repairs, I was mostly self-thought, struggling to keep my bucket of rust running without a problem. </p><p>But, with the System, I was confident to tackle the challenge. </p><p>I glanced at Megan, who was busy driving silently, unable to hide her arousal despite her best efforts. I was tempted to make a move and enjoy that aspect. </p><p>Just not as much as I enjoyed teasing her. </p><p>“You can pull to the side,” I said after a while. “I can walk the rest of the distance.” </p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I need to make some plans for the week, and a walk in the cold would help me think,” I answered. Then, I let my smirk widen. “Unless you have another exercise in mind that could help me put you in the right mood.” </p><p>Her anger was simply beautiful as she pulled to the side with a sharp brake that would have sent me out of the car if it wasn’t for the seatbelt. Dangerous, but not as dangerous as her next move, pressing the gas with her full strength before I could step out. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my Agility gain, I would have ended up on the pavement. For now, however, I waved my hand instead, enjoying her disappearance. </p><p>Hopefully, she wouldn’t try to make me pay back too badly about the car.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>It took everything I had to maintain that smile. “So what,” I said. </p><p>That answer didn’t come from any of the traits, but from the core of my vindictive personality. </p><p>Never show an enemy that their attack hurt. </p><p>And that attack hurt immensely. Coach Bill quitting was a literal disaster. No wonder the rest of the players were just murmuring like headless chickens. </p><p>It was even worse for me. Not because cared much about his assistance — as while he was an excellent coach, I could easily do without him with my cheats. </p><p>Yet, that assumed I would still be in the team, which, considering my tumultuous relationship with the offensive team, and Coach Spencer’s ridiculous coddling attitude toward them, was not very likely. </p><p>“And what if I tell you that Coach took all the good players with him, leaving only rabble behind. No more Thad or Carter to clean up your messes. And seeing you’re still here, he clearly didn’t pick you.”  </p><p>“Oh, I’m shaking in my boots,” I answered, this time not even needing to fake my vicious smile. </p><p>I liked Thad as a friend, and playing with Carter was challenging in a fun way, but their absence certainly worked to my benefit. </p><p>Without them to hold the fort, the defense without Coach Bill’s careful command would turn into a sieve, turning into an even worse disaster than the offense. </p><p>Therefore forcing Coach Spencer to play me. But, I knew for a fact that he wouldn’t do it for the next game. </p><p>And, that meant that I had a choice in front of me. Either let them kick me out of the team silently, or turn that into a spectacle. </p><p>With intent at stake, there was no question about what needed to be done. I brought my hand to my back, looking like I was scratching while I gave the signal to Megan. </p><p>The live stream was turned on, which I didn’t need to check my phone to know, because I felt the flow of Intent getting much stronger. </p><p>Almost immediately as well, showing Megan had made the necessary preparations beforehand if that many people immediately started watching. My guess was, she made some kind of post about a potentially amazing show. </p><p>I had to admit, amazing initiative. Maybe I needed to find a way to reward her without boosting her already dangerous ego any further. </p><p>While I was busy processing the flow, Kevin was busy stammering at the sudden reversal, clearly not expecting the discussion to turn that way. </p><p>Kevin’s frustration at his words failing to register was rather amazing, earning more than a few chuckles from the defensive players, and some angry glares from the offense, not enjoying their triumphant move ruined. </p><p>“Let’s see how you would enjoy when Coach Spencer kicks you out of the team,” he declared after a moment, his expression vindictive. </p><p>Too bad for him that he gave me the opening I needed to bring the discussion to a new place. “So, you’re saying that, Coach Spencer is unprofessional enough to kick his best player off the team just because little Kevin got his feelings hurt after losing his girlfriend.” I chuckled. “Is he that unprofessional?” </p><p>To his credit, not all players were as idiotic enough as Kevin, and some of them had alert expressions on their faces, realizing that my long-winded phrasing was weird enough to be suspicious. </p><p>“Of course, he would. That manchild is too busy squandering his family money to actually work, and he’s too busy reliving his glory days,” Kevin said. “He’ll do anything we ask.” </p><p>“Zip it,” Arnold warned Kevin as he looked back, finally realizing the setup. </p><p>Too bad that he was too late. Kevin was already distracted ad angry as his grand reveal didn’t have the desired impact on his ‘rival’. All I need was to push him a bit more. </p><p>Luckily, Taunt made it much easier. </p><p>“Then tell him to kick me out. It’ll give me more time to seduce your current girlfriend as well,” I said with a smirk. “Do you think I can convince her to dress as a chess queen as well, just to show you have lost another girlfriend to a nerd?” </p><p>That managed to earn an explosive cry from Kevin, and he charged forward, his teammates reacting a second too late to stop him. </p><p>His punch was not half bad, a short jab by his left hand, showing that he had taken at least a few boxing lessons, and it hit my face, giving me a bloody lip. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, I had been punched much harder when I was a literal child, and it would have barely registered even without all my traits reducing the impact even more. </p><p>I didn’t react, which left Kevin confused as he dropped his fist down a bit rather than following up with a straight. He clearly expected me to dodge rather than take it to my face without reacting. </p><p>And he wasn’t the only one that reacted in surprise. The two offensive linemen that rushed forward to pull back Kevin stilled in shock, and so did the defensive players moving forward to intervene.  </p><p>“Ouch,” I said, my voice as flat as I could manage. Then, I let my lips widen, which allowed the blood to spill down more. I could have used Intimidation to push him away. Instead, I used Taunt. </p><p>“Megan spanks harder,” I said, which was all that was needed to enflame his anger. </p><p>Just like that, another punch arrived, this time a right hook. Though, unlike the jab, I didn’t let that one hit, instead ducking underneath and slamming my shoulder to his chest, sending him away stumbling. </p><p>My target, the large center moving forward, acted to separate us. </p><p>“You’re ganging up on me. So be it,” I shouted, more to the sake of the live stream than theirs even as I charged forward with a hook of my own, slamming the center of his chest, right at his diaphragm. Unlike Kevin, I had no problem putting the necessary strength behind a punch to take someone down. </p><p>Without the incredible boost of Strength, even with a sucker punch, I couldn’t take down the giant center easily, which was about a hundred fifty pounds on me. Yet, with that, I actually had to hold back to not actually break a rib. </p><p>He went down wheezing, a shocked expression on his face, out of the fight for more than half a minute. </p><p>Which might as well be an eternity as far as the fights were concerned. </p><p>The other lineman that was coming to separate me and Kevin was quick to charge me, to tackle me down. I dodged, deliberately toward one of the receivers, hotheaded enough to react to my presence. </p><p>But his punch was decidedly lighter than a lineman. </p><p>He attacked from behind — giving an excellent view for the live stream about a cowardly ambush — and I stumbled forward. </p><p>Then, the rest of the defense joined the fray, and mayhem exploded. </p><p>One of the fun things about such chaotic mayhem, it was really hard for anyone to get injured, because people lacked space to put proper strength behind their punches, turning that into a chaotic fight, but little chance to cause actual harm — at least, nothing a few days of bed rest wouldn’t cure.</p><p>“I’ll kill you,” Kevin shouted angrily as he managed to right himself as he tried to cut through the crowd, trying to reach me, but unable to cut through the crowd as I moved on the front line, keeping the fight balanced. </p><p>It was an interesting feeling, I thought as I waved through the crowd, applying the benefits of both my physical traits, and the mental ones like Pattern Recognition and Leadership to make sure the fight continued relatively evenly despite the numerical disparity — and the little metal rod in my fist giving me the extra edge I needed occasionally, especially when delivering body punches to the side. </p><p>And, it was working for more than just keeping the fight balanced. The showier I acted, the more intent I received. Not as much as the match, but still considerable enough that I could divert a significant portion to the System rather than letting my guide devour it for recovery. </p><p>Especially if it could trigger some new Traits. </p><p>“That’s enough, disperse,” shouted a voice through a megaphone, one that clearly didn’t belong to a student. A glimpse showed that several security guards had already arrived. </p><p>A shockingly quick response, especially from a security team famous for their laziness. Even more amusingly, they stood at the side, just shouting with their megaphones, rather than intervening. </p><p>It was not very effective, but the fight slowly petered out during the next few seconds, and the groups split.</p><p>Altogether, a memorable way to get kicked out of the team.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I had many fun expectations from the morning. </p><p>After all, I had gone to sleep with two beauties in my arms, one exhausted redhead after the amazing time we spent together, and one tense yet aroused blonde who was stubborn enough to get into the bed naked just to prove a point. </p><p>And, since they were still in my arms when I woke up, the amazing things I dreamed about seemed to be the case. The warmth of their bodies was superior to any blanket I could even imagine.</p><p>I glanced at Megan, curious just how much it would take to ignite her competitiveness toward her best friend until she joined our morning exercise even if she didn’t join to make it a proper threesome. </p><p>Too bad fate chose to intervene once more, and I woke up to the horrible noise of an air horn. “Wake up, you pathetic worms,” came a loud shout, from a voice I failed to recognize. </p><p>“Don’t move, probably one of those stupid morning hazings,” Megan murmured as her arms tightened around me, her warmth enough to awaken a certain part of my anatomy. </p><p>From the window, I could see that the sun was high enough to tell that noon had already come and gone, but I didn’t bother correcting that little detail. </p><p>There was little difference between morning hazing and afternoon hazing. </p><p>I was about to agree with her point, but then another shout arrived. </p><p>One that I recognized as belonging to Arnie, the starting quarterback. </p><p>“No, it’s not,” I said even as I extracted from the bed, jumping to get my pants. “Wake Kim up, and start dressing.” Of course, technically, there was a high likelihood that whatever made the offensive team react didn’t react to my immediate attention, but I preferred to be on the safe side. </p><p>One didn’t survive the streets by assuming the best in unexpected situations. </p><p>While Megan looked rather disbelieving at first, preferring to go to sleep, the several shouts that followed, similar in content, were enough to change her mind. </p><p>“They sound angry,” she said as I pulled on my pants, and put the car keys in my pocket. I looked around for my shirt but failed to find it immediately, so I abandoned that direction in favor of finding something that could be used as a weapon without being obvious. </p><p>My hand already went to my keys reflexively halfway before I stopped myself, remembering that using anything that could leave permanent damage was a bad idea even if things came to a fight. </p><p>“Yes, they are,” I said even as Megan started poking Kim, trying to wake her up. Meanwhile, I continued looking around until I saw a little spiral of metal, some kind of decorative item, but an excellent way to give my punches some extra edge if necessary. </p><p>I didn’t expect that to be necessary, not with the amazing number of Traits I gained from the football match. </p><p>But it was better safe than sorry. </p><p>At the doorway, I looked back. “Dress quickly, then come to the stairs, and make sure you’re ready to live stream if I give you the signal,” I said, bringing my palm to my back, my index finger bent. </p><p>I had no doubt that, any other college girl in Megan’s place — especially the rich kind — would have been blaming me for overreacting, or trying to make sure I stayed with them to protect them, in case things had gotten violent. </p><p>Yet, Megan proved her attitude by acting rather than trying to keep me inside with pointless questions. </p><p>It was not very likely that things would burst into violence, but it was not impossible either. </p><p>I was getting tenser and tenser as I walked down, because I could hear several defensive players answering, and while their voice was boisterous at first, that was soon replaced by shock. </p><p>“Impossible,” I heard more than one shouting, but anything more had been lost in the cacophony. </p><p>When I reached the top of the stairs, I didn’t look immediately but used my phone, to check the situation with my phone camera. A little exaggerated, maybe, but old habits died hard. </p><p>The situation was even more interesting. The offensive team was there in full force, including all of the backups, and most of the practice squad players — both defensive and offensive — stood behind them. </p><p>To compare, barely half of the defensive team was there, and most of the crowd slowly went away during the party. </p><p>Yet, some of the people I expected to be there were not there as well. Thad, for example, didn’t seem like a guy who would leave a party early. </p><p>Then, I remembered him mentioning an early meeting with Coach Bill. </p><p>Carter was not there as well, but that was less surprising, as, unlike others, he did take his business seriously, and only stayed in the party enough to make the team feel like he hadn’t been snubbing them. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but frown at his absence even more than Thad. Carter was cold and calculative, but he also treated being captain as the only responsibility in his life, and did everything around that — and his eventual hope of going professional. </p><p>Him not hearing such a great commotion was near impossible. </p><p>I frowned as I looked around, trying to find someone that could actually take the position of leadership. It hadn’t been a long time on the team, but I was exposed to it enough that, there were four other players that had the personality to act appropriately in such a situation. </p><p>Three others were not there. </p><p>The fourth was me, watching from upstairs, trying to decide what to do. </p><p>Of course, I had just recently earned that reputation, a combination of my performance, and Carter’s very explicit transfer of power ensuring that I had enough weight to stabilize the situation without other faces. </p><p>Yet, the absence of all of them was suspicious. I remembered Thad mentioning something about a meeting with the Coach, but that was supposed to be long finished. </p><p>I glanced down, fighting my instincts to do the logical thing and extract myself from the situation by climbing down the window. And while Megan and Kim were here, the offensive team was clearly more in the mood to deal with the other players, and even they were not stupid enough to attack girls. </p><p>At least, during the day, under everyone’s view. </p><p>Yet, while their safety was not a problem, I had a bigger one, my reputation. Normally, I wouldn’t care the slightest about my reputation when facing almost three-to-one odds that could trigger violence. </p><p>But things changed when that reputation was currently giving me literal superpowers. </p><p>As I considered that, I saw Megan looking from the doorway. I caught her gaze. “Start recording, but don’t put on the net yet,” I said, confident enough that it wouldn’t be heard during the mess that was going on downstairs. </p><p>Then, I started climbing down the stairs. </p><p>“Wow, it smells down there,” I said as I arrived downstairs, and started walking forward in a confident gait, one that was designed to display unwavering confidence to the other players. </p><p>It was not something I would have considered usually, but one of my newest traits, Leadership, gave me the necessary boost to remind that. </p><p>“Oh, look what the cat dragged in,” Kevin stopped behind one of the offensive linemen, showing that his habit was to hide there even outside the game. </p><p>I didn’t need the assistance of Taunt to know that ignoring him would have been the greatest insult I could lay on him. Instead, I turned to Arnold. “Arnie, what the fuck is going on that needs you lot to shout like fishermen’s wives in this ungodly hour.” </p><p>I loved the flash of anger going through the faces of both quarterbacks, one being called by a diminutive he hated, the other for being ignored. </p><p>“It’s noon,” answered one of the offensive linemen, suggesting that, while not all football players avoided the stereotype. Some were dumb enough to miss an obvious setup. </p><p>“Yes, but unlike you, we actually have to play to win our games,” I answered, which earned several chuckles behind me. </p><p>Yet, that was all it earned, which was rather serious. Normally, they would have reacted much more explosively to the favorite pastime of the defensive players, mocking the offense for being useless. </p><p>Kevin was the first one to answer, though I had a sinking feeling in my stomach as rather than getting angry, he had a smug smile on his face. </p><p>Something really monumental must have happened. </p><p>“Oh, I wonder how useful defense would be going forward now that Coach Bill quit.” </p><p>Okay, I thought. That would do.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was somewhat conflicted as I returned to the living room, wondering whether playing with Nancy was a better option than giving her a task and leaving. Admittedly, to leverage the sudden popularity we found ourselves in, a lot of work needed to be done. </p><p>But that was hardly helping the uncomfortable hardness of my midsection, pushing my dressing gown up aggressively. </p><p>Well, at least I wasn’t wearing any pants. </p><p>However, when I looked at the other end of the living room, the little surprise Penny prepared for me was more than enough to address my surprise. </p><p>They had followed my request and put on swimsuits, but in a daring choice, and wore only the bottom part of the bikinis from the room. </p><p>I couldn’t see their breasts, at least not fully, but it was not about the direction they were facing. Penny was standing behind Laura, using her body as cover. Unfortunately — fortunately — Laura’s lithe body wasn’t the most appropriate cover, and combined with the angle, it still gave me a beautiful side view of her breasts. </p><p>Laura’s breasts were also hidden, but her coverage relied on Penny’s hands resting on her breasts,  revealing even more thanks to Penny’s ‘careless’ hold, not that things would have been significantly better with Penny’s dainty hands even if she was working better. </p><p>Though, she certainly wouldn’t have given a glimpse of her beautiful areolas, that was for certain. </p><p>“We’re ready for the next stage,” Penny said with a chuckle, her tone implying that she was slowly getting into the same mood that turned our bath adventure into a very memorable threesome. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I grabbed the camera once more as closed in the distance, but this time, I didn’t start taking photos immediately, instead started playing with curtains and the lights, trying to get more appropriate lighting. </p><p>The photoshoot was certainly more for fun than work, but there was no harm in multitasking. </p><p>Luckily, thanks to my experience, the grueling task of arranging the lighting setup only took a couple minutes — though already the design of the room helped, not to mention I was targeting just decent rather than my usual perfection, not wanting to girls waiting. </p><p>Meanwhile, I watched as Penny’s hands moved occasionally, caressing Laura’s bosom, who was busy experimenting with reaching new heights in terms of blushing, her beautiful brown eyes darting all around the room to avoid contact. </p><p>Yet, she stayed in place despite Penny’s surprising aggression, showing she was truly determined. </p><p>“Now, let’s start with some real poses,” I ordered as I raised my camera. </p><p>“How about this?” Penny asked, even more exorbitant than the previous night, feeling particularly confident dealing with a brand new model as she moved one of her hands down to Laura’s stomach, moving her hand a bit to the side to compensate for the absence, trusting her forearm to hide Laura’s other breast. </p><p>Which wasn’t exactly working considering her arm was misaligned. “Umm,” Laura murmured shyly, but that was the extent of her complaint, dying when Penny acted like she didn’t hear it. I walked around them, taking photo after photo, immortalizing the beautiful view, Laura’s honest shyness much better than any order I could give. </p><p>And Penny was certainly not a good enough actress to fake her great enthusiasm. </p><p>The contrast in their expressions made me glad that I had spent a few minutes fixing the lighting, as the results were enough to actually satisfy me, which was certainly a difficult level of achievement to reach. </p><p>I might even use those as a bonus set for my newest business venture — only some of the tamer ones, of course, as the real fun ones were destined to stay in my private stash. </p><p>As I walked for some close-in shots, Laura’s gaze slipped down the floor, enough to ruin the shoot if I wasn’t leaning on her shyness in the first place. </p><p>“That’s enough for this pose,” I whispered as I took another deliberate step, getting closer. “Why don’t you girls change places.” </p><p>Laura jumped at the opportunity as she moved, her hands jumping up to her chest to hide her beautiful bosom before she took a step away from Penny, who was considerably less concerned about hiding her breasts even as I pressed the shutter a few times. </p><p>As Laura hid behind Penny, she pressed tight against her body, managing to hide her breasts successfully. Her attempts to hide Penny’s breasts behind her hands, on the other hand, were considerably less successful. </p><p>It wasn’t her fault, not with Penny's amazing boundless bosom. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said, doing my best not to insert a saucy comment that would ruin Laura’s fledging confidence. For all her daring to use her naked pictures as audition material, she was woefully inexperienced in displaying her body when someone else was taking those pictures. </p><p>If Nancy wasn’t bustling in the other room to put together a costume for her, I might have been more aggressive, but I didn’t want to send Laura away, packing, ruining her work. </p><p>Especially since that work had the potential to earn us another several thousand dollars, maybe even tens of thousands of our newly discovered customer base maintained their enthusiasm. </p><p>Yet, despite my decision, the situation suddenly escalated in a way I hadn’t been expecting. </p><p>The responsible, Laura. </p><p>As I took the new photos, Laura’s hands started to slip down, revealing even more of Penny’s breasts. Completely accidental, of course, and certainly not working to make her pay back or anything for putting her in just bikini bottoms. </p><p>Yet, at this point, Penny was certainly familiar enough with my presence to not care about an accidental nip slip or two, a fact Laura was smart enough to catch on to. </p><p>And, rather than abandoning her strategy, she doubled down, and when she raised her hands on Penny’s chest, she let her fingers dig into their great expanse, teasing her flesh. </p><p>The moan Penny let out in response was simply spectacular, though it was less about Laura’s great skills in teasing her, and more about Penny’s great sensitivity, combined with her arousal. Unable to catch that subtle nuance, Laura thought herself to be wholly responsible for that beautiful moan, and her fingers started to dig deeper into Penny’s bosom. </p><p>A beautiful coping mechanism, one that I had no problems encouraging. </p><p>“Daring choice,” I whispered as I caught Laura’s gaze, enjoying her sudden blush as she realized what she was doing. The reminder seemed to be enough to make her stagger, so I pushed her a bit more. “Now, why don’t you show me just how far you can push it.” </p><p>“R-really,” she whispered. </p><p>“Yes, impress me,” I said, which earned a glare from Penny, but a short-lived one. Her eyes closed as she let out another moan when Laura’s fingers found her nipples, twisting with surprising aggression. </p><p>A bad choice. </p><p>Not in terms of photographing, as I certainly enjoyed the outcome, but in terms of the vindictive expression it awakened on Penny’s face, promising a spectacular payback. Unfortunately for Laura, due to her position, she missed that expression, and kept one hand on Penny’s breasts, tugging and squeezing. </p><p>Even more, her other hand moved down steadily, landing on top of Penny’s bottoms, teasing her core over the fabric. </p><p>“Wow, daring,” I said, catching Laura’s gaze, and giving her another encouraging smile. She smiled back, and I recognized the reckless nature of her smile, just like someone learning skiing for the first time. </p><p>Thinking that a double black diamond trail was a challenge she could face. </p><p>Seeing her lost in a beautiful combination of elation she was feeling from finally fulfilling her dream, the excitement of posing naked, and the intense pleasure she was getting from making Penny suffer — for a very liberal definition of suffering — under her fingers, her next action hardly came as a surprise. </p><p>As she tugged the strings of Penny’s bottom, leaving her naked as her only piece of clothing fell on the floor, I was pressing the shutter repeatedly, immortalizing the view. And, when Laura’s fingers landed on her core, dancing aggressively around her clit to push Penny toward the climax that she was already not too far away, I walked around them, taking more and more photos. </p><p>While Penny slowly developed a sharper, surprisingly vindictive edge to her personality as we worked together, that hardly meant that her physical quality changed. She still had her beautifully sensitive body, created by Aphrodite, and under the unfamiliar touch of Laura, it only took less than a minute for her to collapse on the floor, trembling helplessly. </p><p>“Daring,” I said as I caught Laura’s smug gaze, her elation strong enough to make her miss the fact that her beautiful breasts were completely bare without Penny's body blocking the view. </p><p>What an interesting audition, I thought, trying to decide what to do next. </p><p>But before I could make that decision, Penny pushed herself up despite her trembling legs. “I don’t think I can model for a while,” she whispered, making Laura smile smugly. “Why don’t you pass the camera to me so I can take a few photos while you accompany her,” she added, her vindictiveness almost physical.</p><p>And just like that, Laura’s smile faded, replaced by trepidation. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The moment Irene walked into the room, she let out a shocked gasp, her gaze firmly locked onto my midsection, her beautiful eyes widening to the limit as she caught the impressive show I was providing. </p><p>Which was a welcome reaction, as it gave me the opportunity to get a view of her costume as well, equally fascinated, just hiding it better than her. </p><p>Seeing the tight yet beautiful body underneath was not a shock at this point — as after Carrie, Sarah, Naomi, and Ida, that particular reveal was rather predictable — but a pleasant surprise, like enjoying yet another show of my favorite director. </p><p>The excellence might not come as a shock, but that hardly made the show any less of a masterpiece. </p><p>After that little mental journey, I focused on her costume, only to realize why she was struggling not to wear it in front of me. The costume was sufficiently similar to mine to reveal they came as a set, but one more extra piece. </p><p>The cape was the same just shorter, but unlike mine, which was dancing freely, she hugged the edges and pulled it to herself desperately in an attempt to conceal her body, but the cape was not big enough to do so, giving me a glimpse of what was underneath.</p><p>And what was underneath was certainly an amazing sight, a loincloth that was similar to mine — but shorter and more elegant — that made my mouth water, as well as a top that was similar to a saucy bikini, with an equal coverage area. </p><p>The only thing that was lacking was stability. A bikini top would stay in place despite the movement, but her top looked unstable enough to move at the slightest touch. </p><p>Even without a movement that would trigger such a fortunate event, the cleavage was rather impressive, enough to reveal the full potential of her breasts — which was not enough to compete with Carrie, but probably enough to let Naomi taste defeat. </p><p>I let the silence stretch as she examined my body while doing her best to hide hers — which was flatly unfair — for a while before I started walking toward her. Her eyes widened as I did so, the movement challenging the loincloth even more, only requiring a small accident to trigger.</p><p>I didn’t bother to disguise where my eyes pointed once I stood in front of her. “So, that’s the costume,” I said with a casual tone that contrasted greatly with the seriousness of my gaze. “I don’t remember seeing anything like this on TV,” I added, before letting humor inject my tone. “And I’m sure I would have remembered if I saw it, even a glimpse. It’s rather memorable.” </p><p>“It’s not on TV,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, is it a book?” I asked, mostly to make her speak. </p><p>“Technically, yes,” she whispered, yet as she said so, her gaze dipped down, even more, this time looking at the floor, avoiding my body, which was an interesting reaction. Somehow, she felt more ashamed of it than her current state of dressing. </p><p>“Technically, what an interesting word,” I commented, prompting her to explain more without explicitly forcing her to do so. </p><p>“It’s still being written,” she admitted with a whisper, which also implied that she was a part of the process. </p><p>“Being written by you, I presume,” I said as I looked at her, and she nodded. </p><p>“And who are these characters supposed to be,” I asked. </p><p>“T-they are the main characters,” she said. I said nothing, just letting my gaze drift down to point at our clothes. Her embarrassment intensified as I met her gaze once more, but she was quick to explain. “There’s a reason why they are dressed like this,” she added hurriedly. “It’s from the middle of the first book, where they are captured and forced to fight as gladiators in an arena. They are forced to dress like this to add to the entertainment of the viewers.” </p><p>“Makes sense,” I said, my words taking the sudden edge from her posture. Though, her sudden over-explanation suggested she was feeling overly conscious about her work. I decided to distract her from that part. “After all, I’m very entertained,” I added. </p><p>And just like that, the edge was back, but in a much more different, self-aware form. Her eyes widened, but before she could say anything, I grabbed her arm and led her toward the center of the room. </p><p>“It’s time to listen to the boss once more,” I suggested, pointing at the side of the room, where Ida was standing, still in her chainmail bikini. And more importantly…</p><p>Holding her camera. </p><p>She had clearly used the little moment I spent talking with Irene effectively enough to fix her clothing, erasing most of the signs of our recent encounter. </p><p>Except for her very noticeable tenseness, which was a natural side effect of Irene’s last-second arrival, leaving her just at the edge of an orgasm. </p><p>“Yes, that’s enough wasted time, stop holding your cape and let it fall behind you properly,” Irene said, her voice even sharper than usual, implying that she was blaming Irene for her struggle. </p><p>It was not fair, as I was the one to initiate the event, and she was the one who asked me to continue despite knowing Irene might return at any moment, without even bothering to close the door. </p><p>Yet, while it might not be completely fair, the fun indirect struggles between Carrie and Sarah, as well as the more direct ones between Naomi and Sarah taught me that not intervening in their little struggles had amazing potential. </p><p>And, considering Irene was wearing little more than nothing while Ida held a camera, it didn’t take a genius to guess where things could evolve. </p><p>Especially when Irene obediently followed me to the center of the room. </p><p>“Let’s start with something simple, one that would show that two heroes are fighting against a lot of enemies. Stand back to back, and lean against each other,” Ida ordered. </p><p>I turned my back to her, though I didn’t feel her presence against me. “Hurry up,” Ida ordered, her voice sharp, though it wasn’t impatience that fueled that sharpness but vindictiveness. </p><p>Busy with her concerns, Irene failed to notice that particular concern. “A moment, just fixing my cape,” she said, and a second later, I felt her presence pressing against my back, smooth enough to know that she followed Ida’s order and was facing the other way as well. </p><p>We maintained the pose — discounting the countless adjustments Ida requested, her tone slowly taking her usual abrasiveness while she worked — for a while before the next big order arrived. “Now, Irene, hug him from behind, like you’re relying on his defense,” she said before looking at me. </p><p>“And you, pick a sword and stand in front of her,” she ordered, and when I looked at her blankly, she pointed to a certain part of the wall behind the racks of clothes. </p><p>Only after she had mentioned that I noticed it was not a wall, but another layer of wardrobe. I pushed the clothes to the side and opened the latch, only to meet with enough wardrobe space to fit all of my clothes,  filled with a great range of weapons, axes, swords, maces, knives, even some ninja stars…</p><p>Certainly had an impressive catalog. </p><p>“Wow,” I said, impressed even as I looked at the weapons, their glint enough to show they were made of metal, though their edges were clearly not sharpened. I carefully dragged a finger along the length, making sure they were not dangerous. </p><p>“A-actually, the main character uses an axe while he’s in the arena,” Irene corrected. </p><p>Ida said nothing, showing she had accepted her correction — which was only fair considering it was supposed to be a scene from Irene’s book. I picked the largest axe from the wardrobe without the slightest hesitation. If I were fully clothed, I might have hesitated to pick it, not to give a wrong impression. </p><p>Luckily, with the loincloth I was wearing, no one would doubt whether I was compensating for something. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I raised, finding the weapon lighter than I expected, especially when I held the handle with both hands like it was clearly supposed to be designed. “Do I look good,” I asked Irene as I swung the axe. </p><p>Irene said nothing, and for a moment, I thought that I did something wrong by trying to use a  weapon in the room, even a blunted one, but then I noticed her gaze dipping down, reminding me what I was wearing. </p><p>“Yes, I can see why they are forcing gladiators to dress like this,” I said with a chuckle to fix my loincloth, fixing it. </p><p>“I - I’m sorry,” Irene gasped in shock. “I didn’t mean to stare.” </p><p>“No worries,” I said as I walked back toward her. “Think of it as payback for the show I got when I just arrived.” </p><p>That statement hardly helped her to calm down after her show, but Ida chose that moment to intervene. “That’s enough wasting time. Pose, now,” she ordered. I stood in front of Irene, and she hugged behind. </p><p>“It’s not working,” Ida commented. “Get rid of the cloak.” </p><p>“B-both of us,” Irene stammered, clearly not feeling comfortable with the idea of losing more of her clothing. </p><p>“No, just Chad,” Ida explained. “It’s blocking the view.” </p><p>I dropped it, which was hardly a chore, especially when Irene hugged me from behind once more. Ida followed it with a great number of corrections, which had the potential to be extremely annoying under different conditions. </p><p>But, I had to admit, it was hardly a chore when I could feel the presence of a sexy redhead pressing against me… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You have — you have awakened,” Mariel found herself muttering with a palpable shock, but even then had been interrupted by a moan halfway as I slid inside her. </p><p>“What do you think?” I said with a chuckle as my hips started to pick up speed. Since she had kindly completed the necessary foreplay — and more — I had no problems rushing forward at full speed. </p><p>“I … Right now?” she asked, her hopeful tone rather obvious, which meant she had realized I had been playing with her a bit. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, I’m a light sleeper,” I said, which earned a gasp of shame from her. Which was misguided at best, but I let that slide, as I had enjoyed her juvenile reaction. Not as much as I enjoyed the way she was tightening around me downstairs, of course, but to be fair, there were very few things in life that could match the way an actual angel wrapped around my shaft. </p><p>“I need to go and start working,” she managed to stammer, which would have been more convincing if two things weren’t true. First, she was the boss, one that scared everyone enough that no one would dare to even visit her office without being summoned, let alone ask her why she was late. </p><p>The second piece of evidence was more direct. Her hips started to move even as she delivered her excuse, displaying the abilities she had learned during her earlier adventure in a different way, showing that she was not as committed to stopping me as her words implied. </p><p>If someone else was using that excuse despite clear desire, I might have actually followed it to teach her a lesson. But my poor angel had been dealing with an enforced puritan lifestyle for centuries, and it would have been too cruel to do so. </p><p>Instead, I teased her with a spank. “You can always take a sick leave, sweetie,” I said as I let my hand linger on her ass, caressing softly, making her tremble in anticipation, temporarily stopping the rhythm of her hips. </p><p>“M-maybe —” she whispered, which turned into a wordless growl as I used the opportunity to push forward, triggering an explosive moan as I touched her depths once again. </p><p>“It’s clearly justified,” I said even as I tightened my grip and pulled out just enough to flip her, making her balance herself on the bed on all fours.</p><p>Allowing me to grab her wings once more as I slid inside her, flaring my mana to caress her feathers, leveraging its softness in the process. And that was not the only way I was using my mana. I gathered a thicker flood and filled her insides with each push, once again assisting her to assimilate her Light Divine Spark. </p><p>[-3183 Mana]</p><p>She certainly deserved a reward after her naughty morning adventure. </p><p>Her moans got even more intense as my mana invaded her body, once again efficiently working on her bonding process with the Light Spark. </p><p>The process wasn’t complete, far from it, but even the development was enough to progress it significantly. </p><p>“Good,” I said cheerfully as her hips started moving once again, responding to the mana flood rather intensely, my teasing tone making her move even faster. I had several words to tease her about the situation, but she was still reasonably sensitive, and I didn’t want to push her too much in any case. </p><p>No matter how self-possessed she looked in her role as a headmistress, she was a fragile beauty, and it made teasing her a dangerous proposition. Especially since she was already overwhelmed by getting caught during her morning trickery. </p><p>Instead, I pulled her wings back as I started impaling her even more aggressively, enjoying her repeated cries. </p><p>Under the pure invasion of pleasure, it didn’t take long for the last vestiges of her little adventure to disappear completely, leaving her to moan and gasp repeatedly, her words long forgotten. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I had seen her like this, as she hadn’t been different the last night, especially during the later half, where the unfamiliar pleasure blanketed her mind. Her delirious moans suggested that just a night of experience was not enough for her to generate familiarity as well. </p><p>I managed to hold back my desire to explode inside her for a while as I quickened my invasion, doing my best to give her an even more explosive experience — at least, as much as I could manage without doing anything creative, which would, at this point, shut her down completely. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean I had nothing else I had in mind, I thought even as I flipped her once more, but this time I stayed straight, which left her torso free from my view. </p><p>She noticed my gaze, her wings folding immediately to hide her face and her torso, which, at this point, was simply amazing. “No need for that sweetie,” I whispered as I grabbed her wings and slowly parted them, which required no strength as she didn’t resist. </p><p>But she whimpered beautifully in shame as she covered her face with her hands, her expression simply an incarnation of cuteness. </p><p>“Honey, let’s put those hands to better use,” I said as I grabbed her wrists, slowly pulling her wrist forward until her hands landed over her breasts. “Now, squeeze,” I said even as I directed her fingers, teaching her how to explore her own body. </p><p>Her expression cycled between shyness and arousal as her fingers clamped around her nipples, while I still played with her wrists, making her twist them slowly. </p><p>Soon, I pulled back — well, let my hand slide lower to caress her stomach — and let her hands handle their task independently. Her hands stayed in place, dancing over her beautiful breasts, the effects of it clear as she started moving her hips thirstily, proving that the pleasure was stronger than the vestiges of shame she was dealing with. </p><p>I managed to keep my lips shut despite my desire to tease her, not wanting to interrupt the growing show. </p><p>An amazing decision, it turned out, as soon, she pulled one of her hands away, only to follow the direction of my hands and reached lower. </p><p>I grabbed her wrist,  leading it toward her clit, our fingers tangled together as we teased her most sensitive spot together, rubbing against her softness, the pleasure growing for her. </p><p>Then, I noticed a flare on the wards, and her eyes widened. “E-emergency,” she whispered in shock. “There’s an attack!” </p><p>“Where?” I asked even as I started cursing at the inappropriate timing of the attacker. </p><p>“One of the outposts at the south,” she said, which was clearly communicated by the wards. “A big one, they need reinforcements immediately.” </p><p>“How immediately?” I asked, quickly recalculating the distance. </p><p>“The monster tide is about to reach the destination, maybe twenty minutes,” she said. </p><p>“Good,” I said with a sudden wild smirk. “It’s enough for me to finish my job and reach there,” I said.</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock. “W-wait—“ she gasped, which was all she was able to say before I leaned forward once more, trapping her under my height. Our lips latched together as I let my hips go free, invading her drenched core with an absolute lack of mercy, the clapping of flesh filling the room, loud enough to overwhelm her suppressed moans. </p><p>Facing a sudden time crunch, I abandoned every sense of restraint as I wanted to teach her about the true meaning of education. </p><p>When I pulled back from the kiss to impale her even more aggressively, her only response was to moan, even more, an impressive delirium coloring her tone, suggesting she was slowly losing all connection with reality. </p><p>An expected outcome under my reckless invasion, which was good, as it was a much better way to use her amazing lips than trying to deliver useless arguments. </p><p>“Now, let’s open those beautiful legs more,” I whispered as I pressed my hands to her thighs, parting them for the next stage. Which came as I changed my alignment slightly, drilling her down. </p><p>“Too … much,” she managed to gasp, but even that took half a minute for her as her moans interrupted her several times, her body rebelling against her. But even as she said so, she couldn’t help but keep her eyes open, watching me disappear into her core again and again without a hint of mercy. </p><p>Yet, she found herself opening her legs, even more, allowing me even better access. </p><p>Her flexibility was simply phenomenal. </p><p>I would have asked her to stand up to explore another position for a fleeting moment, but the way her legs started to tremble suggested that it would take a miracle for her to stand upright. And while I had several means to achieve that miracle, with the sudden invasion forcing my hand, I didn’t have the luxury of dealing with those. </p><p>So, I continued my simple yet effective assault until my body decided it was time to stop, exploding inside her, filling her with both my biological marker and my magical touch. </p><p>[-975 Mana]</p><p>I would have rewarded her with even more mana, but with the upcoming fight, I decided to play it more conservatively. Though, it was still sufficient to break the last vestige of her consciousness as she collapsed against the bed, muttering softly…</p><p>“Rest well,” I whispered as I leaned down and left a lingering kiss on her temple. “I’ll be back for the second round soon enough.” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 7821 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I carefully examined the small bird of flame in Cinder’s hand, trying to come to a decision, which was more difficult than I initially expected. I needed more information. </p><p>“Tell me, what are the biggest risks of attempting to transform early,” I asked. </p><p>“Going feral,” the answer came immediately, and the shudder that followed told me that it was a very dangerous issue. She might be spoiled, but she didn’t give me the impression that she was a coward. </p><p>Her visceral reaction indicated that the risk was truly great. “Explain,” I asked. </p><p>“Full transformation…” she started with a sigh. “It means total surrender to the living fire, far more intense than what we usually accomplish, but some phoenixes go too far during their first transformation.” </p><p>“And never come back,” I completed her thoughts rather directly. She nodded. “And what do you plan to do, wait until you return back to your home?” </p><p>Her answer came instantly. “No, I can’t afford to wait for that much.” </p><p>“And do you have some ancient tomes with you explaining the potential hidden dangers,” I said. </p><p>“Of course,” she answered. </p><p>“Tomes that you haven’t memorized already?” I asked, which made her freeze as she realized what I was driving at. </p><p>“I’m not ready yet, it’s too soon,” she said immediately, even as I came to a decision. </p><p>I would push her for the attempt. </p><p>It had good reasons. Some were related to the logistical availability of our current situation. We were already in a location that would fit excellently to the environment, suitably away from the civilization, under wards to hide us. And, I was there to help her if she needed me. </p><p>Yet, those weren’t the main reason I was looking at her with a sharp expression that told her she had to try. No, that was about the general degradation of the political situation. Soon, I would launch the fake assassination of Sapphire, and while necessary, I had no idea how it would make the elves, or the other phoenixes react. </p><p>I certainly didn’t want Cinder attempting to transform if she suddenly found herself surrounded, especially since she was not as hidden as she thought she was. </p><p>“No, it’s not,” I said, once again tapping our connection to reinforce the order. I was prepared to explain it in detail, but she just nodded, once again surprised me with the extent of her obedience. </p><p>But just because she accepted didn’t mean I would immediately push her to act. “Explain the transformation to me, in detail,” I asked. It earned a nod from her before she gave a detailed breakdown. </p><p>The kind that took almost half an hour for her to deliver, interrupted by several questions from me, forcing her to restate the same concepts again and again. I wasn’t doing that to be pedantic, but to force her to think deeper about the concepts. </p><p>From her explanation, it was clear that she had memorized every scrap of available information about the transformation, but rather than analyzing them critically, she accepted them wholesale. </p><p>Our short yet intense session solved a few tricky issues, such as delving deeper into the meaning of surrender. As she explained, I could see the reason for the number that lost control, especially when contrasted with my own unique method of using the living fire. </p><p>So, I have explained to her some of my own insights into a unique method of using fire. Not fully, of course, as it would just make her confused, but a few hints about not forgetting to keep herself separate from the fire was reasonable advice. </p><p>“Do you think … it will work,” she murmured, hesitant. </p><p>“It will work,” I said to her, letting her enjoy my words as I delivered the explanation, even as I let my hand dance on her naked body. Since I was never one to miss such an opportunity, I had long pulled her onto my lap, caressing her body as I explained. </p><p>As an added benefit, the distraction helped to keep her away from getting lost in details. “Now, create a fire and meditate, while I explore the ways to intervene with your magic, in case you lost control.” </p><p>“You can’t intervene with the transformation, it’ll create an even bigger disaster,” she said. </p><p>“Maybe, but it’s still good to have the option in case of a catastrophe,” I said, not taking her explanation too seriously. It was clear that her civilization had been treating the transformation as an almost religious experience. </p><p>Which had the unfortunate result that the ritual had been calcified, close to changes. Even from her relatively summarized explanation, it was clear that some assistance would help the transformation quite a bit. </p><p>Of course, the same intervention could easily be used to kill the one that was being transformed if the assistant wished to do so, but luckily for Cinder’s sake, I had no intention of doing so. </p><p>Instead, I focused on the way her magic was flowing to get a better sense of intervening with her casting. It was not the easiest thing to do, but the accidental connection between us significantly reduced the difficulty of the process nonetheless. </p><p>My first attempt was to intervene in her casting directly, trying to manipulate the small ball of fire she created.</p><p>The results had been … less than pleasant, using the layered shield I had created to the limit. “Hey,” she gasped in fear as the flames went chaotic in front of her. </p><p>“No need to fear, sweetie,” I said even as I caressed her stomach, calming her down. “I expected that already, hence the shields. I just wanted to see the result directly.” </p><p>“Was that necessary?” she asked, her breathing still quick. </p><p>“Well, it’s better to know it won’t work rather than assuming it won’t,” I said with a chuckle. “Now, start again,” I said, slapping her ass, enjoying the beautiful echo it created. </p><p>She moaned at my slap, her hips moving seductively as she did so, showing that I wasn’t the only one tempted to stop the process halfway for a reward session. I managed the resist the temptation of pushing things further, but I had to admit that it was a close call. </p><p>“Fire,” I warned her, even as I flicked her nipple to punish her, which didn’t help her arousal any. </p><p>An appropriate punishment for her trick. </p><p>“As you wish,” she muttered as she slowly shook her head, trying to handle the effect of my intervention. She moaned softly as I let my hands settle just under her breasts, and cast another fire. </p><p>I used our connection to intervene with her casting again, but this time, I did so on a more fundamental level, by preventing her mana from reaching the spell. </p><p>And we watched as the fire slowly flicker and die easily. “Excellent,” I said. It was an effective trick. Pity, it was completely useless in combat, as after pushing the mana in such a core location, there were much more effective ways to deal with an enemy. </p><p>“Repeat,” I said, and we repeated the attempt almost a dozen times, making sure it worked every repeat. It had the added benefit of making her get used to the process, which would prevent her from reflexively panicking. </p><p>“Let’s start, and don’t forget to give me a sign if you feel like you’re losing control,” I said. </p><p>She nodded obediently before she took a deep breath — which had a beautiful effect on her breasts, enough to make me curse the fact that we had more important things to do. </p><p>She took several steps back before she raised her arms, and the subtle shine on her skin intensified once more. First, it reached the level of a raging fire, then it soon expanded even further like an out-of-control forest fire. </p><p>A majestic forest fire. </p><p>First, her wings of flame grew bigger and bigger, their span reaching almost fifty feet of range rather than just a few feet of initial extent. </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I noticed Isolde reacting once more, but I gestured for her to stay away. The process was complicated enough without her intervention. Luckily, her obedience was stronger than her distaste for magic, so she stayed back like she was ordered. </p><p>Soon, the flames continued to expand over her skin, creating the outline of a bird, the same kind she had displayed as a model earlier. </p><p>Yet, I was more focused on her face, which was getting more and more hidden as the flames intensified. It was good, as I barely managed to catch her expression of alarm, which, along with the sudden intensity of flame that followed, suggested that it was the time to intervene. </p><p>I flared my own magic to cut her flow. </p><p>In response, the flame that surrounded her stopped flickering, and rushed toward me, acting with more intelligence than I had seen from the living flame. </p><p>Luckily, this time, I wasn’t directly connected with the flame, which allowed me to put up a much more efficient defense against it. A flare of my mana was enough to activate the wards that I had set up, dispersing the impact point of the spell, and the Shield was enough to handle the rest. </p><p>Barely, making me glad that there wasn’t a follow-up attack. </p><p>The phoenix transformation was certainly not a joke. </p><p>While I handled the reaction, Cinder collapsed on her knees, breathing hard. Yet, it was Isolde that grabbed my attention, already dashing forward, her blade drawn as she misread the situation. </p><p>I was impressed with her silent rush even as I gestured for her to stop. She had already covered half of the distance without making Cinder have the slightest idea of the risk she had been facing. </p><p>Once again highlighting what a great assassin she would be once I finish her training. I smirked at the view, ready to rush for more even without her indirect intervention. </p><p>“I … almost,” Cinder gasped in shock as I walked next to her. I needed to distract her from the near-disaster she experienced, and a kiss worked wonders on that aspect. My tongue’s invasion distracted her from her momentary daze. </p><p> “The sensation, it was overwhelming,” she gasped as she took a deep breath, trying to contain her reaction. </p><p>“Experimenting with unknown magic always is,” I said. “But you had good progress, and the next time will be even smoother.” She looked hesitant at the mention of a next time, but I leaned forward for another kiss.</p><p>While thinking about the merits of pushing her for another attempt, or letting her rest. </p><p>In a certain sense of the word, of course. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You remember our safe word, right?” I said to Kim even as I slid into her core once more, earning a monumental moan as a response even as only the crown was inside her.  </p><p>Yet, that was not what I was seeking, so I spanked her ass. “I expect a proper answer when I ask a question,” I reminded her, enjoying the way she shivered under my words. </p><p>“Yes, I remember,” she managed to squeeze between her moans. I glanced at Megan while Kim spoke, enjoying the depth of her shock as she looked at her best friend, not expecting such a spectacular example of obedience from her. </p><p>After that glance, I ignored the tickle of temptation begging me to bring Megan into our little exercise session. </p><p>The idea of her watching without relief was still more tempting, erotic, and vindictive at the same time. </p><p>The perfect treatment Megan deserved. </p><p>“Since your best friend is doing her best to convince everyone she’s not a little frigid bitch, let’s make it loud and help her. It’s alright with you, right?” I asked. She answered positively, but not before receiving another spank. </p><p>The pleasure was working excellently to awaken the latent aspects of her personality. </p><p>Let’s see how strong your lungs are,” I whispered as I grabbed her hips, pushing my shaft deep inside her. Our earlier shower adventure worked excellently to keep her ready for that sudden invasion, and I slid inside her. </p><p>She just moaned, her usual cool personality nowhere to be seen as she helplessly processed the pleasure of the latest invasion. </p><p>Her naked body trembled under me as the pleasure continued to build, the only respite she received was the few seconds I flipped her over while talking with Megan. </p><p>Curious just how far I could push, I leaned down to grab her hair, and used that opportunity to whisper in a way that was inaudible to Megan. “You like being watched by your best friend while being fucked like the whore you are, do you?” I asked. </p><p>The growing wetness of her core was enough to answer, but this time, I didn’t need to spank her tight ass to extract a response. “Yes,” she shouted, but I was fascinated by the undertones of her tone. Pleasure, I expected…</p><p>But the shock I could hear was an interesting addition, showing that it was not a fact she had been aware of before my question. </p><p>I might have felt bad under different circumstances, but considering the said friend was on the couch next to us, her fingers furiously dancing in her core, it was clearly not a dangerous addition to their interesting friendship. </p><p>And, if they had some problems with that part, I would be more than happy to play the peacemaker and help them mediate any complication. </p><p>Preferably through experimentation. </p><p>I thought about teasing her a bit more, but with the intensity of her moans, I could feel that any such attempt might actually push her too much, leaving me with accidental blue balls. </p><p>So, I decided to abandon my tricks and pushed forward, abandoning all my attempts to tease her with my words or stretch the moment. Instead, I penetrated her aggressively yet steadily, pushing both of us into a beautiful climax. </p><p>Kim’s face didn’t stay buried on the pillow for long. After a particularly sharp push, she managed to find the strength to push herself up, her moans even louder without something pressing against her lips. </p><p>The warmth of her grip was spectacular as I pushed repeatedly, enough to make it a spectacular moment without the presence of the sexy blonde whose concerns about the moment were evaporating as well, leaving its place for pure arousal. </p><p>The evidence, was, her current state. </p><p>She had abandoned her attempt to act like she wasn’t enjoying the show — admittedly, it wasn’t a very good attempt in the first place — and focused on her pleasure. The best evidence for that change. </p><p>Her current pose. </p><p>At one point, she chose to stand up, which made her towel finally slide off her body, treating me to the full view of her beautiful body. Her left hand still concealed her core as her fingers furiously danced along her clit, pushing her pleasure to the next stage. </p><p>Her right hand still carried her phone, continuing to record the moment. </p><p>“Why don’t you come closer for a better angle,” I said, and seeing her hesitant expression, I chuckled. “Of course, if you’re afraid…” I added. </p><p>It was a naked provocation, and I doubted it would have worked without Taunt helping me to time it perfectly. With its assistance, however, I was able to tap into that exact sweet spot in her mentality, and she walked forward, closing the distance between us. </p><p>When she stood next to me, her posture was tight, like a gunslinger that was about to lash out. Her tenseness told me that, despite her proximity, she was ready to pull back if I tried to take liberty on her. </p><p>I put my hand on the small of her back, just the location to make her tense, without giving her an excuse to retreat. </p><p>At least, not without accepting the accuracy of my earlier taunt. </p><p>Touching her was certainly not as spectacular as what my other hand was busy with — squeezing and mauling Kim’s ass repeatedly — but that didn’t mean it was beautiful. The way she shivered under my skilled touch, the dance of my callused fingers targeting just the right spots to trigger her sensation, enough to bring her arousal to the next stage. </p><p>The way her knees buckled was evidence of my success. </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me the great celebrity of our campus can’t handle an idle touch,” I said even as I let fingers continue to dance, moving along her spine, fueling her enjoyment with my touch while my words ensured she would stay in place. </p><p>Meanwhile, Kim was not in a position to care about what was happening just a foot behind her, lost in pleasure. </p><p>I had been planning to reduce the intensity of her treatment after the quick start, but she proved that her tough exterior was not a complete lie. “Harder,” she moaned while I was busy with her friend. </p><p>“Do you think you can handle the same treatment, “ I whispered mockingly to Megan’s ear even as I pulled my hand, leaving her body free of her touch once more. </p><p>Just a moment ago, she clearly didn’t want my touch, but by pulling it away without her request, I managed to earn her ire. </p><p>Such a complicated beauty. </p><p>I acted unaware of her distaste as I pumped my hips forward, giving Kim the intense treatment she requested. She moaned, her voice pushing her limits. </p><p>Enough to be heard at the party despite the music of the intensifying flow of Intent. </p><p>“Oh, I can handle that, and much more,” Megan whispered, her tone in a perfect cadence as she climbed on the bed as well, her tits pressing against my back to give her unrestricted touch. Meanwhile, her hands started caressing my stomach, tracing my muscles — which was even more apparent after the boost to the physical traits I had received. </p><p>“Too bad I’m not going be able to touch that, right?” I whispered back, predicting her next line. </p><p>Successfully so, if the way she tensed was any indicator. </p><p>“Not if you play your cards right?” she whispered into my ear, doing her best to take back control of the moment. </p><p>A nice twist, enough to show her capabilities. </p><p>I would have loved to tease Megan even more, but I could feel that Kim was almost at the edge of an explosion. I could have resisted one of my own, but I knew Megan enough that, by doing so, I would give her another excuse to leave me hanging. </p><p>I decided to let her experience that instead. </p><p>My hands slipped under Kim’s hips, raising them slightly as I pushed another time, this time even deeper, the move all I needed to loosen my control over my body, and explode inside her. </p><p>And that was all that was needed to cover the distance between her and her next orgasm, adding another beautiful layer to her amazing moans. </p><p>Her sudden tightness felt like heaven. </p><p>“Amazing…” Kim managed to mutter as she collapsed against the pillow, showing she was completely spent. </p><p>I could feel Megan tightening in shock even as her arms tightened around me, one of her hands still pointing her phone camera at Kim. </p><p>“That was a great celebration,” I said as I turned suddenly, and stole a short yet searing kiss from Megan, pulling back before she could actually progress, let alone respond, which pushed her arousal even more. “Now it’s time to rest.” </p><p>With that, I threw myself next to Kim, spooning her with one arm,  leaving Megan, naked, aroused, and gaping in shock. “T-that’s it?” she whispered in shock. </p><p>“Of course,” I said with a wink. “That’s all I can manage after a game,” I said even as I grabbed her waist and pulled her to the empty side of my body. </p><p>“What—“ she started, only for me to close her lips with another kiss. </p><p>“Well, you have three options, either leaving, which would create another scandal, or sleeping on the couch, which would be too uncomfortable for a pretty little girl like you,” I explained with a chuckle. </p><p>“A gentleman would choose to sleep on the couch,” she answered. </p><p>That earned a genuine chuckle me. “Good thing I’m not a gentleman, then,” I said as I closed my eyes, trying to sleep. </p><p>Megan stayed in my arms even as I fell asleep. </p><p>I couldn’t wait until the morning arrived. </p><p>I fully intended to leverage every single benefit of waking up to two amazingly sexy ladies… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I pulled my gaze away from the mirror once I noticed Megan’s destination, not wanting to get caught. It wasn’t that I was shy, and didn’t want to be caught looking at her while she was in her revealing state. </p><p>Her amazing mood was about my lack of perceived attention. The setup would have been ruined if she noticed my gaze. </p><p>Kim was busy devouring my shaft, unaware of the little interplay, too aroused to do anything else. For her, there was only pleasure.  </p><p>The blonde figure of Megan passed next to me without stopping, doing her best to get my attention. The way her hips swayed was one of those methods, and to her credit, it was beautiful enough to instantly climb to the list of erotic moments. </p><p>It was incredible enough to pull my gaze despite the amazing service Kim had been providing. </p><p>Yet, that was not the only strategy she had used to get my attention. As she passed me, she made sure to brush her arm against mine in a very noticeable manner. Adding that trick suggested that she wasn’t fully confident in the beautiful dance of her hips to appropriate my attention. </p><p>She sat on one of the large seats next to the bed, and lay on her back, her head pointing at me. Of course, as she lay, her towel, which was barely holding onto her body, accidentally come undone, giving me a full glimpse of her beautiful breasts. </p><p>I had to admit, they looked amazing, the light hitting just at the right angle, enhancing the glistening of her breasts. Of course, if the beautiful redhead busy devouring my shaft without rebelling had any attention to spare, she would have a few corrections to further enhance her friend’s beautiful pose, but I had no critical feedback. </p><p>“It had been a tough day, isn’t it,” I said with a chuckle, giving her some attention, but not in the way she wanted. I didn’t want her to get discouraged enough to stop, but giving her the type of attention she wanted would only make her pull back with a victorious smirk. </p><p>“Yeah, cheering from stands is clearly tougher than playing, if you can be this energetic,” she said, her voice biting as she shuffled in her place, and took a sitting pose. As she moved, her towel slid to bunch around her waist, but she just crossed her legs, not bothering to fix it, revealing her hardened nipples without any impediment. </p><p>How spectacular. </p><p>Yet, if she was hoping to get a hint of repentance from her slight needling, she was very wrong. I was not one of those rich kids not knowing how to handle a prickly woman like her. </p><p>Kevin was an excellent example. Lacking the ability to confront her, maybe not even noticing the calculative nature of what lay underneath, he clearly just played along to get a place he had no hope of arriving, unaware that he had been being used for his popularity. </p><p>But my calculated disinterest worked wonders to trigger the desire for attention. </p><p>“Constant practice helps me to keep in a good shape,” I said, smirking, not showing the slightest hint of shame. “Not to mention, it had been a tough week, and I need some release,” I said, then let one of my hands drift down, slapping Kim’s hips. “Luckily, my girlfriend prepared me the perfect gift to release that pent-up aggression.” </p><p>“You’re welcome,” Megan answered, her sarcasm thick enough to consist of a physical presence. </p><p>“Thanks, sweetie,” I said with an exaggerated warmth that belonged to a lovely sitcom rather than our current situation, contrasting beautifully with her sarcasm. </p><p> Meanwhile, Kim’s eyes were cycling between us, my earlier slap finally making her take notice that we had an audience. She looked hesitant for a moment, making me think that she was on the edge of surrender. </p><p>Amusingly, it was Megan that prevented that. With our little discussion over, she turned her gaze to Kim, her gaze sharp, with no doubt about the meaning behind her gaze.</p><p> She was asking Kim to stop. </p><p>It was an amateur mistake that  I never expected Megan to make. Not only, for all her faults, she was an expert manipulator, but also Kim was one of her best friends — maybe even the best one — and she knew her habits very much. </p><p>Yet, she was unsettled enough to try to give an order to Kim, the perfect way to trigger the more combative parts of her personality.</p><p>To her credit, it took only a second for her to realize her mistake, but it was enough to destroy Kim’s blooming doubt. </p><p>She closed her eyes as she grabbed my thighs, pulling her forward fast enough to make my hands on her head useless, her gags of struggle joined by exaggerated moans of pleasure. </p><p>“The perfect gift, indeed,” I said as I caught Megan’s gaze, my smile as sarcastic as I could manage. Normally, sarcasm was not an emotion I had trouble generating, but an enthusiastic deepthroat from a sexy redhead was one of the few events that made it difficult to reflect that sarcasm.</p><p>The huff of protest Megan let out was beautiful, her bouncing gaze showing that both of us were the target. I had no doubt that, at one point, she would make me pay for that, but that day was not today. </p><p>That was enough attention, I decided as I turned my attention back to Kim, ramming into her throat again and again as the arousal between her legs grew more and more. </p><p>Meanwhile, Megan pulled out her phone, taking a few photos while playing. I might have intervened otherwise, but with the existence of the System, I was not afraid of any kind of leak. </p><p>Not to mention, she would never do so in the first place. Even if her friendship with Kim broke, Kim also had a great number of revealing photos that would ruin her reputation as well. </p><p>Mutually assured destruction was a surprisingly comforting concept. </p><p>I turned my full attention to Kim, enjoying the way she was busy pushing again and again. Minutes passed as the presence of her throat become a constant fixture around my girth, giving me a comforting feeling. </p><p>I was feeling the stirrings of a climax, and I was about to let it go, when I noticed a movement in the corner of my eye. I shifted my attention back to Megan, only to meet with a beautiful surprise.</p><p>She had raised her phone, recording us, her earlier attempt to keep it subtle abandoned at one point, but that wasn’t the surprising part. The surprising part was the fact that she was holding the phone with only one hand, and the other under her towel, making suspicious movements. </p><p>It was nice to see her indulging herself for once, I thought even as I did my best to hide my attention, knowing her enough that any attention on my part would make her pull back. </p><p>Since we had an audience, I decided to put on a proper show. </p><p>At this point, it was getting troubling to keep me back, but since we had such an enthusiastic audience, I decided to make a proper show rather than just exploding inside her mouth. </p><p>I pulled out at the last moment, spraying her face and chest generously. Amusingly, Megan gasped in shock, her tone enough to show that she expected her friend to react to that surprise move negatively. </p><p>Contrary to her expectations, Kim mewled beautifully even as she pressed her hand on her chest, spreading them along. The intense pleasure worked excellently to awaken the more submissive parts of her personality once more. </p><p>And that made Megan look at me in shock, having trouble believing her prickly friend acting as obediently as an aspiring sorority girl during the last day of her pledge week. </p><p>At this point, pulling Megan into the situation would have been easy. Her shock, combined with her arousal, made it a trivial achievement. I just needed to pull her on top of her friend, making a delicious marmalade sandwich for my midnight craving. </p><p>And, I would have done so, if Megan hadn’t left me on the edge more than once. Making her payback was simply more attractive, I decided as I grabbed Kim’s hips, flipping her down. </p><p>“Let’s see just how loudly you could cry,” I said even as I pressed against her entrance, my shaft already hard. </p><p>Recovery was not just useful for football practice.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I barely managed to close my eyes as she glanced up, no doubt testing the signs of waking up. With her little test giving a negative result, she started leaning down even as her hands wrapped around the base of my shaft. </p><p>Her lips followed a moment later, repeating the same effect around the crown of my shaft, adding another layer to my pleasure, especially when she started moving up and down. Her movements were choppy, but not completely unfamiliar. </p><p>She might not have done anything like this before, but clearly, she had lived far too long to never stumble on others doing something like that. Soon, she reached a simple, yet effective rhythm, her natural grace helping to compensate for her lack of experience. </p><p>That didn’t mean her hesitancy was gone, of course. However, her taste for pleasure was finally awakened, and it was a good combination when it was mixed with her curiosity. </p><p>I just watched, happy with the pleasure. Her technique — if it could be called that in the first place — was lackluster at best, but one of the advantages of a blowjob was enthusiasm was more than enough to compensate for a lack of skill. </p><p>And she had lots of enthusiasm. Her wings, still sprawled, twitching beautifully, only enhanced the inherent view of the moment. </p><p>I let her play freely without any intervention as she teased my shaft from every possible angle, her lips going deep enough to reach halfway mark. I was tempted to grab her head and push her down, curious how her wings would react in such a circumstance. </p><p>Pity I was too curious about how far my naughty angel would push while thinking that I was still asleep. </p><p>I limited myself to watching. Luckily, she was too distracted to keep her eyes open, allowing me to watch her rapt concentration as her expression constantly cycled in a wide range, from shame to arousal. </p><p>She pulled before I could reach a climax, and I prepared to stand up, to teach her why it wasn’t a good idea to wake me up in such a teasing manner and stop halfway. </p><p>Or, a rather excellent way, as it depended on the way one looked at the issue. </p><p>However, before I could stand up, I noticed her magic flaring, and she cast a spell on me. Ironically, it was a credit of my trust that I didn’t retaliate reflexively and instead checked the spell structure curiously, only to see it was a sleep spell. </p><p>A weak one that would have certainly failed against a woke target, even if I was as weak as I led her to believe. </p><p>However, it was an excellent way to make sure a sleeping person wouldn’t wake up. </p><p>Which had some beautiful implications. </p><p>So, I wasn’t surprised when she turned her back to me before climbing on the bed, her legs on both sides of my body. One perk of the position, it allowed me to open my eyes without fearing getting caught. </p><p>Which was excellent, because the sight of a beautiful angel from the back, her glowing silver wings spread wide as she hesitantly lowered herself was a memory I would cherish for all eternity. </p><p>I bit my lips as she finally lowered herself enough for our bodies to connect, her warmth phenomenal as she wrapped around my girth, and the fact that she stopped her blowjob just as it was starting to get amazing helped to carry the pleasure to the next stage. </p><p>It would have been an amazing trick even if it was intentional, and its accidental nature only made it more amazing. </p><p>I watched in appreciation as she slowly lowered herself with a speed that surprised me, showing that my forceful education had taken root excellently. Her back arched as she easily passed halfway mark. </p><p>A loud moan rippled in her mouth, showing her confidence in her sleeping spell trick. Too bad for her it was completely unfounded, leaving me a desire to move and pin her down to teach her about being more careful. </p><p>Yet, as she sank deeper, I decided on the lesson and focus on enjoying her beautiful treatment. She moved up and down, experimenting with the pace until she settled to a furious up and down, her wings waving in the same pattern in reverse to balance her momentum. </p><p>A rather inventive way of using her wings, one that I enjoyed greatly. </p><p>I waited, curious just how far she would leverage her freedom. </p><p>Quite a bit, as it turned out as she leaned forward, putting her hands on my thighs before her hips started to move even faster with the leverage, the sight of her devouring my shaft, again and again, creating a rather excellent view for me to occupy myself. </p><p>And that occupation helped me to suppress my desire to flip her and start her next lesson. </p><p>Her hips moved both back and forth and up and down, her wetness enveloping me greatly, her natural elegance once again helping to elevate her movements greatly. Another moan escaped her beautiful lips, making me curious about her expression. </p><p>Pity, she didn’t have a mirror in the room, and casting a spell to do so would have alerted her that I wasn’t as sleepy as she assumed me to be. Her hips continued to work, making me feel a slight pity that she didn’t get the benefits of the system. </p><p>Such steady work would have already earned her my first perk. </p><p>However, just because she wasn’t able to get the benefits of it, didn’t mean she couldn’t receive the benefits in another way. I let my magic rise slowly, coating my shaft. </p><p>It made her stop and throw a panicked glance back — at least, that’s what I assumed as I had to close my eyes to fake sleeping. Her body stayed twisted for a while, her posture suggesting she looked at me, no doubt trying to see if I had woken up. </p><p>But she stayed impaled even as she did so, showing she didn’t want to stop receiving the pleasure she had been sneaking. I gave no reaction as I did so, but let my mana calm slightly. </p><p>Selling the idea that it was just a reflexive reaction, one that overlapped with the pleasure I was feeling. </p><p>She said nothing, but even as her presence disappeared from around my shaft, I didn’t react, remembering the earlier situation with the blowjob. It turned out to be the correct decision as she settled around my girth once more. </p><p>This time her hands pressed against my chest. </p><p>It was a risky decision, but I found myself opening my eyes after her hips started moving, this time even more heatedly. But not before letting my mana rise once more, tainted with Tantric energy, slowly filling inside her. </p><p>[-381 Mana]</p><p>It turned out to be a good decision. When I opened my eyes, I found hers conveniently closed, which allowed me to take the view she created fully rather than trying to steal an occasional glimpse. </p><p>Which was good, as the view she created easily took a spot in the greatest views I had ever seen. Her wings were spread fully open, their glow even more intense as my mana invaded her body. And, that silver light contrasted against her body, highlighting the slight sheen that covered her skin in the best way possible. </p><p>Her beautiful breasts jumbled pleasingly with every desperate movement of her hips, begging for me to grab them and tease her hard nipples for eternity. Her face was contorted with pleasure as her core devoured my shaft repeatedly, her lips open as endless moans started to escape her lips. </p><p>I wondered whether she was that confident in her spell, or she had forgotten the dubious nature of the start of her morning exercise. </p><p>Either way, I said nothing as she rocked desperately on my lap, too distracted by the pleasure to pay attention to such nuances. </p><p>Her moans exploded against the walls as they started to gain a desperate quality, tempting me to use the trick that I had been fond of, blocking her arousal with magic to keep her on the edge.</p><p>Tempting, but after some thought, I decided against it. The poor girl had spent centuries without knowing the touch of a man. It would be plain mean to test her with such a radical edge play. </p><p>For now, at least, I decided, shelving the idea for later, when she got a more useful sense of what was ordinary and what was not.</p><p>While I was considering the appropriate time to pull some interesting tricks, she finally reached the peak she had been searching for. Her body tensed as she started trembling desperately, each second enhancing her pleasure even more. </p><p>As her moans subsided, she looked down, only now noticing my eyes were wide open. “Good morning, boss,” I said with a chuckle as she froze in shock. Which I leveraged by grabbing her waist and flipping our positions, trapping her under me in a missionary position, still firmly inside her.</p><p> She was done with her morning exercise. </p><p>It was my turn now.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 8826 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p> Sleeping in a decadently comfortable bed was certainly an enjoyable experience, something that I had enjoyed greatly since my experience had reached a point of great success. </p><p>In comparison, the current bed I had been sleeping in, which was more of a bare cot that even a servant would feel insulted to use, was supposed to be an annoying downgrade. Clearly, the spell I used to transform it had been dispelled. </p><p>I guessed Mariel was responsible for it. Not intentionally, but the integration of her Divine Spark resulted in occasional flares of her mana, and dispelled it. </p><p>Not that it disappointed me. The enjoyment of a soft bed was nothing compared to the great warmth of Mariel’s beautiful wings. </p><p>Which was why I woke up immediately as I felt those wings shuffling around me, pulling back halfway, too smooth and deliberate to be just a sleep reaction. </p><p>My dear headmistress was awake. </p><p>Not only I kept my gaze shut, but also applied my extensive abilities to give her the impression that I was still sleeping — which was not unbelievable considering just how much physical effort I had expanded and how much mana I spent in the process of keeping her happy. </p><p>And kept her happy, I did even as I finally broke her centuries-long dry streak in a very memorable manner. </p><p>I was curious how she would react while thinking I was still asleep. </p><p>Without the mind-numbing pleasure that impaired her sound decision-making capabilities, I expected her to slide away, and thought that the question was whether she would maintain enough presence of mind to do slowly, without ‘waking’ me up, or she would pull back with enough speed to force me to abandon my fake-sleep ploy. </p><p>She had just the virginity that she had been maintaining for centuries. An exaggerated reaction was not exactly unexpected. </p><p>Yet, she surprised me by not picking either of those options.</p><p>At first, her wings continued to pull back, giving me the impression that she would pick the first option, yet, that movement was soon arrested. And even better, after a few more seconds passed, it reversed, once again tightly wrapping around me. </p><p>The warmth and comfort radiation from them as they slowly wrapped around me was beautiful, tempting me to go back to sleep. I fully intended to follow that temptation, but soon, a contradicting message arrived, arresting my slow descent to unconsciousness. </p><p>It was her finger, moving on my chest. </p><p>It wasn’t a hard or painful touch. On the contrary, it was a weak one, soft enough to be written off as nonexistent, as heavy and permanent as a dream, existing only for a second before disappearing.</p><p>That disappearance didn’t last forever, and a minute later, her finger landed on my chest once more, this time staying a little more before pulling back. </p><p>I lost count of how many times she repeated that, but with each repeat, the time between her touches got shorter, and her touches lingered more. </p><p>The duration wasn’t the only thing that changed. The pressure her finger generated increased accordingly, from lighter than a feather to a noticeable caress as she traced my chest muscles, her fascination impossible to be mistaken. </p><p>I still had a lot of things to do, but wrapped in the wings of an angel, I was feeling rather decadent — not to mention curious about just how far she would push. Considering her hesitant start, I guessed that my abs would be her limit. </p><p>The answer turned out to be more than that. She first climbed to my shoulders then shifted to my arms, continuing to trace my muscles, then slipped down to my abs. There, she spent less time than I had been expecting, continuing to slip lower. </p><p>Dragging along my erection, shocking me with her daring. I didn’t expect her to leverage the benefits of her new situation that quickly. </p><p>Though, the moment she touched my full erection — as it should be considering I was sharing the bed with a naked angel — I felt a great shock, though it was not as great as when, rather than pulling back, she stayed on, moving back and forth. </p><p>Soon, her finger was joined by a second one, and a couple seconds later, her palm joined the fray. </p><p>My acting ability was my savior as her hands moved up and down on my shaft, allowing me to hide the signs of both the surprise I felt and the arousal that was steadily growing. </p><p>Admittedly, it was not exactly the best handjob I had received, with its uneven pacing and unnecessary tightness, but that didn’t prevent me from enjoying it immensely — and her fumbling that highlighted her lack of experience gave me much more pleasure than a skilled handjob. </p><p>Opening my eyes and greeting her was tempting, but not as tempting as just how long she would stay there, exploring the unfamiliar texture of my length. </p><p>I stayed there, waiting until she stopped while I enjoyed the amazing warmth of her wings, enjoying the soft nature of the light that infused my body — though I had to maintain a thin layer of light mana inside myself to prevent that from turning into something more painful. </p><p>Even in its calmest state, the light was destructively burning.  </p><p>Her hand stayed in place for several minutes. Soon, I realized her movement getting even choppier, but the only struggle that was created was to make me feel the challenge of forcing it down. </p><p>I felt curious about her actions. I needed to keep my eyes closed, but with my magical sensitivity, it wasn’t as big of a problem as it would have been a couple months ago. Especially since Mariel was an intensely magical being, her natural light mana radiating off her body without her robe to block it. </p><p>And, by focusing on the radiance, I could ‘see’  her movements without opening my eyes. Of course, it wasn’t a perfect view, as, ironically, the intensity of her glow made it very hard for me to pick the details, but I could still notice the broad strokes. </p><p>Like the fact that her hands were dancing on her breasts repeatedly. </p><p>Holding back my smirk was an even bigger challenge than hiding my challenge to her clumsy handjob — especially since, unlike a blowjob, enthusiasm was definitely not a replacement for actual skill — but I managed to keep it down. </p><p>Curious how she would follow. </p><p>Her hand soon pulled away from her chest and landed back on mine, caressing my skin once again, treating exploring my body more important than enhancing her own pleasure. </p><p>Soon, her free hand slipped down to my thighs, but then she chose to push them to the side. I didn’t want to wait for long to learn about that. The familiar weight of her breasts pressing against my legs was indicative enough that she wanted to get a closer look at my shaft. </p><p>As she waited there, I assumed that it was the extent of her ambition. But then, her fingers wrapped around once more, this time dancing gently as if she wanted to see its reaction rather than giving a handjob. </p><p>It was a much more pleasant feeling, especially with her tits pressing to my legs. I took the risk of cracking my eyes, only to see her face scrunched in intense concentration. It would have been just cute if it wasn’t for her wings, spread on her back, twitching with her every move — yet the way they throbbed with magic was more than enough to remind me that they were not just nice-looking accessories, but the representation of her power. </p><p>The power that just enhanced significantly after the last night’s adventure where I helped her to finally bond with her Light Spark. Yet, interestingly, she was more fascinated by the process she attained rather than the result, considering she preferred to molest me rather than wake me up so that she could ask some more questions about how that was possible. </p><p>I wouldn’t have answered them, of course, but her preference was interesting nonetheless. </p><p>I didn’t keep my eyes open, but I managed to sneak occasional glances without alerting her, each repeat showing a growing excitement as she started to abandon her awkwardness and embraced the erotic nature of the situation. </p><p>It was nothing compared to what we had been doing the previous night, but the fact she was taking initiative made it even tastier... </p><p>Soon, she started moving up and down with surprising fluidity, suggesting she was not aware of her own movement, especially since the exaggerated movement would have been enough to wake me up if I had been actually asleep. </p><p>I continued to relax in her bed, the comfort of my blanket more than enough to compensate for the lumpy coat underneath. Meanwhile, the movement range of her fingers got larger, climbing high enough to graze the crown, dipping down to touch the base, and even leaving a lingering touch on my balls. </p><p>Just as I thought it would be the end, she managed to surprise me once more. </p><p>In the form of her beautiful lips, parting in preparation…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Life was good, I decided as I continued to look down, not willing to miss even a second of the naked Asian beauty leaning down to devour my shaft, her hands on my thighs. </p><p>Her enthusiasm was quick to be blocked by the immense size of my shaft soon, when she was barely able to take one-fourth of it. “It’s not as easy as Tiffany made it look, is it?” I asked with a chuckle. </p><p>She didn’t answer, but her frustrated gaze, rising to meet mine, was enough to show her distaste. “Do you need any help?” I followed. </p><p>“No,” she answered as she pulled back for a moment, her tone rebellious. “I can handle it if she can do it,” she added before leaning back. </p><p>It was an interesting thing to focus on at the moment, suggesting that she wasn’t just being fueled by her anger, but also a sense of jealousy and inferiority that was triggered by the previous night. </p><p>Phenomenal…</p><p>I said nothing for a moment, giving her the freedom to work with my shaft and prove herself, the combination of the feeling of her lips and the sight of her naked body was more than enough to buy my patience temporarily. </p><p>She firmly shut her eyes as she grabbed my hips for leverage, pulling herself deeper. It went fast until I felt the feeling of the entrance of her throat, only for a monumental gag to escape, slowing her attempts down immediately. </p><p>I watched her struggle for the next minute, only for her to fail spectacularly at each attempt. “Are you sure you don’t want any help?” I asked even as I wrapped my hand around her hair, ready to push her down. </p><p>Only for her eyes to widen in shock before she pulled back panickedly. “No,” she gasped. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I suddenly leaned forward and lifted her, her petite body barely weighing anything. “W-what, where are we going?” she asked panickedly, glancing fearfully at the stairs that led toward the bedroom, showing that despite her action, she was not ready to step into an enclosed space with me. </p><p>Which was funny fear, as last night’s encounter should have thought her I had no problem pushing the limits of what society deemed acceptable. </p><p>Compared to some of my other adventures, the deck of a private boat was simply nothing. </p><p>“Don’t worry, we’re just going for the lounge,” I said, pointing at the small seating and bar combination that we had been hanging on earlier. “I’m not a young man, I need to sit occasionally,” I said, delivering a sentence that was more worthy of a man in his seventies than my real age. </p><p>Joking about the age was much easier when the audience was leaning against my muscular chest while being carried in a bridal hold to enjoy the contrast. </p><p>I lay on the long seat, and positioned her on top of me, looking in the opposite direction, her lips once again hovering inches away from my shaft. </p><p>“Here, now you can work on it as much as you want,” I suggested, my hands already locked on her hips to prevent her escape. And, since she showed no signs of trying to escape and instead leaned down to capture my shaft once more, her hands already working on the base, they started mauling her naked ass instead. </p><p>I raised my head slightly to watch her work on my shaft. Not seeing her beautiful eyes dancing between hesitation and arousal as she worked on it was a loss, but luckily, my new angle had other things to compensate for. Her surprisingly large tits, swaying freely as she moved back and forth in her attempts to take more of my shaft were one of those. </p><p>My proximity to her glistening core, getting wetter and wetter with each passing second, was another. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to decide to enjoy that proximity. With my hands already on her plump hips, I just needed to pull a bit to lower her hips to my face, my tongue already out. </p><p>She pulled back in shock, her voice alarmed. “What are you—“ she started, only to be interrupted by a moan halfway as my tongue started to work on her core. “That’s—“ she tried to complain, but another brush, and it was converted into a beautiful whimper. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, I’m just being a gentleman and paying you back for your hard work,” I answered, unable to keep back a chuckle at her reaction. </p><p>“Still—“ she said, but that was all she was able to say as my tongue returned to its assigned task, dancing and brushing at her entrance. Another moan exploded off her lips, loud enough to bring her fiancee climbing up if he wasn’t too drunk to understand the significance of those sounds. </p><p>Also, I trusted Brenda enough to alert me if he started to act. There was nothing wrong with her expertise on the current subject. </p><p>Umi whimpered as my tongue continued to work, but soon, she managed to gather herself enough to return to her task. Her tongue slid along my shaft before returning back to the crowd, swirling slightly before slipping inside. </p><p>The movement was amateurish and choppy as she tried to replicate Tiffany’s tricks, but I wasn’t complaining. Her enthusiasm and beauty were more than enough to compensate for the lack of smoothness. </p><p>Especially after her lips returned around my shaft and she restarted her attempts to devour my length. A groan escaped my mouth as she managed to surpass her previous record and pass the halfway mark. </p><p>An incredible achievement for a first-time sucker, especially with her relentless gags and gasps, showing she had a sensitive throat. </p><p>Soon, the sensitivity of the throat got too much, and she abandoned her attempts to go deeper. However, since she decided to compensate by getting faster, I wasn’t exactly complaining. </p><p>Not to mention, watching her struggle as she worked on the task of handling her first cock was a unique pleasure. If I just wanted an amazing deepthroat, I would have dragged Brenda toward it. </p><p>As she worked on my shaft, my tongue continued to work on her core, each brush pushing her closer and closer to a climax, her tits jiggling every time my tongue hit a particularly sensitive spot. </p><p>Her hands tightened around my legs, enough to leave finger marks as she tried to multitask between devouring my shaft and getting serviced. Unfortunately, she was far too experienced to handle the growing pleasure, and soon, she rose once more, gasping and moaning as her tits jiggled and bounced. </p><p>She rose and sat on my face directly as the pleasure got more and more intense, driving her closer to the pleasure. Soon, she was gasping and moaning repeatedly under the growing invasion of pleasure, signaling an upcoming climax. </p><p>Her cries got louder and louder, until they were cut. Not because she reached the climax, but because of Brenda. </p><p>“Oh, really, why don’t you show me what you have in your room?” Brenda spoke loudly, her voice loud enough to cut Umi’s dazed pleasure. </p><p>“No,” she gasped as she heard the distinct sound of people climbing the metal ladder at the side of the ship. Her hands searched for her bikini, only to realize she had forgotten them on the way back, where she had left her stuff. </p><p>“We need to hide,” I said as I grabbed her and rolled, using the lounge we had been using as a bed moments earlier as cover. It was more of an excuse, as she was pinned under me, my shaft already pressing against her entrance, her tits pressing against my chest as she was pinned under me.  </p><p>Her eyes widened in shock, but I pressed my hand on her lips, preventing her from making a sound. </p><p>“Wait a moment,” I said, looking up to see why Brenda decided to ruin my plans by coming up, afraid that we made too much noise, enough to even alert Charlie despite his state of drunken excitement. </p><p>Charlie stepped onto the deck, but he barely managed to stand on his feet as he stumbled forward, drunk enough to make me guess that Brenda made him climb the ladder because she was afraid of him getting drowned. </p><p>Brenda stepped on the deck a moment later, her face exasperated. “Yes, you stud, just like that,” she moaned fakely as she put her hands on his shoulder and led him toward, her expression bored. </p><p>Then, she caught me peeking from the top, and her bored expression turned into a smirk. From her angle, she couldn’t see Umi under me with the seat on the way, but it didn’t take a genius to guess why I was ‘hiding’ there. </p><p>Especially with my swimsuit and Umi’s bikini in the middle of the deck, giving an accurate impression of our state of dress. </p><p>“Now, let’s go and you can show me just how strong you are,” Brenda said as she moved forward, leaving us alone on the deck once more. Yet, before shocked Umi could even ask me to move, a beautiful moan arrived from the stairs, begging for a dick, followed by the movement of a bed. </p><p>A smile appeared on my face as I realized just how far Brenda was going. The sound was convincing enough to make me worry if I hadn’t seen Charlie too drunk to walk unaided, let alone perform in bed. </p><p>Brenda was giving Umi the last excuse she needed. </p><p>“H-how dare he,” she gasped angrily as her legs wrapped around my waist…</p><p>It seemed that she wanted him to pay. </p>",

    "content": "<p>A smile grew on my face as I conjured a small ball of fire, making it dance in the air, a  few feet above me as I tested my newest ability.  </p><p>Figuring out a new discipline of magic had always been a happy affair, providing me with more options, which, in turn, meant that I was getting stronger. However, it was a bit different from the current magic I had been using, as I could feel the magic itself was awakening cheerful emotions in me, far more intense than I usually felt. </p><p>No wonder Cinder was calling it the living fire. </p><p>Which was also the reason that, even as I made the little fire dance a foot away from my fingers, I still didn’t lose all my tenseness. The fire was obedient, but only like a pet lion with lackluster training was obedient. </p><p>And, my skin still throbbed with pain to remind me of the cost of it lashing out. </p><p>“Impossible,” Cinder repeated after a minute of watching me control the fire. “H-how could you do such a thing. It’s not supposed to work like that.” </p><p>“Maybe I have a special bloodline,” I answered, which, in my experience, was the easiest answer to give under such circumstances. I had a great deal of experience with people’s reactions once I had managed to discover a different way of using the magic they had dedicated their life to. </p><p>And it was never gratitude, even if I was willing to teach them the new, more efficient way. Maybe it was about the way most people learned magic — through a very strict traditional education, revering the process — but they seemed to take affront on my innovative ways. </p><p>“Maybe,” Cinder said, taking my explanation at face value as she watched. </p><p>I played with the little fireball for a few minutes, making various shapes to test the limits of my control, then I turned to Cinder. “It’s now your turn, why don’t you show me the benefits of the transformation.” </p><p>“R-right now?” she answered, panic growing on her face immediately. “I’m not sure if now is the correct time—“ she started, her pointless platitude clearly an excuse, which was why I pressed my finger on her lips to silence her. </p><p>“There’s no time like the present,  show me how much your abilities grow,” I ordered. </p><p>I expected more argument, but even as I delivered the order, I could feel the connection between us getting stronger, enhancing the order with a sense of gravitas. It wasn’t like a compulsion, at least not the kind that was impossible to break. It was more like my order getting some extra weight. </p><p>Interesting benefit, though clearly unnecessary considering the speed Cinder followed my order. She raised her hands, and suddenly, flames covered the sky, enough to make me glad I had played safe when I had been setting up the wards that would keep this little meadow hidden and suppress the radiance of her magic. </p><p>Though, the only reason they survived was that she didn’t want to damage the wards. If she wanted, she could shatter the wards easily. </p><p>I was fascinated as I watched the dance of the flames, especially since she showed no sign of strain even as she channeled her magic. </p><p>Avoiding a fight had been the correct response, I realized as I felt my mouth dry suddenly. Even if her power had been enhanced by the weird resonance that happened, the comfort and ease she had been displaying as she created a huge wall of flame in the sky with complete confidence s showed that she was yet to begin tapping into her expanded capabilities. </p><p>Even with the shield and tether, a fight had been a dangerous proposition unless I went for a killing blow, assassin style. Though, considering the potential implications of killing her, I would have probably chosen to retreat using the Blade of Shadows. </p><p>Still, even as a part of my mind was occupied by the way her magic had been flickering in front of me, a bigger part was occupied by observing the way her magic had been working on.  </p><p>While my method of using living fire worked well, allowing me to cast incredibly strong fire magic with little consumption, it was nothing compared to the great efficiency I could feel from Cinder as I slipped my own mana to hers to watch the process more intensely. </p><p>Clearly, they had a reason for preferring their method of surrender. </p><p>Soon, I noticed a shadow on the corner, tensing for a moment before I realized it was Isolde, coming to check what was going on. </p><p>I gestured for her to calm down and go back to her own training. She just nodded before returning, not bothering to push the situation, or even asking about the reason for the commotion. </p><p>Or even making a comment about the mostly-naked state of the sexy phoenix, her skin covered in flames.  </p><p>Her obedience was really useful. </p><p>After chasing away Isolde, I said nothing for a while, watching Cinder as she continued to cast. Soon, she started to get more and more confident with her new limits, her test spells getting stronger as she started to touch her new limits. </p><p>A frown occupied my face as I watched the change of her spells, then I interrupted her with a spank. “Enough,” I called. </p><p>“W-what? Why?” she stammered as she looked at me, her face flush with excitement, showing that she had been feeling an intense version of the pleasure I had felt earlier. </p><p>“Your spells are getting sloppier the more you cast,” I said to her with a frown. There was no doubting about the sheer power, but there was more to high-end magical combat to it. </p><p>“What do you mean, clearly, the stronger the spell, the better, especially since I can still cast it quickly?” she asked, a question that earned a sigh from me. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I said, even as I realized that, despite the great aptitude she had displayed, she must not have any practical combat experience. Her earlier spells had been much more structurally sound and well-crafted, which, at that point, I attributed to her combat awareness, but after those new spells, I revised that information. </p><p>It was probably about the competence of her tutors rather than her approach. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel disappointed. “Cast another fireball, as strongly as you can,” I said, pointing at the center of the opening. </p><p>She was clearly annoyed at my words, and as a result, cast the spell with even more power, clearly intending to invalidate my comment. </p><p>I responded by a much more simple spell, a small bolt of ice that was targeting the core of her fireball, one that destabilized its structure completely, so what was supposed to be a great explosion of fire fizzled out halfway, turning into an inferno. </p><p>It was still a devastating fire unlike a normal fireball, which would have fizzled out, showing the advantage of the living fire. </p><p>Still, the loss of impact was enough to convey my point. </p><p>“I must have miscast it,” she said with a stubborn frown as she repeated the spell, only for it to fall apart even worse this time. After three more repeats, I decided to cut her off. </p><p>“Do you understand my point now?” I asked her. Admittedly, it was not a trick that anyone could easily repeat, as I had to apply the full range of my skills while also leveraging the tether to get such an impressive result. </p><p>But that didn’t mean leaving easily-leveraged weaknesses in spell structures was a good idea, especially on a relatively simple spell like a fireball. The weakness would have been even more obvious in a more complicated spell. </p><p>She just nodded, too frustrated to answer. “With your words, sweetie,” I said, slapping her ass to punctuate my question. </p><p>“I said I understand,” she growled in frustration. </p><p>“Good,” I said. I was tempted to push her a bit more about the disrespect she had been showing me, but I managed to hold back. She was clearly not used to being admonished directly like that — reinforcing the idea that she had come from a well-off family and was pampered greatly despite her failure to transform. </p><p>And,  about transformation. </p><p>“So, tell me, what’s the true meaning of a phoenix transforming?” I asked. </p><p>I watched her expression flicker as I asked that. The first response was anger, but it was a reflexive one, one that clearly came from a lifetime of habit, evidenced by the speed it disappeared as the realization replaced it, remembering it was not a problem for her anymore. </p><p>Yet, the elation that replaced them was not pure, underlined with hesitancy as I felt her magic move as she tried to ascertain the barrier that limited her since childhood, leaving her facing the unknown. </p><p>An understandable concern; if the transformation meant exactly what I thought it meant. </p><p>“It’s the embodiment of the final cohesion between a phoenix and the living fire, the sign that we are … true avatars of the living fire,” she said, the last part carrying no small amount of bitterness, as it was also admitting failure for her. </p><p>“And, what’s the final result,” I asked, curious for a more concrete answer. She chose to answer more directly and raised her hand. </p><p>And a fiery bird, majestic and intimidating, appeared on her palm, flapping its wings calmly. A small model of the true form, carefully. </p><p>But still enough to confirm that the stories about the huge birds of flame were not just something to look like gods to the masses. </p><p>All that remained was to decide what to do next.   </p>",

    "content": "<p>With each quick step toward the bathroom door, my smile widened in anticipation. </p><p>Who knew a simple walk could be so entertaining? </p><p>The entertainment I was feeling had two sources. The first one was simple, owing to the redhead on my lap, doing her best to keep her hold, her trembling legs wrapped beautifully around my hips, her face buried on the nape of my neck, doing her best to process the spectacular orgasm she had just gone through. </p><p>The pleasure I received from her presence was certainly not a mystery, not with every step effortlessly pushed my presence deeper inside her, her breasts rubbing against my chest. </p><p>The second source was more interesting. It was watching a hint of Megan’s shadow under the door. </p><p>Initially, as I stepped out of the shower with Kim in tow, there was little shift in her movement, but that changed when I started walking toward the door with rapid steps, only pausing for a second to pick up a towel, not even drying ourselves I pushed forward. </p><p>The shadow moved rapidly, yet the movement itself was erratic, as if she tried to stand up, only to fail at the first attempt. I wondered whether it was the fear of getting caught, or her legs trembling for another reason. </p><p>Discovering the answer to that little mystery hadn’t been too difficult. </p><p>It was the latter. </p><p>The evidence, as I opened the door, I found Megan still on one knee, desperately trying to fix her bra to hide her erect nipples while her panties were damp enough to make her last-second twist of her legs to hide it rather useless. </p><p>If I didn’t much about Megan’s attitude, I might have teased her about that. Yet, everything she did showed a desperate need to get more famous, And, while she did so with a cold-blooded determination that actually earned my respect, it didn’t change the fact that such an attempt was inevitably based on an intense desire to get recognized. </p><p>And, what better way to trigger someone that built her whole life around the idea of being recognized than ignoring her despite catching her in such a compromising position. </p><p>“You can use the shower now,” I said as I continued to walk forward, not even pausing for a moment. </p><p>Under most circumstances, such a move wouldn’t have been believable, therefore reducing the impact significantly. Yet, thanks to the naked redhead on my lap, busy moaning with each step as we got closer to the bed, my current status didn’t qualify as one of them. </p><p>As I continued to walk, Megan went into the bathroom, the loud slam of the door was enough to show that my little trick worked much more excellently than I expected.</p><p>Maybe I underestimated the impact of the earlier strip show on her mood.  </p><p>“You’re … evil,” Kim managed to mutter as we arrived at the bed, showing that she was able to process the invasion of pleasure, not to mention familiar enough with her best friend to understand the significance of my little trick. “You … know that she’ll pay back—“ she added. </p><p>Only to be interrupted as I threw her on the bed, face first. “I must have treated you too lightly if you are still in the mood to think about the others,” I said as I looked at her. </p><p>She said nothing for a moment, busy scrambling to change her alignment. Yet, she didn’t answer even after she completed her movement and lay on her back, instead choosing to occupy her time by staring at my glistening cock. </p><p>I didn’t move, letting her enjoy the show for a moment.  She earned that much. “I can’t believe you just shoved all of this inside me,” she grumbled for a moment. </p><p>I took that as a sign to move and climbed on the bed, smirking as I did so. “Hey, you’re the one that claims you can take all of it without the slightest issue. Feel free to ask me to stop or slow down,” I said, pausing for a moment to let my smirk widen even more. “You know what you need to say.”</p><p>“Never,” she growled, her anger quick to awaken as she remembered the exact words she needed to say to earn my mercy. </p><p>Admittedly, the way her legs parted open as she said so showed that it wasn’t just the indignity of uttering those words that made her avoid that direction. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I moved forward, but rather than sliding inside her, I moved a bit more so that her chest was under the valley created by my thighs on both sides of her. </p><p>Leaving her beautiful lips just inches away from my shaft. “You want—“ she started, but that was the only thing she was able to say before I grabbed her beautiful red hair and pulled her forward, skewering her mercilessly. </p><p>The resulting muffled cry as I invaded her throat was simply marvelous. “Feel free to tap my leg three times if you want to say the magic words that would make me stop,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>Despite the challenging situation she was in, she managed to raise her eyes to send me a threatening glare, earning my admiration. She recovered from her earlier climax, surprisingly so considering the intensity of it. </p><p>Not that I had any problem with it. </p><p>I grabbed her head even tighter before moving more, turning the blowjob into a merciless throat-fucking, but her hand stayed away from my legs decisively. </p><p>I continued ramming down, enjoying the signs of her arousal, curious whether I could make her climax in this position. She clearly had all the telltale signs of such a need, enough to make me think that it was a reasonable possibility. </p><p>Of course, it was also possible that she would surrender before reaching that point. </p><p>However, before that little experiment could be concluded one way or another, I felt a movement behind me. </p><p>It was not the System, but a combination of living in the streets, further enhanced by playing football. I could always feel someone approaching from behind. </p><p>Luckily, there was a convenient mirror on the bedside, allowing me to steal a sneaky glimpse behind me. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, it was Megan. Yet, while her presence was not a surprise, the same didn’t apply to how she looked. </p><p>She had a towel wrapped around her body, but it was barely large enough to cover the essentials. On the topside, it was barely high enough to cover her nipples, still leaving a hint of her delicious areolas. </p><p>But pulling it any higher was not an option with the situation downstairs. There, the towel ended just below her core, with no margin for error, even the slightest move would be enough to create a scandalously revealing glimpse. </p><p>The deficient towel she had around herself was completely accidental, of course. I had been in there just moments ago, and saw that there were several towels and bathrobes of various sizes. </p><p>There was no reason for her to limit herself to that little piece. </p><p>Not that I was unhappy with her choice. On the contrary, it was a beautiful show, especially since the towel she picked was soft and thin, wrapping around her body as beautiful as a tight dress, enhancing her beauty. </p><p>Amusingly, her beautiful blonde hair was only slightly glistening with water rather than getting completely wet, like she took a shower twenty minutes ago and it was in the process of drying. </p><p>With another subtle effort, she managed to enhance her allure even more. I had to admit, I admired her hustle, willing to use even the smallest advantage, showing a killer instinct that I rarely saw after I finally got free of the streets. </p><p>Pity that she decided to pit herself against someone with an even stronger killer instinct, and played with a rigged deck. The abilities the system gave me, such as Seduction and Taunt, worked wonders to read the nuances in her actions much more than I would be able to. </p><p>Especially through just glancing at a misaligned small bedside mirror. </p><p>I subtly watched her as she waited behind me, managing to give a sexy pose — one that still looked casual and random — even as her gaze fell down to watch the show that was going on. </p><p>The impact was clear from the way her nipples pushed against her top, showing just how much the little live-action show was affecting her.  </p><p>Yet, she didn’t waste much time watching and raised her gaze, and took a step forward, her step unnecessarily loud. </p><p>Since her whole aim was to get my attention, I took great pleasure in ignoring her not-so-subtle attempts to deny that. </p><p>I expected her to get angry as her attempt failed. Instead, a determined one took that place as she took a step forward… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Even with the noise of the party, Megan’s gasp of shock was unmistakable as I grabbed Kim’s hips and lifted her trembling body against the bathroom wall. </p><p>“The audience is getting impatient,” I said with a chuckle, confident that that little interplay wouldn’t be heard by Megan. </p><p>“Don’t worry about that, she can act entitled from time to time,” Kim said, trying to sound confident, doing her best to hide the tremble in her tone, showing Megan wasn’t the only one that might be too occupied by the way she looked. </p><p>Kim did her best to look like a dominatrix without being gauche, and from everything I could see, it was not an unfounded desire. She certainly enjoyed that aspect. </p><p>But, our earlier moment showed that she clearly enjoyed being submissive as well, showing some switch traits, more than willing to take the submissive role under a sure hand. Yet, despite her enjoyment, she clearly did her best to hide that, showing she was rather invested in not reflecting that trait outwardly. </p><p>Not too unsuccessfully, I might add, and it would have been much more difficult to detect that little trick without all the assistance the traits provided. </p><p>Yet, the difficulty of cutting through her outer layer didn’t make her comment any less amusing. </p><p>“Oh, really, I didn’t notice,” I answered, earning a chuckle, even as I shifted my grip a bit for better access, and Kim opened her legs, showing just how enthusiastic she was about the upcoming beautiful moment. </p><p>I let my smirk widen at the moment, enjoying her implicit surrender that cut through all of her attempts to play the dominant party. </p><p>“Let’s give her a show, to teach her a lesson about peeking,” Kim suggested even as she raised her hips, making the entrance even easier. </p><p>I moved forward, pressing against her entrance, but didn’t immediately move for completion. Instead, I caught her beautiful green eyes and enjoyed her gaze for a fleeting moment. “A good idea, but do you think you can handle the full brunt of my action?” I asked. </p><p>“Oh, big boy, believe it. I can take anything you dish,” she whispered even as she pushed her hips forward as far as she could manage — which wasn’t much considering she was pinned against the wall, with my forearms supporting her thighs. Yet, even with that little amount, I didn’t let her succeed. </p><p>Instead, I pulled back the exact amount to maintain the same connection, not giving her even that little hint of success. The frustrated moan that resulted was a thing of beauty. “Let me ask. Are you sure you want me to put on a real show?” </p><p>“Of course I do,” she growled. “Don’t worry, I’m not a weak little girl,” she answered. </p><p>“If that’s what you wish,” I said as I put the slightest pressure against her entrance. “Then, let’s find a safe word.” </p><p>“I don’t need one,” she growled as she repeated her earlier attempt, only to be foiled again. </p><p>Agility was not just useful on the football field. </p><p>“No, that would not do. Just yell that I’m a little weak girl if you want me to stop,” I said, letting my smirk widen even as I said so, doing my best to poke her pride. </p><p>She growled once again, but this time, rather than trying the same trick with her hips, she chose to grab my shoulders and dug her fingers deep. Not enough to draw blood, but it wasn’t too far away from that point either. </p><p>It hurt, of course, but I was not unfamiliar with pain even before the benefits of the Divine System started to enhance my abilities. </p><p>“Oh, the kitten has claws,” I said, doing my best not to show any sign of pain, or even slight discomfort — which was rather easy thanks to the relative dimness of the bathroom.</p><p>Her growl of frustration was just as beautiful as her naked body, pressing against mine. “And how long are you going to wait, until I fall asleep from—“ she started, her frustrated statement cut halfway by an explosive moan. </p><p>Because I pushed my hips forward. </p><p>“Damn, girl, you’re wet,” I said even as I pushed my hips, skewering her halfway with the first move, enjoying the way her walls loosened to allow my invasion. “Just how horny you got as you watched me receiving that show from the strippers.” </p><p>“Shut up,” she answered as her grip on my shoulder tightened even more. </p><p>“Oh, little Kimberly can’t handle talking at the same time?” I said as I pulled back, but moved forward again just as she opened her mouth, destroying her response in a beautiful cry. Yet, as beautiful as her cry was, it wasn’t as beautiful as the beautiful expression in her eyes, two aspects of her nature battling, a primal pleasure mixing into her intellectual frustration. </p><p>A nicer man would have slowed down for a minute or two for her to get used to my presence, as it was hardly in a size that could be classified as comfortable. Unfortunately for her, while people described me in many ways, nice was rarely an adjective they used. </p><p>Not that anyone could argue that such a situation was unearned. </p><p>Not with her earlier challenge. </p><p>So, I continued, punishing her for her arrogance with the rhythmic, merciless beat of my hips, making her moan loud enough to actually impair her attempts at breathing. </p><p>And, the way the little shadow I could see under the door was any indicator, Kim wasn’t the only one that was overwhelmed by the nature of my reckless charge. Megan was shuffling repeatedly — and I doubted that the reason for her shuffles was her desire to come and save her friend from my hands. </p><p>However, rather than occupying myself with the movement of a shadow, I turned my attention to the sexy redhead that was doing her best to get a breath. </p><p>After all, no matter how suggestive, the movement of a shadow was nothing compared to the beauty that was currently in my grip. I let my hips quicken, even more, testing her resistance. She dipped her head down to hide her expression from me, showing she was not entirely lost in pleasure, and still showed enough presence of mind to attempt to hide her expression from me. </p><p>Too bad for her replicating the same for her moans was much more difficult. The frequency and intensity of her moans showed just how much she was losing control, making her attempt to hide her expression rather useless. </p><p>At least, from a functionality perspective. From the perspective of enhancing my pleasure, it worked excellently. </p><p>I let my smirk widen slowly as I slowed down the aggressive assault of my hips, enough for her to recover a modicum of control. </p><p>She waited a few seconds before she raised her gaze to understand the reason for the sudden change of pace, only for her eyes to be widened as she caught my playful smirk, realizing it was just bait. </p><p>“Pity we don’t have your camera with us, I would have loved to immortalize this moment,” I whispered, enjoying her shocked expression. “Why? Can’t you handle being on the other side of the camera? Don’t tell me you’re that weak, Kimberly.” </p><p>“Don’t call me —“ she started, only to be interrupted by an explosive moan as I chose that moment to push my hips forward, interrupting her angry correction. “Kimberly,” she still added after her moan subsided, showing that she was true about her distaste for the diminutive versions of her name. </p><p>How entertaining. </p><p>“And, what would you do if I do, Kimberly,” I said, making sure to pace my movement so that our hips collided with each word, creating a beautiful combination. </p><p>She didn’t answer, but the anger that infected her beautiful green gaze showed that it was not about her lack of complaint. The sudden anger worked wonders to destroy — or at least, temporarily arrest — her growing submissiveness. </p><p>She didn’t complain, because her mouth had better things to do, such as letting out an incredible chain of moans that showed the depths of her pleasure. So, she tried to use her earlier tactic and dig her fingers into my shoulder. </p><p>Even that wasn’t as effective, because, with growing pleasure, her lips weren’t the only part of her body that she was struggling to control. Despite her best effort, her fingers lacked the strength to make her touch painful, reducing it to an overly enthusiastic caress. </p><p>The perfect time to give her the first reward of the evening. I let my hips forward, letting both the Strength and Agility traits enhance my movements, enough to bring what was happening from amazing to spectacular. </p><p>I wondered if Megan gasped as she watched, but it was not something I would learn. Not with the incredible cries that exploded off Kim inches away from my ear. </p><p>Those cries soon turned desperate as Kim started trembling with the telltale signs of an orgasm — far more intense than I expected. Yet, as I felt her tremble on my lap, I kept my shaft inside her, enjoying the way she repeatedly tightened around me. </p><p>It wasn’t enough to make me climax, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t fun. </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me that great Kimberly couldn’t handle an itsy-bitsy orgasm,” I whispered, expecting the anger to flare in her gaze once more, only to find a much more mellow and accepting gaze. </p><p>It seemed that her name wasn’t as big as a taboo after a spectacular orgasm. </p><p>“So, are you ready for a second round,” I said. </p><p>“O-of course,” she managed to say. “I’m not a — weak little girl,” she stammered. </p><p>“Sure, sweetie,” I said as I chuckled, enjoying the exhaustion in her tone as she tried to say that, and started walking toward the door. </p><p>She needed some rest, and what better place to get that than the bed, where her best friend could assist.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Even as Umi started moving back and forth, rocking over my length, I could feel that her tenseness was yet to disappear completely. </p><p>In a way, it was understandable. Just because she was letting things go too far didn’t mean that she was unaware she was letting things go too far. It was just that, due to out-of-view ‘cheating’ of her fiancee. </p><p>Of course, that was just an illusion, one that was created by Brenda. The blonde secretary might not be good when it came to her job, but she truly knew how to play with a man from a distance, especially a naive one like Charlie. </p><p>The poor guy didn’t even have a chance. </p><p>Under the shadow of Brenda’s lush laughter, I finished putting sunscreen on her breasts, and started to move lower, toward the last untouched destination. </p><p>“I-is it really necessary,” she gasped as she made a motion to stand up, but it was a weak, ineffectual move, easily prevented by the weight of my hand. </p><p>“Of course, we don’t want your beautiful lips to burn if your bikini bottom slips, or you have to remove it for any reason.” </p><p>“I’m sure such a thing wouldn’t happen—“ she stammered, only to be interrupted by a moan as I let my fingers cover the remaining distance aggressively, landing on her knob. </p><p>“Really, do you want to bet?” I said throatily, letting the challenge infect my voice. A challenge that was enough to silence her, no doubt invaded by the memories of the night before, aware of just how far things could devolve in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Or maybe, I was reading her wrongly. Maybe it was just the fact that my fingers were dancing at her entrance, each flick triggering a beautiful moan that she did her best to suppress, but only attained partial success. </p><p>Luckily, her fiancee had other things to focus on, thinking Umi was just lounging on the deck of the ship. “Do you think that Charlie imagines that you’re lounging on my private … deck?” I whispered. </p><p>“D-don’t be crass,” she gasped back, barely able to stammer a response. </p><p>“Well, maybe he just doesn’t care. Or he would at least check what kind of bikini I picked for you,” I whispered, adding a few flickers of doubt about her fiancee’s ultimate aim. Or, more accurately, I fueled already existing ones, as Charlie already achieved the seeding part by sending Umi to entertain me the night before. </p><p>He was unaware of the truth of what was going on, misguided by his overconfident manager, but it certainly looked different from Umi’s perspective. And, Charlie’s reaction to being flirted with by a sexy bombshell like Brenda just further enhanced Umi’s inclination to think of his actions in the worst light. </p><p>Combine her otherwise submissive personality with a shark like me, and it turned into a recipe for disaster. </p><p>A fun one, I thought with a confident grin as she quivered on my lap. With her attention focused on suppressing her moans, she didn’t pay much attention to the trembles of her body, or the great effect it had on my strategically-positioned shaft. </p><p>At this moment, I could have pushed her down and had my way with her, but where was the fun in that. Instead, I pulled my fingers, and without she could react, I helped her to stand up. “Let’s go and see what your fiancee is doing,” I said. </p><p>“R-right now,” she stammered as she looked at me, breathing hard, her legs trembling. </p><p>“Yes, right now,” I replied as I gave her a confident grin that made her legs tremble even more. I was speaking louder than necessary, because I wanted to alert Brenda that we were coming, expecting her to do something interesting. </p><p>“Oh, Charlie, you’re so bad,” Brenda gasped, followed by a crystal laugh, just as we arrived at the side of the ship, leaning against the railings. </p><p>Damn, I thought as I glanced downward, taking a mental note to let Brenda whatever she wanted to buy on our little trip. The scene I glimpsed at the sea deserved nothing less.</p><p>When we arrived, Brenda was fixing her top while she was looking at Charlie, like she was to be blamed for the mishap. From our angle, it looked scandalous. Yet, I didn’t miss the fact that Brenda’s back completely turned to Charlie, not giving him even a glimpse, and the distance between them was too much for him to quickly realign himself. </p><p>Especially since he was already drunk enough to prevent him from moving quick enough. </p><p>I managed to catch those details, but, if Umi’s sudden huff of anger was any indicator, she wasn’t as careful analyzing the situation. </p><p>She said nothing, just walked back disappearing from the view before Charlie could even register her presence. I turned to watch her, standing still to enjoy her movement, her hips shaking at each step. It wasn’t a measured sway to maximize her assets like Brenda might have displayed, but that didn’t make her any less sexy. </p><p>On the contrary, the intensity of her emotions only made them more impactful. </p><p>Halfway to the deck, she stopped and turned. “Are you coming?” she ordered impatiently, her voice lacking even the slightest indecision in a rare display of confidence.</p><p>She must be truly angry. </p><p>Her anger was misguided — at least, partially so, as no one forced Charlie to follow Brenda into the sea and ignore his fiancee — but I had no problems enjoying the benefits of her emotions despite that. </p><p>I didn’t reach where I was by being nice. </p><p>Umi just waited until I arrived next to her. Her hand reached toward me, and for a moment, I was sure that she would grab my wrist and drag me toward the small bedroom of the ship. </p><p>Then, she surprised me by reaching for something different. My swimsuit. She pushed it down with a tug even as she fell to her knees. “It’s all Charlie’s fault,” she murmured petulantly. Normally, it wasn’t the most attractive emotion, but it looked much better on the face of exotic beauty. </p><p>Especially since the exotic beauty in question was kneeling in front of me, her gaze locked on my shaft. </p><p>Her statement was inaccurate, that much was clear. Some were Charlie’s fault, but quite a bit was hers as well, a mixture of trusting the wrong people — like her redheaded bestie — and lacking the ability to say no, unable to gather the necessary courage under the overwhelming combination of her submissiveness and her curiosity. </p><p>“Of course, it’s all his fault. And you need to make him pay,” I whispered rather than informing her about my true thoughts. After all, the devil didn’t go around having fair debates about people, he just whispered temptations… </p><p>Not that Umi seemed to require many temptations at the moment if the speed at her fingers wrapped around the base of the shaft was any indicator — her soft fingers unable to all the way. “I’ll make him pay,” she whispered as she leaned forward more, her lips finally touching my shaft. </p><p>“Yes, make him pay,” I whispered as I slid my finger into her beautiful black hair, enjoying the glorious softness on my fingertips. Of course, the sensation was nothing compared to the hesitant touch of her lips as she devoured the head, but I didn’t want to scare her. </p><p>Instead, I limited myself to playing with her hair as she went back and forth, carefully watching her expression as the hesitation slowly disappeared, replaced by a smoky, lusty look, along with what could be termed as confidence. </p><p>The confidence portion didn’t survive for long. I treated it as a signal, and reached down, hooking my finger around her bikini top, directly into her cleavage, while my other hand tugged the string that was responsible for keeping it in place. </p><p>A tug later, her bikini top was yanked away, leaving her gasping in shock as she pulled back, her hands on her breasts. “Come on, sweetie,” I said. “You wanted to make him pay, right. You need to do it properly.” </p><p>She gaped as a blush spread on her face, but she glanced down, looking at my naked shaft, the glistening head enough to tell her she had already gone sufficiently far, and an absent top could hardly make a difference. </p><p>Then, before she could fully make that commitment, another laughter exploded from the sea, erotic and suggestive, enough to renew Umi’s warped understanding of what was happening. Though, it caused a surprising reaction. Rather than leaning forward, she grabbed the strings of her bottom, and a tug later, freed herself from its confines. </p><p>“See,” I said with a chuckle. “It’s like just I said. All it takes is an accident to leave you bereft of it. Aren’t you happy that I already put sun screen?” </p><p>“S-shut up,” she stammered. And, since she followed that up by leaning forward and wrapping her lips around my shaft, I decided to follow her orders. </p><p>The moment was just too fun to miss the implications… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I walked toward the bathroom, smiling at Irene’s sudden protests. She didn’t speak loud enough for me to properly hear her voice, just enough to catch the sudden undertone of distress. </p><p>She was panicking at Ida’s decision. I felt curious why, but not enough to go back and distract them from their talk — or give Irene a chance to change her mind. Instead, I pulled off the shirt as I walked forward, finally getting rid of its tight grip. </p><p>It turned out to be the correct choice, because just as I passed through the doorway of the bathroom, Irene burst out into the corridor, no doubt to inform me about a change of plans that she attained. </p><p>Only to freeze the moment she came across the sight of my naked back. </p><p>I did my best to suppress my chuckle, acting like I didn’t see her as I closed the door, and removed it quickly, wanting to finish changing before Irene could throw the shock at my half-naked body. </p><p>The potential for entertainment was simply too much to ignore otherwise.</p><p>Yet, as I removed the pants and opened the bag, I couldn’t help but think that there was a mistake. There were two pieces of clothes, but the majority of the bag was occupied by a large cloak. The other piece was much smaller, making me think that there were missing pieces. </p><p> A brief examination showed that it was only a bottom that could only be described as a loincloth, but I didn’t waste too much time examining it. </p><p>After all, it wasn’t like I was ashamed of showing up with a missing outfit. </p><p>I quickly changed, so when I heard a knock on the door, I was already tying on the cape, one that hid my back yet left my front completely visible. “Yes, Irene, how can I help you?” I asked as I opened the door. </p><p>She didn’t answer, but considering it was because she froze at the sight of my mostly-naked body. The cape covered my back successfully, but considering I was looking at her, it was not exactly helpful. </p><p>And the less about the loincloth, the better. </p><p>“I … Maybe we shouldn’t…” she stammered as she got a better view of my muscular chest, close enough to allow her to touch without straightening her elbow. </p><p>“Nonsense, I’m already changed, and it certainly looks fun,” I answered as I reached down and tapped her own bag. “Why don’t you change and come visit us,” I added. She still looked hesitant. “Come on, Irene. It was your idea in the first place, but if you changed your mind….” I followed, letting just a small amount of annoyance slip into my tone. </p><p>That small amount was enough to break her already shaky determination — mostly thanks to the fact that she was still distracted by the surprise show she had received. </p><p>“Maybe…” she stammered again as she blushed, but under my gaze, it didn’t take long for her to surrender. “You’re right…” </p><p>“Excellent, then see you inside,” I whispered, using a particularly throaty tone that was enough to make her shiver in arousal even without the great visual aid I was providing to her. </p><p>I walked past her, letting my body rub against her shoulder to enhance the impact, even more, amused by the fact that she stayed frozen at the entrance until I walked the whole distance and went back to her little nerd cave. </p><p>The nerd cave that was holding a cute Asian with a disappointed expression. A disappointed expression evaporated faster than a water puddle in a nuclear explosion. “Don’t worry, I managed to change her mind,” I said as I walked forward. </p><p>“Excellent,” she whispered excitedly, yet her gaze was on the floor even as she started walking. At this point, their mood swings between shy and confident were not a surprise, so, rather than stopping and watching her, I took a step forward, positioning myself between her and her camera. </p><p>She froze as she suddenly found her objective interrupted. She tried to take a step around me, but I interrupted her again, and again. After the third repeat, her gaze rose, her confidence shivering helplessly without the mental assistance of her camera, the change simply beautiful. </p><p>So beautiful that, if it wasn’t arousal that was dancing in the depths of her gaze at the sight of my mostly-naked body — an arrangement she was responsible for in the first place, which made me even less inclined to pity her — I might have let her go and achieve her objective. </p><p>Yet, ultimately, she wasn’t afraid but aroused, a beautiful combination that I had no intention of missing. </p><p>Not after she went all the trouble of fighting with her friend to get me almost naked. </p><p>“M-may I get my camera,” she whispered softly, impossible to hear if our bodies weren’t already close enough for the distance to be measured by inches, and still stay in the low end of the single digits. </p><p>“What’s the hurry, we can start once Irene arrives. I’m sure she will arrive in a minute or two. Instead, why don’t we talk about your attitude while taking photos.” </p><p>“W-what about it,” she stammered as she took a step back, one that made her beautiful breasts bob gently with her stride. I was quick to cover the distance, forcing her to retreat once more, once again requiring two steps to match one of mine. </p><p>And, just like before, she soon run out of her escape route, but this time, it was not a couch but a wall against her back, even more solid, leaving no path to escape. </p><p>A fitting theme to my barbarian costume — or at least, the late-night erotic film equivalent of a barbarian — to put my exotic princess into such a delicious peril. </p><p>A peril that she was tempted to taste no matter how ill-advised it was. </p><p>“Your attitude, of course,” I whispered as I leaned down, once again pinning her in place by putting both arms around her, her whimper more beautiful than the greatest song. “You  were rather aggressive when ordering behind the camera.” </p><p>“I-is it a problem?” she whispered. </p><p>My smile widened. “Oh, not at all, on the contrary,” I whispered. “It was very fun.” </p><p>“T-then,” she whispered in confusion. </p><p>“Just because I enjoyed it doesn’t mean I wouldn’t reverse it,” I whispered even as I slid my hand under her skirt once more, climbing up her thigh. </p><p>“It’s not fair,” she managed to stammer as she dipped her head down. </p><p>“Well, I can stop if you don’t want to continue. Do you want me to stop, or continue?” I asked. My question lingered without an answer even as my fingers steadily climbed up her inner thigh, stopping only when I was close enough to her core to feel the radiating warmth on my fingertips. Yet, I didn’t push for more. </p><p>It would have been too easy. </p><p>“If you don’t give an answer, I’m going to assume that you want me to stop,” I whispered, making her raise her head, her shy gaze capturing mine, wordlessly begging me to change my mind, showing that, she was more ashamed to ask me to continue to wordlessly accept my touch to her most sensitive spot. </p><p>I might have pitied her and accepted her desperate gaze as an answer if it wasn’t for her aggression while she made me pose. I was impressed with her attitude, just not enough to miss such a beautiful opportunity to make her pay. </p><p>She maintained her silence despite the location of my hand, only to be broken once I started pulling my hand back. “C-continue, please,” she whispered, her desperation clear despite the softness of her whisper.</p><p>“As you wish, princess,” I whispered as I let my fingers move just an inch more, which was all that was needed for me to land them on her wetness, enjoying her beautiful shivers. </p><p>“Ohh,” she gasped as she shivered, her voice loud despite all of her attempts to keep it down. She raised her hand, but before she could press that to her mouth, I raised mine to grab her wrist. </p><p>She looked surprised at my move. “W-what if Irene hears it?” she managed to ask.</p><p>“Good point, then, let me help,” I whispered as I leaned forward and captured her lips, successfully suppressing any moan that she might let out. She stiffened as my lips pressed against hers, suggesting that I might have actually stolen her first kiss. </p><p>Not that she seemed to be torn over that fact as my tongue invaded her beautiful mouth, each flicker of tongue making her shiver — well, either that, or the skillful manipulations of my fingers downstairs, giving her a level of pleasure she was clearly unaccustomed to. </p><p>As I pressed against her, her chainmail bikini was rather noticeable, but it was a fun type of discomfort, the contrast making the moment even more pleasurable. </p><p>That didn’t leave her top free from manipulation, of course, as I reached the back and loosened the strings that were holding it together. With the natural weight of her chainmail top pulling it down, it enhanced the cleavage even more, while simultaneously loosening it enough for my fingers to slip underneath easily. </p><p>My fingers tightened around her hardened nipple, my other hand still under her skirt, slowly dancing around her knob, and with my lips still busy giving her a kiss that would have been enough to put her into a magical daze… </p><p>Combined, a minute would be enough to push her into a delicious climax. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I heard the footsteps on the corridor, soft and hesitant, showing Irene was walking toward us. </p><p>“You’re very unlucky,” I whispered as I pulled back, chuckling at her conflicted expression, begging for me to ignore the arrival of Irene, but lacking the courage to utter those words. </p><p>I chuckled as I turned toward the door and take a step forward, though I was kind enough to position myself in front of Ida, giving her the concealment she needed to fix her costume, at least enough to erase the most obvious signs. </p><p>I doubted she could erase all of it easily, but she should be able to erase the most, enough to avoid suspicion. </p><p>Especially since our redheaded observer would have her own distractions, I thought as I looked down at my loincloth, strained to the limit after our little encounter…</p>",

    "content": "<p>The sensation of slipping inside her for a second time was just as amazing, though even as I slipped inside her, I realized one very amusing detail. A little oversight — one that wasn’t happening for the first time. </p><p>“By the way, sweetie, before forgetting,” I started even as I skewered her halfway, enjoying her moan. “I remembered that you’re yet to bestow your beautiful name to me. Would you be so kind to deliver that?” I said. </p><p>Despite the invasion of pleasure — and some more material things, she found the power to twist her neck to catch my gaze, her face colored with an intense surprise, enough to suggest that she was sharing the same surprise. </p><p>She might have had some choice words about the circumstances we found ourselves in another time, but. still trembling after her last orgasm while a new wave of pleasure invaded her body, a lone stammer was all she was able to handle. </p><p>“M-Mariel,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>“Mariel,” I repeated, testing the cadence of her voice, enjoying the cadence of her name. “A beautiful name,” I added, intersecting it with a slap to her ass, adding to the rhythmic sound of my hips. “Almost as beautiful as the way you’re tightening around me.” </p><p>“S-shut up,” she managed to say even as she shifted her head and buried her face to the pillow, earning a chuckle from me at the intensity of her blush, even at the moment, the slightest attempt to dirty talk enough to break her confidence. </p><p>“How amusing,” I said, not bothering to keep it to a whisper, and she buried her face in the pillow even deeper. </p><p>Her pillow did more than just hide her shame. It also helped to suppress her boundless moans that displayed the capabilities of her supernatural lungs. Not exactly a development that increased my enjoyment. </p><p>At least, not before her moans got even more intense as my impalings started to invade deeper and deeper, her moans getting loud enough to make the muffling of the pillow rather redundant. </p><p>“Before forgetting, the reward of your obedience,” I added as I reached to my mana reserves. </p><p>[- 318 Mana]</p><p>The sudden addition of the earlier Light-based massage trick worked the opposite direction I was expecting, and rather than pushing her delirium deeper, it actually made her act. </p><p>Well, if I counted the act that was limited to her neck twisting to catch my gaze once more, while the rest of her body stayed under me obediently as I pulled her wings to ram inside her again and again acting. </p><p>Interpreting her gaze was not too hard. Once again receiving the reward that allowed them to slowly bind with her Divine Spark allowed her to cut through the pleasure, reminding her that just an hour ago, we were in her office, having a deep discussion about the nature of the Gods. </p><p>Even more amusingly, I caught a beautiful sheepish expression on her face, suggesting that, as she lost herself in pleasure, she didn’t even realize that the flow of mana from me had ceased. </p><p>Which robbed her of the only excuse she could have for the situation she was suffering. If I continued, she might have at least justified the position she found herself in for herself. Yet, unless the person in question was delusional enough to count as sick, they required a strong excuse to function as a pillar for their self-deception. </p><p>The effects of my massage were certainly such a pillar. Such a pity that she didn’t even notice its absence, making it essentially useless. </p><p>Her expression cycled between expressions, ranging between abject shock and pure arousal, before setting in a grudging acceptance. Grudging, because she clearly didn’t appreciate the indignity she found herself in. </p><p>Acceptance, because her expression told me that she had no intention of stopping halfway, not with a pleasure she had never felt before invaded her body. </p><p>I decided to test that determination for a moment. “I can stop if you—“ I started, only for her to freeze in abject shock for a fleeting moment before interrupting me. </p><p>“No!” she gasped. </p><p>I chuckled even as I spanked her ass. “Try listening to my questions completely, Mariel,” I said, pausing after I said her name, enjoying its cadence like a particularly tasty piece of dessert, its delicious aroma lingering on my tongue. </p><p>“Mariel,” I repeated, enjoying the tone, yet, even as I did that, I realized that that taste wasn’t as theoretical as I assumed. </p><p>She shivered with something more than just pleasure, showing I wasn’t the only one that was feeling that. I turned my attention to her magic even as I repeated her name once more, feeling her magic flaring subtly and mixing with my mana even more efficiently. </p><p>“P-please, slow down,” she whispered, showing she was being impacted by that. </p><p>“Why do you say so, Mariel,” I said, enjoying her trembles getting even more intense as I uttered her voice. </p><p>“B-because it’s my …” she started, only to slow down. </p><p>“Your what, Mariel?” I said, enjoying her tremble even more while I felt a fleeting connection between us, more than just her mana merging against mine. But I failed to understand the full extent. </p><p>“Because it’s my … true name,” she admitted. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked, feeling curious enough to ask. “And why is your true name having such an effect?” I asked, feeling important enough to pause for a moment — but not important enough to actually pull out. </p><p>The reflexive gasp she let out as my constant drilling stopped for a fleeting moment was beautiful, showing just how much she didn’t want the pleasure to stop. “I … I don’t know,” she whispered, which might be the single most obvious lie I had ever heard. </p><p>I was too used to drawing conclusions from half-formed pieces to fail to read her complications. The true name was clearly something magical about her nature, enough to be treated magically important, but considering the shock, she was displaying about the effect it triggered, it was rather obvious that it was more about her changing true nature as she successfully absorbed Divine Spark and slowly progressed into the rank of the goddess. </p><p>Regardless, it also implied that, if I asked her about her name anytime but at the moment, as she was deep into the throes of pleasure, I might have received a different name. </p><p>Of course, that left many questions unanswered. The exact definition, for example. Or whether it applied just angels, all supernatural creatures, or all beings including humans — maybe excluding people connected to the system. </p><p>It also raised questions unrelated to my sexy headmistress Mariel, such as if it applied to the dragons, whether Janelor was actually the true name of my sexy Dragoness, or if she gave me some kind of daily name.  </p><p>However, all of those questions for another time, I decided as I restarted the movement of my hips once more, her spectacular tightness once again testing my abilities to stave off a premature explosion. </p><p>“Let’s leave the question of your true name for a moment, Mariel,” I said, enjoying the shiver of her mana, one that reflected in her body immediately. “Instead, just answer my question. Do you want me to stop…” I said, pausing for a moment to see whether she would explode in a panic once more. </p><p>To her credit, she didn’t. </p><p>“… distracting you with my mana while we’re enjoying our special embrace?” I asked, enjoying the way her head dipped down. </p><p>“No,” she muttered, but her beautiful voice was subdued as she said so, somehow feeling self-conscious about her earlier reaction. It didn’t survive for long before the moans of pleasure stole the show once more, of course. </p><p>“Such a greedy little angel,” I said teasingly. “Wanting a massage and a proper fucking at the same time…” </p><p>Unlike the earlier euphemistic phrasing, the more explicit word was once again enough to push her into a near-catatonic state, making her bury her head into the pillow once more. </p><p>Yet, her hips stayed raised, allowing me to repeatedly ram into her beautiful body without the slightest pause, showing that, her extreme reaction toward dirty language was not a barrier to her pleasure. </p><p>I said nothing else, once again letting the time fly, measuring it by the light sheen of sweat that started to gather on her skin, a little sign of impurity that I had never seen on her before, showing the depths of pleasure she lost. </p><p>As time passed, the pleasure started to get too intense, challenging my ability to contain myself, so I decided to surrender to the pleasure. But not before one last attempt to tease her beautifully. </p><p>“I’m about to come,” I said, which made her tense beautifully. </p><p>“N-not inside,” she stammered, showing that, while she might be woefully inexperienced, it clearly didn’t include not knowing the basic mechanics of the process and the implications. </p><p>“Not even if it would arrive with an amazing flood of mana, enough to fill you to the brim?” I asked, which was enough to make her pause in indecision for a while. </p><p>Once again highlighting her lack of knowledge when it came to the applied side of the carnal business, because froze long enough to make her answer irrelevant. </p><p>“Too late,” I said even as I let my control over my body loosen, filling her with my seed explosively. </p><p>“N-nooo, that’s too much!” she cried, but that was all she was able to say before a spectacular tremble hit her body, triggering another climax, this time even more explosive than the previous one. </p><p>Since I promised her, I let my magic infuse my explosion. And, as a reward for her spectacular obedience, I even made sure to intensify the impact of Tantric to quicken her merging even more. </p><p>[-4728 Mana]</p><p>Such beautiful obedience needed to be rewarded, I thought, my mind already busy with many interesting things I could apply to her. </p><p>Unfortunately, as I looked down, I found her already collapsed, the intense chain of orgasms she experienced without a break, when combined with the intensity of the mana flood, proved more than enough to break through her supernatural physical resistance. </p><p>“Well, that was a fun start,” I murmured, spending a moment to think whether I should go and work. </p><p>But, the presence of her beautiful soft wings was enough to change my mind. Instead, I lay down next to her, smiling as her wings reflexively wrapped around me protectively. </p><p>I fell asleep, not before one last spell, changing the nature of her bed from a simple cot to a large, four-poster bed, decadent enough for us to bury ourselves. </p><p>And, just as one last joke, pure black…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 5106 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I wanted to follow her implied request, but not before teasing her a bit first. </p><p>“It’s rare for you to be so kind when giving an order,” I whispered mockingly even as I continued to rub against her body, enjoying the sensation of her flawless skin, each second driving the sensation higher. “What do I owe this change?” </p><p>Another whimper escaped her lips, one she let out in response, showing just how much the pleasure she had been enjoying loosened her attitude. </p><p>Not that I could blame her, as she had been dealing with the weight of her Divine Spark for a very long time, and I could hardly imagine the extent of the stress such a problem caused her without any hope of resolution. </p><p>Add that to the responsibilities of managing Silver Spires, the royal politics that seemed to be determined to include her, undead attacks, and most importantly, the constant presence of the Eternals… </p><p>Yeah, neither her initial stress, nor the elation she felt as the weight of her biggest problem disappeared was entirely surprising. </p><p>“No answer, huh,” I whispered. “What a rude action. And do you know what happens to rude headmistresses?” </p><p>She flinched, but that might be more about me suddenly ceasing my flow of mana, stopping the slow binding process she had been enjoying. “W-what happens?” she found herself muttering reflexively, the shiver she let out as she said so impressive.</p><p>Especially considering she was tightly locked between the wall and my body. </p><p>“They face a choice,” I whispered, stretching the limits of Speech to the limits as I extended the cadence of my tone, wanting to elicit a reflexive response from her. Of course, even with my Speech and Charisma, it was not exactly a simple trick to pull. </p><p>I only dared to attempt it because of her current state. </p><p>“W-what choice?” she whispered. </p><p>“They either stop getting massages, or receive punishment,” I whispered. </p><p>“Punishment,” her answer came immediately, her determination beautiful. I felt her body stiffen as she realized the nature of her words, but before she could rethink her stance or take back her statement, my hand rose, landing on her ass. </p><p>The cry she let out was beautiful. It was certainly not pained, as to actually hurt her, I needed to hit hard enough to ruin the moment. </p><p>Luckily, that was not necessary, as the indignity of being spanked was much more impactful for someone in her position. For better or worse, she had ruled the school with a distant yet unyielding fist, enough to fall into the habit that even the simplest of her comments couldn’t be violated.  </p><p>The lack of pain was actually better, leaving her bereft of an excuse she could rely on to explain her shocked yet beautiful cry. </p><p>After the first spank, she had enough time to change her mind, but chose to stay silent as I used the opportunity to deliver another mana flood, just enough to make her consider suffering the indignity. </p><p>After all, what were a few spanks compared to finding herself pinned naked in her room, obediently giving up her body just for a massage… </p><p>The number of spanks slowly piled up as time passed, each arriving with a cracking sound, and leaving a soft, stinging sensation behind — one that I cast a reversed-healing spell to leave on her ass, making her flawless skin redden. </p><p>The other continued to caress her wings, their spectacular sensitivity not exactly helping her to recover from the conflicting physical feelings she had been enjoying. </p><p>Just as she was starting to get used to the new state, I pushed her limits once more, this time letting my hand slip low after the spank, dripping to a dangerous part of her anatomy. </p><p>A part that was sopping wet. </p><p>“N-noo,” she gasped in shock as my fingers danced around her clit, finally breaking the silence she maintained during the spanking. “That’s too—“ she added, but her voice died halfway as my fingers continued to dance around her sensitive spot, the pleasure building once more. </p><p>“What part of punishment you don’t understand?” I asked even as I finally let go of her wing, letting that hand slip between the wall and her body. Her gasp only intensified as I captured her nipple between my fingers, twisting hard enough to trigger another flood of pleasure, another touch of Healing magic perfect to add a layer of a shock to the equation. </p><p>“I don’t—“ she started, but as my fingers sank into her shockingly large breasts, she was once again betrayed by her own body, the flood of pleasure coalescing into a beautiful moan. It was a tense, throaty one, showing she was not too far from another climax. </p><p>The perfect thing to take as an implicit reaction to push further. </p><p>“You don’t, what?” I asked as I shifted my hands to her waist and pulled her as I stepped out of the bath, once again in the bridal hold, her beautiful wings flapping in trembles. </p><p>Yet, as she found herself lying on her bed, all she was able to achieve was a needy whimper. I grabbed her hips and pulled them up momentarily, preparing her for the real event, earning no complaint as she tried to deal with the invasion of pleasure. </p><p>Her hips stayed up as I pulled back, making no attempt to change her vulnerable position. Yet, I didn’t slide instantly. No, there was still one thing I wanted to do. Something I was being tempted for a long time. Since I had discovered her true nature. </p><p>I grabbed her wings. </p><p>It wasn’t a gentle touch, nor it was a violent move. The best word to describe it as I grabbed them was firm. As I pulled them up, she let out a shocked moan. </p><p>I paused a moment, enjoying the feeling of utter control as I grabbed her wings, her hands flailing helplessly as the invading pleasure ruined her coordination. </p><p>To make things even more fun, it wasn’t the greed that was keeping her obedient, as I had ceased using the mana flood as I carried her. </p><p>No, it was an even more beautiful sin that kept her in place. </p><p>Lust. </p><p>“Such a horny angel,” I said as I tightened my grip around her wings, and slid inside her, accompanied by a spectacular moan. </p><p>And just like that, I took the virginity of a beautiful angel. </p><p>As her warmth tightened around me, I paused, properly enjoying the changes in the nature of our little warped relationship, from the days I had treated her as a distant scary figure, to the days I had treated her as a strong yet naive boss… </p><p>Now, she was just a little horny angel, squirming under the invasion of unfamiliar pleasure as I continued to enjoy her phenomenal tightness, each second driving my intense pleasure even higher. </p><p>She might have an issue with my sudden pause, but if she did, she was too busy moaning with the constant invasion of pleasure to deal with it properly. </p><p>I didn’t stay motionless for long, of course. Regardless of how monumental the moment felt, it wasn’t enough to actually make me disregard the spectacular moment I was in — though, even if I did, she was ready to remind me with the sweetness of her moans, the rhythm of her dangling breasts, and the beautiful contrast of the color of her hips, still carrying the mark of my spanks. </p><p>I pushed forward, something she enjoyed rather well if the way her back arched was any indicator. </p><p>My hold over her wings tightened as my hips started rocking back and forth, pushing forward as her tight body remodeled around me, her moans exploding loudly enough to deafen a weaker man. </p><p>For a while, I did nothing other than moving back and forth, just enjoying the relentless invasion of pleasure, her tightness getting more and more. There was no banter, no teasing, no order. </p><p>Just a steady rhythm of our bodies as I pushed her toward the second climax of her life. One that didn’t take long to arrive, hitting her with all the strength of a collapsing building, pushing her toward the land of unconsciousness… </p><p>Only for me to prevent that by casting a simple healing spell. </p><p>The utility of magic was hard to overstate. </p><p>However, the spell was not there to wake her up directly. Instead, I cast that to temporarily block her natural pain resistance. Waking her up was a task for my hand, stopping and grabbing her beautiful wings for a moment as I spanked her beautiful ass. </p><p>The jolt of pain was perfect to make her open her eyes despite the incredible flood of pleasure. “Do you need a break, or can the great headmistress of Silver spires continue without a pesky break.” </p><p>It was proof of her pride that even under the circumstances, it made her twist her neck and catch my gaze, her expression beautifully tight, showing hints of anger — hints only because it was being drowned in a sea of pleasure and trembling. </p><p>“I’ll take it as a no,” I smirked even as I pressed my hand on her back, pushing her down for another session…</p><p><br></p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I frowned as I turned my thoughts toward the next step of my plan. </p><p>I was tempted to ask Cinder to practice for the next hour as an example, but that would be just an attempt to delay time. I had already learned all I needed to learn from her earlier show. </p><p>Stopping the practice completely was also tempting. Maybe I shouldn’t bother trying to learn a new school of magic, one that worked much differently than my other abilities, while dealing with a crisis that threatened the whole world. </p><p>However, ultimately, I decided to ignore that direction as well. </p><p>I was already in a safe location, far from any kind of civilization that could be threatened by a dangerous mishap, under the observation of the most competent teacher on the subject unless I discovered the secrets of dimensional travel. </p><p>“No time like the present,” I murmured. </p><p>“Did you say something?” Cinder asked as she shuffled, showing that she was distracted by the pleasure of her current seating arrangement to pay much attention to my words. </p><p>I reached to her naked breast and squeezed, earning a beautiful gasp from her. “Don’t worry sweetie, I was just talking to myself before experimenting with this new energy. Why don’t you pay attention to that while I experiment.” </p><p>“Umm… Do you think that’s a good idea to start experimenting that quickly. Living fire is a dangerous thing.” </p><p>“How long do you recommend studying before we start.” </p><p>“Not too long,” she answered, and I smiled. Maybe it wouldn’t be too bad to let her lead teaching. I didn’t expect her to have a concrete idea. “For a human … maybe just a decade,” she added. </p><p>“Right,” I said, the sincere desire to help on her face the only reason I didn’t start spanking her immediately. I certainly didn’t have a decade to slowly work off the kinks of my new ability. “I have somewhat a more accelerated strategy in mind,” I answered. “Just watch, and don’t intervene unless I explicitly ask you to, alright?” </p><p>“But — “ she started, only for her words to be interrupted by a spank. </p><p>“Understood?” I repeated. </p><p>“Yes,” she gasped, though her shocked affront was laced with arousal as well. </p><p>She was truly developing a taste for punishment. I let my left hand linger on her body while I raised my right hand, and raised my hand, ready to experiment. </p><p>Surrendering myself to this unique magical energy was out of the question, especially since it was showing signs that the first part of its moniker might not be an exaggeration. It wasn’t just a choice, though, but an actual impossibility. </p><p>Even the thought of it was as impossible as pushing my head under water, and trying to breathe. A lifetime of habits and reflexes prevented it. </p><p>Instead, I gathered the smallest amount of the special energy I could manage, and flared my mana, to see whether it could be leveraged as some kind of boost to my usual spells. </p><p>The answer turned out to be negative, in a very spectacular manner. The small sliver of energy suddenly grew into an explosive flare, searing my finger in the process as it broke the shield I established for this exact purpose. </p><p>Even then, the only reason the rest of my hand stayed intact was my reaction, tapping onto the ability of the Shield to create a layer, pushing the crazed magic away. </p><p>Interestingly, Cinder flinched away from the resulting reaction as well. The first time I saw her reacting against any kind of fire, suggesting it wasn’t entirely shocking that it managed to push through my newly-acquired flame resistance. </p><p>However, even before casting another spell, I spanked Cinder’s ass. “Don’t intervene unless I order,” I said as I felt her magic moving once more. </p><p>“But —“ she tried to say, only to receive another spank. </p><p>“That’s the nature of experimentation, there’s no gain without at least some pain,” I said even as I cast a healing spell on myself, which, frustratingly, resisted the healing energy much more than I had expected from such a simple wound. </p><p>A rather amusing little detail, especially since the pain lingered even after I had been cured. </p><p>“But the pain of the cursed burns —“ Cinder tried to intervene, showing that she was very much aware of the impact. </p><p>No wonder she warned me many times. </p><p>“It’s not that hard to ignore,” I said, but still, during the next few experiments, I created a much stronger ward, consisting of several layers, not wanting to risk it. Even then, the subsequent experimentation didn’t work any better, every single attempt to control it resulting in a backlash that would have been deadly if I hadn’t been using only a sliver of energy. </p><p>Pity, it wasn’t useful as an offensive weapon, as the moment it flared, it bounced back to the caster rather than targeting the others. </p><p>It would have been an excellent suicidal attack, but that was hardly my style of doing business. </p><p>“Are you sure that’s the best strategy?” Cinder whispered as she watched me, flinching every time the living fire turned chaotic. </p><p>“Best, definitely no,” I said with a chuckle, caressing her comfortingly, aware that the presence of my hand on her naked skin was the only reason she maintained her current position. “But definitely fastest.” </p><p>And that was not an exaggeration. While the results looked similar, every repeat, I had been using a different strategy of control, trying to understand the details of the reaction. It didn’t take long for me to understand that the fire was reacting with intelligence that surpassed my initial expectations, enough to rival some of the smarter animals. </p><p>In a way, it was bad news, meaning none of the mana control techniques that were available for me could be used even after re-purposing. It was like trying to use a dam to herd a cat. Hardly useful. </p><p>Meaning, I needed to use a different approach. </p><p>What would happen if I could trick the fire about the source of the manipulation, I suddenly decided as I started constructing a ward, and then tried to channel the fire through it. </p><p>The attempts didn’t work as I intended. As long as I maintained the connection, the fire attacked me, as if it somehow realized I was the source of its issue. And, considering the ward made it much more difficult to control it, it wasn’t exactly a useful tradeoff. </p><p>Even worse, no matter how much I tried, the ward failed to manipulate the living fire without my direct input. </p><p>“Maybe you should take a break,” Cinder whispered after almost an hour of experimentation. </p><p>I was about to reject it, but then, I realized that the break offer was not exactly for my benefit or hers. She had been flinching badly with each chaotic flare of the living flame, building up her stress. </p><p>The only reason she was able to resist it for an hour was her special seat, feeling my erection under her while my fingers continued to caress her body. </p><p>Though, the growing arousal might help her to control her fear, it hardly helped to make the situation bearable. </p><p>Especially after a long hour of teasing and torture. </p><p>She earned a reward, I decided even as I let my fingers drift lower, her silver panties melting to clear the path, allowing me to touch her wet core. As I flicked my fingers, a moan exploded off her lips, showing just how close to a climax she was already. </p><p>How fun was to tame her, I decided as I freed my shaft and slid inside her, enjoying the way she clamped around me. </p><p>And, just like that, the inspiration struck. </p><p>The living fire acted like an unwieldy mount, doing her best to free herself from my control. Just like the beautiful girl on my lap had been doing before I had educated about the perks of listening to me, and now, rather than running around, giving orders, she was begging for her pleasure. </p><p>And begging loudly, her every jump making her tits dance vigorously.  </p><p>As I pushed her forward, making her land on her hands and knees, I started thinking about how to achieve a similar effect for a sentient piece of magic. It wasn’t a simple problem, naturally, but pushing inside Cinder repeatedly as her cries turned into a symphony, I had something to keep me busy while I tried to find a solution to that problem. </p><p>It was a risky direction, as while it was not a total surrender, it was not exactly the isolated way I was used to casting magic. Yet, it wouldn’t be the first time I faced something that was too big to pass up, and took a challenge that was above my head. </p><p>At least, this time I wasn’t trying to deconstruct a spell to save myself from certain doom, which was something I had managed to put myself in my youth more than once. </p><p>While I continued to slide inside Cinder, I constructed my wards again once more, but this time, I didn’t seek efficiency. Instead, I did my best to replicate the magical pathways of Cinder, giving the living fire a comfortable living area. </p><p>Hardly the most accurate description of what I had been doing, but a good verbal metaphor to explain it at least. </p><p>“Are you still —“ Cinder gasped as another explosion occurred not too far from us, but I once again silenced her with a spank, not even bothering to answer as I created the wards again. </p><p>She maintained her silence for a while. Well, not saying anything was a more accurate description. As, under my repeated invasions, it didn’t take long for her to collapse in a climax, moaning repeatedly. </p><p>I continued experimentation, and soon, she finally commented again. “Impossible!” she gasped, but I didn’t punish her this time. </p><p>Because, I was watching a rudimentary flame arrow flying in the air with an equal fascination. </p><p>My first success.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I soon ignored the growing difficulty of keeping my transformation in check. After all, it wasn’t like I had anyone to talk to that would make my state a drawback. The only one I technically could talk to was the captain, who was a sorcerer and might have the necessary knowledge, and I certainly wasn’t in the mood to trust him. </p><p>The only risk was one of the sailors coming down to check us, but luckily, their secret armory was not their favorite hanging spot. </p><p>Instead, I once again turned my focus on my internal nature, particularly the way my crackling with an intimidating amount of magic — I would have used the word endless if I hadn’t watched the intimidating display of the Archmagus, giving me a new appreciation of the word — that I needed to take control as soon as possible. </p><p>I cycled the mana, one that turned into lightning in my veins, but rather than leaving me as a charred mess, it just left a comfortable warmth behind, like it was not the most destructive element known to mankind but a simple charm. </p><p>There were perks to losing control of my transformation, I realized. As my ears transformed, my hearing sensitivity increased enough to allow me to catch the discussions between the sailors, and the occasional order of the captain. </p><p>I listened to them as I circled my magic. The first thing I noticed was the distinct lack of gossip and idle chatter between the sailors, which I would have normally assumed as an after-effect of the storm, but as the orders came rapidly from the captain, they neither panicked nor got overwhelmed. </p><p>I would have said military precision, but not even the soldiers I watched could act in such a practiced manner in a state of emergency. Though, considering the secret warehouse of weapons I was currently in, their extraordinary origin was hardly a great surprise. </p><p>An hour into the travel, the ship suddenly stopped, with the first mate of the ship informing the sailors that they were about to go through an inspection. But, that was the extent of his explanation, not bothering to give a lot of reminders to his sailors, suggesting that they expected them to know how to act. </p><p>Which certainly deepened the mystery behind the ship, and in particular, how Theodora was able to arrange such a team.  </p><p>While I kept a sliver of my attention on them, I continued focusing on my core, circling my magic again and again desperately to gain control. Of course, I didn’t expect to have enough control to actually casually cast illusions and other utility spells for a long while. </p><p>The ability to cast an elemental blast without actually killing myself was all I hoped to regain. </p><p>Interestingly the inspection lasted long enough to actually allow me to achieve that part before it was our ship’s turn, giving me enough confidence to cast elemental blasts. Of course, since I expected the elemental rejection of the four elements to get even stronger, lightning blasts were my only option, and even then, I wasn’t sure I could control the intensity, only the backlash, making it the last resort that would alert everyone in a several miles ranges to my presence. </p><p>“Luckily, magic is not my only option,” I said as I caressed the Spear of Scipio, the weapon I never actually hoped to hold in my own two hands, let alone using it to challenge multiple sorcerers. With the spear and my abilities, I was confident enough to deal with one or two sorcerers with ease. </p><p>Any more would mean that alerting the others wouldn’t exactly be the biggest problem I was facing. </p><p>Yet, the spear wasn’t the only gain I found, I thought as I turned to the other two weapons, the bow, and the sword. </p><p>I first grabbed the sword. It was a simple, unadorned gladius, clearly Roman in origin, though made of bronze rather than iron. Or, at least, it looked like it was made of bronze, as my weapon forging knowledge was certainly not deep enough to accurately assess a Patrician weapon’s material nature. </p><p>I dragged my finger along its length, appreciating its excellent texture while I felt the connection between me and the weapon strengthen slowly. The sensation felt unfamiliar, yet familiar at the same time, like it was filling a gap that I didn’t even realize I expected. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but sigh as I analyzed the connection, which was not entirely magical, at least not the way I understood. It could still be used to channel magic — something I was reluctant to test without getting better control of my magic — but the connection was almost directly to my life force. </p><p>It was the reason I was able to use the internal abilities of the Spear despite my ruined control.</p><p>The sword promised a great expansion of my abilities, but unfortunately, the abilities of the Patrician weapons were some of the greatest secrets of the families that owned them, and it was unlikely to be laid around. </p><p>Of course, even if the original family that owned it had a such book conveniently lying around for me to steal, I first needed to know where that weapon had come from. Weapons, I corrected as I glanced at the large bow, which, unlike the gladius, filled with gold lines and drawings, radiating a much more elegant aura. </p><p>For the moment, the extent of my knowledge was eliminating two families from contention. It didn’t belong to House Scipio as I knew the history of my family too much to miss the existence of two lost Patrician weapons. </p><p>And they didn’t belong to House Junia, and I doubted even they wouldn’t throw their own bloodline-locked weapons with a pile of others just to have more experimentation material. </p><p>The bow clearly didn’t belong to any Patrician Families but to a different land. Unfortunately, my knowledge was rather limited to anything, not Roman, with the possible exception of Gallic and Germanic tribes, which I researched since I was a young adult as a potential avenue of retreat when the day of my uncle took control of the family ultimately come. </p><p>Yet, as I looked at the Spear of Scipio, I couldn’t help but wonder whether it was as inevitable as I had first thought. My grandfather, the crazy old man, clearly had other aims than just raising me into a good disposable weapon for the family considering he had actually used the bestowment ritual. </p><p>Unfortunately, even he wasn’t clairvoyant, and his death arrived before informing me about whatever plan he had for me. </p><p>And a plan, he clearly had, I thought as I looked at the two other weapons that I connected, wondering where the connection came from. </p><p>My first guess would have been my mysterious father, a figure that I seldom thought of since I was a child, not wanting to focus on the man that was the source of my plight. Yet, the bestowment ritual was enough to suggest that something was extraordinary. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was not a strong guess, as my father wasn’t the only direct relative I had never missed. I also never met my grandmother, a figure that my crazy grandfather never spoke about. And the ‘training’ I received after I made the mistake of asking about her once made sure I never prompted that question. </p><p>Though that didn’t prevent me from searching around the Estate back in Britannia, only to fail spectacularly, not even finding a scrap against her. </p><p>So, it was also likely that the bestowment ritual came from her side of the family as it came from my father’s side. </p><p>Or, maybe one from each. </p><p>Unfortunately, in either case, it meant that I needed to back to Britannia to start searching for, the freedom I lacked. After angering the strongest family of the Republic, it was certainly not safe for me to stay in any area under the direct control — or even the influence — of the legions, that that assumed I had dealt with the problem of my haywire core in the first place. </p><p>“One mystery at a time,” I murmured as I caressed the surface of the bow, feeling the connection setting between us, which, even without the visual differences, was enough to confirm that it didn’t come from the same origin. </p><p>The sword and the spear, for all their differences, had a very familiar sensation. If they were human, they wouldn’t be twins, but they would be brothers. Brothers with different colors of hair and some age difference, but brothers nonetheless, a glimpse enough to confirm the familiar connection. </p><p>The bow, on the other hand, was clearly a foreigner, not only coming from a different family, but also from a different country, a glimpse enough to separate the origin, different both in looks and habits. </p><p>Interestingly, even their attitude carried a different flavor. It was hard to describe, but the best thing I could identify was a sense of superiority. All three weapons had that, but the Roman ones had a healthy sense of competition, enthusiastic to prove their superiority but acknowledging the need for it. </p><p>The bow, on the other hand, radiated a sense of superiority that was born from its unique nature, and nothing else. </p><p>Of course, those were the first rough glimpses I was able to get from them, trying to make sense of something I could hardly comprehend, probably mostly inaccurate. </p><p>Before I could delve deeper, however, I was distracted by something more urgent. </p><p>The sounds of combat exploded upstairs… </p>",

Underneath her leather pants, I wasn’t expecting a white lacy set, one that radiated a sense of naughty innocence. </p><p>“So, is this enough to get an extended show,” she whispered as she stood in front of the shower. </p><p>“It’s enough for one song,” I said as I quickly fiddled with the sound system — one that was integrated into the shower just to highlight the wasteful decadence more — and turned on the music, starting the same song we had listened to earlier while Kim had been helping me to use the head cheerleader as a masturbation aid. “We can always bargain for more later.” </p><p>“Naughty,” she murmured as she stepped under the shower, a reckless smile on her face as her hand landed on my shaft — already in full mast — and stroked it a few times, in a way that would have been classified as tentative if it wasn’t for the smoothness of her movement. </p><p>Her underwear was quick to turn transparent under the shower, adding a unique sexiness to the moment, one that would have been hard to match even if she was completely naked. </p><p>“Mmm, delicious,” she moaned loudly as she slowly lowered herself to her knees, yet as she did so, I needed to turn my attention to something else. </p><p>The sudden absence of light streaking in from the keyhole. </p><p>And since there was still a streak of light coming from under the door, it was easy to guess Megan didn’t turn off the lights, leaving one other option, one that was supported by the suspicious break in the light that was coming from under the door. </p><p>Someone was curious about what was going on. </p><p>“We have an observer that thinks herself well-hidden,” I whispered to Kim as I raised my hand like I was washing my face, knowing that it would only make Kim act more aggressively to show off. </p><p>Her reaction didn’t surprise me. “Oh, really?” she whispered, her smile getting wider as she spoke. She said nothing else, nor could she as she leaned forward, occupying her mouth with more important activities. She first captured the crown between her pouty lips, her green eyes rising up to capture my gaze.</p><p>Then, it turned into a lingering kiss before she pulled forward, only to replace it with a smooth lick, going up and down along my length with a surprising passion. It was an interesting departure from her previous blowjob, one that was once again in the shower. </p><p>It still felt nice, but it looked even more impressive, suggesting that she was as interested in teasing her naughty friend as enjoying the perks of her access. She moved up and down several times, but her attempts to coat my length with her saliva were made impossible by the constant presence of the shower. </p><p>With one hand gently cupping my balls, she repeatedly licked my length. Only when we reached halfway to the song, she decided for a change of pace and her lips slid over my length once more. A low moan emitted from the depths of my throat as her lips covered more and more of my shaft. </p><p>I was tempted to grab her head and pull her closer to skewer her throat, but before I could take any action, Kim had already grabbed my legs and started to pull herself deeper and deeper, once again showing a surprising preference toward a more painful version of fun. </p><p>Showing that her preference for wearing leather was not just a coincidence. </p><p>Meanwhile, the subtle shadow at the entrance stayed in place, but I noticed a subtle movement, almost trembling, which raised a saucy question about what Megan was doing. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t ask her to open the door and give a better glimpse of what she was doing without ruining the beautiful mood that had been established. </p><p>Instead, I turned my attention back to Kim, who was doing her best to devour my full length, showing a beautiful combination of desire and willpower. </p><p>Then, the song came to an end. </p><p>“That’s the end of the song, but since you don’t seem to want to stop…” I murmured as I leaned down and grabbed her bra from both sides and pulled. There was no doubt that Strength Trait was extremely useful for the game, but that didn’t mean it didn’t have some ancillary benefits. </p><p>Like allowing me to rip off her underwear like it was made off the paper, leaving Kim half-naked — though, admittedly, that descriptor was already accurate before that. </p><p>Still, the pressure of her naked breasts over my thighs was certainly an improvement. </p><p>The destruction of her bra didn’t seem to annoy her much. On the contrary, she clearly enjoyed the rough move, as it only fueled her intention to engulf my shaft fully, the sudden boost of passion allowing her to cover two-thirds of the distance, her gasps, and gags loud enough to suppress the sound of the shower. </p><p>Since she was clearly enjoying roughness, I grabbed her arms and pulled them high, which allowed me to steadily push into her throat without a fundamental issue. She let out a gasp, but that didn’t seem to prevent her steady attempts to devour more and more of my shaft, each second achieving more. </p><p>I grabbed both of her wrists with one hand, pulling them high enough to challenge her flexibility, especially after I pushed them back a bit, enough to earn a steady gasp of pain in the process. </p><p>Soon, she was gasping and gagging even more loudly, but her attempts to take my shaft fully failed. </p><p>“You’re lucky that I’m a helpful person,” I whispered as I grabbed the back of her throat and pulled her tighter, enjoying the beautiful gasp of pleasure she had let out in the process as I pulled her closer, finally allowing her to achieve her objective. </p><p>Swallowing my full length.  </p><p>“Not bad, even though you had to cheat a bit,” I commented, which was enough for her to look up despite her strain, anger flashing in her gaze despite her throat tightening around my girth.  </p><p>Such an amusing woman, I thought. </p><p>Then, a murmur reached my ears. It was not a particularly quiet one considering I was able to hear it through the constant background noise of the water, the music, and Kim’s constant gagging, but I doubted Megan was aware of that fact as she lost herself in fascination. \"She's doing it.\" </p><p>Kim continued to her assisted deep throat without the slightest reaction, suggesting that she had missed it. </p><p>I pulled Kim even deeper, bringing her to a point that would have been impossible without my assistance, her lips finally reaching the base of my shaft, giving her the achievement she had been seeking all along.  </p><p>As her throat tightened around my girth, I met with my next challenge, keeping myself from exploding. While my new Traits gave me a greater ability to command my body, I had been also challenged to a great degree. Kim’s deep throat was delicious already, but the fact that it followed the amazing thematic strip show I had received from six cheerleaders elevated the challenge from difficult to almost impossible. </p><p>Technically, I might have actually resisted it despite the difficulty, but not before turning it into torture for myself. So, Kim’s throat tightened around once more while her nose brushed against my skin, bringing me to a point where I was about to burst. </p><p>I let her arms go as I took a deep breath. Yet, to my surprise, rather than using that as an opportunity to pull back, she grabbed my hips, and increased her pace even more. </p><p>That managed to break my willpower sufficiently, and soon, I exploded into her beautiful throat, filling her with my seed. </p><p>An impressive amount, considering I had been backed up for the last few days… Unable to handle the unexpected intensity of the flow, Kim pulled back, gagging and coughing, but that didn’t make my throbbing shaft stop. </p><p>On the contrary, it continued to explode over her face without a pause, competing with the flowing water to keep her face dirty. </p><p>It was a nice thing to let her stay on the floor to catch her breath. Yet, as the song came to an end, I leaned down and ripped off her panties, which was even easier than ripping off her bra. “Payment for the next song,” I whispered as I slipped my hands under her body and lifted her…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Oh, don’t worry about it, I have a really impressive plan,” Megan whispered as she led me through the party crowd, clearly frustrated as I enjoyed the treatment of the cheerleaders far more than I was supposed to, clearly under the impression that she had substantial control over our relationship. </p><p>One that I would have a great enjoyment disabusing her.  </p><p>I shared a glance with Kim, showing that she had the exact same amusement I felt at Megan’s words. But, since we were going through the party — with more than one gossiping and pointing excitedly as I walked through the crowd in full mast — I decided not to rain on her parade before we arrived in a private room. </p><p>She certainly earned that much consideration from me. </p><p>I climbed up the stairs, a crafty blonde on my right arm, and a sexy redhead wearing leather on the left. </p><p>It took a while for us to climb the stairs, mostly because of Megan’s deliberate slowness, intent on showing me off to the party just to highlight her victory against the allure of the cheerleaders — albeit, the fact that she required the very visible assistance of her friend to turn the situation into a threesome to win lessened the impressiveness of her victory. </p><p>Of course, I knew Megan to know that wasn’t what she intended to do but it was just something that she was dangling in front of the crowd, but the crowd was eating that up if their amused cheers and gossipy whispers were any indicators. </p><p>Then, she decided to give one last show to the crowd as we arrived at the top of the stairs, and I felt her hands on my shirt and she pulled me to a kiss. One that was supposed to be a fake one, but her tongue was suspiciously active in my mouth during her ‘fake’ kiss, showing that she wasn’t as unaffected by the collaborative show between me and the cheerleaders as she wanted me to think. </p><p>The intensity was enough to leave me slightly lightheaded once she pulled back, which was an even bigger achievement than before considering my recent physical improvements. </p><p>I didn’t have any time to catch my breath, not when another pair of lips clamped over mine, a leather-clad body pressing against mine, a tongue invading my mouth as a set of fragile fingers grabbed my hair, tight enough to actually hurt.  </p><p>“Not bad,” Kim murmured after pulling back, though as she pulled back her breath quickened considerably as well. Then, she turned to Megan and repeated louder. “Not bad, he might actually last until morning.” </p><p>“We’ll see,” Megan answered, once again loud enough to be heard by our onlookers, earning another set of cheers. </p><p>Cheers, that the offensive players in the crowd clearly didn’t appreciate. </p><p>Vicious of Megan, which I needed to take as a lesson before I decided to cross her. Not enough to actually stop me if I decided to do something like that, of course, but enough to give me second thoughts. </p><p>And, since I wanted to keep her in a good mood, I decided to give her a little gift in the process. I looked around to see Thad was still around — busy enjoying the attention of two cheerleaders at the same time. </p><p>Clearly, it wasn’t the of his meeting with the coach yet. </p><p>“Hey, Thad,” I shouted. And since I was the celebrity of the day, it actually made the people get silenced. </p><p>“Yes, Terry?” Thad asked, stopping kissing a buxom lady that seemed determined enough to destroy his pants through rubbing. </p><p>“Do you think Kevin would mind if I used his room?” I asked even as I tightened my arm around Megan’s waist, leaving no doubt what I was driving at. </p><p>“Not at all,” he said with a cheerful laugh. “He would be ecstatic helping his ex-girlfriend get laid. The second floor, at the end of the corridor.” Then, among the snickers of the crowd, he returned his attention back to the sexy cheerleaders. </p><p>We disappeared into the corridor even as the rest of the crowd exploded into mocking cheers, enjoying the scandal only a rich college student with absolutely no responsibility in their life could. </p><p>When we finally arrived at the room, Megan tightened in my arms, signaling that she was preparing to reject me the moment I pushed for more. </p><p>And, it would be a lie if I said I wasn’t tempted to push for more, especially after the combined show of the six cheerleaders really drove my arousal to the limit. Yet, if there was one thing that increased Seduction gave me, it was the ability to predict the results of her attitude and giving me the ability to counter it. </p><p>Since she was waiting for the excuse to shut the door on me, I decided not to give her that. Instead, I leaned to my left side, and captured Kim’s lips, enjoying a kiss that went long enough to make Megan shuffle in discomfort. </p><p>Her expression of frustration was beautiful as I pulled away without even bothering to repeat the attempt on her. “No kiss for me?” she asked, unable to help herself despite her intention. </p><p>“Well, since today is my date with Kim, one that you had gone all that trouble to arrange, I thought it would be unfair to pay attention to you,” I said. </p><p>“Right, he’s mine tonight,” Kim interjected smugly, more than happy to join me to make her friend back. Just because she enjoyed Megan’s favor-enforced date didn’t mean she would miss the opportunity to mess with her. </p><p>Such good friends. </p><p>“Do you girls mind if I take a quick shower,” I said. </p><p>“Not at all,” Kim answered. </p><p>Megan was more vocal. “Go ahead, and make sure you use a lot of soap, who knows just how many diseases those whores have,” she said, not bothering to conceal her distaste toward the cheerleaders. </p><p>What an amusing dynamic. </p><p>I was about to take a step toward the en-suite bathroom — another evidence of the luxury the quarterback, even a backup, got by default — when Kim grabbed my arm, her grip tight, preventing me from walking. </p><p>“Don’t be in such a rush,” she said with a chuckle, looking at her friend. “I’m sure Terry wouldn’t mind giving us a little show, to pay back for allowing us to get the earlier reward.” </p><p>There were a lot of things I could say, from asking for a service in return, to mention I was the one that was helping them by allowing their kisses. But since I wasn’t a total moron, I said nothing, and let Megan decide. </p><p>Kim’s expression, was clearly about teasing her friend as much as it was about having me strip. After all, if she wanted to see me, she could have just stepped into the shower ‘to help'. </p><p>“I’m sure his fragile male ego can’t handle being objectified by our gaze. Could it, Terry?” she asked, the last word pronounced tight enough to convey her threat perfectly. </p><p>“Well, if you say so,” I said with a smirk even as I grabbed my shirt, amused by her word choice. She clearly wanted to see me strip, but instead of admitting that, she chose to goad me in a belligerent manner. </p><p>If it wasn’t for Kim’s presence, I would have denied her implicit request, but luckily, Kim’s presence gave me many different ways to mess with her, and an early illusion of victory for her wouldn’t hurt much. </p><p>I pulled off my shirt with smooth, exaggerated movement, one that went surprisingly smooth. I wasn’t exactly a spectacular dancer, but exaggerating my movements, combined with my most recent Agility boost, helped me to replicate a sexy dancer’s attitude decently enough. </p><p>Though, my muscles certainly helped. </p><p>“You definitely know how to pick them, he’s even dishier than I remember,” Kim whispered to Megan while I continued to pull the shirt higher, giving them an even better glimpse of my body. </p><p>Luckily, despite the very intimate glance she had gotten onto my body the week before, the Traits worked slowly on the way I looked, turning what might have been a panicked call for medical assistance into an aroused gaze instead. </p><p>After getting rid of my shirt, I stood in front of them and gave an exaggerated muscle pose, and pushed down my pants, displaying my length with all its glory, thick and tall enough to steal their words. </p><p>Kim’s interest was rather predictable. She hadn’t hidden her interest since the day we met — rather directly, I might add —  but the way Megan’s eyes widened was a surprise. </p><p>Yes, she had been aware of its size thanks to the number of times I had pushed against her, but it was the first time she was getting such an unfettered view. Even during the strip show, she had not got a good glimpse because of the others in the way. </p><p>“And that’s the end of the show,” I said as I turned my back and started walking into the showers. </p><p>“That’s it?” Kim asked, her smirk hungry. </p><p>“Yes, unless you’re willing to follow me to the shower,” I said, not bothering to stop my walk. Footsteps followed me. </p><p>“Kim, what are you doing,” Megan said with a sudden shock, revealing who was the one that was following me. </p><p>“Hey, you’re the one that forced me to a date, I’m just working on it to not to make a liar out of you,” Kim answered as I disappeared into the bathroom, aware that she would follow me. </p><p>The day was developing truly excellently. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The headmistress said nothing as we climbed the spiral stairs. As I did so, I couldn’t help but compare the amusement I was feeling with the tenseness I did as I climbed for the first time, expecting to meet an undead monstrosity under her cloak, unaware of the extent of her deception. </p><p>Yet, as I carried her upstairs in a bridal hold, her beautiful wings twitching as she tried to keep them collected to avoid hitting the walls, only to fail repeatedly, showing that her legs weren’t the only part of her body that she was having trouble controlling. </p><p>“Wow, this place is very different when you’re not expecting any guests,” I said, mentioning the noticeable absence of the crystal pillars that helped her to channel her mana. Instead, the room was in the same configuration I had observed when I first stumbled. </p><p>She blushed at the comment as I glanced around like it was the first time I was seeing this layout. </p><p>A wooden bed with a thin cot that even a servant would turn their nose to, a similarly shoddy wooden wardrobe, the crystal platform in the middle. </p><p>And the bath in the corner, one that she used to cleanse herself and reabsorb the Darkness Spark — which moved much more obediently than the Light Spark, enough to be cleansed by the ward before getting absorbed by the ward. </p><p>The bath might be a critical component of the balance she had been maintaining for a long time, but I was in the process of solving that problem, which meant that it was time to explore alternative usage methods of the bath. </p><p>“Let’s see if we can use your light-infused bath water to enhance the impact of the massage,” I said. A thoughtful expression appeared on her face rather than the panic I was expecting, suggesting that, she actually took it as an actual input rather than just a teasing remark I used before I undressed her. </p><p>But then, I corrected, why shouldn’t she. I had done everything I could do to obscure the link between Tantric and her transformation, shifting attention to my relatively elegant way of leveraging Light mana. </p><p>And if that had been correct, the bath would certainly enhance my capabilities significantly, by allowing me to infuse mana all over her body without the need for a direct touch. </p><p>I wondered whether it was more of her naivety or her newfound greed in play as she missed the most obvious reaction behind her situation, but I was sure that, regardless of the reason, the pleasure that blanketed her mind played a big role in her omission.</p><p>That omission didn’t survive for long as I let her step down in front of the bath, one of my hands on her shoulder, stabilizing her. </p><p>The other grabbed her robe, and after one harsh pull, ripped it completely. “Wow, you really don’t like wearing anything underneath that robe, do you?” I muttered as I enjoyed the beautiful sight of her flawless body from behind, her heart-shaped ass on display without any pesky interruption, the soft shine of her wings just adding another shadow to the state. </p><p>“W-what are you doing?” she gasped as her wings moved to cover her ass, with them lowered, I was able to get an amazing view of her breasts, large enough to easily spill out of my hands, yet just as perfect and firm. </p><p>“No bra as well, very naughty,” I commented cheekily, which earned a beautiful gasp as her hands jumped up to cover her breasts. Unfortunately, they were much less adequate coverage, her small hands leaving most of her flesh free for my enjoyment. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at her ineffective attempts of covering her body even as I gave her a gentle push, allowing her to step into the bath. </p><p>I followed her, but not before matching her in the state of dressing, but she was too occupied by her own nudity to notice that before I stepped into the bath after her, and hugged her behind. </p><p>Her wings were between our bodies, but considering the sensitivity she had displayed, it was hardly something that reduced the impact of the hug for her, and even if it did, my hands were on her naked belly, caressing softly. </p><p>“So, are you ready for the real massage,” I whispered. </p><p>She whimpered in shock at my daring, but, just to make things fun, that whimper didn’t survive for long. </p><p>The reason, as I cast another biomancy spell, this time pulling some of her bath water to fly, covering our bodies with a thin layer of water. It didn’t work to erase the traces of darkness from her since she wasn’t channeling her magic. Instead, I used it as a kind of focus to further intensify the flood of light magic. </p><p>Of course, it was just an excuse to slightly increase the effectiveness of Tantric, further tripling the speed of the process, bringing the required time to complete the process from years to months — assuming constant dedication, of course. </p><p>And, just like that her greed, aligned with the unfamiliar touch of pleasure, worked wonders to destroy her complaints, once again making her fall silent. </p><p>“Let’s start by focusing your back, move your wings,” I whispered into her ear, this time my voice reflecting my arousal without the slightest attempt of concealment. </p><p>She didn’t follow that request, but considering she made no attempt to move forward to separate herself from my naked touch, it was less of disobedience and more of indecision. “Or, I can start from the other side,” I whispered into her ear, my lips close enough for my breath to caress her skin. </p><p>I had been planning to let my lips linger down her cheek before focusing on her neck, kissing and nibbling cutely to push things further, but she managed to thwart that insidious plan with a very clever solution…</p><p>Near-instant obedience. </p><p>Before I could even lean down to place the first kiss on her cheek, her wings moved, freeing her body from the protection of her wings. “Good girl,” I said as I pushed my hands through her wings, caressing her feathers softly. </p><p>It might be the single most conflicting yet comforting feeling I had ever experienced. The light mana invaded my body as I touched her wings, almost instinctively, her mana dancing with mine, giving an ethereal feeling to my touch. </p><p>Of course, I could feel that there were two reasons for that reaction. The first was her aroused state, one that was flailing her control. And the second was the current nature of my mana, a soft variant of light, almost wrapping around herself. </p><p>“N-not my wings,” she whispered, needy, but this time, it wasn’t just panic that I was hearing in her voice but a carnal tremble, one that reflected need, showing it wasn’t just simple sensitivity. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, but only pulled one of my hands from her wings, and used that to put her belly. </p><p>“Y-you were supposed to work on my back,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, I am,” I said as I used my hold to pull her tighter against me, one that buried my shaft between her beautiful ass cheeks. Surprisingly, she reacted less than to my continuing caressing of her wings, whimpering helplessly. </p><p>It was not fair for her to be the only one enjoying it, I decided as I started moving up and down, using my muscular chest as a tool of massage. </p><p>Of course, that amazing work was shadowed by the impact of my shaft moving up and down in the beautiful valley created by her perfect ass…</p><p>But one couldn’t get anything. </p><p>At that moment, there was nothing preventing me from pushing forward. Well, nothing but her delicious whimpers and her lack of complaint, showed that she was not too far away from acceptance in the first place. </p><p>Ironically, that just tempted me to tease her more. I took a step forward, pushing her with my body until she found herself pinned against the wall, while I moved up and down repeatedly. </p><p>The constant flow of light mana under the guise of massage, slowly helping her to properly merge with the Light Spark, worked wonders. </p><p>Though, as the process continued, I could see the difference between my process and hers even more. </p><p>After the slight softening, the nature of the Divine Spark was aligning perfectly with hers, slowly taking shape over her body, the subtlest shadow that even she would have trouble noticing. But still, it was almost independent of her, but aligned at the same time. </p><p>Maybe that was how the avatars of the gods worked. </p><p>In comparison, I could see the way I used Divine Spark definitely butchered any potential of leveraging that. </p><p>Because, I could feel that, the only reason she was able to achieve that was the extreme alignment she had with the nature of the Divine Spark — and while I had little idea about what exactly such nature meant, I could see that it was not just a mana trick, but something more. </p><p>My strategy was much similar to what Janelor had been doing with Mana to empower her abilities directly, only using Divine Spark as fuel rather than mana. </p><p>But, as a needy whimper escaped her mouth, I abandoned that track and focused on the present. </p><p>“Please,” she whimpered, and I was more than enthusiastic about understanding what exactly she wanted to think.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The headmistress was busy processing her shock as she found herself against her desk, while I let my fingers dance along her spine, changing the undercurrent of the massage significantly. </p><p>Yet, her silence was not just about the sudden change the situation showed, starting with her accidental flinch, but also the intensity of the mana flow, doubling in impact as I increased the amount of skin connection as I also let my forearms brush, with a corresponding increase in the mana flow. </p><p>I also thought about increasing the effectiveness of the process, but I had to ignore that part despite its fun potential. It would be a pity to do so after I went all that trouble to disassociate the process from my Tantric — or from her perspective, the Degenerate’s powers. </p><p>And, increasing the effectiveness through arousal was the best way to resurrect that point.</p><p>Instead, I enticed her silence with a simpler equation. The more skin contact, the more effective the massage… </p><p>And faster the process. </p><p>“I hope you’re not unhappy with the pressure from my elbows,” I explained with a chuckle. “But the constant flow through my hands was getting unsustainable, but since you clearly didn’t want to stop…” I added, adding a mocking tone at the last part.</p><p>This time, she didn’t miss the sexual implication in my words and my tone — which was impossible even for her after she was pushed against her desk, still trying to keep her ripped robe in place with her hands, too distracted to even try to use her magic — but that didn’t change her silence. </p><p>Once again, her greed worked wonders to add some more confusion to the challenge she was facing, forcing her to consider things she would never have considered otherwise. </p><p>And, the arousal she felt more and more intensely as my fingers danced along her spine, adding more ingredients to the confusing elation she was feeling after finding a solution to the problem that plagued her for a time long enough that I struggled to comprehend. </p><p>“I can stop if you’re unhappy with the service,” I prompted. </p><p>Her silence was telling. Soon, her tenseness disappeared as she leaned against the desk more, accepting my reckless overreach, making me wonder just how much she would accept. </p><p>And, with her mind plagued by the shock of my achievement, it was the perfect time to test that. My forearms and hands alternated against her naked back, increasing the intensity of mana flow more and more to increase her enjoyment. </p><p>It was reckless, certainly, but her silent acceptance and the sight of her trembling wings were impossible to resist, especially after I kept away from her for so long, afraid of the mysteries that were hidden behind her facade. </p><p>The state of those mysteries was not that different from the state of her body. While they were not completely revealed, I managed to rip through the curtains enough to give a tantalizing view of what was hidden underneath, with curves hinting more. </p><p>I certainly made riskier decisions than I had been doing at the moment. </p><p>That didn’t mean I recklessly charged forward to rip the remaining veil — which applied both the metaphorical existence that hid her secrets, and the literal existence that hid her ‘secrets’. Instead, I let my fingers dance freely over her beautiful back, each moment bringing her to a new height of pleasure. </p><p>A pleasure that she was reacting badly enough to make me doubt the frequency she was applying any self-care method. </p><p>What a great horror. </p><p>I let my thumbs climb back to her neck, pressing softly for a fleeting moment before dragging them back down along her spine, leaving a lingering warmth that triggered her pleasure even more. </p><p>The trembling of her beautiful wings turned into a roadmap for me, giving me a shortcut to reading her reactions as unlike her voice, she made no attempt to contain their trembling and occasional tensing. </p><p>She didn’t stay silent forever. “Careful,” she warned as I dragged dangerously close to her breasts, though that warning would have been more effective if a moan used that as an opportunity to escape from her beautiful lips, echoing against the walls. </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” I said mockingly as I repeated the move deliberately, this time getting even closer, confident that the shame of that slip would be enough to keep her silent as I did so. </p><p>I was correct, as I repeated the move several times, she stayed silent, even when my fingers slipped under her robe to brush against the side of her breast momentarily, though I could feel her preparing to warn me again if I repeated that. </p><p>So, instead, I pulled back after that touch, leaving her with her aborted intent and the flicker of pleasure. </p><p>The resulting tremble of her wings was simply beautiful. </p><p>I returned to the task of caressing her back once more, the intense flow of mana getting even more intense, enough to make me question my magical strength. </p><p>[-683 Mana]</p><p>Luckily, she had other concerns than keeping a tab on the amount of mana I spent, like trying to deal with the unfamiliar touch of pleasure. I focused on her back a few more minutes before making another pass near her breasts, the pleasure delaying her prepared response sufficiently to make it obsolete once more. </p><p>Though, she could have warned me regardless, but I wasn’t unfamiliar enough with the female body to miss the signs of a held-back moan. </p><p>“Tell me if you feel uncomfortable,” I said, using her momentary silence as a chance to enhance the pleasure she was feeling even more by pushing the limits, though this time, vertically rather than horizontally. </p><p>My fingers drifted down to the small of her back, a location that was arguably less obscene than the sides of her breasts, which was enough to keep her lips silent once more as the special mixture of my mana invaded her body and helped her Divine Spark to transform more and more. </p><p>I might have limited our first massage experience to that, if it wasn’t for a sudden tremble that exploded all along her body intensely, along with a swarm of moans that was louder and more intense than I had expected. </p><p>“Wow, you’re certainly loud,” I said, unable to keep the mocking statement off my lips as her cries exploded without restriction. </p><p>“W-what’s going on?” she muttered softly, showing that, despite all her power, she was tethering on the edge of unconsciousness. </p><p>“You’re having an orgasm. It can’t be that long ago you have forgotten how it felt, right?” I said as I leaned down to catch her gaze, only to see that along with the invasion of pleasure, there was a shock, its deepness surprising me. </p><p>“Of course, that assumes you have orgasmed before,” I added, her reaction confirming that while she was familiar with the concept, she had no first-hand experience with it. “Oh,” I said, unable to keep my chuckle in. “No wonder you’re so surly all the time,” I said.</p><p>That earned an angry glare, one that would have been followed by a much more intense reaction if she actually had the strength to move, or could give her lips any order other than the endless moans that exploded off her beautiful lips. </p><p>“Come on, boss, you can’t still think that it’s not a tragedy, living that long without experiencing one of the greatest pleasures of life,” I commented, and she trembled. “But you’re clearly not in the mood of walking. Let me help you to your bedroom,” I added as I grabbed her in a bridal hold, and started walking out of her office. </p><p>“L-let me go,” she stammered. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, only for her legs to tremble badly the moment I let her connect with the floor. Reflexively, she grabbed my shoulders. Her body was still trembling with the effects of her first orgasm, enough to make it impossible for her to actually stand on her feet. “Do you want me to let you go?” I said. </p><p>The glance she threw at me, anger battling with arousal made her look the cutest I had ever seen, though that was not without sexiness, as her inattentiveness allowed her robe to slide down, creating a crude cleavage — crude as in the shape of it, as it was certainly not a comment about the celestial beauty of her breasts. </p><p>“Did you change your mind?” I asked, unable to suppress my desire to tease her. She decided that being carried was less humiliating than collapsing. </p><p>I chuckled as I lifted her to a bridal hold once more, enjoying the way trembled in my arms, with no signs of subsiding anytime soon, suggesting that, without her supernatural endurance, she might have fallen unconscious — which would have been a great pity. </p><p>Though, just because she didn’t fall unconscious didn’t mean she was unaffected by her pleasure — above and beyond the obvious physical impact. For example, she missed the very obvious implication of being carried into her bedroom after an orgasm…</p><p> —————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasted more time than I expected while changing, as while the costume was adjustable thanks to its stretchy fabric, I was still bigger than its limits. The shirt, I was able to put on relatively easily, though as the fabric stretched, it looked like it was painted on my body. </p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured as I stretched against the mirror, enjoying the sight of my muscles. While my endless workouts focused on increasing my performance rather than looks, I could hardly say I was unhappy with the side effects. </p><p>Putting on the pants took more of an effort — especially a certain part of my anatomy, still awake after my fun encounter with Ida, and waiting for what would happen next. </p><p>I didn’t bother fixing, or even hiding that as I walked back. After our corridor encounter, Ida wouldn’t be exactly surprised by it, and while it might surprise Irene a bit… </p><p>It was only fair for me to pay her back after her accidental show. </p><p>With the costume on properly, I walked back to Irene’s room, my steps lazy and dangerous at the same time, like a tiger looking for prey. </p><p>“Hey, Chad you are — ready,” Irene started, only to stammer halfway as her gaze dipped down and took a note of my erection. </p><p>A blush was quick to explode on her face, but when she opened her mouth, she looked down at her chest for a moment before changing her mind, clearly thinking that it wouldn’t be fair to raise that issue after the tone she had started the event. </p><p>Ida just looked down, but I could see her peeking through her beautiful black hair, her gaze firmly locked on my midsection. </p><p>“I hope I was able to put it correctly,” I said as I made a show of raising my arms to display my perks even better, only to hear a warning crackle from the costume, suggesting me not to push my luck. </p><p>“It seems a bit tighter than I expected,” she whispered. “I should have made it bigger.” </p><p>I looked at her with surprise. “You made it? I assumed that you just bought it.” </p><p>“Of course not. I make every costume myself,” she answered proudly, then sighed as she looked at my shoulders. “But I should’ve asked you for your measurements rather than trying to guess. You’re deceptively … large,” she murmured, unable to prevent her gaze from dipping down during her last word. </p><p>“Hey, I work out very seriously,” I answered, giving a comical display of affront that wouldn’t be amiss on a boneheaded cartoon character. </p><p>“Y-yeah, it shows,” Irene answered, trying to sound quippy, but unable to add the required levity to hide her fascination. Then, she sighed as she looked at the corner of the wardrobe that was holding male costumes. “However, it seems that our day is going to be cut short.” </p><p>“Well, maybe they could fit as well,” I said, trying to console her. “After all, this one fit, even if it was more difficult than I expected.” </p><p>“Unfortunately, I didn’t make the rest of them from such a stretchy material, so they won’t fit, not before a very careful adjustment period.” </p><p>Ida chose that moment to intervene. “What about the barbarian costume?” she asked. </p><p>“Ida!” Irene gasped in shock the moment she heard that, her tone shocked and scandalous at the same time. </p><p>I smirked as I smelt blood on the water. “There has to be a story on there,” I asked. </p><p>“T-there’s nothing,” Irene said, but her explanation was as convincing as a serial killer caught chasing her victim with an ice pick. </p><p>I turned to Ida, and a sharp glare was all that was needed to encourage her to tell the rest of the story. “She designed her original costume, based on the graphic novel she’s working on,” Ida said. </p><p>“Ida!” Irene gasped as she ducked down her head. </p><p>“Hey, there’s nothing to be ashamed of, creating something is always impressive,” I said as I caught her gaze, smiling encouragingly. “I like people that work hard,” I added. It wasn’t even an empty statement, as I realized I was entertained by the little group I found myself in not just because of their beauty, but also their serious work ethic. </p><p>“R-really?” she whispered. </p><p>“Yeah, do you want to show them?” I asked. </p><p>“N-no!” she gasped, with a level of shock that caught me in surprise. Yet, at the same time, there was a knowing smirk on Ida’s face — one that looked particularly sharp in her cute face — that suggested the sudden shock was not entirely undeserved. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, deciding not to push her too much before she got more comfortable. Instead, I walked toward the center of the room, and posed. “So, let’s start our photoshoot.” </p><p>I expected Irene to get the camera, but, to my surprise, it was Ida who grabbed it. It was a large digital camera, one looked almost excessive in her hands, but the way she held it suggested great familiarity with it. </p><p>Yet, that was only the beginning of the surprise. “Stand in the center of the room, and raise your arms,” Ida ordered, her tone shockingly sharp, to the point that I struggled to believe it was the same girl that was struggling to speak a second ago. </p><p>It was a total transformation of the personality. </p><p>“You’ll get used to little Ida’s monster side soon,” Irene chuckled as she looked at me, her earlier timidity melting into amusement. “She gets very bossy behind the —“ she started, only to be interrupted by Ida. </p><p>“Silence,” she ordered as she raised her camera once more. “Give me a pose like you’re preparing for the battle, tense yet thoughtful.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk at Ida’s sudden dominance. It was as intimidating as a kitten trying to replicate a lion she watched on the TV screen, but that didn’t make her any less cute. </p><p>Especially since I could see her nipples slowly getting visible, which was an achievement considering I only stole her panties and not her bra. </p><p>I would have followed her requests even without noticing that she was getting a particular enjoyment from her volunteer work, but that realization certainly made things more fun. </p><p>Though, she was certainly demanding. I was not completely unfamiliar with being a model — as I had been a part of several ad campaigns, nothing too exaggerated, mostly local businesses trying to piggyback on the popularity of the football team’s streak of victory — so I had worked with several different photographers. </p><p>None of them started their pose requests in such a demanding manner, giving a complicated challenge without giving the model any chance to warm up. </p><p>For a moment, I thought whether it might be a reaction to my earlier request, galvanizing her into action, but a glance at Irene was enough to erase that doubt. Irene was just watching her like it was nothing out of ordinary. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I did my best to replicate her request. Luckily, while her request was difficult, it wasn’t completely unfamiliar to me. It was more or less the same as the quintessential quarterback pose many other photographers requested from me, allowing me to adapt to that easily. </p><p>Ida said nothing, which surprised me. Then, she started walking around me without the slightest reaction and taking photos, and my surprise got even more intense. Not because of her silence, but the careless attitude as she walked around and bend forward to get a better angle, uncaring of any sudden revealing flash. </p><p>An impressive display of courage considering she was not wearing any panties. </p><p>Irene watched us, shocked enough to make me think that she had already got a glimpse of what was under — and more importantly, what was not under — but I changed that soon after. </p><p>If that had been the case, she would have looked at her skirt rather than her gaze jumping between me and Ida’s camera. </p><p>It didn’t take long for the mystery behind her surprise to get revealed. “It’s not like you to treat a model with kid gloves—“ Irene commented. </p><p>A statement that was interrupted by Ida immediately. “Silence,” she ordered. “I’m not correcting it, because he’s doing a good job of following my directions, unlike a certain redhead who treats half of them as pointless suggestions,” she added, her voice beautifully sharp. </p><p>Irene’s expression, one between exasperation and amusement, told me that I wasn’t the only one that was finding her sudden transformation amusing, but it was clear that it wasn’t at the same level. </p><p>Exasperation was much thicker than amusement in her tone. </p><p>I didn’t say anything as Ida continued to give me directions, but it didn’t take long for me to understand what Irene meant. Because after the initial few poses, her requests started arriving at the unfamiliar territory, which, in turn, made my poses look more amateurish. </p><p>Which triggered a flood of corrections from Ida. </p><p>It was enough to show frustration of Ida. I would have long stopped the shoot… </p><p>If the photographer was anyone but a sexy petite Asian girl who already lost her panties to my greedy paws, enthusiastically waiting for the end of the day… </p><p>The shoot lasted until one unfortunate order of her. “Raise your arm,” she ordered. I followed it, but my clothes didn’t, the top ripping with great fanfare. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” I said as I looked at Irene. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I was going to redo it in the first place,” she answered. </p><p>As she looked at me, Ida said nothing, just walked toward the wardrobe, and leaned forward to dig something. She was lucky that Irene was looking at me, and missed the fleeting show she provided as she bent forward, faster than advised considering her current clothing changes. </p><p>“Go and change,” she ordered as she threw a small bag at me, one that looked suspiciously small. </p><p>Not that it was a particularly big problem for me, I decided as I walked toward the bathroom. And, my enthusiasm got even thicker as, just as I stepped out of the room, I noticed Ida throwing a similar small bag to Irene. </p><p>Especially since it put a shocked expression on Irene’s beautiful face…</p>",

    "content": "<p>\"Shall we,” I said as I gestured for her to walk, enjoying the sudden hesitant expression on her face. Yet, with Charlie and Brenda already in the water, there was nothing that prevented me from putting my hand on her back and leading her down the small stairs that led into one of two rooms in the small boat. </p><p>“Sorry for the limited selection,” I said as I entered the bedroom, which was inevitably small, and opened the wardrobe, which had several small pieces. “But that’s the best we can hope with a rental yacht,” I said. </p><p>“It’s … it’s okay,” Umi murmured as she took a step toward them, and started shuffling, suddenly tense as she realized she was alone with me once more, her fiancee too distracted to interfere. </p><p>I stayed behind her as she shuffled through the swimsuits before she picked one, one that was the largest and the most wholesome among the alternatives. It was still leagues better than her one-piece, of course, but I had no intention of letting her get away with it. </p><p>“That’s good, if you want Charlie to get hypnotized by Brenda,” I whispered, which was enough to make her gasp in anger. Yet, that was the limit of her reaction, and she continued to grab it. “Of course, it’s understandable if you want to admit defeat against Brenda as she seduced Charlie…” I continued, just like a devil that whispered dangerously seductive comments. </p><p>Another gasp left her mouth, one that was softer than the previous one, but I still counted that as a win as she dropped the swimsuit she had picked, and instead, she started searching the small pile once again, her fingers getting faster with each second. </p><p>“You’re right,” she whispered, her voice deceptively bubbly as she kept her gaze down. </p><p>I stayed there only until I watched her pick a white top, one that would rival Brenda’s in sexiness before I turned my back and left. As much as I wanted to stay in and help her pick a top, I knew doing so at this point would push her more than she expected. </p><p>Instead, l slammed the door and left her alone to change and sat on the deck and removed my t-shirt, finally revealing my muscular torso now that Charlie was in the water and wouldn’t get intimidated by the show. </p><p>I grabbed the sunscreen, and, after a gentle spurt, I started working on my legs first. A couple minutes later, just as I finished my torso, hesitant footsteps came into my view, revealing Umi wearing the same white bikini I saw her picking. </p><p>But it fit her even better than I expected. Well, technically, it didn’t fit her properly, it was rather tight for her chest even when she tied it more loosely than it was advised, but that was hardly a problem in terms of coverage. </p><p>“Much better,” I whispered suggestively, enjoying the blush on her face. “But, before going down and giving Brenda a fit of jealousy, why don’t you help me by putting some sunscreen on my back.” </p><p>“I …” she murmured, clearly feeling hesitant in repeating any kind of closeness after the lesson of the night before, but luck was on my side, and Brenda chose that exact moment to let out a beautiful pearl of laughter. “Sure,” Umi said as she pulled the bottle off my hand with surprising aggression, and started rubbing my back. </p><p>Yet, Brenda continued to help me. “Oh, Charlie, you’re so bad,” she followed, her voice beautifully suggestive, doing her task even better than I expected. </p><p>Umi’s fingers stilled, and for a moment, I thought she was feeling embarrassed, but that didn’t last for long. She started caressing me once more, but this time, her fingers were slower, more deliberate as she caressed my back muscles. </p><p>Yet, there was a sharpness in her movements that wasn’t there before. No doubt that being ignored by her fiancee all morning was annoyed her greatly, which had great benefits to my little plan. </p><p>“Thanks,” I said as I turned back and looked at her once she finished. “Now, it’s my turn…” </p><p>“Not necessary,” she started, only for her to come to a sudden stop when I grabbed her waist and pulled her on my lap. “That’s not appropriate,” she whispered. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, it’s nothing we hadn’t already done, what’s the harm,” I whispered. “And, do you think it’s as worse as what is going in the sea.” Just like it was timed, Brenda’s exaggerated laughter exploded again, replacing Umi’s hesitance with anger. </p><p>“Right,” she whispered as I put my hands on her back after a brief pause to get some sunscreen. My caressing was soft, gentle, and definitely unhurried. Something that Umi didn’t like, enough for her to actually show her distaste. “Hurry,” she murmured. </p><p>Admittedly, her impatience could easily be about Brenda’s lush laughter, followed by her words. “Oh, Charlie, you’re amazing, maybe I should keep you for myself.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I whispered into her ear, enjoying the way she trembled. Though, I was even more amused by her submissiveness. Even under the current circumstances, she just accepted my slow and deliberate spreading of sunscreen was not something she could ask me to stop. </p><p>And I was evil enough to abuse that assumption to the limit. </p><p>I handled most of her back rapidly, but my movement slowed down once I reached her neck. The last night’s adventures had revealed she was particularly sensitive on her neck, and I would like to think of myself as a proficient masseuse. </p><p>Not to mention, it was a lesser-known fact, but anger and jealousy could also work as an aphrodisiac as long as it was carefully managed — a process Umi was being subject to since breakfast. </p><p>The combination worked excellently, and a few seconds later, a soft murmur left her mouth despite her best efforts. She closed her eyes and leaned against my chest as I continued massaging her neck. </p><p>In her distraction, it took a while for her to comment when I pulled my hand away from her neck and put it on her stomach, continuing to work on the front of her body. Though, she did notice after a minute. “I … I can handle the front,” she stammered. </p><p>“Maybe, but I’m not in a habit of leaving things halfway,” I answered as my fingers continued massaging her. She stiffened at my words, but that stiffness only lasted for a small while, until my thumb moved the nape of her neck, exerting just enough pressure to make her moan. </p><p>With her complaints gone, I moved my hand down her thighs, first working on the outside of her thighs before moving to the inner part, my thumbs dragging dangerously close to the limited area that was covered by her bikini bottom, enjoying her tenseness whenever I got close. </p><p>As I repeated the move, I could feel the nature of her tenseness changing, the alarm aspect slowly leaving its place to a more amorous kind. Yet, I let my hands climb upward, bypassing the covered area, leaving her without overt contact. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to find a candidate for the next stage of our play. My hands landed on her hips, and soon, I was caressing her shoulders with both hands. Yet, this time, I started dragging them down, and started working on her cleavage. </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit … much,” she whispered. </p><p>“Really?” I whispered as, without a warning, let my hands slip inside her top, earning an alarmed gasp as my fingers grabbed her nipples. “Your body clearly disagrees with that.” </p><p>“But—“ she whispered, but that was all she was able to say as she bit her lips to contain her moan. </p><p>“No buts. Your bikini looks rather unstable, and I need to make sure to cover every part of your body with sunscreen. We can’t afford your breasts getting a sunburn just because your top slipped a bit.” Then, I paused a bit as I pressed my lips against her earlobe. “Your breasts are far too beautiful to suffer such an indignity, as much as your fiancee seemed not to appreciate them.” </p><p>Brenda laughed again, making Umi’s body jerk. “Well, it’s because he didn’t see them yet,” she whispered. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I whispered. </p><p>“We’re saving ourselves for our wedding night,” she whispered. </p><p>“Well, that I know, but I didn’t realize just how far it was going. So, you’re saying that I should feel really lucky for being the first one to rub sunscreen on your beautiful peaks.” </p><p>“R-right,” she managed to answer. She tensed at the reminder that I was taking liberties that her intended didn’t have the opportunity to experience, but that didn’t last long. </p><p>This time, it was the fiancee in question that saved me. “Yes, you’re right,” Charlie attempted to whisper, but it was a whisper in the form of a shout, in a way that only a drunk man could achieve, suggesting that the two cocktails I prepared for him worked even better than I expected. “Your breasts certainly look amazing. But maybe you should remove your bikini so I can get a better view.” </p><p>Charlie’s enthusiastic shouts worked wonders to destroy Umi’s growing reluctance. She even shuffled back, finally capturing my hardness between her hips. </p><p>It was time to move to the next stage. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I have my own training to focus on, but continue working on your task, and don’t forget that I’ll be watching you from a corner, assessing your performance,” I said. I even cast a spell to assess her posture for each role. </p><p>Hardly the most accurate measurement, but good enough for her skill level with my observation, while still allowing me to focus on my experiments. </p><p>“But—“ she started, but a simple raised hand and a shake of my head had been enough to sufficiently silence her. Amusingly, rather than frustrating her, it put a soft smile on her, showing that, rather than pointless indirect platitudes of Lancelot and the rest of her party, she preferred a more direct approach. </p><p>I nodded and walked away, toward the beautiful Phoenix that was lying under a tree, her glow once again spreading around without the tablecloth to cover her whole body. </p><p>I prepared myself for an explosion, the Shield already in my hand as I stood in front of her and send a dash of healing energy through her body, not sure how she would react after the way she had fallen asleep.</p><p>It turned out to be rather unnecessary, but not in a way I could predict. </p><p>Healing spells were a subset of spells that was designed to ignore the natural resistance of the target to work, mostly by aligning with the natural responses of the body. A tricky job, one that worked better based on the competency of the healer. </p><p>It was also the reason master healers like Aria were particularly prized even for the injuries that could be healed by the other healer. </p><p>In comparison, my healing spells were extremely rough, hence my surprise when my magic slipped through Cinder’s resistances without the slightest resistance and worked to wake her up. And, since I didn’t suddenly gain an epiphany to increase my healing capabilities, the answer for the sudden change was clear. </p><p>Whatever the transformation was, it completely removed her natural resistance toward me, making my spells would be extremely effective on her. </p><p>Both helpful and harmful ones. </p><p>Interesting. </p><p>However, it needed to be factored in carefully, as evidenced by the current moment. My simple spell to wake her gently was extremely effective on her, making her wake up with a gasp. </p><p>Luckily, even then, rather than the blast I feared, she just gasped in fear. “What is it, problems?” she asked, genuinely concerned. </p><p>“Don’t worry, sweetie,” I said as I sat next to her and caressed her flaming hair, enjoying the way the flames tickled my palm, while she looked around, noticing we were not in the city anymore. </p><p>“Where are we?” she said as she glanced around, calming down under my touch. Interestingly, without even noticing, she pressed her body against mine, snuggling to my chest reflexively. </p><p>Her taming seemed to work better than I expected. </p><p>“We’re in a small private spot, a good place to do some training.” </p><p>“Training?” she asked dazedly. </p><p>I chuckled, amused that she still seemed to be groggy enough to remember the reason. “Not a huge thing, but I thought that, after that fateful transformation, you might want to test your capabilities. But maybe I’m wrong?” </p><p>Her eyes widened. “Transformation,” she gasped in shock. “How did we —“ she tried to continue, but I recognized the telltale signs of a growing panic attack, and leaned down to capture her lips. </p><p>The invasion of my tongue worked wonders to handle her shock, though not without replacing it with other things, as I noticed her silver dress rapidly shrinking once more, reducing to mere panties. </p><p>And this time, without the slightest intervention from my side.  </p><p>“Someone’s feeling frisky,” I said as I dragged my fingers over her breast, chuckling as I imagined how different her reaction might have been if I wasn’t there when she woke up. </p><p>She was not exactly an expert at managing her emotions, and the transformation clearly didn’t help her in that aspect.</p><p>“As much as I enjoy your beautiful lips,” a minute later, pulling back with no small regret, I pulled her on my lap as I did so. “We need to do some training to make sure we can compensate for the changes,” I said. </p><p>“W-what, why?” she said, seemingly shocked. “Transformation is a beneficial transformation, no need for immediate training.” I barely held back my chuckle as I realized the urgency in her tone. She had clearly wanted to attain her so-called complete transformation for a long time, with considerable pressure from her family if her name was any indicator. </p><p>Yet, finally attaining her biggest desire, she was less interested in testing that, and more interested in continuing our carnal distraction. </p><p>How amazingly cute.  </p><p>“As much as I want to continue that,” I whispered into her ear even as I brought my hands up, squeezing her breasts roughly before letting my hands settle on her stomach, which earned a beautiful moan from her. “We have to make sure our control is up to snuff before focusing  back on entertainment.” </p><p>“Do we have to?” she whispered, soft enough to be barely heard. </p><p>I chuckled at her sudden assault of cuteness. “Yes, but you’ll have a reward if you work well enough.” </p><p>Just like that, she had a smile on her face once more. “What do you want to test first?” she asked immediately, her enthusiasm renewed. </p><p>“Well,  let’s start with something simple,” I said as I raised my finger, and cast a flame spell. Before the transformation, it would have created a simple tongue of fire, barely half the size of my thumb. </p><p>Instead, a small bonfire appeared on my finger, one that raged aggressively, bigger than my palm. Worse, the more I tried to suppress it, the stronger it raged. </p><p>Then, I raised my other hand, and cast a simple air spell which, unlike the fire, worked just as it was supposed to. </p><p>Of course, I made sure that none of the new fiery aspects of my mana touched the air spell, but it was impossible to do the same for the flame spell. The contrast it created was incredible, but the loss of control didn’t bother me. </p><p>Not when compared to the great potential power-up. </p><p>“You can’t control the living fire like that!” she gasped as she looked at the flame dancing on my finger. </p><p>“And, how do I control it,” I said even as I dispersed the air spell on my other hand, realizing the contrast was not necessary for her. And since it was empty, there was no harm putting that on her breast once more, squeezing hard enough to earn a beautiful gasp. </p><p>“First…” she started, stopping for a moan as I gently squeezed her breasts. “You need to understand the nature of the living fire.” </p><p>“Enlighten me, then, beautiful,” I whispered, which hardly helped her to gather her wits, nor the kiss that followed, lingering on her neck. “Is living fire a different name for a phoenix fire?” </p><p>“It’s not!” she gasped, looking scandalized. “How dare you say that!” </p><p>“Calm down, and tell me why did you give such a reaction.” </p><p>“You can’t call living fire phoenix fire when it’s the living fire that created phoenixes in the first place,” she gasped. </p><p>“Interesting topic, but let’s start with how it interacts with the spells without going about its history,” I said, realizing that I had stumbled upon a weird topic, one that strongly reminded me of religion if her excessive reaction was any indicator… </p><p>Fascinating topic, certainly, but not something I wanted to focus on while there were bigger priorities I had to deal with. </p><p>Priorities such as the applied benefits of the new transformation, and more importantly, the dangerous pitfalls. </p><p>Cinder looked a bit miffed at the dismissal of the topic, but she still started explaining. “The first thing about the living fire is the way to control it,” she started. “It’s not like normal mana, where you direct it and demand obedience. The more you control it, the more it will rebel. You need to surrender to it, gently requesting assistance while feeding it with energy.” </p><p>I was lucky that she was on my lap, and not just because she was squirming softly as she explained, turning the boring class into something fascinating. No, I was glad, because she didn’t see my frown as I listened. </p><p>Letting mana flow freely already contrasted with my personality, and it was only worse when the magical substance in question showed semi-sentient traits. I had no doubt that the results were impressive, but sometimes, results weren’t all that mattered.</p><p>As many of my enemies found out. </p><p>“Why don’t you give me a sample then, sweetie,” I said. While the passive effect of flame dancing on her body would have been enough as a sample, there was no harm in some additional examples before starting dangerous experimentation. </p><p>Especially when facing such a dangerous topic. </p><p>What I requested was a rather intimate thing from her, one that was arguably more intimate than sex. I was asking her to allow me to observe the way her mana formed into a spell, directly with my own mana. </p><p>Dangerous, and not just due to potential betrayal from me — which would have been devastating. No, even the slightest mistake from my end would ruin her. </p><p>Yet, she didn’t even blink before she started casting her spell, and she even did it slowly enough for me to observe the process. Yet, as I watched her casting, I tensed more and more. </p><p>Because it seemed that her explanation about surrendering to it was not an exaggeration. It might even be classified as an understatement. </p><p>And, that worked pretty much against my whole being, making repeating that a challenging affair. </p><p>I needed to decide what to do next.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I wanted to go and explore to ship, to see why Theodora thought it appropriate for a trade ship that could double as a flagship for a mid-sized fleet if the need aroused. </p><p>After all, it raised several questions, one being how she managed to improve her reach enough to arrange such a ship since our last communication — and why she thought that it was not information important enough to use one of the emergency channels we have arranged. </p><p>Coming from someone else, I might have assumed betrayal, but the same didn’t apply to Theodora. First, I was rather convinced of her loyalty, and even if she had changed her mind about things </p><p>That didn’t mean I trusted the people on the ship, of course. Just because Theodora didn’t intend to betray me didn’t mean that people that worked for her shared the same intent — not to mention the suspiciously well-armed ship she somehow managed to hire. </p><p>And, since they were clearly sailing away from Rome, and we were safely hidden behind several isolation wards that no doubt took weeks of expert work to implement, which was good enough to hide the dragon heart that Xia still had in her grip despite her exhaustion — one that I left in there as I could sense it filling her reserves slowly and obediently</p><p>A great contrast to the raging storm in my chest, struggling to get out. </p><p>The silence of the hidden deck was an excellent chance for me to take a breather, for the first time since the fight in the arena. Even thinking about everything that happened since the last chance I got to rest…</p><p>The fight in the arena, letting myself get poisoned deliberately, arranging the initial cooperation with Xia under her implied threat, the show battle in Junia Estate, the long — and fun — string of sessions where I had kept the noble ladies entertained while their husbands discussed politics… </p><p>The infiltration of the base, penetrating the actively monitored defensive wards, saving Xia, fighting against the squad of mages while losing control of my core, discovery of my ancestral weapon, finding the strength to defeat them, absorbing the second, much bigger piece of dragon heart despite its supposed impossibility, the escape, spreading the treasures we had managed to acquire to trigger a small civil war, killing Marcus and Antony before escaping with the Nemean lion to create a convincing direction of escape, using the river to switch back to sea…</p><p>Then, the Archmagus…</p><p>A breather was certainly welcome, I decided even as I examined the room more carefully, taking note of the layout and other features. </p><p>The room itself was not tall. I had to slouch as I stood up, and even then, my head was rubbing against the ceiling. The room itself lacked any kind of walls or other platforms, but luckily, the racks that held the spears had a large panel on their back, and I had enough strength to break the connection of them with one pull, pushing it forward a bit, creating a space of two feet, just enough for Xia to lay and for me to sit. </p><p>And, the fact that it was under the only stairs that led to the secret compartment made it a better coverage. All I needed was to find something to throw on top of the newly generated gap to cover the empty space. </p><p>I looked around, and found a large bundle of magical fabric, etched with an even split of defensive runes and wind runes. I considered taking it to create some coverage for the little hiding spot I had created. It was clearly a backup sail.</p><p>After a while, I decided against it, and even carried that sail to the other end of the room. Classifying that as a backup sail was not accurate. It was better to define it as the real sail, and they currently equipped an ordinary one to avoid the suspicion it would generate. </p><p>I looked around more, and finally found a less suspicious item, a large piece of fabric they used to wrap the arrow bundles. I unwrapped it and throw that over the little hiding spot I had created. </p><p>It was not the greatest hiding spot, I had to admit. I doubted it would delay anyone that was searching for us, or even paying any attention to the small gap, by more than a fleeting second. </p><p>If my control wasn’t ruined completely, to the point that I doubted my ability to cast even the simplest spell without blowing half of the ship to smithereens, I would have tinkered with the wards to create a unique concealed space for me, one that could not be sensed without taking down the wards that protected the secret deck. </p><p>Unfortunately, without that utility, I had to rely on external factors, particularly the fact that the sailors wouldn’t casually visit the secret compartment filled with very dangerous weapons. And, considering they were also very expensive, I doubted the captain would allow casual visits in the first place. </p><p>I turned my attention to Xia, who was still lying on the floor with her naked clothing. A touch to her face showed that she was getting rather cold, showing her unique form of Sorceress talent also didn’t support her physically. </p><p>I sighed as I quickly undressed her, before going and picking a similar roll of fabric, fashioning an impromptu blanket that was also fashioned as sleepwear, leaving her to sleep.</p><p>Then, I sat down and crossed my legs, and finally turned my magical senses and attention inward. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was my core, the magic flowing inside wild and unrestrained, already crackling like lightning without any attempt from me to push to an elemental nature. </p><p>Even without any trial, I could feel that my ability to cast lightning spells was strengthened, and I had no doubt that it came with an equal sacrifice from the four fundamental elements. </p><p>And, I didn’t know what to feel about that. </p><p>There was a reason that four elements were the preferred tools for combat for almost all mages. The impact they created compared to their power requirement was almost always better than the alternatives, and while the lightning was more than enough to compensate for certain offensive applications, the same didn’t apply to more utilitarian or defensive purposes. </p><p>Just an hour ago, I would have been saddened by the sudden loss of utility, seeing it as a bad tradeoff for even more explosive penetrative power — something I had already in troves. </p><p>Yet, watching the mysterious Patriarch of House Junia Ascend in front of my eyes, only to be locked down by the same four elements, chained in a conceptual level until he lost his ability to react completely was an eye-opening show.</p><p>Showing that the benefits of the four elements weren’t as free as the mages assumed. </p><p>Unfortunately, that didn’t mean that my transformation was a simple affair. Considering the ease of the Patriarch in Ascending, it was clear that he was already on the edge for a long while, and kept himself from that step to avoid the chains of the Earth, and instead chose to experiment with the Dragon Hearts. </p><p>While the experimental notes I read were limited, and I was yet to have a long chat about it with Xia — as we had more urgent issues to deal with — about the experiments, guessing that he was trying to find a way to Ascend without those chains. </p><p>Yet, I doubted it was as simple as simply absorbing a dragon heart. It was also likely that doing so ruined any chance I had to actually Ascend in the first place, maybe along with my ability to use magic flexibly at the same time. </p><p>The power that was thumping under my skin, begging to be let out, was another problem. While it didn’t empower me enough to give me any hope to fight against an Archmagus — not with the great display of power already fresh in my mind — it was still enough to erase the threat of any sorcerer presented unless they gathered in enough numbers not to be counted by the fingers of one hand. </p><p>Even then, it would be a battle, and not a hopeless last stand. </p><p>Assuming I could actually control that power, of course. I still remembered the troubles I had gone through the last time I tried to learn it, only an accidental Ascension to sorcerer allowed me to control that. </p><p>And, I doubted I would simply jump to Archmagus level — and considering what I had seen about that, I wasn’t sure I wanted such a jump in the first place. </p><p>“No need to lose hope,” I murmured suddenly even as I tightened my hands, the transformation getting harder to push back. The reason was simple. The spell Xia had cast on me during our escape, to make it easier for me to transform, started to get weaker and weaker as time passed, which was making it harder to keep it at bay. </p><p>Luckily, not impossible. </p><p>Not yet, but it was not a guarantee for the future, a dark part of my mind reminded me. </p>",
