    "content": "<p>“What are you looking for. Move, we have a lot of studying to do,” Carrie ordered sharply as she caught my gaze. Or, more accurately, she did her best to deliver those lines in a sharp order, yet the beautiful tremble that underlined her tone showed her unfamiliarity with the role. </p><p>Amusing that she was much more capable of acting dominant when pushing her best friends into my arms than we were alone. </p><p>Though, I had to admit, that contradiction in action was one of the things that boosted her personality even further. </p><p>“As you wish, ma’am,” I answered her, accepting her demand of dominance despite having the ability to shatter it easily in less than a second. </p><p>Why ruin the fun.</p><p>Before I could say anything, she took the lead and started walking. She was already aware of the location of the room as we already studied there — along with some other interesting activities. Though, as she walked, her hips swayed with a beautiful exaggeration, enough to make my shorts uncomfortable. </p><p>An incredible achievement, considering I was wearing loose basketball shorts. </p><p>Then, the impact elevated even further when she arrived at the stairs, and started climbing slowly, her hand grabbing the rails hesitantly, clearly not feeling comfortable with her stilettos. I had more important things to focus on, such as the glimpse I managed to catch into her beautiful inner thighs as she took a large step, compromising her skirt’s ability to keep things hidden, revealing an important little secret. </p><p>The bra wasn’t the only piece of underwear she neglected to put on. </p><p>“What are you waiting for?” she asked once she arrived at the middle of the stair. </p><p>“Sorry, ma’am,” I said, doing my best to sound serious as I started climbing up, but lingering behind her. The way her hips danced despite her unsteady steps suggested that she was not only aware of where my gaze was, but rather satisfied with it. </p><p>Understandable with all the effort she put into her amazing clothing. </p><p>Soon, we arrived at my room, once again filled with an incredible mess of football-related items despite my best efforts to make it more conducive to studying anything but football tactics. </p><p>Carrie’s disappointed gaze — one that was far too real to be a part of the role — showed she wasn’t entirely happy with the state of my working space. “No wonder you keep delaying your homework,” she commented. </p><p>“Sorry, ma’am,” I answered as I took a seat, neglecting to mention her role in the delay. </p><p>“Let’s start with algebra,” she said, and I couldn’t help but sigh. I couldn’t say that math was my favorite topic, but I didn’t have in my heart to disappoint Carrie. Not to mention, having a genius of her level helping me whenever I stumbled was a good reason for starting my least favorite topic. </p><p>I pulled out my notebook and started working on the questions, turning my attention fully on the questions. Another girl might have found my focus insulting after all the effort she had put into it, but Carrie was different. Even now, my focus on the questions gained an approving murmur from her. </p><p>Admittedly, concentrating on the questions wasn’t easy, especially when she pulled a chair behind me, her beautiful breath inches away from me, close enough that, whenever I looked down I caught the bright presence of her red stilettos, and the beautiful legs that they were connected to. </p><p>I had to admit, as she said nothing, just letting out deep breaths, it was getting harder to maintain my focus. She was beautiful, which wasn’t a surprise, but the aloofness she was displaying as I studied despite her sexy attire really elevated the mood to the next level. </p><p>Her aloofness lasted until I was stuck in a question for five minutes, the answer insistent on staying away despite the pressure of the moment. “Let’s see if I can help you find the answer,” she murmured as she scuttled closer, and put her finger under the question. </p><p>She asked me a question. I knew that, because I noticed her mouth move, but I doubt that, even under the threat of torture, I could repeat that, not with the little surprise she had prepared for me. </p><p>Apparently, while I was doing my best to solve the questions, she had made a couple of adjustments to her clothing. One of those changes was her skirt, which was ridden up as she sat down, a touch more than it would have normally done by seating, revealing the red straps of the garter belt she was wearing directly, which hardly helped my hard-on. </p><p>But the real blow came with the trick she had pulled with her blouse. The view of it was already dead with its relative tightness combined with her — very apparent — lack of a bra, but Carrie seemed to work on the buttons of her blouse while I was studying. Three of them were unbuttoned, creating a deep valley that was worth dying for. </p><p>And the way she leaned forward certainly didn’t help her moderate the view any. </p><p>I had seen Carrie naked, many times, but that was irrelevant to the alluring magic of her beauty, captivating my attention. </p><p>Enough to force her to repeat the question three times before I managed to extract myself, and even then, I doubted I would have been successful without her poking my side, hard enough to leave a lingering pain. </p><p>“Attention, mister,” she ordered, though it might have been more effective without the smug smirk she displayed, her ruby red lips stretching beautifully under my gaze, twisting the corners to create a beautiful picture. </p><p>“Sorry, ma’am,” I whispered back exaggeratedly. “I’ll focus.” </p><p>“Better,” she said as she put her elbows on the table and leaned forward, looking at me intently. But, with her large breasts delightfully pressing against her forearms as she leaned forward exaggeratedly, it hardly helped me to focus, her attempt to repeat the question turning to waste. </p><p>Her head twisted to the side softly, conveying her amusement for a long moment before she stood up. “It seems that you can’t focus with me in front of you,” she whispered seductively as she stood up. </p><p>When my head tried to follow her movement, she prevented it by grabbing my hair, keeping me in place. “Focus, mister,” she whispered, which, unfortunately, worked at the exact opposite of the meaning of the words. Admittedly, it might be about the seductive gasp in her words, or the fact that she whispered it with her lips close enough to caress my earlobe… </p><p>“Let’s try again,” she whispered, her voice no less gaspy, her hand still grabbing my hair, but she had pulled back slightly, which was a win. “Try to follow that explanation, and maybe, there will be a reward.” </p><p>I said nothing, though I had to bite my lips to contain some of the select words that arrived at the exit, begging for freedom. Instead, I did my best to focus as she explained the best way to solve that type of question. </p><p>One advantage of the challenging position that we were sharing, was that it was enough to sear her explanation on my mind. I doubted that I would ever fail to solve a similar question. </p><p>“Better,” she whispered as her hands slid on my shoulder, rubbing them softly, just an excuse to touch rather than an actual massage. It certainly made it harder for me to focus on the next question. </p><p>Yet, the distraction coming from her hands couldn’t be compared to her next move, when I finally completed the algebra assignment and moved to English. As I did my best to create a coherent essay, she started whispering suggestions. </p><p>Her suggestions were certainly welcome, and even her whispers were manageable, but the sudden warmth around my neck, the touch far too soft to be her hands was a different matter. It felt like a pair of pillows pressing on my neck, if those pillows had a heavenly softness and warmth, and came with a rhythmic thumping. </p><p>Feeling the pressure of her breasts, I didn’t need to see her blouse flying forward to land on my desk to have an accurate guess about her current condition. </p><p>“Try to focus more,” she whispered mercilessly as she pulled my hair without a warning. “You made a typo.</p><p>“I’ll do better,” I whispered as I quickly corrected the mistake and focused on following her clues. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she moved slightly, her breasts bouncing against my back and neck. She moved lower, my t-shirt hardly enough to completely block the sensation of her glorious breasts, but even the slightest reduction enough to disappoint. </p><p>“Why are you sighing?” she whispered. “Are you feeling hot?” </p><p>“Yes, it’s a bit warm in here, and my t-shirt is rather stuffy.”  </p><p>“Good point,” she whispered as she slipped her hands under my shirt, and started dragging up. “It’s important to maintain an ideal working environment regardless of the circumstances” she added as she pulled off my shirt before pressing her breasts against my back once more, the hardness of her nipples unmistakable. </p><p>Who knew studying could be this fun?</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was hard to believe, but there were drawbacks to spending the night with two spectacularly beautiful women who were willing to do a lot to win their self-appointed competition, followed by a little video adventure featuring a sexy blonde, enthusiastic to get a blow-by-blow summary of the events. </p><p>Though, saying that sentence out loud would have been enough to kick me out of the manhood club permanently. </p><p>The biggest drawback was the challenge of waking up the next day as my alarm blared, forcing me out of bed for my morning training. It might be Sunday, but as an aspirant athlete, I didn’t have the luxury of skipping morning training. </p><p>No matter how exhausting it had been dealing with Sarah and Naomi the night before. Ultimately, Naomi hadn’t been too challenging, as, overwhelmed by the threesome that represented her first time, it didn’t take long for her to surrender to pleasure. And it took a while for her to wake up once she collapsed. </p><p>Unfortunately — though, that word was only accurate from the perspective of the exhaustion and not the great pleasure that I felt in the process of accumulating said pleasure — Naomi’s challenge elevated Sarah’s competitiveness to the next level, challenging me for another exhausting session while Naomi took her well-deserved nap, challenging me to take her down.</p><p>And she was ready to push hard when Naomi finally woke up from her nap and dragged her away. I would have expected Naomi to join us for another session, but after her nap, the shy aspects of her personality reestablished herself and decided to leave, dragging Sarah away as well.  </p><p>It was the reason I was waking up to an empty bed after that spectacular threesome. </p><p>With a sigh, I reached for my phone to silence my alarm, only to see the notification of one last message from Carrie. ‘Your reward for being a good boy,’ the message read, and accompanying it was a photo of her, wearing a cheerleader skirt — and nothing else. And just to make things better, the skirt was positioned in a way that covered absolutely nothing. </p><p>“Good girl,” I murmured even as I looked at the photo, its erotic beauty enough to dispel my desire to go back to sleep. Not that my reward was undeserved, because she kept me up for almost another half an hour despite my exhaustion while she received a blow-by-blow report of her friends’ adventures, her voice getting suspiciously gaspy toward the end of my story.</p><p>After a brief pause in the kitchen where I made myself a large protein shake to jumpstart my metabolism, I went to the garden and started a long, grueling set of exercises, both more exhausting and not as fun as the ones I had completed the night before. </p><p>Three hours later, I had finished my full schedule, leaving my muscles burning, completely spent. </p><p>After that, I still needed to study, but I was unable to resist the call of exhaustion. After a quick shower, I threw myself into the bed… </p><p>Only to be woken up by the sound of my phone again. The first thing I checked was the time, which told me that I had been sleeping for two hours, though my exhausted body certainly didn’t agree with that fact. </p><p>I prepared to shout at the idiot who decided that annoying someone on a Sunday morning was a good idea. Then, I noticed the caller. </p><p>Carrie. </p><p>“Is there anything I could help you with, sweetie,” I asked, my plans to admonish the caller immediately abandoned. After all, there were perks to being a sexy and enthusiastic curvy blonde in the process of discovering a hobby of seducing her friends indirectly.  </p><p>Not to mention I genuinely enjoyed her company. </p><p>“I wanted to check if you have finished all the studying you promised that you’ll finish,” she said. I couldn’t help but smirk as I listened to her voice, her usual soft tone replaced by a sharp authority, the subject of studying enough to show her strong side. </p><p>“Well…” I murmured. </p><p>“You didn’t, then,” she commented, quick to cut me off. “Are you being lazy?” </p><p>“Hey, whose fault is that,” I said, unable to keep myself back. “We were supposed to finish them Friday, but then you decided to change that plan.” </p><p>“Hey, that part is Sarah’s fault,” Carrie said, quick to defend herself. </p><p>I disagreed of course, as after the initial push, she was far too enthusiastic to actually push that to the completion, but I let that slide. “How about Saturday, then? It wasn’t Sarah who brought Naomi along.” </p><p>That earned a beautiful silence. “Anyway,” she said after a cute cough. “You need to finish your homework.” </p><p>“I promise I’ll finish them,” I added, unable to hold my chuckle. “Just let me sleep for ten more minutes.” </p><p>“No, you can’t be trusted,” she answered, which was a rather unearned dig, but I let that slide because I recognized the shift in her tone. “I’ll come for a visit and make sure you finish it.” </p><p>“As you wish, madam teacher,” I said, earning a beautiful giggle. “Did you have any breakfast, or should we eat together.” </p><p>“I already had my lunch,” she corrected, her tone once again echoing a disappointed tutor. “Be ready in twenty minutes.” </p><p>“As you wish, madam teacher,” I repeated. </p><p>“Don’t be sassy,” she answered, though I could hear the momentary flare of confidence already shattering. “And, if you can finish it on time, I have another surprise reward for you.” </p><p>“I’m not sure I can survive another of your surprise rewards,” I said, though even as I said that, I felt a stirring in my loins, the idea enough to awaken my exhaustion. </p><p>“Does this mean that you don’t want my surprise,” she murmured, though with a soft, seductive tremble rather than panicked stammer, showing just how far her confidence had come in the last few days. </p><p>“Hey, I didn’t say that,” I said, unable to keep my chuckle down. “There are things that are worth dying for.”</p><p>“Good,” she whispered throatily. “Because I have an excellent surprise for you if we can finish everything on time.” With that, she ended the call. </p><p>I wanted to continue sleeping, but Carrie’s surprise was more than enough to pull me back to my feet — especially since she was showing an impressive performance when it came to surprises. </p><p>Instead, I changed and dashed to the kitchen for a quick — though not small — breakfast, then went back upstairs, collecting all the assignments I needed to complete. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk at the additional benefit of hanging around with Carrie. Not only did I have far more action than I would have seen if I was dealing with the cheerleaders but also I wasn’t dealing with any kind of drama. </p><p>Technically, I was dealing with a lot of drama, but I liked the method they had chosen to handle it. </p><p>More importantly, rather than making me abandon my responsibilities, it actually helped me focus on them more. Carrie’s presence meant that I not only finished my assignments better, but also I learned more, which prepared me better for my upcoming college life. </p><p>What a great decision it was to deal with her. </p><p>Then, just as I prepared everything on the desk, the doorbell rang. I went down to open the door, not even bothering to check who was the visitor. </p><p>It was Carrie, of course, but that didn’t mean she failed to surprise me. My eyes widened as I took a note of her clothing… </p><p>She was dressed as a strict teacher. </p><p>Or more accurately, an erotic movie’s version of a strict teacher. The first thing I noticed was the pencil skirt, long, but not long enough to completely cover the thigh-high stocking she was wearing, as well as giving hints of a garter belt. </p><p>Below, she wore red stilettos, bright enough to give her a fiery aura that made my mouth water.  </p><p>Yet, as impressive as her skirt and accessory choices looked impressive, it was nothing compared to what was going on upstairs. </p><p>She had chosen a serious-looking white blouse. Or more accurately, it would have looked serious if it wasn’t for the fact that more than half of the buttons were open, creating a cleavage that was far too deep to be safe. </p><p>Deep enough to reveal she wore no bra, enough to give a hint of her erect nipples. </p><p> She said nothing, but as she shifted her weight, her lovely breasts swung freely within her loose blouse, which had a beautiful impact on my hormones, stirring them into action. </p><p>The study session certainly promised to be fun… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Trying to pull juvenile sexual tricks against someone that was stronger than me — at least, as far as the pure magical strength went —  was a bad choice, even if I wasn’t locked in with her in the depths of her base, with dozens of magical constructs to help her if she decided to rely on the more violent aspects of her little plan. </p><p>Especially since I needed her to make some accurate decisions. </p><p>Yet, as she listened to my explanation with confident laziness, a smug superiority shaping her beautiful face, the temptation of pulling such juvenile tricks was simply impossible to deny. </p><p>After all, what was life without the occasional tricks to send my heart racing? </p><p>“There are some valid clues about the possible locations for the Eternal Core,” I murmured as I channeled my magic through the Tether, distracting her with a potentially relevant source of information that could give her the reward she was searching for while I increased my connection with her dress.</p><p>Then, I pulled a subtle trick, and let some of the silvery fabric move down, making her dress more transparent in the process. Not completely sheer like a nightie, but still enough to get a glimpse of her breasts. </p><p>And the glimpse I got was simply spectacular. Just like her face, her body had a surreal beauty, almost enough to be classified as alien, but enough to prevent my shaft from stirring in anticipation. </p><p>Yet, that was just the start of my plans. I wouldn’t have classified my actions as risky if that was the extent of my ploys. Her magic was still connected to the dress, which gave me a chance to make a subtle connection to her magic, using the dress as a medium to prevent her from being alerted. </p><p>Then, I started casting Tantric magic. </p><p>I was careful in my targeting as I cast my spell, not trying to affect her directly — which would have been a deadly move with her magical aptitude, no matter how distracted she was with the potential clues of the location of the Eternal Core.</p><p>The bludgeoning way Sapphire used Tantric on me was not the only method available. Carefully flooding her dress, letting her own connection absorb it while she rotated her magic was also a viable strategy. </p><p>Not without its own costs, of course, as using it indirectly meant that I had ceded the control of my mana to her, and she could easily use it for her own purposes. Not that it was a great perk to her considering just how incredibly strong her mana was already, but the real drawback was the limited effect. </p><p>Unlike a properly cast spell that could easily send them into throes of passion under my control, my indirect method only allowed me to enhance her arousal slightly, barely more than a beautiful perfume or a charming smile. </p><p>Luckily, I thought as I decided to act the moment I noticed the flames of her wings started to burn differently — almost amorously. Compared to that, her gaze wandering down might as well be a subtle clue — I had the assets and the skills to push forward once she had felt that flicker of passion. </p><p>I started moving as I continued my explanation, stretching my arm and letting my shirt ride up, taking a note of her reactions to seeing if she was particularly affected by a part of my body. </p><p>I didn’t notice a particular source of attraction, but more a low-level instinctual interest, one that, even with the assistance of my spell, was only possible because of her boredom. Not just the boredom of my explanation, as if that had been the case it would have been much less effective, but the mind-numbing exhaustive boredom she was clearly feeling, mostly hiding in her own base. </p><p>Albeit I doubted she would particularly enjoy what passed as entertainment in the Capital. She clearly had tastes expensive enough to treat the most expensive city in the land as a backwater waste. </p><p>With her spoiled nature radiating off her with all the intensity of a forest fire, another option was not possible. </p><p>And, that was only a part of my tricks. My real trick was her dress, the unwitting tool she had given me to access her body. Even as I was busy with everything else, I continued playing with her dress, using it as an indirect incarnation of my fingers to give her a soft, hard-to-notice massage, easily written off as the movements of her extraordinary dress. </p><p>Another simple trick that showed surprising effectiveness when supported by the other two sources. </p><p>Soon, her lips parted beautifully, letting out a soft, lingering sigh. </p><p>I chose that moment to make her dress move, leaving a soft, stinging pain on her nipple, making her gasp in shock. I pulled my magic away completely as I did so, of course, not daring enough to leave any evidence of my subtle manipulations.</p><p>“Is something wrong?” I asked, doing my best to look concerned. </p><p>“N-no, just a cramp,” she explained quickly. </p><p>“I’m not bad when it comes to massage, your Highness, I can give you a treatment if you want,” I offered. Of course, I didn’t expect her to accept that offer, as even with the previous tricks, it was too early for someone as haughty as her to allow me to touch her body.</p><p>Which was why I was surprised when I received a nod from her. “It’s a good idea,” she said as she stood up and gestured, and a door parted open at the wall. “Follow me.” </p><p>After a momentary freeze, I stood up and followed her, surprised by the quick speed she had accepted my offer. Though, while I did my best to hide it, I was feeling rather tense. Not because I would be massaging her, but because she had accepted that much closer than I had been expecting. </p><p>Suggesting I had misread something about her. Maybe she was more calculative and wanted to test me, maybe she was more affected by my simple tricks. Maybe, she simply saw me as inferior enough to count as a servant, and had no problems allowing me to touch her. </p><p>Or maybe, she was simply bored enough to jump at the opportunity of some fun while she was away from her family. </p><p>After all, the way she dressed clearly revealed she appreciated my hungry gaze as long as I wasn’t daring enough to act on it. Massage just could be the next step to that. </p><p>When I arrived in the next room, she was already lying on her bed — a huge, four-poster bed that was filled with a shocking number of magical wards, to the point of making it almost impossible to analyze them. </p><p>Luckily, while I lacked the ability to analyze and deconstruct the wards due to their unfamiliar nature, checking their outcome of them was much easier, especially since none of them particularly well-concealed. </p><p>It didn’t take long to ascertain that as I walked forward, that other than a defensive ward that was big enough to be activated under the emergencies, the rest of the spells were just enough to ensure the spectacular comfort of the bed, turning it into a true luxury. </p><p>“Show me how well a king can serve,” she said as she stretched on the bed, lying prone. I walked closer as I watched her dress shuffle, creating a nice wide space for me to allow my touch. </p><p>Her words revealed more about her mood, revealing the subtle mystery of her sudden desire to get a massage from me, one that couldn’t be explained by the subtle trick I had just pulled. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk in amusement as I understood it. </p><p>She wanted to treat the king as a servant. </p><p>It wasn’t to say her body was not tempting, but still, I was more interested in the wings of flame that were coming out of her back. There was no direct limb on her back, revealing to me that it was fully magical rather than a mixture of her natural looks — at least, as far as her human form was concerned. </p><p>Of course, my information about phoenixes was not exactly comprehensive, it was more accurately framed as a mixture of scraps and legends — which shouldn’t be too shocking considering before seeing the beautiful woman lying in front of me, I didn’t believe the existence of the phoenixes. </p><p>Even now, I wasn’t sure if it was her true form, or if it was just a very effective transformation she was able to put on as a secondary form. </p><p>Luckily, delivering an extended massage was a good way to address some of those curiosities. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but smile as I drove away from the stadium despite my exhausted state. The training had been a bigger success than I expected, my performance good enough to catch the attention of the coaches in a positive way. </p><p>All I needed to replicate it during the afternoon training — and the next three days, until Friday evening —  by push myself to the limit without a break. Painful, but certainly worth it. </p><p>And, impressing the coaches wasn’t the only benefit of my training. I had managed to gather a decent amount of Intent, and while most of it had been devoured by my guide, I managed to channel some toward the System. </p><p>Not enough to give me a new Trait, but just like making a budget, every little bit helped. </p><p>I wanted to go and sleep, but unfortunately, I had other, more important things to do, such as hacking the database of that museum to change the information to further obfuscate the information they could use to lead to me. Luckily, I had long received the notification from the little phishing e-mail I had sent using the credentials of the museum director, which in turn would allow me to access their systems remotely. </p><p>The moment I arrived at my dorm, I turned on a few remote networks simultaneously, before activating the little program that I had left in the museum, one that would make it look like the connection came from the museum even if someone discovered my fiddling.  </p><p>It sounded complicated, but it was a simple trick, done using mostly commercial programs, assisted by a few nuggets I had downloaded from hacking forums when I was younger, hoping to make a lot of money — before I realized just how hard it was to actually make a criminal career through hacking. </p><p>Not the stealing part, which was ridiculously easy, but using the money that was stolen was much more difficult, for anyone that didn’t have international criminal connections.</p><p>Yet, simply didn’t mean ineffective, I thought as I quickly typed the information, and a remote program popped in front of me. “Now, the boring part,” I murmured as I started working on the inventory program I had accessed, carefully reading the help section and the other documentation I could access. </p><p>It was a mind-numbingly boring activity, but a necessary thing to understand how the program worked, and what kind of process it required to actually change information. </p><p>Unlike what the movies show, hacking was mostly a mind-numbingly boring amount of documentation reading, with the occasional break where the hacker prayed someone with the correct administrative access clicked the phishing link. </p><p>Of course, true hackers still existed, the kind that used recently-discovered vulnerabilities to attack networks, scraping passwords from temporary files, hijacking access privileges, and many other tricks that were truly impressive. But those tricks required expertise that I was woefully lacking. </p><p>Luckily, a third-rate museum that relied on security measures that were written in the eighties, and managed by an IT manager that habitually clicked later whenever his computer prompted a security update didn’t require that level of skill. </p><p>Still, even in an ancient system filled with security vulnerabilities and managed by a team that literally clicked every link that I sent, understanding how the system worked sufficiently took half a day, and stealing all the required credentials to approve a correction request took another two hours. </p><p>Not all was bad, however, as my food was long delivered by the team, only requiring a quick reheating. The chicken breast, rice, and artichoke might not be the most amazing combination, but it was still more delicious than anything I could cook for myself, with the added benefit of being free. </p><p>After eating, I focused back on my task. In the end, I was finally able to push and approve the amendment request that changed the delivery location of that orb from our museum, marking it as lost in delivery instead, then erased all the notifications to relevant people before it was noticed. </p><p>When I completed everything and logged out of the system, it was already three. I sent one last command to the museum computer I used to access the other museum, triggering a deep format that erased my presence of being there — alongside all the information they had saved in. </p><p>Not the most elegant method to erase my presence, but it was certainly better than nothing. “Time to sleep,” I murmured as I threw myself to the bed, but not before I set four alarms just in case. </p><p>I was exhausted enough to fear missing the evening training. </p><p>Yet, the moment I put my head on the pillow, the alarm started to blare, quick enough to make me think that I had screwed up setting the alarm, but checking the clock corrected that mistake. It was almost five. </p><p>I was glad I had set four alarms, because, somehow, I had already turned off two of the alarms I had set up. Technically, I still had ten minutes to sleep, making that blinking snooze button on the screen extremely tempting, but I forced myself to stand up. </p><p>Skipping the training was not an option. </p><p>I chose to use that ten minutes to eat another quick meal, accompanied by bitter coffee and a painfully-cold shower. It forced me to go a touch faster than I would have preferred on campus, and put on my uniform and pads a tad quicker than I would have preferred, but I was on time.</p><p>Unlike the morning training, the offensive team was on the field with us, significantly more energetic than the defensive players. Since I had no reason to believe that they would be fitter than their defensive counterparts, it wasn’t hard to guess that their morning training didn’t include desperate dashes or endless burpees as punishment, leaving them fresh.</p><p>As I looked at the offensive team, more than one player caught my gaze, anger flashing in their eyes. It wasn’t too hard to guess the reason for their frustration.</p><p>I pushed my chests out as I let my smirk widen challengingly, because I noticed a slight flare of Intent as they started looking at me furiously. Not that the sudden influx of Intent surprised me too much. It reminded me of the chess tournament, the first time I received such benefits, turning others’ frustrations into power.</p><p>Since the coaches were yet to arrive, I decided to milk it a bit more before Megan finally dumped me and I lost the most interesting tool I had to stomp on their nerves. </p><p>“Thad,” I said, far too louder than necessary to be heard by someone that was standing close to me. “Do you think we can make another bet with Kevin? Megan mentioned she would appreciate a new car.” </p><p>My words earned a disapproving glare from Carter, whose approach was far too serious compared to the rest of the team, but as the rest of the defensive players exploded in laughter, he kept his mouth shut. Considering the bad blood between the two parts of the team, he clearly decided that trying to keep the tension down was a thankless task. </p><p>I smiled in satisfaction even as I closed my eyes, doing my best to channel the sudden flare of Intent into my system once more. The offense glared, the defense laughed, while the practice squad players shuffled in discomfort, clearly not wanting to involve themselves in the issue. </p><p>Their combined attention brought much more Intent than I had been expecting, completely overshadowing the scraps that I managed to collect during the morning training. </p><p>It wasn’t surprising. What I had done during the morning training was not too impressive. They expected me to perform below average, and I merely performed above average for a backup, hardly something to awaken emotional reaction. Of course, considering my tenure, it was still impressive, but the kind that only earned an intellectual nod rather than a deep emotional response. </p><p>Much different than the anger coming from bruised pride. </p><p>“Middle-class garbage,” Kevin grumbled loudly, trying to attack my financial state. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, it was not the amazing comeback he thought himself delivering. From his perspective, middle-class might be a scathing, devastating insult, but for me, it was an aspirational target. </p><p>So, the laughter that escaped my lips was genuine. Unlike the following words, carefully barbed to hurt the most. “Hey, at least I can keep a sexy blonde satisfied,” I answered. “I even have some photographs you can use if you want to learn how to do it.” </p><p>“How dare you!” Kevin exploded, once again motioning to dash forward, only to be held back by two offensive linemen. </p><p>“Hey, don’t tire yourself,” I mocked him, amused by his reaction. It was clear that he expected the others to hold him back, and he was using that as an excuse to put on a show. “You would disappoint your current girlfriend as well. I simply don’t have time to go around satisfying all of your exes.” </p><p>The laughter that exploded from the defensive team was impressively loud. Too loud, even. I was certain my little dig didn’t have the merit to earn that. I had a feeling that it was more about freezing in the early morning in full pads while they were doing their lazy practice in the indoor gym. </p><p>Yet, seeing the anger and frustration dancing on the face of our ‘teammates’ was just an ancillary bonus. Because, when I touched my mental space, I was greeted by another beautiful line of writing. </p><p>[Taunt II, acquired]</p><p>Before I could see whether I could push them enough to get to the third stage, however, Coach Bill stepped on the field, cutting off that probability. </p><p>It was training time. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“What a start,” I murmured as I collapsed on the floor after completing the punishment round. </p><p>I had pushed myself hard during the terrible twenties, and the four sets of fifty burpees that followed as punishment were hardly the easiest thing to complete — the punishment the backups earned after predictably losing the competition with the starters.  </p><p>Yet, despite my painful exhaustion, I did my best to finish the burpees as fast as I could manage, managing to stay in front of the other linebackers for each set even with the pain it caused me. </p><p>“Impressing the coaches doesn’t come for free,” Thad replied as he stood next to me while I panted hard, trying to recover. He wasn’t the only starter that was standing next to the collapsed backups, teasing and mocking. “Too bad you collapsed as soon as this simple exercise is over.” </p><p>I didn’t bother replying, just focused on breathing. I wasn’t the only one that was struggling. Every single backup player was on the ground, panting badly. </p><p>Yet, after a few more breaths, he helped me to stand up, and I followed his clue despite the temptation of staying on the ground. As much as resting a bit more was tempting, I wanted to be one of the first players to stand back up. </p><p>The details were important if I wanted to get any playing time before the season was over. </p><p>“Someone is determined to get that first-string status,” he commented. </p><p>“If something is worth doing, it’s worth doing right,” I said with a shrug, aware that before even having the hope to get that coveted first-string status, I needed to actually get some playing time, even if it was just for the special teams. </p><p>And to do that, I needed to prove I was strong enough, smart enough, and most importantly mean enough. I had already shown I was tactically amazing. Yet, no matter how much I showed up during the tactical meetings, it wouldn’t matter if I couldn’t prove myself strong enough to handle the field. </p><p>Before Thad could say anything else, Coach Bill started speaking once more. “That wasn’t completely horrible. Now, it’s tackling time,” he said as he pointed at the dummies. “Get in line, and start working until I call a pause.” </p><p>“Yes, coach,” the team replied loudly despite the exhaustion, and we started delivering repeated hits on the dummies. It was a grueling exercise even under normal conditions, but it hurt even more under the biting cold, well below freezing. </p><p>Yet, whenever it was my turn, I dashed forward and slammed my body without flinching, ignoring the radiating pain on my cold skin. “Keep your shoulders down, your center of gravity is too high,” called the linebacker coach as I returned, correcting my tackle.</p><p>Yet, surprisingly, I wasn’t the one that was receiving the most corrections. A part of it was about my detail-oriented approach, but the real credit belonged to Coach Juana, and the detailed technical training she had conducted the day before which helped me to fix a lot of my mistakes. </p><p>A private coaching session like that was much more helpful than a group session, where one coach was responsible for almost ten players, his attention split. </p><p>I didn’t complain about that part out loud since I wasn’t a complete moron. With the challenges I was facing, I could hardly challenge  I just kept my head down, doing my best to integrate every single comment as I gave one hundred and ten percent effort.</p><p>Amusingly, as I pushed, I could see the rest of the backup players pushing, even more, not wanting to be shown off by a newbie. I had no doubt that, without Carter’s explicit push and the weight he carried as the defensive captain, they might have reacted differently. </p><p>But with that, they had to react to my threat more directly. Showing themselves qualified. Ultimately, trying to get a crack into the playing lineup was challenging. Players needed to impress a wide jury, one that consisted of the defensive coordinator, the position coach, and the captain. It was just like a beauty pageant. </p><p>A painfully violent beauty pageant. </p><p>I kept my mouth shut, doing my best to follow the requests of the coaches, enjoying the benefits of my Recovery Trait to the limit. More than one backup player was looking at me angrily, but that only made me push even harder. </p><p>Because, with their gaze, I could feel intent flowing toward me faster. It wasn’t as intense as the explosion that followed the photos Megan had revealed, but the more Intent, the sooner my guide would awaken. </p><p>And the sooner I could focus on gathering more Traits.</p><p>I still tried to channel the flow towards the System whenever I felt a spike, of course. Unfortunately, without a significantly thick flow of Intent, the success proved elusive. I needed to impress the other players more, but, unfortunately, just pushing harder from them was not enough to be shocking. </p><p>Especially when I was competing alongside starters, each faster and stronger than me. I could try to challenge some of them for more attention, but doing so in my first match would hurt my chances of getting a starter position. And, the Intent I would generate from a few football players was nothing compared to the potential represented by a stadium full of people. </p><p>I kept my head down, doing my best to impress the coaches with my diligence instead, even after we moved from basic training and started working on various formations, testing us on the formations that we had memorized during the previous evening. </p><p>“Start with a base cover six,” called the coach as the starters quickly followed the orders, taking the appropriate layout. “Now, they are using three receivers, and two tight ends,” the coach called, and Carter, standing at the center of the defensive formation, quickly called a few adjustments before letting the defense launch. </p><p>“Not like that, morons,” called Coach Bill, his tone biting. “Fifteen, you’re a step too deep into the formation, you can’t properly cover the receiver with your step. Twenty-three, your footwork is not appropriate to cover a slant, be more careful. Forty-six, you’re too slow…” he started, delivering several biting criticisms to every defensive player on the field, showing that his great reputation among the players was not unearned. </p><p>It was not easy to catch all those mistakes with a glance. I certainly didn’t catch even a quarter of the issues he raised, and that was with the assistance of my Traits. </p><p>Such a deep experience was hard to beat. </p><p>For the next fifteen minutes, the backup players watched the first string players cycling through many plays, some simple, some complicated, but one thing was constant. No matter the play, every single player received insulting corrections, often followed by some colorful language that would make a sailor blush. </p><p>Yet, none of the players reacted, showing it was just another day. </p><p>I watched carefully, admitting that Carter really knew his role well. He was not only fast and strong, but also he was able to deliver the required corrections rapidly even as he got exhausted. In comparison, Thad looked rather ordinary, though that wasn’t too surprising. He was a defensive tackle, and his actions usually required the least adjustments. </p><p>His true ability would only appear when playing against the defensive players. </p><p>After fifteen minutes, the coach started calling for some replacements, allowing the backups to get some reps, though I noted that not all starters had been removed at the same time. </p><p>Nor their rest was a reward. The ones that were making the most mistakes were the ones that were pulled the first, and, their sharp expression showed that they were aware of the reason, as well as the implications for their playing time. </p><p>Carter was clearly not exaggerating when he said every player had to work for a spot regardless of the situation. </p><p>Though, the danger wasn't exactly catasthrophic. As the backups replaced some of the positions, the smoothness of the defense had been displaying all along vanished. The players started stumbling on the adjustments more, which threw the coherency of the defense out of sync. </p><p>After all, there was a difference between first-string players and backups, both in terms of years of experience, but also in terms of pure ability. Combined, the drop in performance was not a surprise. </p><p>As a newcomer, I only had the opportunity to take a practice snap half an hour into the practice, and the correction came almost immediately. “Fifty-eight, don’t be an idiot and keep your shoulders tighter and your center of weight lower, or the running back would kill you,” the coach shouted, immediately catching a significant mistake. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t a mistake big enough to make me lose my turn, and I stayed on the field for the next few repeats. After them, the number of corrections I received lessened, the issues raised getting lower and lower, though the space they would otherwise occupy started to get replaced by insults and slurs. </p><p>Interestingly, Carter, still at the center of the defense, holding the mike position to call the adjustments, started favoring the complicated schemes that were challenging for the side I was holding. </p><p>And since we spent the whole night practicing those formations, it was clearly a favor from his end. I caught Coach’s gaze jumping between  Carter and me after a particularly challenging blitz combination that required me to fake an outside dash before coming through the offensive line to take down the quarterback, yet he didn’t raise an issue. </p><p>It was an understandable choice. While what Carter was doing was favoritism, giving me a chance to perform more than the other players, considering it allowed me to show just how much of a complicated defensive playbook I was able to display after just one day, Coach Bill clearly had no problems with it ethically. </p><p>Though, soon, I noticed the plays he was calling started to get more and more complicated, blitzes disguised as zone, zone disguised as man-defense, and formations that ordered to change completely unrelated patterns. </p><p>I even caught several plays that hadn’t been studied during the study session, yet I managed to implement them successfully thanks to our study session, even when half of the starters stumbled on the field. </p><p>Seeing the coach’s intrigued expression, I could say that the first training was a success.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Suddenly sprouting a fresh layer of scales all over my body was a supremely uncomfortable sensation, with a weird itch. Though, it was not as uncomfortable as suddenly having two brand new limbs on my back. </p><p>Interestingly, going through such a huge transformation was much less painful than I would have expected. All I felt was a weird itch, though my new ally’s a panicked attitude as she walked around me, doing her best to cast a diagnostic spell — only to be rebuffed by the magic circling under my new scales. </p><p>And the scales weren’t the full extent of my transformation. In my chest, my core was getting warmer and warmer with each second, pumping more magic to my body than I ever thought to be possible, completely overshadowing my previous capacity — which was incredible as not only I was a Sorcerer, but also I was one of the stronger sorcerers in terms of magical power. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t dare to cast a spell to test my newly acquired abilities, because I still remembered the way my magic had been working the last time I had gone through such transformation, with little to no control. </p><p>I had a feeling that my current situation would be even worse.</p><p>Then, I grabbed the nearest wall to stand up, only for my hand — claw — to go through the wall, showing that it wasn’t only my magical abilities I had to struggle to control. </p><p>“H-how are you still alive?” my newest ally stammered again, further highlighting the extraordinary nature of my new status. </p><p>“Why?” I said as I walked back and forth, leaving a great number of footprints on the floor as I did so, my tongue feeling weird in my mouth as I spoke. “I know that I’m not supposed to survive after absorbing a dragon heart, but considering I had managed to do it once, is it really that surprising that I’m still alive?” </p><p>“You don’t even realize what just happened!” she answered, her beautiful face contorted in abject shock, though it was the small, hysterical chuckle that escaped her lips that showed me the true extent of her shock. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” I answered, ignoring the unfamiliar sensation of a different-shaped tongue moving in my mouth. “I can’t say I’m an expert in dragon hearts,” I said, then looked down. “Honestly, before now, I didn’t even realize just how accurate their naming was.” </p><p>Her giggle hardly helped me to feel comfortable about her state of mind, suggesting that she might slip away to hysteria. I would have slapped her to distract her from her hysteria if it wasn’t for my out-of-control strength, making it likely that such an action would likely kill her. </p><p>And my newest claws, sharp enough to cut through a wall, were hardly something that made it easier. </p><p>“Tell me then?” I prompted instead. </p><p>“You survived a complete merging,” she said. </p><p>“And that’s unlikely, how?” I asked. </p><p>She sighed before starting to speak, though I didn’t push her about the delay despite being in the center of the enemy base. Not only my physical state was rather hard to conceal, but also I couldn’t even walk without creating a commotion. Since I needed to get a minimal handle on my power before escaping, a couple minutes of delay was not the biggest inconvenience. </p><p>“First of all, a resonance is the precursor to a merging, which is a complete melding of two pieces of dragon heart, creating a bigger and stronger one in the process, usually stronger than the sum of the earlier pieces.” </p><p>“And that’s a problem, how? Isn’t it better to have a stronger one?” </p><p>“Because, such merging only happens in an explosive way. The kind that erases the towns off the map, and that’s on the condition that the merging is successful.” </p><p>“And how about the unsuccessful ones.” </p><p>“There’s a story about that back in my country. A usurper of the throne dared to force one to prove his heavenly mantle, and he decided to do so on the top of a holy mountain, hoping that being closer to the heavens would accelerate it?” </p><p>“And I’m guessing the mountain didn’t survive unscathed.” </p><p>“You could say that,” she said. “Considering it is the location of the largest lake in my country.” </p><p> “Understood,” I said, unable to suppress a chill. “But why are they experimenting with them in the middle of their estate if it’s so dangerous.” </p><p>“Because resonance is rare, and not something you can force. There needs to be a natural connection, which, considering the rarity of such an event, was not likely. Even if you collect all dragon hearts in the world in a room, I doubt that there would be more than a handful of natural resonance events.” </p><p>“That rare, huh,” I murmured, once again unable to believe my luck.</p><p>“Yes, it was your misfortune that triggered it, but it was your fortune that allowed you to survive,” she answered, her hysteria slowly disappearing as she spoke, getting a hang of her nerves. I could still see a manic glint in her gaze, suggesting she was still feeling shocked, but she was able to suppress it sufficiently. </p><p>Which was all I could expect. </p><p>“How big was the initial piece of crystal you absorbed for it to dominate and absorb such a big piece of dragon heart?” she said curiously. I raised my hand and made a gesture. </p><p>Only for her shock to return to the surface. “Impossible,” she gasped. </p><p>“More impossible than not destroying the outskirts of Rome in a magical accident?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered immediately. “In a resonance, it’s impossible for a weaker piece to absorb a stronger one.” </p><p>“How do you know that? You just told me that it’s rare in the first place. Maybe it was an exception,” I said, not feeling particularly convinced of her statement. </p><p>“We don’t have time for a month-long lecture, but believe me, it’s impossible for a natural resonance to work like that.” </p><p>“How about an artificial one, then?” I asked. “Maybe my lightning spells triggered something.” </p><p>“That’s even more unlikely,” she answered. “Triggering an artificial resonance requires decades of careful work to even have a hint of success, and trying to compress it further, even onto years…”  </p><p>“Turns mountains into lakes,” I completed her sentence. </p><p>“Exactly!” </p><p>Though, as we talked, I could see her shock slowly getting under control. “Anyway, I’m sure it’s not going to be the only time we discuss my impossible survival,” I said, interrupting her track of thought. “Let’s focus on the more important challenge. You need to find a way to hide me if we want to escape successfully.” </p><p>“And do you think we can still escape after all this commotion?” she asked. “They’ll scour the whole of Italy just to discover us even if we can get out of the Estate in the first place.” </p><p>“Maybe, I already have a ship ready and waiting for us at the docks. I could signal them to leave early, and we can meet with them in the sea. As long as we can get out of the estate and arrange a proper distraction to them…” </p><p>“We can’t avoid them following you,” she said with a sigh. “After resonance, you’re radiating a very distinct aura, and you’ll radiate it until you can get it under control, which is hardly something that could be achieved easily.” </p><p>I frowned a bit. “Can’t you use a spell to conceal it?” I asked. </p><p>“Maybe for a few hours, but that would be my limit,” she answered. “Anything more, and I would be too drained to move, let alone cast anything.” </p><p>It seemed a bit weak to me. I wondered whether her reserves were too low, or I had a general misunderstanding about the potential of the other sorcerers due to my own warped nature. Not that it mattered at the moment. Not like I had another sorcerer helper to replace her. </p><p>“How about using a dragon heart as a battery, then?” I said as I pointed at the glowing crystals that littered the room. </p><p>“That’s even more impossible,” she said as she looked at them. “By using them, they would radiate an aura similar to what you’re radiating in the first place, making it a moot point.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said as I looked at the crystals, a plan forming in my mind. “And, can you trigger them so that they radiate that power constantly, for a few hours?” </p><p>“That’s much easier,” she said. “Why?” </p><p>“I was thinking of decoys,” I said. “There’s a group of nobles in the estate, and it’s almost time for them to leave the estate. If you can suppress my aura for an hour, we could slip some of the dragon hearts to them and spread the rest around the city. The chaos in such an important location would give us the opportunity to disappear.” </p><p>I glanced at the many Patrician weapons spread around the city, most I failed to recognize. “And, imagine the intensity of the chaos if along with some dragon hearts, more than a dozen lost Patrician weapons suddenly appeared in the city. Wouldn’t the chaos it created be just enough for us to slip out.” Technically, I didn’t know whether all those weapons actually belonged to Patrician families, that was just my assumption after recognizing the Spear of Scipio. </p><p>I didn’t even know the source of the other two weapons that I managed to summon, the sword and the bow, let alone others. </p><p>But I doubted the greedy nobles of Rome would care about their origin compared to the power they represented. Giving such a treasure up was not exactly easy, but it was certainly better than dying for them. </p><p>“Then, how are we going to get onto the ship if it leaves the docks?” she asked. </p><p>I smirked. “How well you can swim?” </p>",

    "content": "<p>Carter was quick to change in the locker room, and he wasn’t the only one that was extremely quick. The locker room was filled with defensive players, each doing their best to rush as they changed into their training outfits. Full pads as well, which was a surprise, as most teams didn’t train in full pads until the last day as it was both exhausting and painful. </p><p>Though, it was clearly for the defensive players only, as, on the other side of the room, the offensive players were acting much more lazily, ignoring the ticking clock for the training to start. </p><p>And more interestingly, they weren’t putting on their pads. </p><p>But since none of the players commented on that, I kept my mouth shut, focusing on my own preparations, until Thad arrived. “A night full of studying?” he asked. </p><p>“Once a nerd, always a nerd,” I answered with a shrug, earning a chuckle from the people that surrounded me, though that didn’t prevent tense gazes from more than one linebacker that was feeling threatened by the surprise study session with the captain who was also the mike linebacker of the team and what it might imply against my chances of playing. </p><p>And not all of those worried glances belonged to backup players. </p><p>I acted like I was unaware of their complicated gaze, but took a note of it. Sunset college was not exactly the top of the food chain, with a lot of players going professional, but there were enough players that had been drafted even though usually sixth or seventh round — or managed to earn a position as an undrafted free agent — to make them dream about it. </p><p>And even for the ones that didn’t want to go professional, playing as a starter was a point of pride. </p><p>A pride that was suddenly threatened by a newcomer. </p><p>Like I needed more reasons to be careful. </p><p>Soon, we were in the field, doing our best to suppress our trembles. As the sun was yet to rise, the weather was positively freezing. One of the assistant coaches arrived, and ordered us to start running while taking notes. </p><p>A nice morning warmup exercises to contrast the freezing wind. </p><p>Not the most pleasant experience of my life, but unfortunately, it was an inevitable part of football life. Luckily, it wasn’t as challenging as the day before, when my overambitious conditioning coach Juana had pushed me to the limit. Yet, I noticed one interesting thing. Even as we started stretching, the offensive players were yet to arrive. “Where’s the other half of the team?” I asked Thad when he was next to me. </p><p>“Coach Spencer believes early morning practices are best conducted in the gym,” he said with a chuckle, his disdain clear, yet not enough to suppress the hint of jealously. I understood his rationale perfectly, yet I couldn’t help but wonder. No wonder our offense sucked. If they were soft enough to neglect proper practice when it was too cold, they were certainly too soft to put a proper game. </p><p>Yet, before Thad could answer, Coach Bill walked to the field, and all chatter disappeared immediately. A great sign of his authority for a frail man in his late seventies to walk into the field, and command that kind of fear and respect without saying a word. </p><p>“You got five days to get ready,” he started without the slightest preamble. No good morning, no greeting, nothing. Direct to the subject. “This isn’t just another poser team that you’re going to face this time. They are your rivals, and when they come to the field, they are not going to search for an entertaining game. They will come here, in our stadium, to humiliate us.” </p><p>No one said anything, but from the way they were perking up, I could see that the words were affecting them. A nice little proof that Coach Bill was not about just fear, but also respect. </p><p>Coach Bill walked back and forth in front of us for a while before he continued. “In the field, they will try to defeat you, and it’s not going to be an honorable defeat. They will hit, they will trick, and they will try to humiliate you.” He paused for a moment. “And you know you can’t trust the help of anyone that’s not currently on the field,” he added, his tone softening for a moment. </p><p>The chuckles that spread around the team reflected the mood, just another piece of evidence of just how bad was the divide between the two halves of the team. </p><p>“It falls on you to prevent things from turning into a total humiliation. This week, you are going to be a bunch of head-hunters. They like to hit. You’re going to hit harder. They have sadistic tendencies. You’re going to be the devil. I want you to show them they are not the meanest bunch in the field just because they are going through a winning streak. I want you guys to be evil, I want you to be the devil. I want you to stomp them into the field.”</p><p>“Yes, coach!” the players exploded, and I joined them, amused by the delivery. I certainly didn’t expect that talk, it belonged to an earlier decade, maybe even an earlier century, when football was an even more violent sport before the rule adjustments interfered. Considering my aims, I couldn’t say that I was exactly unhappy with the reveal. </p><p>“However, I don’t want a bunch of undisciplined rabble there. I want an army, solid, disciplined, every step calculated. I want you to work like a machine, every move calculated, every attack measured. I don’t you guys to waste this early morning practice by making stupid mistakes. Understood?” </p><p>“Yes, coach!” the team exclaimed. </p><p>“Not bad,” he said. “You have five days to get ready. Listen to everything I say, and maybe, just maybe, we can prevent the other half of our team from helping our rival to help us humiliate us!” </p><p>“Yes, coach!” </p><p>“Good,” he said, satisfied. “Let’s start with something simple to warm up. Give me a set of terrible twenties. Starters on the one side, and backups on the other side. As usual, the losers will have four sets of fifty burpees to complete.” </p><p>The grunt of protest that rose from the team was understandable, even after that impressive speech, terrible twenties was not a fun exercise. Not even close. </p><p>Essentially, it required two groups splitting into the two sides of the field, separated by a hundred yards. One side did twenty push-ups while the other side did sit-ups at the same number. Once finished, the sides sprinted to the other side of the field, only to repeat it by reducing the attempts by one, and repeating the attempt, repeating until the count hit zero. Essentially, it was a lot of sprinting, sprinkled with other actions. </p><p>This is another grueling team exercise. Two groups are split up with 100 yards between them. One side does 20 push-ups while the other does 20 sit-ups. Once finished, they sprint across the field to the other side, alternating workouts each time. Once 20 is completed, you’ll drop to 19, 18, and so forth until zero. It’s not a fun countdown.</p><p>It was hardly the most optimal exercise for a morning exercise after the rest, yet the choice to start the week with an exercise that was famous for being painful and hellish was a choice. </p><p>The coach was telling us that his words were not empty, and this week was going to be painful. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but smirk as I positioned myself at one end of the field with the rest of the backup players, waiting for the whistle to ring, though from the way people were positioned, I noticed the difference. People were positioned like they were about to sprint first, rather than doing push-ups. Yet, that didn’t matter much. </p><p>Ultimately, whether it was sprint-first or push-up-first, hellish twenties was an exercise of endurance, recovery, and willpower. </p><p>I couldn’t have scripted it better to highlight my best traits. </p><p>I didn’t start strongly, as speed was hardly my best quality. I was fast enough to hang up with the backup players — if barely, I thought as I finished the first sprint a few steps behind the slowest backup linebacker. Even worse, when I barely reached ten in my push-ups, the starters had already completed it. It didn’t seem like a big difference, but ultimately, the difference between the four-five dash and the four-eight dash was unbreakable. </p><p>At least for anyone without a magical system helping to overwrite my genetic potential. </p><p>The coach only waited until the last player finished their rounds, giving us a couple of seconds to rest, before the whistle rang once more, and we dashed forward. </p><p>By the third sprint, I wasn’t the last player among the backups anymore. By the fifth attempt, there were two players behind me, and by the attempt ten, I was leading the linebackers, much to the angry glares I was receiving from the rest of the cadre, who were doing their best to keep up, only to fail. By attempt fifteen, I was even performing better than some of the starters, enough to catch the gaze of more than one coach on the field. </p><p>It wasn’t a simple achievement, even with the traits helping, the burning of my legs was real. I could imagine myself slowing down, even with the dreams of playing football. </p><p>Luckily for me, a mysterious magical threat from ancient ages was the perfect motivating tool.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I collapsed next to my cute, naked dragoness who had been trembling softly as she did her best to process her explosive climax, tethering on the edge of unconsciousness as she mewled in dazed satisfaction.</p><p>If she didn’t show the signs of exhaustion already, showing she wanted to go back to her sleep, I would have pushed her against the wall for another session.  </p><p>Instead, I pulled her against my chest, enjoying her warmth as her arms wrapped back automatically. It was supposed to be a calming moment, but it wasn’t. Not when I was trying to process the latest realization, one that threw everything I had managed to discover about the System into question yet again.</p><p>It was the reason I let her go back to sleep rather than bothering them. I wanted to think about the implications of the Tantric, and why it was different than my other skills. </p><p>Of course, before making an immediate decision, I first needed to make sure my earlier discovery was not just a misunderstanding of the root, or a mistake of blocking. Which meant, I needed to do more experimentation. I quickly applied the same blocking trick to every single skill I owned, but the difference for every single skill, from Crafting to Melee, from Subterfuge to various magical skills, was sharp enough to be apparent, leaving no place for doubt. </p><p>Yet, for Tantric, between blocking and not blocking, there was absolutely no difference in performance. </p><p>I was shocked. Yet, I wondered whether it was even reasonable for me to feel shocked. From its ability to help others level up to actually giving me the ability to strip its uniqueness from the Divine Spark, there was nothing ordinary about the achievements triggered by the Tantric skill. </p><p>No wonder I never managed to find any proper information about it in the library. </p><p>Yet, that only created more questions. I remembered the dismissal the headmistress had when I first displayed that I had the ability to contain her Light Divine Spark, which, when analyzed together with the shock she displayed when she realized the structures made from Tantric mana were able to contain Divine Spark much more efficiently. </p><p>It meant that I wasn’t the only one unaware of the true potential hidden in my skill. </p><p>It also meant that I needed to be careful about the capabilities I revealed to her — in particular, the ability to purify the Divine Spark.  </p><p>But that was a decision for another time. Instead, I repeated the earlier experiment, this time focusing on the changes that occurred between blocking and not blocking the skill, to see if I could catch something more. </p><p>At first, I was not sure whether it was going to be successful considering I was still under the wards that weakened the reach of the system, but after some time, I realized that wasn’t the case. </p><p>The subtle shadow of the darkness wards created a little layer between the skills nodes in my soul space and the System, and that created subtle friction between that link, allowing me to catch the existence of a flow I had never noticed before. It was subtle flow, hard to describe, and impossible to decipher — at least under my current level of ability. I doubted that I could feel anything more than a flicker that would have been mistaken by my body’s natural flow if it wasn’t for the assistance of the headmistress’ unique wards… </p><p>Yet, the same connection between the System and Tantric was dead. No flow, not even a flicker, completely empty, existing only in form. </p><p>And that only made it more complicated. </p><p>With a sigh, I slowly extracted myself from the arms of Janelor as she slowly fell back to sleep, our little exertion enough to make her collapse even after she had just woken up. I was tempted to nap with her, but that latest realization about the extraordinary nature of Tantric was enough to overwhelm that particular desire. </p><p>I couldn’t say that I was glad about that realization, but that was not due to any direct reason related to its application of it. On the contrary, it actually allayed one of my biggest fears, that, somehow, I would find myself helpless with the System blocked. </p><p>Yet, it was inconvenient, because it put a lot of things in question, particularly about how the System functioned. I didn’t have the slightest idea why Tantric could function without the assistance of the System, and it put into question whether Tantric actually came from the System… </p><p>My unique nature of getting experience certainly added to that particular question. </p><p>It was an annoying feeling, discovering the truths about such a fundamental part of my being, only to end up with more and more questions. </p><p>Unlike the previous times, I didn’t even have the luxury of going to the library to explore some ancient books, or interrogate a naughty dragon or a prude angel for some scraps of information, because it was getting riskier to reveal even hints of my discoveries compared to the scraps of information I might extract, especially since their actions already confirmed their information. </p><p>And since it was pointless to ask the headmistress, it was also pointless to go digging around the library. It was just vain to assume that the headmistress was unaware of anything in the books, not when she had spent almost two centuries ruling the place, her unique method of concealment making reading the best way of killing time in isolation. </p><p>Technically, there might be a book or two she missed, but it was not worth my limited time digging around, hoping to find something that she hadn’t comprehended properly. </p><p>With a sigh, I sneaked out of the school, aware that, technically, I still had one important destination where I might find the answers I was seeking. </p><p>I closed my eyes, focused on a mental direction before creating an air elemental, and started flying. </p><p>[-1320 Mana]</p><p>Unfortunately, my destination was not where I knew I could find the information I was searching, for two reasons. First, technically, I didn’t know the exact geographical location of the information, but that didn’t prevent me from searching. </p><p>The real reason I didn’t dare go around poking, I was afraid of the attention it might create. </p><p>I did not have the power to deal with the Eternals. </p><p>At least, not yet. </p><p>Everything I had discovered about them, every little detail that had been revealed, suggested that they had a veritable army, one that treated warriors and mages over level thirty as disposable items — not to mention their ability to apparently mass-produce them easily, considering the training event I had stumbled on during the encounter in Mount Doom. </p><p>No, I didn’t dare to go around poking such an organization. </p><p>At least, not before I could reach a power level I would feel comfortable. Instead, I set my direction to the mental pull of two companion nodes in the same direction. I chose to use another air elemental rather than traveling directly, because there was no urgency for me to risk using teleportation. </p><p>Moreover, the travel allowed me to train my skills without the intervention of the System. Tantric might not be connected to the System, but it was certainly not the case for the rest of my skills. </p><p>Even picking my target skill wasn’t too difficult. I picked Arcana, which was, ultimately, the most flexible magical ability one might have, from ward creating to utility charms. It might give a weak offensive, but considering my challenges, I didn’t have the luxury of sacrificing the utility to maximize my damage potential. </p><p>As I flew toward my destination, I blocked my Arcana skill, trying to cast a simple arcana bolt, only for it to fizzle halfway, before it could even reach its target. </p><p>“Frustrating,” I murmured. It was impossible for me to ignore just how critical the practice I was doing, not with the ease I was having blocking my own skills to drive the fragility of the power granted by the System, but that hardly made the sensation of failing something that was as simple as breathing any easier. </p><p>It was like trying to relearn walking. </p><p>But sometimes, you needed to relearn how to walk, if the alternative was to rely on a pair of enchanted legs that might simply run out of power and fold in the middle of an adventure. </p><p>I journeyed even as the sun slowly set, covering the area in darkness, underlining just how long my journey was even with the assistance of the air elemental, hunting the occasional strong monster I came across to replenish my reserves. </p><p>Yet, even as the sun set, there was no uninterrupted darkness, not with the explosions of the light that was happening on the horizon. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I saw the signs of Titania’s signature spell. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 7592 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Natalie might be surprised by the surprise inclusion of the handcuffs, but that didn’t prevent her from continuing to display an amazing performance around my girth as she went down, barely needing her girlfriend’s assistance to do so. </p><p>That didn’t stop Jenny from pushing her head down, not when she was this committed to dominating her girlfriend. </p><p>The next push she gave left Natalie helplessly skewered on my shaft as she gagged, proving that just because Natalie was showing an incredible improvement in the art of deep-throating didn’t mean she couldn’t attain even higher achievements with the assistance of her lovely girlfriend. </p><p>I would have loved to continue faking sleep, to see just how far Jenny was willing to push during our current situation, but my state of sleeping was getting incredibly unbelievable as Jenny pushed Natalie to her limits, so I made a show of waking up. </p><p>“Wow,” I gasped in fake amusement the moment I opened my eyes, though slurring words just slightly to sell a groggy impression. “It’s rare to wake up to a reality that’s better than a beautiful dream,” I said as I let my gaze dance over their naked bodies before I fixed my gaze on Natalie, the woman who had the great honor of being my superior at work, at least officially. “Good to see you, boss. What a nice morning, right?” </p><p>The fire in her gaze told me that she had several select statements against my mocking tone, but those could hardly be delivered with the impediment in her throat. </p><p>“I’m sure she agrees,” Jenny said as a smile covered her beautiful face, though that didn’t stop her from pushing her down more. </p><p>“I’m sure she does,” I repeated while I Natalie’s head. “But I can take over the task of helping her, why don’t you come here and give me a good morning kiss.” </p><p>“Good idea,” Jenny said as she pulled back and climbed on the bed. While she slowly moved closer, I gazed down Natalie’s eyes, enjoying the sharp jealousy dancing in her eyes — but after three months of continuous exposure, that jealousy was just an aspect of our relationship, one that she was developing a taste for. </p><p>That aspect of her arousal hardly disappeared when Jenny leaned and delivered a slow, lingering kiss on my lips. “Delicious,” I murmured as Jenny pulled back, the small blush giving her face an ethereal quality. “Now, why don’t you give one to Natalie as well. We don’t want her to feel neglected, do we?” </p><p>“Sure, are you going to let her pull back?” she asked. </p><p>“No,” I answered with a smirk. “But she still has more lips, ones that aren’t currently occupied, right?” </p><p>A beautiful pearl of laughter escaped from her mouth and exploded in the room. “You’re right,” Jenny said. </p><p>While Jenny traveled the same road, I turned my gaze back to Natalie, whose face was filled with anger and relief. </p><p>Relief because the idea of being treated from both sides clearly attracted her, and anger because, even at the moment, she hated that I was the one that allowed her to have pleasure, and could have chosen a path that would torture her on the edge. </p><p>While Natalie was busy processing the complicated nature of our relationship, Jenny arrived at her destination, her hands landing on Natalie’s thighs, making her widen her legs. Natalie complied quickly to the touch of her lover, her eyes firmly shut at the moment Jenny’s tongue touched her wet slit. </p><p>Jenny stayed there, teasing Natalie, aggressively as well if their quickening squirming was any indicator. As the pleasure hit, Natalie’s resistance to her assisted blowjob disappeared even more, obeying my every push enthusiastically. </p><p>I wondered whether it was the pleasure making her lose control, or if she was trying to pay me back for triggering Jenny’s involvement. Either way, the tight grip on her throat was certainly spectacular. </p><p>I watched as Jenny’s small, dainty hands slipped and danced on her thighs before landing on her perky ass, squeezing her butt cheeks — surprisingly, hard enough to leave her mark. Jenny was definitely feeling like playing the dominant side today. Since it was a rare occurrence, I decided to enjoy it fully, and while Natalie’s eyes closed and Jenny rose for a breather, I made a gesture for a slap. </p><p>Jenny was a smart girl, and was quick to get what I meant. Her hand floated up for a moment, yet, rather than landing down, it stayed motionless for a moment, while her gaze found mine, showing hesitation. Clearly, she wasn’t feeling too confident in her newly adapted dominant role. </p><p>Yet, I caught her gaze and nodded, prompting her to take action. My silent prompting proved to be sufficient for her to overcome her earlier decision, and her hand landed, the sound of a slap exploding in the room. </p><p>Natalie tried to let out a gasp, but it was terminated before it could form. Her throat was occupied with more important tasks, but her widened eyes reflected her shock successfully. </p><p>These last few months had taught Natalie a lot about being the submissive party, but being dominated by her otherwise sweet girlfriend was clearly a different experience than accepting my more confident brand of dominance. Her eyes widened even further Jenny repeated her spank, her legs trembling. </p><p>Yet, despite the shock, Natalie didn’t fight the sensation, accepting Jenny’s changing attitude with a smoothness that surprised me — but maybe being handcuffed prepared her for that. </p><p>When I let her pull back for a breather, she limited herself to moaning and gasping, showing Jenny just how much she had been enjoying the sudden change of treatment. Jenny responded by spanking her again, this time even harder, eliciting a painful cry. </p><p>“Did I do it too hard?” Jenny asked. Natalie opened her mouth to answer, but I had no intention of allowing her to do so. I pulled her down before she could answer and turned to Jenny. </p><p>“First rule of spanking fun, no need to stop without a safe word,” I explained, my smirk widening. “That’s the fun part of it.” </p><p>Jenny smiled at my explanation, then her hand landed on Natalie’s ass once again. Natalie’s shoulders tightened as she tried to balance herself on the bed, with her legs starting to tremble under the rush of pleasure.  </p><p>Yet, when Jenny changed her pace and returned to Natalie’s nether lips, her tongue dancing against her softness, it triggered a climax in Natalie, making her let out a string of moans — moans that were unfortunately silenced with my shaft in her throat. </p><p>In a rare merciful moment, I allowed her to pull back, treating us to the latter half of her beautiful moans as her orgasm ravaged her body, making her shake badly. </p><p>Though, just because I let her pull back didn’t mean that I wouldn’t tease her. As her back arched, her position displayed her tits excellently. I was quick to cover them with my hands, my fingers circling her fingers and pinching them. Her entire body shook at the invasion, the pleasure pushing her hard enough to unbalance her. And with her hands locked, she toppled forward. </p><p>“Someone needs a little help,” I said with a chuckle and pulled her to my lap, skewering her with my shaft, earning a beautiful moan in the process, her hands still tied behind. Jenny threw a jealous glare, but that didn’t prevent her from sitting on the side of the bed, her legs wide, her fingers dancing around her knob to enjoy the show. </p><p>Since Jenny wanted to watch, I decided to give a proper show. I tightened my hold around her body and pushed even deeper, making Natalie moan more and more. </p><p>“Faster,” she gasped, showing that her earlier orgasm was not even close to satisfying her. I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for her handcuffs, her hands would have been digging into my shoulders to push herself even deeper. </p><p>I was too familiar with the level of passion Natalie liked the display once she started going… </p><p>Natalie wasn’t the only one that started breathing even harder. Jenny gasped and moaned, her fingers disappearing deeper and deeper into her core. </p><p>I let my hands drift down, squeezing Natalie’s hips for the extra leverage I needed as I plunged deeper into her, fucking her fast and hard, giving her the perfect treatment she needed after a long and exhausting flight. </p><p>“Pity we didn’t fly together,” I whispered into her ear even as I plunged, making sure to speak soft enough to avoid Jenny’s attention. “Because, we had a familiar stewardess.” </p><p>“T-that girl,” Natalie murmured back, not as effective as my whisper. She was lucky that Jenny was moaning loud enough to deafen herself. </p><p>“Yes, Tanya,” I whispered. “And she was quite fun, but she mentioned she missed you. But, hopefully, we will get her on the way back as well.” </p><p>“H-hopefully,” Natalie managed to gasp as her hips danced and crawled. Then, the urgency of the pleasure overwhelmed any distant fantasy that might or might not include the participation of a cute blonde in an exciting location, and Natalie started crying with a more primal need. “Harder, harder.” </p><p>“Your wishes, my order, boss,” I whispered as I tightened my grip even further before pushing her down, and launching an aggressive assault into her core, my full weight behind my strokes as the sound of clapping exploded in the room. </p><p>She gasped continuously, her toes curling up and her feet stretching out. I watched in a primal satisfaction as her head tilted back and her eyes rolled, her moans exploding without cohesion. She tightened around my cock, her entire body quivering.</p><p>I used the opportunity to grab her thighs and fuck her as fast as I could manage. Combined with her tightness, it didn’t take long for me to explode in her, filling her to the brim. </p><p>Natalie trembled helplessly as I grabbed and lay her on the bed, then leaned forward to Jenny and stole a quick kiss. “I think that’s enough for morning fun,” I whispered as I pulled back. “I’m going to have a quick breakfast and maybe a swim. And, it’ll leave you two alone to have some private fun.” </p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Jenny murmured with an uncharacteristic enthusiasm as she looked at Natalie, still in handcuffs. She was clearly enthusiastic about the opportunity to reverse their usual relationship. “It’s going to be fun…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>Naomi froze once again as I stood in front of her, close enough to feel her breath. Yet, even with her hesitance, she didn’t take a step back, which was all I needed as an excuse to grab her hips and pull her closer. “It’s your turn,” I whispered as I pulled her tight against my body, my glistening shaft pressing against her stomach. “Are you ready?” </p><p>She stood motionless as my hands explored her sides once more, but ultimately, her lips parted and delivered her obedience. “Yes.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I whispered, though her answer didn’t surprise me too much after everything that had been going on. </p><p>I could have dragged her upstairs, where we would have calmer, uninterrupted fun, but after everything that happened, it would have been a boring conclusion. Why occupy a single bedroom, when we had such a superior location to enjoy, I thought even as I glanced at Sarah, who was still laying on the couch, trying to catch her breath, but her gaze was sharp. “Let’s prove to your friend that you can do it better than her,” I whispered. </p><p>The shocked gasp Naomi let out was beautiful and loud, but that didn’t imply she wasn’t willing to follow my suggestion. Otherwise, she would have moved away before I could push forward rather than putting her hands on Sarah’s shoulders for balance. </p><p>I stopped for a second, giving myself time to enjoy the sight of Naomi’s beautiful body leaning against her much paler friend, her waist bent, pushing her ass out even as her back gained a beautiful curve that was only possible due to her endless obsession with fitness. </p><p>Sarah’s reaction was beautiful as she found a pair of soft hands on her shoulders, pushing her down, adding another layer of eroticism to the moment. Her eyes, still misty with pleasure, widened beautifully, shocked by Naomi’s daring display of initiative.</p><p>Naomi pushed her hips high, presenting her entrance, her excitement gushing. “So, do you still think I can’t match you,” Naomi whispered erotically to Sarah, their lips inches apart. </p><p>Sarah left that statement slide without a response, but only because she was focused on Naomi’s expression. I didn’t have the angle to see Naomi’s expression as I aligned my shaft against her entrance and pushed forward, but, during the day, I had interacted with her enough to imagine it, especially when Sarah’s shifting expression gave me a clue. </p><p>Though, the beautiful moan that she let out as I finally invaded her core left little doubt about the nature of the expression. “I … I can’t believe it,” Sarah murmured dazedly as she watched me taking another friend of hers, unable to stop her gaze from dancing between Naomi’s excited face and her swaying breasts. </p><p>And, just to make things more fun, she was watching her friend during her first time. </p><p>A gasp escaped Naomi’s mouth as I pushed forward sharply, marking a monumental step in Naomi’s sexuality. “Tell me when you feel comfortable,” I said. </p><p>“You can go,” she murmured after a momentary pause, showing that such a little amount of pain was nothing for her. </p><p>I could have pushed forward then, of course, but I decided to tease our observer first. “What do you think, Sarah?” I said, unable to suppress a chuckle, earning a matching one from Naomi — though hers was quick to turn into a delicious moan as I put my hands on her bountiful ass and gave a squeeze. </p><p>“W-what do I think?” Sarah murmured, though, despite her stammer, it didn’t take long for her to throw away her shock. After all, compared to everything she had done herself, the current position wasn’t exactly extreme despite her extremely close vantage point. </p><p>Then, she looked at Naomi’s face, and the expression she found there transformed the nature of her expression, her hesitant gaze evaporating, leaving its place for a sexy smirk. </p><p>Whatever expression Naomi was wearing, it was enough to awaken Sarah’s competitive naughty spirit. </p><p>“If she thinks she can handle it, give it to her, then,” Sarah delivered her order, her whisper appropriately soft, trying to slither under my skin. Then, her voice sharpened as she put her hands on Naomi’s shoulders to mirror. </p><p>However, unlike Naomi, her hands were not there to help her find her balance, but to give her a push. Naomi moaned in shock as she found herself filled to the brim with my shaft, the wetness from our extensive foreplay the only thing that allowed her to let out a moan of pleasure — though overwhelmed and shocked — rather than a loud cry of pain. </p><p>“Not that she looks like she can handle it,” Sarah said, the eroticism of her voice, a perfect mixture of satisfaction and jealousy packed in a wrap of eroticism, enough to make a less experienced man explode prematurely. </p><p>Luckily, I was experienced enough to resist the temptation of not only Sarah’s alluring voice, but also Naomi’s iron grip around my girth at the same time. “Let’s see if she can handle it,” I whispered, unable to resist the temptation of slapping her tight ass before starting to impale her. </p><p>And just like that, Naomi’s explosive moans filled the room, mixing beautifully with the sound of flesh hitting flesh, and Sarah’s occasional, softer moans that told that she still wanted what Naomi was getting despite receiving the same treatment just minutes earlier. Her expression told me that she wanted it bad. </p><p>However, I had no intention of complying with that, not when I was busy sharing Naomi’s monumental first step. I had no intention of stopping halfway for Sarah’s wordless tantrum. </p><p>With Naomi’s hands clamping around her shoulders, Sarah was unable to stand up. Yet, she was quick to find something to entertain herself. Her hands slipped down from Naomi’s shoulders, only to stop at her peaks, squeezing them… </p><p>Squeezing them rather hard as well if Naomi’s sudden cry of pain was any indicator. “Oh, don’t tell me that you can’t handle a little squeeze,” Sarah whispered into her ear as she grabbed her nipples. </p><p>“I can—“ Naomi started, only to be interrupted halfway by another pained cry as Sarah twisted her nipples harshly. “I can handle anything you can do,” Naomi whispered, though as she did so, her fingers trailed down Sarah’s torso as well, her fingers clamping around Sarah’s nipples. “The question is, can you take what you dish out?” she added. </p><p>Sarah’s eyes widened at the realization that their little game wasn’t exactly one-dimensional, but that was too late as Naomi copied her, the twisting nipples making her cry just as loudly. </p><p>I said nothing as they delivered an extremely erotic rendition of a catfight, just occupying myself with steadily impaling Naomi’s wetness, focused on enjoying the moment. The way Naomi was gushing with each push left me no option to do otherwise. </p><p>Though, the rhythmic beats earned the ire of Sarah despite her earlier order, and it was also weakening Naomi’s counter-attack. Sarah’s expression left no doubt that she wanted nothing more than to snatch back Naomi’s current position. </p><p>Though, since that would force her to take back her words, she managed not to mention that fact, and she found something else to entertain herself. One of her hands moved forward, caressing Naomi’s smooth belly as she did so until they arrived at their real destination. </p><p>The little knob between Naomi’s legs, was the perfect place to tease her. </p><p>Considering it was her first time, Naomi was already having significant trouble handling the rush of pleasure. Under the combined attack of my shaft and Sarah’s fingers, her journey toward her inevitable destination got even faster. </p><p>And I doubted that my hands on her tight ass, alternating between mauling her cheeks and slapping hard enough to darken her glistening skin helped much. </p><p>Inevitably, Naomi started to tremble under the rush of pleasure as the climax hit her with the unrestricted strength of a freight train, making her legs buckle as she collapsed forward. Though, before I could grab her to prevent her from falling, Sarah reacted and hugged the collapsed beauty, pulling her to the sofa, their naked thighs pressing against each other.</p><p>The pleasure hit Naomi hard, leaving her dazed and exhausted, on the edge of a collapse.  </p><p>“I told you you couldn’t handle it,” Sarah said smugly as she looked at the side while she opened her legs, revealing her wetness for me even as that move put her leg on Naomi’s. “Now, it’s my turn!” </p><p>I could have explained that it wasn’t an entirely fair comparison, as poor Naomi was no doubt spent all day extremely tense after our little shopping adventure, but looking at Naomi’s face, I could see that the fight was finally drained out of her under the euphoria of her explosive climax, surrendering in their little game, giving the victory to Sarah. </p><p>At least, that was the result of their first battle, as hopefully, many more would follow. With that thought, I leaned forward to conclude our little dance with Sarah. </p><p>Though, even as I slipped into Sarah’s wetness, I couldn’t help but dream about the future…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I walked out of the prison cell, leaving Isolde behind — as much as her naked body tempted me to stay for another round — and started climbing up the stairs, forcing my mind to focus on my next problem. </p><p>How to handle the exact details of my next challenge. </p><p>Coming to a decision about Isolde’s freedom wasn’t the difficult part. Prison break was not an option, at least not the first one. There was no doubt about the necessity for her freedom, but not to a point of ruining my ability to visit the nest of the Phoenix whenever I wished to do so. Even someone as irresponsible as her would change the security of her base once a prisoner had escaped, and focus on the limited number of subjects — which I stood at the top.  </p><p>Or at least, I assumed she would do so, and testing whether my assumption was accurate on that subject was not exactly worthwhile. </p><p>Of course, going out and directly asking her to free Isolde was not an option as well, as doing so would mean that she knew my interest, and once I saved Isolde regardless, she would know who was responsible, promoting me from the list of suspicious people, to being the definite criminal. </p><p>Luckily, there were other, more measured, approaches I could use between the two extremes of arranging a prison break and begging her like a pathetic supplicant, hoping to receive her goodwill. </p><p>And even more fortunately, despite all her power, the Phoenix was overconfident, everything she had done since I had been acquainted with her reinforced that idea. I agreed that she had enough magical strength to be proud of — which was, admittedly, phenomenal enough to actually scare me — but she was clearly under the impression that her power gave her the necessary political acumen as well. </p><p>Perils of a privileged life, I reasoned. How could they learn the art of decision-making, if their families isolated them from every single bad decision of their lives? </p><p>And, that overconfidence left her weak against some of the simplest ploys a conman could pull. </p><p>I grabbed my sword to pull the shadows tighter around me, making sure I stayed concealed as I traveled through the long corridor filled with the constructs, using the same method I had used during my previous time, yet, just as I passed the halfway stage, I felt a small flicker of magic, a magical tripwire made of fire, in front of me. </p><p>As a master spell crafter, I had to admire the effort that went into the tripwire. Elemental magic had always been challenging to force outside of their nature, and the fire was definitely notorious for that aspect. Using fire as a ward was not impossible, but managing to keep it concealed enough to make it almost invisible certainly was. </p><p>I wasn’t bad at detection, yet, without the Tether enhancing my capabilities with the wards, I would have missed it. </p><p>It was that good. </p><p>I paused for a moment, examining the little magical tripwire, trying to understand where it was connected to. My first instinct was to check the combat constructs that were spread along the corridor, afraid that it was there to trigger them to turn the corridor into a deadly ambush. </p><p>Luckily, that seemed not to be the case. Instead, I tracked the connection toward the end of the corridor, where the office of the Phoenix lay. </p><p>I tried to decide between two options, avoiding the little tripwire, and showing her that I was even better in magic and concealment than she expected, increasing her wariness against me while also simultaneously increasing my perceived value. </p><p>Yet, after a brief consideration, I walked like I hadn’t noticed it, choosing to trigger it. I was tense as I did so, grabbing my magical shield in case it would trigger a deadly assault — as there was no harm in being on the safe side. Luckily, that seemed not to be the case, and other than a simple flare that I would have missed if I hadn’t been looking for it intentionally, there was no reaction. </p><p>I stood in front of the study, where I had met with her the last time, and knocked on the door rather than trying to sneak in. Since she was already aware of my presence and playing dumb, a fake show of respect didn’t make me lose anything. </p><p>On the contrary, it highlighted the fake limits of my capabilities. </p><p>“Come in,” called a familiar voice. </p><p> I opened the door, only to meet with the perfect stature of the phoenix once more. “Good evening,” I said with a slight bow — just enough to accept her superiority without reaching an absurd level of subservience, which needed to be avoided considering the fake identity I had displayed against him. It was the same reason I avoided any kind of honorific. </p><p>A king might be subservient, but never to the point of being mistaken for a servant. </p><p>“Why are you here?” she asked, equally abrupt. If it wasn’t for the wildness of her magic, swelling threateningly, I might have assumed that she was actually angry, but ironically, the immensity of her magic was enough to reveal the truth of her attitude. </p><p>A bluff. If she wanted to attack, she would have done it when I was in the corridor, with my mobility impaired even more. </p><p>I paused for a moment even I made a show of staggering backward, pushing the shadow of a well-hidden fear on my face. She clearly wanted to give the message that she was the superior one without a doubt, and I let her succeed in that message. </p><p>As I made a show of staggering backward, I examined her looks. I stopped for a second to enjoy her perfect face, flawless flaming hair, and her wings, burning even brighter than her hair. </p><p>An impressive sight, certainly, but not as immediately impressive as her dress, a silver low-cut one that displayed an amazing cleavage, yet I noticed the texture of the dress moving, suggesting it wasn’t just the color that looked silver, but it was some kind of liquid metal. </p><p>Which posited another interesting detail, that she was displaying her cleavage intentionally despite knowing I was coming to visit. </p><p>Maybe I wasn’t the only one that intended to use subtle tricks for subversion. </p><p>“I’m here to report about Eternal Core,” I said after taking a deep breath, acting like her magical flare scared me. </p><p>The mention of the treasure that she had been looking for was enough to break her forced disinterest. “Sit down, and explain,” she ordered as she pointed at a chair, her tense voice showing the great importance she had attributed to the item. </p><p>I did my best to keep my frown concealed, still unable to believe that an artifact I picked more as curiosity was slowly turning into the center of a great hurricane that threatened to devour both the Empire and the Dark Lands together. “Let me give you a breakdown…” I started as I sat down on the chair. </p><p>I started explaining the political situation in extremely great detail, enjoying the flicker of impatience on her beautiful face as she listened. She clearly didn’t enjoy listening to a detailed report. </p><p>So, I did the simplest thing I could do, and extended the report, even more, letting her frustration build up even more. </p><p>Of course, if it had been possible, I would have loved to work on seducing her directly, but unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. Her attitude made it clear that she had treated me as inferior to her. And that emotion was the most difficult thing to convert to seduction. </p><p>Even hatred was easier to convert to romance than dismissal. </p><p>I extended my explanation, because I wanted to replace her impression with boredom. Hardly a great emotion, but at least a better thing for her to focus on. </p><p>Especially since she had no choice but to listen to get an accurate understanding of the situation. </p><p>As she listened, she waved her hand, and a bottle of wine came flying and poured itself into a glass, the wine radiating with an impressive amount of magic, more than I had seen in high-grade healing potions, highlighting the great fortune she could access. </p><p>Like the two intimidating hulking magical armors behind her weren’t enough to show that detail. </p><p>She took a large sip off her glass as she listened to my explanation, her attention slipping away despite her best effort to keep it. </p><p>Yet, despite the great view, after several minutes, I was starting to feel the stirrings of boredom as well. After all, creating a useful yet dry report was even more boring than listening to one. </p><p>I decided to use the opportunity for a little mischievous trick. I carefully expanded a little string of magic, and touched her dress. For a moment, I did nothing, just continuing my explanation as I did my best to hide my tenseness. </p><p>Yet, she showed no reaction. </p><p>Interesting, I thought with satisfaction as I pulled that connection softly, giving me momentary control over her dress and widening the already impressive cleavage of her dress even more. </p><p>Her other magical achievements showed that she had the sufficient magical capability to catch it. Even the boredom wouldn’t be enough to make her ignore that unless she had written me off as a threat. </p><p>Apparently, ‘being caught’ by her little trap was enough for her to finalize a decision about my abilities, enough to completely dismiss her alertness. </p><p>What an interesting choice, I thought as I glimpsed into her beautiful cleavage. </p><p>Under different circumstances, being underestimated this badly might have annoyed me, but facing my current opponent, I would take any advantage I could find. </p><p>I just needed to decide the best way of turning that into an advantage.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I wished that I could say that I collapsed in satisfaction as the last enemy had fallen, enjoying the chance to take a breather after a difficult battle — one that, arguably, was the most difficult one I had ever experienced. </p><p>Unfortunately, resting after such a challenging battle was not in the cards that had been dealt by the fate, as I could not only feel the pain of the transformation filling my body, triggering my pain, but also, I could feel the feeling of the scales slowly creeping up to my neck. </p><p>“Quick,” my ally gasped. “Go and grab the resonating dragon heart,” she ordered as she pointed toward the center of the room, where the largest piece of dragon heart sat, crackling with lightning. “The resonance is getting stronger, we need to break the connection.” </p><p>Saying that, she started moving, not even bothering to wait for me to react. That proved smart, as the moment I took a step, I moved much faster than I expected.</p><p>Much faster than my body had been capable of just a moment ago, showing the transformation was getting even worse. Worse not in terms of impact, as it was hard to argue with the incredible physical improvement my body was experiencing, allowing me to cut through enemies that were supposed to demolish me without my full magic. </p><p>Yet, my magic was hampered by the same transformation. </p><p>Even worse, that wasn’t even the worst thing. I could feel unfamiliar instincts growing in my heart, wild and aggressive, the kind that clearly didn’t and shouldn’t belong to a human, forcing me to act. </p><p>I bit my lips as I passed my ally, biting my lips to suppress a more carnal aspect of my new instincts, which was a supremely difficult challenge. Luckily, my mind was still more supreme, and I arrived in front of the dragon heart without a crisis. </p><p>I stood in front of it as it crackled with lightning, trying to suppress the sudden twinge of hesitation. Even with my elemental specialization, lightning was a scary element.</p><p>Grabbing a dragon heart crackling with an incredible amount of lightning made it much scarier. </p><p>“It’s not as scary as turning into a monster,” I murmured as I took a deep breath, trying to gather the necessary courage. </p><p>I still needed the voice of my ally. “Quick, before it goes out of control.” </p><p>A lightning orb was scary, but not as scary as an out-of-control explosion powered by such a huge piece of dragon heart. I tensed as grabbed the dragon's heart in my claws. The moment my scaly fingers touched it, the lightning bolts on its surface intensified, covering my body, activating every single nerve ending in my body at the same time. </p><p>And with that, came pain.  </p><p>It was intense, like I had been just dipped in molten lead. The pain blanketed my mind, worse than anything I had ever experienced, with the notable exception of the first time I had swallowed the first dragon heart. And, even that was a difficult comparison. </p><p>Yet, that didn’t mean I couldn’t feel anything else. I could feel the skin of my legs crawling with the familiar sensation. The scales were spreading even faster, both down my body and up my neck. More importantly, I could feel the scales getting thicker.  </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t feel angry at that development, because as the scales spread, the pain was becoming somewhat manageable. </p><p>“What are you doing!” my ally shouted. “Suppress the lightning, I can’t touch you like that. We need to suppress the transformation before you turn into a wild beast and die!” </p><p>Of course, what an excellent idea! How could I not imagine such a simple solution? </p><p>Unfortunately, with the pain, I didn’t have the luxury of wasting my breath on sarcasm. “Do—“ I managed to gasp between my clenched teeth as the sudden explosion of pain started to get more manageable. I managed to stay conscious, but only barely as the one that was buried in my chest started to throb as well, flooding my body with its power, giving me the strength to resist the overwhelming dominance of the other one. “Do I look like I’m in control?” I managed to gasp. “My magic is going wild.” </p><p>“But that’s impossible,” I heard her gasp behind me. “Because that means that their resonance already reached the point of active radiance. It’s impossible for you to stay alive when they are resonating with active radiance.”</p><p>“Sorry for the convenience of being alive,” I said, unable to suppress the temptation of sarcasm even as I struggled to suppress my magic. As I spoke, my own voice hit unfamiliarly to my ears, with my lips giving a scaly feeling. </p><p>I breathed hard as I tried to loosen my grip around the dragon heart, but that didn’t seem to be working because my scaly fingers refused to listen to my order, holding tight against the crystal. </p><p>Even my tongue felt foreign in my mouth. </p><p>I closed my eyes tightly as the sensation spread onto my face even more. And when I opened back, everything was different. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was the colors, but it was not limited to that. The colors, the shapes, everything. No, I corrected myself as I felt a sensation crawling in my temples. It wasn’t the room that changed, but my eyes, making me see the world differently. Even my nose — the only part of my body that I could see by looking down — was different, smaller, with scales covering its surface. </p><p>Yet, the transformation of my body was nothing compared to the way my core was reacting. It was throbbing with all the intensity of a furnace, sending its own lightning bolts outside. For a moment, I had thought that they were battling, feeling the chill of Pluto, mixed into the fires of Mercury. </p><p>After all, as the earlier battle had shown, dragon hearts were not equal, and the one that in my hands was radiated magic that easily eclipsed the one that was responsible for my transformation, and it did so by a significant margin. </p><p>With my magic out of control, I didn’t even have the chance to resist, watching it helplessly. With my skin — scales — still crackling with lightning, even help from my ally was not an option. She couldn’t put her hand without being shocked herself. </p><p>To her credit, she tried. She cast several spells without touching me, but this time, the ability of lightning to destroy magic worked against me, easily demolishing the delicate structure of her healing spells. </p><p>Yet, soon, I noticed something wrong. I wasn’t getting weaker but stronger. Feeling shocked, I opened my gaze and looked down, only to notice the crystal I was holding in my hand was getting smaller. I closed my eyes and focused on my core, only to notice another shocking thing. </p><p>It was getting bigger, stronger, pumping my body with more and more mana in the process. </p><p>Too late I realized that the lightning that was escaping my core was not battling against the energy of the one that I was holding in my hand, but guiding its streams. </p><p>As the crystal holding in my hand got smaller, the process of absorption quickened, and soon, my hands were completely empty once more. </p><p>My ally stammered as she looked at me in shock, murmuring something in her native language. Yet, I had a feeling about her question. </p><p>“I have no idea how I’m still alive as well, sweetie. No idea at all…” I murmured as I shuffled, only to notice something behind myself. I turned to look, only to see a surprise. A pair of surprises, to be exact. </p><p>Two big, scaly wings, sprouting out from my back…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, I think that’s enough for today,” I offered as I looked outside the window, only to see a certain unwelcome blue hue, signaling the morning while also telling me that, for the second day in a row, I had completely skipped sleep. Though I didn’t need the sun to tell me that, because the dullness of my mind and the exhaustion on my body informed me of that.  </p><p>“He says that’s enough, you monster,” Carter answered, though his smile was more honest than his words. “It took me three months to learn all the stuff you have memorized in a night! If you continue to learn like that, you’ll steal my job even if I try to block you.” </p><p>“It’s not that complicated compared to all those chess openings,” I countered, more than happy to blame chess for my abnormal capabilities. It wasn’t even completely wrong, as it gave me the discipline to aggressively memorize the various player formations and tactics with great attention to detail. </p><p>Yet, without the benefits of the System, I could not have a hope of memorizing a tenth of all the plays I had committed to my memory. Traits didn’t improve my memory noticeably, but the amazing combination of Strategy, Tactics, and Pattern recognition allowed me to break down the tactical roots of most of the formations relatively easily. It was like learning to do the sums with five-digit numbers as a child, intimidating to anyone that didn’t understand the logic, yet trivial once the trick was discovered. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t the perfect analogy, as, even with the assistance of the Traits, football was hardly the simplest sport to analyze, but it certainly held true up to a level.  </p><p>“It’s not complicated, he says,” Carter murmured even as he slapped my shoulder, which stung hard enough to dispel my sleep. “That’s more than enough studying for today, and we only have ten minutes before the training starts. Try to do your best. Coach definitely hates quitters. If you can impress the coach in the morning, we might even have a chance of getting a few minutes of play time toward the garbage time.” </p><p>“So, you’re confident that our offense will play good enough to make the last quarter unnecessary,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“Yeah,” he answered, unable to keep his laugh down. “If they start giving points for interceptions, we’ll definitely win overwhelmingly.” </p><p>“Good point, pick-sixes should count for us, after all, it’s our quarterbacks that’s throwing them.” </p><p>“Certainly—“ he started, only to stop, because we found ourselves face to face with several offensive players taking the same corridor, including the very familiar face Kevin. And, considering we were not bothering to keep our voice down as we joked around the expected performance. “We were just talking about the amazing performance you’re expected to deliver,” Carter said. </p><p>“I heard,” Kevin said, first to answer. He wasn’t the only angry player, but he was certainly the angriest. Understandable, considering a great number of explicit scenes with me and his ex currently filling the web. And considering the previous narrative, delivered by his current girlfriend, was Megan was frigid, it was certainly not helping his general manliness reputation. “However, do you think that a garbage that’s only fit for practice squad could play in a real game?” </p><p>I recognized the glint in his eyes. It was the anger of a man who needed the slightest excuse to start swinging. </p><p>Too bad for him I had no intention of giving him the excuse he was seeing. Not because I didn’t want to opportunity to swing a few times. It wasn’t even the current disadvantage in numbers that kept me back. It wouldn’t be the first fight I had to deal with such a disparity. Yet, I wasn’t stupid enough to throw the first punch in a corridor filled with security cameras. </p><p>Making him throw that punch, however, was much more interesting, especially since I still missed my rust bucket. </p><p>“He’s right, you know,” I said to Carter, making sure to sound casual, making everyone look at me in shock, though only Carter had a calculating glint on his gaze. After a long evening filled with endless studying, it wasn’t surprising for him to get a sense of my personality, just like I generated a sense for his, enough to guess that I wouldn’t retreat that easily. </p><p>“Coward,” one of the other players murmured dismissively, not even bothering to keep his voice low. </p><p>“It’s very difficult to get a defensive starter position,” I murmured. “Maybe I should try out for the offensive team instead. At worst, I should be able to get the backup quarterback position.” Then, my smirk widened as I turned to Kevin. “It certainly wouldn’t be the first thing I took from you, right?” I said. </p><p>The anger flashed in his gaze. “I’ll kill you,” he growled as he threw himself forward, but one of his offensive teammates proved too smart, and grabbed his arm before the punch could connect. I didn’t even bother raising my arm to defend. I noted that Carter took a slight step to the side, to ensure he wasn’t in the line of fire. </p><p>It didn’t surprise me. With the draft just a couple months away, he certainly didn’t have the luxury of receiving disciplinary action. </p><p>Still, it was a good reminder that teammates didn’t necessarily have my back under all circumstances. Carter was not in a position he would sacrifice anything for me. </p><p>“Oh, I’m shaking in fear,” I murmured in a deadpan tone before I turned to Carter. “Shall we go, we don’t want to be late for the meeting.” </p><p>“Don’t go anywhere, you coward,” Kevin shouted angrily, but that was all he could do with his teammates holding him, whispering to him to calm down. I didn’t react to his declarations, treating his anger like a childish tantrum. </p><p>“That was dangerous,” Carter commented, though only after we were reasonably far away from them. “Kevin has a strong family, it’s not a good idea to antagonize him that much for a girl.” </p><p>I shrugged. “He started it, and it’s not like I can give him what he wants. He’s going to be angry even if I dumped Megan and apologized publicly. And since he’s going to be an enemy, I prefer an angry one to a calm one.” </p><p>Carter nodded, yet changed the question soon after. “During the training, be as serious as possible. Some fucks around during the training and assume the coach doesn’t see them, then get surprised when they find themselves sitting on the sidelines for the whole match.” </p><p>“Noted,” I said. Although that was my plan, confirmation was certainly welcome. </p><p>“And after training, skip the classes to go back to your room. Arrange for some extra food, sleep, and maybe even get a session with the team masseuses. It won’t help you to give a nice show in the morning training, only to fall off a cliff during the evening training. Today is your first proper day, and we need to impress the coach to even have a chance for you to play during the garbage time.” </p><p>“Sure, I’ll make sure I rested properly,” I said, carefully not mentioning that I had neither the intention nor the luxury of sleeping for so long. I had a lot of things to do. </p><p>I need to continue working on my program to catch the news, for example, which was not a simple thing to achieve. It would probably require days, maybe even weeks, of dedicated work to turn it into halfway usable. </p><p>And more importantly, that wasn’t even the only — or the most urgent — computer task I needed to complete. I needed to visit the museum to see the little keylogger I had installed during my previous trip and had managed to get any administrative credentials necessary for me to complete my little hacking adventure. </p><p>Improving my traits was certainly nice, but not at the cost of completely ignoring the clues about the forced mystery I found myself dealing with, or erasing the tracks the others could use to find Sunset College. </p><p>Maybe that wouldn’t be enough, but there was no harm in risking that. </p><p>With that, we fell silent as we walked quickly to the locker room. The training was about to start, and we certainly didn’t want to be late. </p><p>Coach Bill didn’t seem like a guy that would appreciate his players being late. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The tactical meeting lasted for three hours, and as the clock ticked, I started to understand the reason for the intensity of the player. Coach Bill bombarded us with facts about the team that we were going to play, from player performance to detailed advanced analytics, enough that, toward the end of the meeting, most of the players looked about to collapse. </p><p>Yet, none of them slipped up, as whenever one looked like he was about to slip, a question came from Coach Bill, punishing without a miss. </p><p>Then, just as the meeting was about to end, it was my turn. </p><p>“Now, let’s see how our newest player will fare, will he stay here for the rest of the night, or will he earn a quick reprieve,” the coach said, his expression showing a ghost of a smile as he raised the remote once more, and a scheme appeared on the screen. “Bonus points if you can guess the offensive scheme they were trying to defend against, but you’ll lose points for every mistake.”</p><p>I expected another drawn scheme like the other players had received, but instead, he revealed an actual recording of the game. It was an important distinction, because it made it much more difficult to analyze. For a moment, I thought the coach was targeting me specifically, but I noticed the rest of the team looking at me in anticipation, their smirks wide. </p><p>A hazing ritual, I realized, one that was for the benefit of the team. The coach was both too experienced and too methodical to truly enjoy such a thing, but it was impossible to deny that such experience helped team cohesion. </p><p>Not to mention, it was a good way to test the mettle of a new player, to see how a new player operated under stress. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I examined the screen carefully, preparing to answer. I always had a tactical approach to the game, and while my lack of studying during the last two years hurt me a bit, those mysterious Traits were more than enough as compensation. </p><p>Especially with the most recent upgrade, allowing me to catch small details even better, which allowed me to catch the subtle details, realizing he had started with a trick play. “Cover 2 defense, disguised as a blitz,” I answered. </p><p>“Oh, really,” the coach answered in his same monotonous tone, but unable to hide the spark of interest. Meanwhile, the rest of the group fell silent. “Are you sure?” </p><p>“Yes,” I answered, not letting his sharp gaze force me to second-guess myself. “The safeties are too far behind for it to be an actual Blitz, leaving a gap for the receivers to exploit around the fifteen-yard range. But if they pull back even further to cover the backfield, the linebackers will retreat and defend between the numbers, confusing the quarterback before he could pass, maybe even get an interception.” </p><p>“Not bad,” the coach answered as he pressed a button, and another scene appeared. “How about this?” </p><p>“Man-coverage, trying to shut out a passing game, baiting them for a run,” I answered just as quick as I identified the small details of alignment, in particular, the middle linebacker standing too close to the defensive line, ready to attack the running back. This time, the coach didn’t ask a follow-up question, and moved to the third scene, then the fourth, fifth… </p><p>Nice, I thought even as I answered yet another question. Apparently, Tactics and Strategy Traits were even more useful for football than I had assumed, especially with Pattern Recognition supporting me, a glance enough to allow me to catch the subtle differences hidden in the player’s positions, the way they leaned, their footwork, even the direction they were looking. </p><p>It wasn’t something that just come from the System, of course. My performance was only possible thanks to the years I had spent learning those football tactics, and trying to get a college recruitment quota. I had even made the occasional mistake, but I didn’t let it bother me since they mostly stemmed from me not recognizing the players, and making assumptions about their strengths — which did not always succeed. </p><p>Yet, as the training continued, those mistakes lessened, because whenever I made a mistake, the coach played the full show, allowing me to fix my assumptions, with a speed that was only possible due to the glorious assistance of the Pattern Recognition. </p><p>“That’s enough,” the coach finally called. </p><p>The room was completely silent, except for Thad, who was chuckling in amusement. “Maybe we should recruit more from the chess team,” he suggested, which earned a chuckle from the rest of the group. </p><p>“Drop by my office after the meeting is over,” he ordered, which put a damper on my plans after the training, but I doubted it was a punishment. “You can go move to position rooms, to study with the position coaches,” he ordered, before leaving. </p><p>I stood up, ready to follow Carter and the rest of the linebackers, though I had noticed more than one player looking at me with a surprised expression, though I noted more than one looking at me in dissatisfaction. </p><p>Maybe I over-performed just a little bit. </p><p>Still, I didn’t show much care. Not like I was going to change my mind just because of a few assholes changing the topic. </p><p>Interestingly, I had seen Carter sending a sharp glare to one that looked the most restless about my performance, showing his ability as the captain. The walk to our assigned room was silent. The rest of the students walked inside, but before I could step in, Carter gestured for me to stay. </p><p>“How can I help you, captain,” I asked, doing my best not to sound snarky even by accident. I had already alienated the offense, and more than one player in defense clearly didn’t appreciate behind shown off by a complete newbie. </p><p>“I want to talk to you about your performance,” he said. </p><p>“Sure, what about?” I asked, but looking at his serious expression, I expected him to tone down my displays of tactical competence in order to not to hurt the apple cart too much. An understandable concern, but one I had no intention of actually following, because I had more important concerns that maintaining team mood. A happy team wouldn’t give me magical powers. </p><p>Playing in games would. </p><p>“How quickly do you think you can learn the full playbook to play the mike?” he asked. </p><p>“I don’t think—“ I started before freezing. “Beg your pardon,” I corrected. “I must have misheard you, do you mind repeating?” </p><p>The slightest smile appeared on his serious expression before it melted back to his stony expression. “No, you didn’t mishear me. I asked you just how quickly you can play mike?” </p><p>I paused, trying to process the enormity of his request. The position of mike was not a simple thing. For all intents and purposes, it was the Quarterback of defense, responsible for calling the last-minute adjustments when the offense changed their schemes, not to mention identifying and alerting the team to the last-minute tricks, like a run game disguised as a passing game. </p><p>“I’m guessing you’re asking about the next year?” I suggested, but it was more to probe him rather than an actual question. If his intention was about the next year, he wouldn’t have mentioned it on the first day. </p><p>“You look smart enough to know the answer to that question,” he answered, equally calmly. </p><p>“Why, then?” I asked. </p><p>Carter took a deep breath. “In your opinion, what’s the chances of a black linebacker from a small college to be drafted as a mike for a professional team, even as the last round draft?” he asked. </p><p>I didn’t bother answering the question, as it was rather obvious. While the racism situation had improved significantly compared to the past, where the black players simply weren’t allowed to play quarterback or mike — so-called thinking positions — it was hard to deny a bias still existed. Combined with the stigma of playing for a small college, it was obvious. </p><p>Of course, as an orphan, I was aware of that kind of bias, having experienced quite a bit of myself. </p><p>“Good,” he said as he noticed my serious expression. “I had some discussions with a couple of scouts, and they are worried about my ability to take orders and cede authority,” he said. “If I had another mike to take the role properly, I will focus on impressing them more directly.” </p><p>“And you need a rookie for that?” </p><p>“Unfortunately, yes,” he said. “Unfortunately, we’re not exactly filled with fresh talents thanks to our losing streak,” he said, not bothering to hide his anger. Understandable, as no one was particularly enthusiastic about recruiting from a losing team, no matter how impressive the defense performed in isolation. </p><p>“And it wouldn’t be exactly a showing if you change position and the team starts performing worse, even if you get better personal stats,” I filled his thinking. </p><p>“Exactly, a story about my supposed selfishness would hardly help my chances in the draft,” he said. It wouldn’t be fair for him to suffer for that, but unfortunately, life was hardly fair. </p><p>“I see,” I answered as I started thinking. “And you decided I’m the better option.” </p><p>“Don’t act like that show you have put on was not intentional. You clearly put your hat on the table for my job. And even if you don’t get it this year, you’re certain to get it the next one. I’m just proposing to hasten the process. You’re a natural when it comes to reading the play and adjusting tactics. You’re still worse than me, but that’s only because you don’t know the playbook. Once you catch up…” </p><p>I nodded, happy to coordinate with someone that shares a similar approach. If Carter had been treating the college performance as the ultimate target, we would have been having a much different discussion. Yet, he was clearly aware that, with all the glory that implied, it was still a giant pageant set up to impress the professional teams. </p><p>I didn’t ask whether he was serious or not. He clearly was, and his needs were clearly reasonable. More importantly, it fitted perfectly with my needs. There was no point to reject it. “How much time you’re willing to spend helping me?” I asked. </p><p>“If you can show enough improvement to prove the meeting was not just a fluke, as much as you need,” he answered. “As long as I get enough sleep after the training, I can put all my free time helping you.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. Even with all the assistance of the System, someone help me with details of the playbook would help. Especially if that someone was the player that knew the playbook the most. “And do you think you can convince the coach to play me?” I asked. </p><p>That earned a chuckle. “That would not be necessary. You underestimate Coach Bill. There’s no hierarchy about who plays and who doesn’t. The one that performs best in the practice gets the starting position. Why else do you think you were getting all those angry glares.” </p><p>“Nice to know,” I answered. </p><p>Then, Carter put his hand on my shoulder, squeezing hard. “Let me be clear, it’s not a simple commitment I’m asking you. You can think for a while before making a decision, but if you change your decision halfway…” </p><p>He didn’t finish his sentence, nor that he needed to. There were simply too many ways for the team captain to make my life miserable. </p><p>Not that it made me worried. Compared with invisible angels and mysterious magical evils, the mundane threats didn’t carry much weight.   </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m not stupid enough to waste such an opportunity,” I said. Carter just nodded, and we started walking toward the meeting room.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The roar of a dragon was famed to be legendary, impressive enough that, even with their extreme rarity in the System space, the stories about their roars persisted, becoming the material that would be discussed around the campsites. </p><p>Yet, as Janelor’s voice exploded, it wasn’t the stirrings of fear I felt, but a beautiful tingling that reinforced my arousal. Admittedly, that might be about the fact that her beautiful cry was not let out to convey her fury and willingness to slaughter like those legends of old, but a vessel for her explosion of pleasure, underlined with just the correct amount of pain and pleasure. </p><p>Not to mention shock, guaranteeing that I was the lucky winner of a special privilege. </p><p>As her delicious cries rang in the room, I pushed forward, my shaft disappearing inside her tight hole inch by inch, a process that she had managed to accept with a shocking smoothness, suggesting that her draconic endurance was certainly not only useful for battle. </p><p>Not too different from her cries. </p><p>I paused when my slow and steady push brought me halfway inside her, my girth slowly stretching her tightness even motionless. Her cries stopped after a second, then a weird silence filled the room. “W-what happened?” she asked in a tense voice, her curiousness battling with her determination to act aloof to maintain her pride — or at least, an illusion of a pride. </p><p>“I wanted to check if you were having any trouble, of course,” I said. “If you want to say that you can’t handle it, it’s the opportunity to do so.” </p><p>Her answer was predictable. “W-who can’t handle it!” she stammered, the hitch in her tone showing her wounded pride. “I’m a dragon, and this is nothing!” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I put my hands on her delicious bottom, enjoying her flawless skin. “Then, we can start for real.” </p><p>I could sense her body tightening at the mention, realizing that my earlier words had goaded her intentionally, but it was too late. The same pride that forced her to give her challenging answer prevented her from changing her mind. </p><p>I could feel her body tightening as she prepared to resist to temptation to cry, trying to defend a scrap of her pride. </p><p>Yet, the same pride fell apart by failing to keep her silent as I pulled back quickly, the sensation it created enough to break all the determination she was able to accumulate under the circumstances. </p><p>Though, that cry was nothing compared to the one that followed as I used one hand to grab her beautiful emerald hair, pulling it back harshly to prepare her body for invasion, the other landing on her ass loudly the moment I pushed forward, earning a delicious cry in the process. </p><p>“Excellent work, mistress,” I whispered, my voice inevitably throaty as I pushed deep into her tightness, the pleasure radiating enough to challenge my supernatural ability to keep myself restricted as I started to impale her repeatedly. </p><p>Though, my reaction was nothing compared to my ‘mistress’, each push making her cries louder, even the limited sense of restraint she managed to maintain evaporating, leaving only a primal mixture of pain and pleasure for her. </p><p>In other words, a perfect time to interrogate her for some potentially-sensitive information. </p><p>“I was feeling curious about something, mistress?” I said, under the circumstances, not really bothering to put any emphasis on the word ‘mistress’ to make it ridiculous. The situation was more than enough to put that emphasis. </p><p>“R-right now?” she managed to stammer between her moans. </p><p>“Well, I thought you can easily handle it under the circumstances. But, if you’re feeling that you can’t handle it—“ I teased, only to be interrupted. </p><p>“Of cour—, of course I can handle it,” she said, trying to sound confident, though the loud moan in between went a long way to destroy the convincing nature of her words. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “I was curious about the lands outside the system, particularly how to travel there.” </p><p>“Of — of course, if you want to — commit suicide painfully,” she stammered, managing to sound mocking. Considering that she managed to achieve that effect while being rammed in her tight hole repeatedly, moans interrupting her every few words, it was impressive. </p><p>“Really, then how did you manage to arrive here if it was that dangerous?” I asked, not neglecting to spank her ass for her sudden arrogance. Just because I was amused by her reaction didn’t mean I wanted to avoid training her. </p><p>“Because I’m a dragon,” she said proudly, even trying to push her chest out proudly, though that hardly had the effect she was hoping for under the circumstances. I continued to ram into her, each push creating a more beautiful explosion of cries. </p><p>“And it’s relevant, how?” I asked. </p><p>“P-primordial aether,” she managed to answer. “We have the ability to resist — the corrosion of it much better than ordinary creatures,” she said. </p><p>“How interesting,” I said as I slapped her ass, not expecting to earn such an easy resolution to my suspicions that resulted from her success of arriving in the system space, and the Headmistress’ explanation about the near-impossibility of travel between different planes. </p><p>Maybe my secretive angel started to trust me more than I was expecting. </p><p>“Is this the reason you’re working for —“ I started, only to receive a growl to interrupt me. “Sorry, you’re allied with a goddess.” </p><p>“One of the reasons,” she answered, her tone more steadily as she managed to get used to my steady invasion. “Our ease to travel between planes is hardly the only advantage of our superior heritage. We rule every dimension,” she said, then made a dismissive gesture. “At least, ones that are not invaded by pathetic cheating abominations.” </p><p>I was tempted to say that she was currently being rammed repeatedly by one of those ‘pathetic cheaters’ but considering my own ambivalent feelings about the System, I let that insult slide. </p><p>Instead, I focused on the implications of the ability she revealed, about her ability to travel between planes. “So, can you bring someone else along when you travel between dimensions?” </p><p>“I’m not a pack horse,” she answered instantly, her voice sharp. Too sharp, with a sense of vulnerability underneath, which was even more reliable than a direct answer, admitting that she couldn’t. </p><p>And, considering the amount of sharpness it carried, I was willing to believe that her inability to help others travel between planes was a personal failing and not something that all dragons experienced. Her pride was too easy to read. </p><p>How interesting. </p><p>Still, even that gave me a lot of ideas about ultimately traveling to other planes and saving Aviada from the predicament she found herself in. Especially since it was Janelor’s personal failing to assist others to travel. </p><p>It meant she could be helped to overcome that particular failing. </p><p>But, that was a challenge for another day, when I had managed to learn more about the different planes — and more importantly, how could I use my abilities without the automatic instincts forced by the System. </p><p>And the current moment was a good method to test that as well. I used my mana to block the assistance of the Tantric skill, to see if I could easily copy that trick. </p><p>After blocking, I gathered a minuscule amount of mana, expecting a great challenge of manipulating that. </p><p>[-5 Mana]</p><p>Yet, surprisingly, I managed to coat my shaft with that easily, though that minuscule amount was beneath the notice of my dragon lover, who had been spoiled by much bigger rewards of mana. Interesting, I thought as I blocked Tantric completely as I repeated the earlier trick twice more. </p><p>[-94 Mana]</p><p>[-492 Mana]</p><p>Yet, despite repeating it with much higher amounts of mana, I managed to complete them with great ease, while earning moans of joy from Janelor, ones that were getting shockingly delirious, the combined effect of my mana and my ceaseless impaling pushing her dangerously close to the cliff of pleasure.  </p><p>Under more ordinary circumstances, that display would have stolen my attention, making me watch with a smirk of satisfaction on my face, but under the circumstances, I had other things to focus on. Such as, the performance of my skill.  </p><p>Maybe I was doing something wrong while blocking the skills while under the coverage of the headmistress’ wards, I decided, and applied the same thing to my Arcana abilities, and cast a weak yet complicated light spell.</p><p>[-4 Mana]</p><p>Under that spell, what needed to appear was the five circles of colorful light dancing around each other, barely more than a cantrip, but instead, a flash of light exploded in an uncontrolled burst of light. </p><p>“What the hell?” I murmured, absentmindedly glad that Janelor was too far gone to care about the flash of light or my confusing whisper, as I certainly wouldn’t want to distract myself by explaining that to her. </p><p>Blocking certainly worked. I tried to block Tantric off the System again, and used my mana to coat my shaft. </p><p>[-793 Mana]</p><p>Yet, I once again succeeded without the slightest problem, annoyed by my own success. I released the block from the System and repeated the trick. </p><p>[-839 Mana] </p><p>Naturally, I succeeded again, but that success increased my frown even more, because that success was supposed to be considerably easier with my ability to access Tantric skill. Yet, it wasn’t. </p><p>It was just as easy, no more no less. </p><p>The repeated mana assistance triggered Janelor’s climax, her tightness gripping my girth, even more, triggering a climax of my own. </p><p>Yet, even the delicious explosion of pleasure was not enough to erase the frown off my face. </p><p>Something was wrong with my Tantric skill…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 6790 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>A groan escaped my mouth as the tight throat of my tiny dragoness enveloped my girth, the passionate bobbing of her head, well-earned after all the effort I spent preparing her amazingly delicious and mana-filled breakfast. </p><p>Then, I pulled back, giving her a breather. “D-delicious,” she murmured as she took a deep breath, but her tongue was quick to jump out, giving a lick to the side of my shaft, getting the remains of the chocolate from the side while triggering a shiver for me.</p><p>Simply spectacular.  </p><p>I smiled as I look down, no less hungry, though unlike her, it was less about the deliciousness of the food, and more about how tasty she looked with her lips stained with chocolate and cream, the black and white creating an interesting contrast with her bright emerald hair and even brighter emerald eyes. </p><p>I didn’t know whether the heaven existed — the existence of a sexy angel withstanding — but even if it did, I doubted that it would be superior to the current moment I was enjoying. </p><p>While my thoughts slipped toward the cosmology of the universe, she assaulted my erection once more, but not before grabbing the bowl of chocolate and coating my length with the black liquid once more, and started licking again. As her tongue moved, the chocolate quickly dwindled. </p><p>I expected her to pull back for another refill, yet she didn’t do so, which told me that, at this point, it was just an excuse for her. </p><p>I just watched passively as Janelor’s tongue danced around my length whenever she took a breather, even after the food that covered my length long disappeared, her stained lips looking excellent whenever she took a more aggressive stance in bobbing. And the angle was making the scene even more beautiful, especially when her breasts pushed against my thighs, changing their beautiful shape for a fleeting moment. </p><p>A moan of satisfaction arrived, knocking on the door, and I let it go, giving her an audio clue that her treatment was working excellently, curious whether it would make her more passionate, or reawaken her arrogance. I wanted to believe that the first was the case… </p><p>Yet, she pulled back, an arrogant smirk on her face as she looked up, confirming that she chose the second path. </p><p>Confirming that fucking the arrogance out of a dragoness was not as simple as I wanted to assume. </p><p>Luckily, I hardly had the intention of stopping my attempts. “You missed a spot, let me help,” I said as I grabbed her head. </p><p>“Wait—“ she tried to say, but that was all she was able to manage before I pushed my shaft into her beautiful throat. A sharp sound escaped her mouth, between a moan of pleasure and a cry of distress. </p><p>Despite its mixed nature, it was exquisite. </p><p>I moaned in satisfaction once again, this time even louder, but with her head locked by my hands, she didn’t have the luxury of escaping unless she wanted to change forms, and that was only viable if she wanted to stop completely. Yet, her muffled gags and moans suggested that escaping was not a thought that occupied her mind. </p><p>Happy with her performance, I continued to push her deeper, doing using her to bring myself closer to a climax. And, with her puffed cheeks and excited eyes, she was clearly happy with my assistance with her task.</p><p>“You have a beautiful throat, your dragoness,” I murmured, unable to hold back a compliment as I pushed her even deeper, but this time, a momentary change. The next second, I pulled my hips back and pushed her on the bed. “But, you have finished your mission of cleaning it. Now, it’s time for the real event.” </p><p>She said nothing as she found herself lying on her back, nor that she needed to. The speedy way her legs parted open told everything I needed to know about her mood. “So, do you want to see my impression of a rampaging dragon,” I said as I moved forward. </p><p>“Don’t get too arrogant—“ she started, but that was all she was able to say before I grabbed her hands and pushed her up, tensing her body to push her beautiful breasts even higher before I pushed forward, invading her warmth once more.  The beautiful moan she let out was beautiful, my hands pinning her down making it even easier to handle things. </p><p>“Really?” I said as my hips started to move, invading her phenomenal tightness. She left my comment unanswered, though her moans were an acceptable substitute. Not that those moans surprised me as I sank into her glistening arousal, impaling her aggressively, without a hint of mercy. </p><p>Much faster than I would use against the others — with the notable exception of Oeyne — but my arrogant dragoness clearly needed another lesson about who was the true master despite the amusing fiction I still entertained. </p><p>Her hands grabbed my hair, pulling hard enough to trigger a flash of pain as her fingers tightened around the strands, but that only earned a slap onto her beautiful breasts. </p><p>“How dare you!” she managed to say between her moans. </p><p>“How dare I, what?” I said, acting oblivious as I continued to spank her beautiful breasts with the same merciless rhythm of my hips, the explosion of the multiple sources filling the room beautifully, steadily destroying any hope of her establishing power over me, certainly not through the bedroom — or any other places I might enjoy her beautiful body. </p><p>Not that she had any chance of doing so in the first place with the way she fell into pieces under the rush of pleasure without the slightest hope of resisting. </p><p>With that trait, it didn’t surprise me when she soon started trembling under the merciless assault of the pleasure, signaling a beautiful climax. </p><p>But certainly not her last one. </p><p>“Where are we going?” she murmured a moment later as she recovered from her pleasure, only to realize I had already lifted her in a bridal hold, walking away. </p><p>“To get a better place than the bed to properly start our fun, of course,” I said. </p><p>“But…” she murmured dazedly as she looked in the direction that we were walking. “But there’s nothing there but the dining table.” </p><p>“I know,” I answered even as pushed against the table, her legs barely able to touch the floor as her tits smashed against the cold wood, resulting in a beautiful gasp in the process. “But, considering we were eating on your bed, it’s only fair that we use the dining table instead of a bed,” I explained. </p><p>“But we already did that—“ she started to comment, only for her voice to fade halfway as she felt my shaft pressing against her hole, but not the one I had been invading earlier. </p><p>“Not this one,” I murmured even as I started pushing into her tight hole, only stopping for a moment to flare my mana.</p><p>[-928 Mana] </p><p>Most of the mana was a reward for the pain she was about to go through, but a small portion of it went to create a layer of lubricant, allowing me to slip easily into her beautiful hole. </p><p>And her bubble butt — with a shape and tightness that certainly deserved the term — gripped my shaft with an iron grip, showing just how necessary was the lubrication. </p><p>“You can’t do that! Not there!” she gasped as my shaft invaded her tightness mercilessly. “That’s wrong!” </p><p>“Not particularly wrong,” I said even as I pushed even deeper, leveraging her dragonic endurance to invade her mercilessly, even spanking her beautiful ass in the process, adding another layer to her little pain. “It’s even tighter than your beautiful lips, and as an added bonus, it doubles as an excellent way of teaching an arrogant dragoness her lesson.” </p><p>“You—“ she tried to say, only to be interrupted by a spank. </p><p>“Of course, we can always stop if are too weak to handle it,” I commented as I slowed down, which was all that was needed to silence her. </p><p>Pride was an emotion easy to abuse. </p><p>I continued to push inside her bit by bit as my shaft slowly disappeared inside her. She managed to keep her mouth shut until halfway, even with the occasional spank that landed on her ass, but that proved to be her limit, as her grunts mixed into the sound of my spanks. </p><p>Against someone else, I might have waited for her to get used to it, but against a dragon learning a lesson, mercy was clearly not the greatest idea. I pulled back, but before she could complete her relaxed sigh, I pushed forward, invading her core more aggressively, her pained cry echoing in the room. </p><p>“Slow down,” she gasped. </p><p>“Only if you admit you can’t handle it,” I said, glad that my healing abilities allowed me to walk the line between mildly painful and actually damaging very easily. </p><p>“Of — of course, I can handle,” she answered rapidly, her pride leaving no place for another answer. </p><p>“Good, then,” I said with a smirk, and pushed forward.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sarah was feeling self-conscious at the sudden request, while Naomi busied herself by smirking proudly, too distracted by her momentary victory on her friend to question Sarah’s sudden mood shift. </p><p>Exactly the emotion I wanted her to display, because as Sarah looked at her friend, her hesitancy was being replaced by frustrated anger with a great speed. </p><p>Of course, even with that anger, I had no doubt that, without yesterday’s adventure, she would have retreated in defeat. Yet, after that, she had developed a very skewed sense of what was acceptable and what was scandalous, and her anger worked excellently to blur those already-skewed lines. </p><p>“She deserves a better view,” Sarah said with a sudden passion as she stood up, took a step to the side, and sat down. </p><p>Directly onto my shaft. </p><p>Naomi looked down, surprised but not shocked, though it didn’t take long for me to understand the reason. Sarah kept her legs together, which hid the true nature of her move even as she once again enveloped the crown of my shaft as she slowly lowered herself, a beautiful grunt escaping her mouth. </p><p>“Not bad,” Naomi said, impressed, but not impressed enough to fall silent. </p><p>“Really,” Sarah gasped as she continued to go deeper. Then, she grabbed Naomi’s hair and pulled her close before finally letting her legs widen. “Do you think you can do it as well?” </p><p>“Y-you,” Naomi gasped, her confidence shattering completely as she finally realized how far her friend had gone. </p><p>Sarah’s vindictive smile was beautiful, almost as beautiful as the way she tightened around me as her hips started to rock. Yet, despite making her point, she didn’t let Naomi go away, but actually pulled her even closer. “You wanted to get a better view, right?” she murmured. </p><p>For a nerd, she was incredibly vindictive. </p><p>Naomi squeaked wordlessly once Sarah let her hair go. She tried to stand up even as she frantically tried to cover herself up, as if she just remembered she didn’t have a stitch of clothing on. </p><p>Before she could raise herself, I stopped her by wrapping my arm around her waist. “No need to hurry, sweetie,” I whispered as I leaned toward her, leaving a lingering kiss on her neck, which distracted her enough to make her forget her concerns. </p><p>And even as her shock slowly evaporated, she obeyed. She did so slowly, hesitantly, her gaze bouncing between our faces. Yet, not only did she stay in her seat, but also she lowered her arms, showing her nipples, standing to attention. </p><p>Sarah grunted in displeasure, clearly unhappy with the fact that I was still paying attention to her friend. “Maybe you two—“ she started, but that was all she could manage before I grabbed her hips and pulled her down. </p><p>Her protests died on her lips as she found herself impaled on my rod, her moan spectacular as my shaft tested her limits. Naomi looked at her, startled, only for her gaze to fall on me once she realized the extent of her friend’s success, her widened legs leaving no place to hide her progress. </p><p>“All of it,” Naomi gasped in shock while the object in question was busy scraping Sarah’s insides. </p><p>“You shouldn’t be surprised. Tenacity combined with repeated exercising. It’s the basis of all physical activity, after all.” </p><p>“Repeated exercising,” Naomi murmured vindictively at the mention that it wasn’t the first time. It wasn’t something that was particularly hard to deduce, of course, but mentioning it openly still had a weight of its own. </p><p>Sarah somehow managed to blush when Naomi looked at her with an inscrutable expression, finally feeling the absurdity of pushing her friend too much, but before she could say anything, I tightened my grip around her hips and pulled her once more, her tight hips squirming around the base of my shaft, her lips busy moaning desperately. </p><p> “She’s such a good friend, right?” I asked Naomi even as I started directing her hips. </p><p>“Oh, the best,” Naomi answered, her voice tense, though, amusingly, all her anger directed at her friend, leaving me free to enjoy the fruits of their little argument, just like the night before. “She’s doing her best to show there’s nothing to be afraid about taking that final step even though it’s a competition. Such a good friend.” </p><p>“No, you can’t!” Sarah gasped between her moans as she heard her friend declaring that she wanted to take a turn after her. </p><p>“Why not?” Naomi answered, trying to sound confident as she pushed her chest out aggressively, though, with her current lack of clothing, it was more erotic than aggressive. “I thought we were competing.” </p><p>Sarah’s expression of realization was beautiful, though as I started pushing her down even more aggressively, she was having trouble answering with the pleasure invading her body. She closed her eyes, and I loosened my grip, assuming she was preparing for a climax. </p><p>Yet, she surprised me by standing up suddenly, turning to face us, her hands on her hips challengingly. With her arousal dripping down and her legs trembling with pleasure, it wasn’t exactly an intimidating sight for me, but Naomi reacted differently. </p><p>Especially after Sarah spoke. “Go ahead, take your turn,” she said, her smugness apparent even with her quickened breathing. </p><p>Naomi froze under challenge, her gaze turning to my glistening shaft. “That…” she murmured. “That was in you. Entirely.” </p><p>“I know,” Sarah answered, satisfied with her achievement. I could see Naomi’s confidence trembling once more, about to retreat. I tried to find a way to encourage her without being too obvious, but Sarah’s move was too surprising for me to react. </p><p>And with all my blood gathered there, I wasn’t exactly in prime mental space. </p><p>“Or, you can do the smart thing and admit you can’t compete with me,” Sarah followed up, unable to resist the temptation of teasing her hesitating friend, once again showing she was her worst enemy in the little game we were conducting. </p><p>Because, the moment her dismissive declaration reached Naomi’s ears, she perked up, anger at Sarah’s words and the realization that she would lose after everything overwhelmed her earlier sensation. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t the only thing responsible. The attraction that was already there, and the build-up of pleasure that she developed during the extended foreplay played a role as well. </p><p>Even Sarah’s intense cries, the most excellent marketing material possible, played a role as well. </p><p>“Oh, what if I want to compete,” Naomi said as she stood up, standing in front of Sarah, whose confidence was quick to melt when coming face to face with her friend. </p><p>“If you can handle it,” Sarah said, trying to sound smug and confident, but failing to carry the mood once the atmosphere shifted. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Naomi murmured, and Sarah smirked, assuming that Naomi was retreating, but that was a mistake. Why would Naomi smirk naughtily if she was retreating? “Maybe I should see you practice a bit more,” Naomi said as she suddenly grabbed Sarah’s shoulders and pushed her down, directly onto my shaft. </p><p>I grabbed Sarah’s hips at the last moment for a little adjustment, preventing a painful accident. “No, not ready!” Sarah gasped as her eyes widened, but that was all she could do before she found herself impaled herself on my shaft once more. </p><p>“Oops,” Naomi whispered mockingly. “How clumsy of me?” </p><p>“Y-you bitch,” Sarah answered, her lips parting beautifully as she delivered that, followed by a deep moan as her body started trembling. Not expecting to be ambushed by her friend in such a direct manner, she wasn’t prepared for the invasion of pleasure, trembling badly. </p><p>I didn’t bother grabbing her hips to set the pacing, because Naomi was keeping her hands on her shoulder, pushing her down whenever Sarah tried to stand up. My shaft slammed deep inside her with each repeat, while Sarah moaned deeply. </p><p>“Come on, Sarah, you can do it, ten more repeats,” Naomi said, once again putting on her trainer persona. I wondered whether it was a reflexive reaction of her, allowing her to drift where she felt comfortable, or it was intentional to mock Sarah. </p><p>Either way, I wasn’t in a place to complain as Naomi pushed Sarah down, just like Sarah did earlier to force Naomi to deepthroat my presence mercilessly. </p><p>I had no problem with the way they were taking revenge. </p><p>“Tease her clit,” I ordered as I caught Naomi’s gaze, and much to my surprise, she didn’t delay even a second before she put her hand on Sarah’s clit, circling aggressively while her other hand still pushed Sarah down. </p><p>Under the combined assault of my shaft and Naomi’s fingers, not to mention the erotic nature of the unexpected position she found herself in, it didn’t take long for Sarah to finally start trembling hard, orgasm hitting her with the strength of an out-of-control truck, leaving her helpless as she gushed and moaned… </p><p>Only then did Naomi pull back, leaving Sarah to tremble on my lap helplessly, without distraction. </p><p>Under normal circumstances, I would have let Sarah catch her minute before repeating the same move, not satisfied without a climax. However, with a chocolate beauty waiting for me, it was much easier to put her next to me before standing up and looking down at Naomi, who suddenly realized making Sarah climax wasn’t the end. </p><p>“So, beautiful,” I whispered as I grabbed her waist. “Are you ready for it?”</p>",

    "content": "<p>It didn’t take long for me to come to a decision. Making sure Isolde regained her freedom was important. However, making sure she fully understood her new role in life, while also making sure that she received all the perks that came along with her new loyalty, was even more important. </p><p>And certainly more fun for me. </p><p>I pulled back for a moment, enjoying the naked and gasping figure of Isolde, amused to see that even her amazing stamina was unable to handle the unfamiliar assault of pleasure. Yet, her beautiful chest, pushing out beautifully with each breath, tempting me to start the next stage as soon as possible was hard to resist. </p><p>Since I was facing a great time constraint, I decided not to deny the call of pleasure as I grabbed her hips and flipped her so that her ass — tight thanks to the endless ranger duties she fulfilled, yet still sufficiently curvy to enhance her charm — pointed upward. A flare of magic ensured the boring aspects like cleaning and lubrication had been handled. “Not a bad start, sweetheart,” I whispered as I dragged my finger around her puckered hole. “But do you think you can handle the real stuff?” </p><p>“I can handle everything you can dish,” she stated, her voice impressively combative, though her face was suspiciously absent of such emotions, instead of showing delicious anticipation. </p><p>I was tempted to delay my treatment, just to punish her assumption that she could manipulate me to go faster with such a silly provocation. Unfortunately, that wasn’t on the cards, mostly due to our environment. </p><p>It was hardly the most feasible location for some extended edge play, especially the kind that would teach someone as rebellious as Isolde to teach a lesson. </p><p>Another time, I decided even as I slipped a finger inside her tightness, enjoying the moan that escaped her beautiful mouth at the moment, enjoying her spectacular tightness as I quickly added a second finger. </p><p>A moan escaped her lips. Though, I had to respect her pain resistance, as her voice didn’t carry even the slightest hint of discomfort, filled with pure pleasure. </p><p>“Still, maybe I should not push you too much,” I whispered, trying to sound serious, enjoying the sudden widening of her eyes as she struggled to catch my gaze, her expression colored with disbelief. </p><p>“I can handle it,” she stated hurriedly, quick to dissuade me from that path. </p><p>“Really?” I said even as I pulled my fingers. “I’m afraid that you can’t handle it, maybe I should go and arrange your freedom first.” </p><p>“No need, not at —” she delivered hurriedly, her eyes wide in shock at the beginning, only to be interrupted as I slid inside her tightness without a warning, a moan escaping her mouth in response. </p><p>One that finally carried a hint of pain, not she seemed to care that part. On the contrary, I could see the pleasure getting even more intense in her eyes, suggesting that pain was not exactly a deal-breaker for her. </p><p>“Let’s see how much you can handle,” I murmured even as I pressed one of my hands on her back, pinning her in place, the other on her hips to stabilize her. “When you want to stop, just say that you’re too weak to handle it.” </p><p>“Never —“ she said, and that was all she was able to say before my hips started moving with a speed that would have been reckless if it wasn’t for her incredible physical strength. </p><p>There was something interesting about the physical strength of top warriors — or rangers, in Isolde’s case. It was not entirely natural. I was a decent warrior, but never pushed myself enough to classify as a master, preferring to cheat when necessary instead of trying to get an expert. </p><p>Yet, as one reached that limit, a significant endurance and strength came with it, one that surpassed the limits of the normal limits of a body. Therefore, I was not entirely surprised when Isolde was able to handle my reckless charge with only a tinge of pain in her tone, more than able to handle the pain. </p><p>“I told you —“ she started, only to be interrupted by another moan as I spanked her ass hard, hard enough to even draw a tear from Sapphire despite her usual determination. Yet, Isolde had a different reaction. “Harder!” </p><p>“Damn,” I whispered. She was clearly in need of proper service. Luckily, I was the one that had the responsibility of taking her virginity. Anyone else, and she might have broken the poor boy in half. </p><p>I put even more weight on her body. She was trapped under me, but she gave no sign of dissatisfaction with the sudden pace. That didn’t mean that she was unaffected, of course, not even close. </p><p>Instead, her legs started to tremble with the telltale sign of infinite pleasure… </p><p>Her legs lost their power to stay closed, parting open obediently. Her eyes widened as she realized the mistake of using such a strong aphrodisiac, but it was too late. The combined assault of my hands and my hips turned it into an amazing assault. </p><p>Such a pity I needed to hurriedly finish such a delicious feast. </p><p>Soon, I let my fingers drift down, and instead of spanking her, slipped a couple fingers inside her wetness, the other still pressing down her waist to pin her in place. The addition of the frenzied assault of my fingers hardly helped her to contain her pleasure, and soon she tightened, exploding into something delicious. </p><p>It barely took a minute for her to start trembling with the signs of climax, achieving the impossible and getting even tighter, her excellent body showing its perks.</p><p>“Damn, girl. Your tightness is simply incredible…” I whispered even as I let my fingers continue ramming inside her even faster. She might have had an answer, but if she did, it was dragged away among her delicious moans. </p><p>Her face was buried in her pillow in an attempt to contain her moans, which blocked my desire to see her expression. Not that it was a problem with no solution, I decided even as I grabbed her hair and pulled it back, forcing her to twist her neck and look at me. </p><p>“Not bad,” I whispered as my hips picked even more speed, the sound of flesh hitting flesh simply deafening. “You might even handle a proper fucking once we’re not restricted in time.” </p><p>I expected her to answer, and when her lips opened, it seemed like she was confirming that particular direction, but instead, her moans rose unbidden, mixing with our rhythmic clapping, creating a great melody. </p><p>The position was fun, but I decided to reward her with another position. I pulled out and earned a disappointed moan, but that disappointment didn’t last long, not when I sat on the bed and pulled her to my lap. </p><p>As I skewered her tight hole once more, her hands found my shoulders, her nails sinking deep enough to draw blood. “Naughty girl,” I whispered before I leaned forward to focus on her neck, kissing and sucking. </p><p>Though I did interrupt that routine with more than one bite, much to her approval if her explosive moans were any indicator. </p><p>Despite her inexperience, she was handling the situation significantly better than I would have given her credit for. </p><p>Her fingers dug deeper into my shoulders, enough to draw blood, and I responded by biting her shoulder with a similar intensity, which left a deep mark on her. </p><p>“Mine,” I growled in a possessive tone, unable to resist the desire rising inside me as her actions triggered me. I stood up, my hands under her hips, and pressed her against the wall, using the leverage to make my assault even more merciless. </p><p>“Yours,” she gasped in response, her voice beautifully soft between her explosive moans, underlining her loyalty even more. </p><p>That didn’t prevent me from pushing deeper inside her — not that she seemed to be complaining. I continued slamming deep inside her repeatedly, underlining my ownership, accompanied by her delicious moans. </p><p>My reckless assault was not without a cost. Soon, she hit another climax, enhancing her already phenomenal tightness even more, which finally managed to break my resistance, and I filled her backdoor with my mark. </p><p>“Not a bad appetizer,” I murmured even as I pulled out, watching in amusement as she collapsed against the wall helplessly, more exhausted than I had ever seen her. </p><p>The unfamiliar invasion of pleasure achieving what her endless exhausting adventures failed to achieve… </p><p>“Appetizer…” she whispered, looking shocked at first before her gaze rose up, and met my gaze. “T-that’s a big promise, do you think you can handle it,” she added, challenge back in her tone, with just a touch of humor added, fleeting, almost impossible to notice. </p><p>Almost, but not quite.  </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle, feeling charmed at her sudden sharp attitude. She had been an annoying enemy, but it seemed that she would be a much more fun subordinate. </p><p>Who knew she had hidden depths… </p><p>“Let’s start working on your freedom,” I said, before stopping for a second.“By the way,” I added, remembering the little disguising trick I pulled against the Phoenix. “Don’t forget that, against the owner of the prison, you’re going to call me your king.” </p><p>“Understood, Your Majesty,” her murmur arrived immediately, her voice filled with a fervor that surprised me. </p><p>How amusing. Clearly, she wasn’t just fulfilling a role, but declaring her loyalty once more. </p><p>Luckily for her, it was already close enough for the truth to save her from the charges of treason. </p><p>All I needed was to decide was to exact way of getting her freedom. </p>",

    "content": "<p>A square mage formation was not something that could be easily dismissed. </p><p>The formation represented a nice utility to the mages, allowing them to share the pressure of any attack, easily defending against frontal assaults while letting the ones behind the attack. And the one in the center was ready to support the attacks or assist in the defense. </p><p>The patrician weapons they yielded, combined with the power of the dragon hearts, turned the formidable defense into a dangerous castle. So much that, even with the Spear of Scipio in hand, I wouldn’t have dared to test them with my transformation impairing my casting abilities horribly, if it wasn’t for the endless months I had spent in a magic thick environment to give me an advantage thanks to the concealment effect from my core’s reaction. </p><p>As I charged forward, I summoned fifteen bolts of lightning, each receiving three, with two important exceptions. I targeted the one at the center by five of them, while using only one on the one on the left corner. Yet, even the power distribution of the bolts was different. The first five attacks were strong, strong enough to be a threat for them even with their armament. </p><p>It worked as intended as they swung their weapons, and rather than retaliating immediately, they turned their full attention to defending. </p><p>They swung their weapons again, preparing to deflect the second assault — one that looked more impressive than it actually was. </p><p>Giving me the opportunity I had been looking for, even though it was a horrible decision. Not that it was a bad idea on paper to rely on their weapons rather than casting, as it forced the enemy to expand their power while they kept theirs ready — one that was critical even with dragon hearts, as their effect was not easy to handle. </p><p>Yet, it was a horrible decision in our actual conditions, one that would have made anyone suspicious. </p><p>There were three reasons behind my complicated attack pattern. First, I wanted them to unbalance themselves trying to defend against my lightning bolts — an attack that looked much scarier than it actually was, but I trusted that my other attacks worked enough to enhance the credibility. </p><p>Second, by targeting the one in the center, I baited the one holding the left back corner to change his position even further, forcing him to support the center blindly.  After all, as the one holding the back line, he was responsible for supporting the center if necessary, and the limited attack he received only reinforced that it was easier to defend him. </p><p>The third reason, the one in the left corner was using an axe, which was the slowest and most unwieldy weapon among their armament. </p><p>So, even though they prepared to defend against the second wave, I tightened my grip over the spear, and charged forward, using the power of the Spear to enhance my assault. </p><p>And, that, combined with the speed my forceful core mishap was giving me, allowed me to push into their formation, before the axe wielder could even react. </p><p>Admittedly, with the spear buried in his brain, it was hard for him to react. </p><p>That move was not free, of course. It left me in the middle of their formation. Even if they were still struggling to defend themselves against my lightning spell. Their emotionless state showed its benefits as they changed the formation in an instant, two of them casting shields to protect against the lightning assault while the other two attacked against me. </p><p>One targeted me directly, while the second one already targeted my path to retreat. </p><p>Yet, I did the last thing one might expect from a sorcerer. I loosened my grip around the spear and continued to charge forward, slamming my body against the one at the center, forcibly pushing through the shield they created.</p><p>Cutting through the shield through my physical body was hardly a pleasant sensation.  </p><p>Such a collision was hardly the safest strategy. Not only did I have to contend with strategy, but also I left my back vulnerable to their attacks. Yet, there were benefits to my transformation. The first was the claws I sported — luckily flexible enough to hold a spear — turned a tackle into a deadly assault as I buried my claw into his chest, pulverizing his heart. </p><p>The second was the scales that already covered my back, allowing me to take their assault using my back. The earlier experimentation with my arm had already shown me that they were almost immune to direct assault. </p><p>A Patrician weapon was not an ordinary challenge, I realized as the pain exploded on my back despite the scales, but luckily, after my charge, the best they could achieve was a glancing blow before they could recover. </p><p>The one on the right back corner started swinging his sword, but not before I completed the assault. </p><p>The remaining three tried to react to my assault, but with the shield displayed, the remaining bolts of lightning distracted them just enough to slow their reaction. </p><p>And, three on one, against my transformed body. </p><p>They didn’t even have a chance. </p><p>A few more slashes, and just like that, the battle was finally over, I thought even as I finally turned toward the entrance, only to see my poor ally trying to defend herself against an impressive number of soldiers, her shield about to shatter.</p><p>Luckily, with my opponents defeated, I had the luxury of helping her. </p><p>Her survival was rather paramount with my transformation going out of control.</p><p>I only paused enough to take the spear before rushing forward, giving myself a little time to examine the formation of the soldiers. Luckily, there were no mages among them to support their attack. Not that it was completely simple.  </p><p>They were set up in three layers, the foremost layer carrying shields. Yet, they were not ordinary shields, each glowing with blindingly strong enchantments. They were already plenty strong alone, but they had an additional feature, that their strength overlapped, sharing their strength to resist the spells of my ally.  </p><p>It reminded me of the throwing spears they had used when I first broke the ward. Impressively strong, but designed for explosive performance rather than longevity. Considering the work and the materials that were required to create a magical item of such caliber, it was wasteful… </p><p>Yet, it was hard to say that it was not worthwhile, considering it allowed some ordinary soldiers to resist a sorcerer — although one that was not geared for combat. </p><p>The second layer was armed with swords and shields. Their shields were smaller, and as a consequence, weaker, than the huge tower shields that the first layer carried, but they glowed with the same kind of energy, ready to support the first layer, or charge forward to deliver the killing blow if necessary. </p><p>The third layer was the most interesting part, as they were only armed with large, weighted nets, the kind that reminded me of the fancy weapons the gladiators used in the arena during show matches. Yet, the weapons of the gladiators didn’t glow with an intensity of the magic that would force a sorcerer to be careful. </p><p>I was impressed by the effort they had put to create that number of equipment just to catch her rather than kill them. I glanced at my ally as I charged forward to cover the remaining distance, who had been doing her best to defend against the combined attack, but struggling to resist. </p><p>Unfortunately, while their gear was impressively overwhelming, ultimately, they were designed to capture a sorceress with a special deficiency in combat, and not something that could stand against a proper battle sorcerer, certainly not against one that was occupied with a Patrician weapon. </p><p>If dealing with sorcerers would have been that easy, we wouldn’t be treated as a strategic weapon.  </p><p>I stood in front of my ally, my spear twirling, its magical impact significant as it collided against the shields. With each contact, one of their shields lost its shine. </p><p>Meanwhile, my ally gasped behind me. “H-how are you still alive?” she gasped. It didn’t take a genius to realize she was referring to my transformation. </p><p>I ignored her statement, not because I thought that my transformation was not dangerous, but since I was still alive, it could wait until I dealt with the rest of the soldiers, still doing their best to take us down with a determination that was only possible due to the brainwashing they suffered.</p><p>A different group had long started to retreat, realizing the helplessness of the situation, every hit of my spear destroying another layer of their protection. They tried to throw their nets at me as a distraction, but against them, I had a particularly impressive advantage. Just a small blast of lightning, and they were destroyed. </p><p>I had a feeling that this formation would have been much deadlier if they had been equipped with the throwing spears that had been used on me earlier. Maybe that was the intention, but they never expected that they had to defend themselves against an attack coming from the heart of their base. </p><p>Yet, despite all the setup, the end of the battle came easily, almost ignobly so. With their shields broken under the might of Spear of Scipio, they were open against magical assault once more. And while the amount of magic I could apply to the spells was limited, the same didn’t apply to my ally. </p><p>Several area spells and several spikes later, the whole formation was destroyed. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching Penny sway in front of me, wearing nothing but a red ribbon was certainly beautiful. Beautiful enough to tempt me to reach forward and give a tug to the little knot that was keeping her improvised ribbon together. </p><p>Yet, I kept myself back, deciding to let Penny take the initiative for once. For a submissive beauty like her, a change of pace like that was certainly a novel change, enough to break my usual attitude when it came to having fun. </p><p>After all, Penny certainly worked hard to earn that treatment.  </p><p>So, I stayed still despite my instincts begging me to take an action, even as she took her place on my lap once more, rubbing and swaying, her breasts arriving at the eye level thanks to elevation advantage of her. </p><p>Penny looked down, her excitement battling with trepidation as she found herself in the position of control, a rare situation in our relationship — if one could call our weird entanglement a relationship.</p><p>Yet, it was a sign of her improvement that she barely stilled for a second before she grabbed my head and pulled me into the glorious valley between her breasts, the ribbon stretching between them barely a barrier as I got buried in their beautiful depths. </p><p>Penny squealed in pleasure as she rocked back and forth on my lap, each second giving me more time to enjoy her barely covered bosom. “Not a bad start,” I murmured, making her blush, which was apparent even in her bosom. </p><p>It was amazing that she could act shy under my words even when dressed like that, rubbing against me at a speed that would make a stripper self-conscious. I wanted to raise my head and catch her gaze, but I had a feeling that, if I did so, the little confidence she was able to collect would collapse spectacularly, and while that would have been fun in its own way, I decided to let it slide nonetheless. </p><p>Still, it was impossible to reject the temptation of not playing her completely. I put my hand on her back, gently caressing as it moved back and forth along her spine, my touch enough to make her tremble. </p><p>“N-no,” she stammered. “No touching,” she added after a deep breath, one that did some interesting things to her bosom, interesting things that I got a direct view of thanks to my face still buried in her breasts. </p><p>“As you wish,” I answered as I pulled my hand back, my voice muffled the best way possible. However, I didn’t pull back without a little trick. I had delivered a little tug to her ribbon, which dislodged the knot that was holding her costume together. </p><p>That raised no comment, signaling that she had missed it. Not that it surprised me. It wouldn’t be the first time she had missed an extremely important detail that led to amazing amorous situations that went against her initial intent. </p><p>She was truly a rare treasure. </p><p>I said nothing as she shuffled on my lap back and forth, each move giving me a deeper sensation of pleasure, tempting me to push forward and ruin her plan. Only the slow crawl of her ribbon, getting looser each second, kept me back. </p><p>Soon, a moan escaped her lips, one that suggested that she was having even more trouble rejecting the temptation of the last step. It was a beautiful one, colored with arousal and desire, making my fingers tighten in anticipation, begging them to move lower. </p><p>Before I could take that move, however, Penny decided to stand up. Not fully, which would have strained her ribbon and left her naked, but a half-rise, a transitory move before she knelt in front of me. </p><p>Yet, her hands stayed on the side, making me think that she had no intention of helping me divest my clothes. “Tease,” I whispered. </p><p>“Are you sure?” she answered, this time managing to deliver that without a stammer as she looked toward me. I quirked an eyebrow, feeling lost about her meaning, even when she leaned forward, using her teeth to grab the sash that had been holding my robe together. </p><p>A tug, and it lost the ability to keep it together, my shaft finally springing free from its protective layer. </p><p>And even better, that move finally caused the end of her gift wrapping. Not because the move finally strained the knot that was holding me together, but because it finally strained my patience to the limit. </p><p>I grabbed, a pull enough to free her body from the already-deficient grasp of the ribbon. “Best gift ever,” I murmured even as I grabbed her waist, and threw her on the couch. </p><p>“S-such a rough little boy,” she managed to say, trying to sound coy despite her shyness. “Didn’t you learn to open your gifts more gently?” </p><p>“Never,” I said mockingly. “I’m not the one that cares about the gift wrapping, only the gift itself…” I stopped for a moment, my smirk widening. “Sorry, the gift herself.” </p><p>The blush that spread through her face in response was simply spectacular, the confidence she showed earlier as she was on my lap nowhere to be seen. I said nothing else as I sat on the couch as well, and gestured for her to spread her legs. </p><p>Ironically, her shyness might prevent her from saying anything, but it certainly didn’t stop her from widening her legs invitingly.  Meanwhile, I finally followed the desire of my heart and put my fingers to her wetness, my fingers danced around her knob. </p><p>And just like that, her moans exploded, destroying any chance of a reply. </p><p>After an extended teasing, I could feel her excitement reaching to climactic level rather rapidly, signaling me to act faster if I didn’t want her to collapse before I could make a move. </p><p>The way she shivered was all the evidence I needed to signal the seriousness of the challenge. </p><p>Yet, even then, I wasn’t the one that would keep myself back. I leaned down, pressing my lips to her inner thigh for a moment before starting to move up, leaving a trail of kisses over her beautiful stomach, each kiss earning a louder moan, exploding once my head disappeared between her legs, her lips wet under my tongue, her aroma delicious.  </p><p>She just moaned loudly, making her amazing breasts jiggle again and again, though the rapidness of her cries warned me not to delay that assault for too long, or risk spoiling the fun. </p><p>Instead, I suddenly pulled back, the disappointed gasp of her easy to mollify by replacing my tongue with a certain other, harder, part of my body.  </p><p>Her cry was enough to show just how much she appreciated the sudden change of approach. She pushed her hips forward even as her beautiful, plump thighs tightened around my waist, entrapping me in the most amazing prison imaginable. </p><p>“Harder,” she murmured dazedly, her voice suggesting that her mind was blanked in a thick layer of pleasure. I waited for another moan to explode from her beautiful lips as I grabbed her hips for leverage, my fingers sinking deep into her flesh, the softness spectacular. </p><p>My shaft started throbbing in anticipation, increasing her pleasure even more even as it signaled she wasn’t the only one that was dangerously close to a climax, her tightness telling the story of growing arousal, each second getting more intense. </p><p>Even more, even as I impaled her aggressively, I could feel exhaustion growing in my body, noticeable even with all the adrenaline that was growing in my body. Understandable, as it had been a very long day, starting from the exhausting encounter in the morning, followed by an exhausting work day, and topped up by the encounter in the bathroom. </p><p>Still, it was a pity as I would have loved to continue until the early hours of the morning, teasing her skin glowing under the first rays of morning. </p><p>Penny moaned, still under my touch, distracting me from such unimportant details like my own exhaustion or alternative plans. I hummed as pushed my hips forward even harder, enjoying the way she tightened around me, her climax just seconds away… </p><p>Yet, she managed to surprise me once again. Before I could explode, she suddenly rose — which also freed my shaft from her core —  and pressed her hands on my chest. I could have resisted her push, but her move was simply too interesting to be stopped, so I let her succeed. </p><p>She pushed me down until I found myself lying on my back, which would have been a sad conclusion to our encounter if she hadn’t followed up immediately, sitting on top of me, skewering herself with my glistening shaft once more. </p><p>I said nothing as she put her hands on my chest once more, this time using it as support as she started rocking her hips with a desperation that pushed me toward the end far faster than I expected. </p><p>Luckily, she still arrived first. </p><p>She cried as her tunnel tightened around my girth, loud enough to wake up the dead. Still, surprisingly, it wasn’t enough to actually wake up Nancy, who had been still sleeping in the other room. </p><p>Apparently, I wasn’t the only one that had been exhausted during the day. </p><p>Yet, as her hips rocked, Penny’s hands tightened on my shoulders, her fingers biting deep enough to leave their mark. Not that I was complaining. With the pleasure radiating in my body, pushing me toward that final explosion, the pain just become another facet of the pleasure I was feeling. </p><p>She had long collapsed against my chest when I started filling her insides, shivering softly against my body as the pleasure hit her hard, her eyes closing for a moment. Clearly, she was no less exhausted. </p><p>I thought about lifting her, but her comforting warmth was simply too comfortable. I closed my eyes, just to catch a moment of sleep. </p><p>Though, the couch was rather comfortable as well… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching the poor Janelor trying to look impervious and dignified even as she impatiently swallowed every little piece of food I brought to her was fun. She utterly failed in her task, not that it was too surprising. </p><p>It was very difficult to look impervious when one was completely naked, her petite yet curvy body even more appetizing than the buffet that was spread in front of me. </p><p>After getting rid of her nightie, I did nothing more than occasional caresses for the next few bites, just enough to arouse her memories of our last time, starting from a massage and ending up in an amazing, lengthy hug… </p><p>She said nothing, intent on enjoying the food, though a part of it was clearly about her lack of experience. Everything about her showed a lack of experience on the fun side of things. When it was time to act once more, I reached for a much more fun condiment. </p><p>Whipped cream. </p><p>I didn’t miss the gazes she had sent toward its way, though I wasn’t sure whether it was about her sweet tooth, or the incredible amount of mana I managed to trap in its gentle, fluffy structure. Yet, just as I put a generous touch on a sweet toast, to give her the first taste of it…</p><p>Another stroke of clumsiness hit me, and my hand trembled helplessly, letting the blob of fluffy cream fall. “How unluckily,” I said as I smirked at her. “Luckily, I didn’t ruin your bed, mistress,” I added, as the white cream was firmly lodged between her glorious peaks. </p><p>What a fortunate coincidence. </p><p>“Not a problem,” she answered quickly as she raised her hand, but I grabbed her wrist, preventing her from touching it. </p><p>“No, mistress. As a servant, I couldn’t wait while you do the cleaning. It wouldn’t be honorable.” I raised my empty hand, and brought it to her chest. Unfortunately, my episode of clumsiness was yet to fade, and my attempts to clean it only spread it further. Soon, her breasts were completely covered with whipped cream. </p><p>Such an unfortunate disaster. </p><p>“I’m sorry, mistress, I’ll fix my mistake immediately,” I gasped even as I pushed her down, enjoying the shocked gasp that left her mouth, one that turned into a moan as I leaned forward to lick her beautiful peaks. </p><p>Naturally, I didn’t neglect to coat my tongue with mana. </p><p>[-258 Mana]</p><p>“W-what are you doing?” she stammered between moans. </p><p>“I’m just cleaning you, mistress. Completely innocent, I swear,” I added, my smirk wide enough to make me a liar if she had any inclination of believing that in the first place. </p><p>“Nonsense —“ she tried to say, only to be interrupted when I dig my finger into the whipped cream and slipped in between her lips, letting her suck the dessert off, which proved convincing enough to silence her. Meanwhile, I continued working on the great expanse of her chest slowly, sensuously. </p><p>Yet, under my hungry lips, even with the hunger burning in my gaze, it didn’t take long for them for her breasts to turn completely clean. I pulled back, leaving her beautiful tits, glistening after my effort. “All clean, mistress,” I whispered as I pulled back. “I’m sorry about my clumsiness.” </p><p>“T-thanks,” she murmured, though that didn’t prevent her from looking dazed as she continued to lay, unable to process what had just happened, trying to process the invasion of pleasure. She pushed herself upright soon, which had a rather beautiful impact on her chest, making it jiggle erotically. </p><p>“Not a problem, mistress,” I said, and without a warning, started leaning forward once more. “There’s some left on your lips,” I whispered, before capturing her lips in a searing kiss. Despite her initial shock and reluctance, her lips quick to respond against the kiss, her tongue joining the battle soon, wrapping tight enough to allow me to steal the taste. </p><p>“Delicious,” I murmured in appreciation as I pulled back, not bothering to hide my great smirk as she panted obediently. </p><p>Her naked sight as she struggled to breathe, trying to throw off her daze was simply marvelous. Not enough to enter the list of the sexiest scenes I had ever seen, though, considering my experience midway, it was hard to gain a spot there without the assistance of at least another very sexy lady — the peak still occupied by our victory celebration following our battle against the undead. </p><p>Yet, while it might not play for the top of the list, the sight of a sexy dragoness out of breath, biting her lips idly like she was struggling to believe the feeling she had just experienced. “Open wide,” I whispered as I grabbed a mulberry, coating it with some liquid chocolate before bringing it back to her lips, giving her mouth something else to be occupied. </p><p>She slowly bit the mulberry absentmindedly, clearly unaware of the sexiness she was displaying as she slowly chewed it. I carefully fed her a few more bites before another accident happened, and her beautiful breasts were stained once more. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I watched her move, laying back without the slightest prompting from my end, ready for my cleanup, her eyes closed in preparation. Yet, I didn’t lean down immediately, instead grabbed more cream and chocolate, creating a beautiful edible bra for her. </p><p>“T-that’s too much,” she gasped, but that was the extent of her complaints as I leaned forward, licking the edge of her beautiful new clothing item, one with an expected survival time even lower than her usual stuff. I had to admit, made by the full application of my Craft skill, the mixture tasted better than anything else I had the pleasure of eating. </p><p>Though the presentation certainly helped. </p><p>As I worked on her breasts, our closeness allowed me to see the way her beautiful skin gained a beautiful blush, the aura of cuteness not exactly damaged by the soft moans that she started to let out while her hands fisted around the bed covers. “Hmm, maybe I should use you as my plate for every breakfast,” I whispered. “You certainly taste nice.” </p><p>“I-impudent,” she gasped. “I’m a dragon, how dare you disrespect me like that!” she shouted. Her shout was loud, though if she was able to push herself up to a sitting position without her trembling arms surrendered, it might have been more intimidating. Under the circumstances, it only made her breasts ripple, increasing my enjoyment of her beautiful body. </p><p>“I’m not disrespecting,” I whispered. “On the contrary, I’m finding an excellent use for your petite body. Isn’t it something you want, to prove your little stature is not an object of shame?” </p><p>“O-of course n—“ she started but her argument suffered a premature death when my fingers slipped inside her wetness, silencing her beautifully, her words leaving their place to endless moans as I coated my fingers with mana. </p><p>[-690 Mana]</p><p>She just moaned while I continued to devour her temporary bra, once again turning her cleavage into something more obscene as her nipples peeked through its white clouds. Though, just because I had finished the cream was no reason for me to stop. “Delicious,” I murmured as I continued to lick and kiss her breasts, the occasional bite breaking the monotony as it left a lingering mark behind. “You’re certainly the best plate imaginable,” I whispered. </p><p>She was likely annoyed by my comment, but that didn’t matter as she struggled to process the waves of pleasure that resulted from my invasion, each flicker pushing her closer to the edge of a climax. </p><p>Yet, I had no intention of making her climax. Not before she earned it. I raised my head, though I kept my fingers inside her wetness, the pleasure it provided critical to making her keep her gaze closed. Meanwhile, I prepared another breakfast surprise for her, one that fit the theme of our little game much more accurately. </p><p>She stayed unaware as I shuffled, taking my new place, only realizing something was different once I pulled my fingers back. “What are you—“ she started, only to freeze as she opened her mouth, only to find me above her, my shaft already out, covered with chocolate and cream. </p><p>“I realized I was being unfair, treating you like a kitchen item. So, I decided to allow you to take revenge for this huge disrespect,” I whispered as my lips formed a smirk, my hips pushing forward. “Open wide!” </p><p>She did so, though I didn’t know whether it was to obey my order or to raise complaints. Either way, she opened her mouth, allowing my shaft to invade her beautiful throat. </p><p>And our breakfast took a small yet important step forward.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>After I left the workshop, it didn’t take long for me to decide on my next destination. </p><p>I wanted to go visit Janelor, and not to have some fun with my petite dragon. Or, more accurately, not entirely for fun.  </p><p>I wanted to question her more about the other planes and traveling in between. Not that I didn’t trust the headmistress’ explanation, at least in the general strokes as she had no reason to lie to me about those, but that still left the question of Janelor had a more recent experience in those dangers as she somehow found herself in here. </p><p>On the contrary, I didn’t even know whether the headmistress even traveled, or was around since the beginning of the system, making her explanation about interplanar traveling not entirely reliable. </p><p>And I prioritized exploring that for one important reason.</p><p>I could still feel Aviada’s presence through her Companion node. Her presence was weak, blunted, a faint flicker compared to the bonfire of Helga and others, yet, without a doubt, she was still alive. One that wasn’t supposed to be the case if traveling between planes was as impossible as the headmistress mentioned.  </p><p>I wouldn’t abandon her while there was still hope. </p><p>Janelor represented an alternative source of information for me to validate. </p><p>But one didn’t simply visit a greedy dragon without an appropriate tribute. </p><p>So, I first stopped by the kitchen, taking a considerable amount of ingredients — using the authority granted by my new role — before finding an unoccupied corner and creating a couple wards to keep me concealed before I started cooking a veritable late breakfast spread, from light cheeses to cooked meats, and even an impressive number of desserts… </p><p>Naturally, every single bite laced with an incredible amount of mana, enough to change the fate of an actual battlefield if used appropriately, though, luckily, my mana recovery filled my reserves before I finished cooking.  </p><p>[-4680 Mana]</p><p>Not all of the mana went directly to the food, of course. A considerable amount of it went to create a temporary barrier around the food, forcing the food to keep that much mana in its confines and block the System from absorbing it back directly. </p><p>Only after that, I went to her room, once again putting myself under the suffocating sensation of darkness wards, weakening my connection with the System. Once again reminding me that, for all the power it had provided, the System was not something completely reliable. </p><p>The door was locked with an intricate ward, one that had been cast recently. The excessively delicate nature of the ward showed that Janelor was the party responsible for its existence. It would have been a strong ward if it wasn’t for the deterioration it experienced as the mana evaporated easily from its structure… </p><p>Without the deterioration, unlocking it without triggering an alarm would have been challenging, but at the moment, it was as effective as a castle gate connected to broken walls. A momentary effort was all that was needed to bypass them. </p><p>I entered the room and found my cute ‘mistress’ sleeping, her petite body sprawled over her huge bed, still in her human form. Her beautiful body was not naked, but considering the thinness of the nightwear she was wearing, she might as well be naked. </p><p>I said nothing as I walked toward her bed with the tray in hand, wondering whether sleeping that much was the habit of all dragons, or it was just something unique to her due to her laziness. </p><p>She woke up before I could cover half of the distance, though the way her cute note twitched suggested that it was not my footsteps that pulled her out of her sleep but the smell of the amazing food I had prepared for her. </p><p>“Good morning, mistress,” I said, intentionally lingering at the last word while letting the smile on my face twist beautifully. “Did you have a nice sleep?” </p><p>For a moment, she just looked at me, beautifully dazed. Then, her gaze bounced between me and the door, no doubt trying to understand how I entered despite the ward — suggesting that she was yet to understand the full impact of the System on her spells despite the time she spent here. </p><p>While she dealt with her mental question, I continued to close into her bed. Distracted, it took a while for her to remember what she had been wearing, her blush intensifying as she glanced down. </p><p>The best part, her pride prevented her from asking me to turn, or even cross her arms around her chest to hide. The only thing she did was to cross her legs, and even that, she did with the excuse of shuffling. “W-why are you here?” she asked, unable to prevent herself from stammering. </p><p>“I brought your breakfast in bed, of course,” I said, with a tone that might be considered respectable if it wasn’t for my widening smirk. I took a step back and turned slightly. “But I can always throw it away if you don’t want it.” </p><p>To her credit, she managed to resist the temptation of my delicious cooking. </p><p>For three whole steps. </p><p>“Stop,” she gasped. If someone else heard the desperation in her tone, they might have assumed that I had been torturing her, and she finally shattered under my merciless assault. </p><p>Such a gluttonous little dragon. </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I said as I turned back, an exaggerated smile of satisfaction on my lips, intentionally big to make her notice. Yet, under the fascination of the food, she let that slide, her gaze carefully following the food. </p><p>Her eyes even momentarily flickered, turning slithered before gaining back their usual emerald quality, glowing whole with no whites. It would have been an intimidating sight if it wasn’t for her sexy nightie — or the memories of the same eyes forced to shut under the endless invasion of pleasure. </p><p>“You can leave,” she said the moment I put the tray on the bed. Yet, when she reached, I pulled the tray back, and climbed on the bed as well. “What are you doing?” she asked. </p><p>“I’m going to feed you, of course. As a good servant, the satisfaction of my mistress is paramount. You can’t be asking me to be a bad servant, right? It would make me depressed.” I paused for a moment, my smirk widening. “Maybe even depressed enough to throw away the food I had gone all the trouble of making.” </p><p>The beautiful expression of frustration on her face was amazing as she considered my threat. “Alright,” she accepted defeat with a nod, but then she raised her hand in warning, the attitude coming across quite clearly as her hand turned into a claw. “No funny business.” </p><p>“I promise, no funny business,” I answered. After all, there was nothing funny about what I had planned to do, especially compared to her so-called threat. </p><p>Her threat amused me significantly because of one very important reason. It was a great contrast to earlier, when she had been feeling very uncomfortable showing her transformation next to me. Yet now, she was very comfortable, proving our growing closeness… </p><p>Even when my mind was busy with the implications of her threat, my hands started working, slicing a small of cheese and brought to her lips, even using the opportunity to inject it with more mana. </p><p>[-93 Mana]</p><p>She tried to keep her face expressionless as she swallowed the piece, but that proved to be a bigger challenge than she assumed. Her tastebuds rebelled, followed by her throat, letting out a moan of appreciation. </p><p>Her fascinating emerald eyes turned to a tornado of petulant confusion, unhappy with her performance. Though, not unhappy enough to reject the next slice I had prepared for her, her pouty lips parting immediately the moment I raised the fork. </p><p>Another moan escaped her mouth. </p><p>She closed her eyes, enjoying every bite fully while doing her best to ignore my presence. </p><p>That would not do. </p><p>After several repeats, the fork I was carrying trembled accidentally — as it was very normal for someone with forty points on both Agility and Precision to experience — dropping a big blob of jam on her nightie, right at the nice valley between her breasts. </p><p>“Oh, mistress, I’m sorry,” I gasped, using my ability of speech and charisma to the limit to make it convincing just to mock her. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s —“ she started, reflexively responding to the anguish in my tone before her mind caught up with the absurdity of it. Her eyes opened, catching my wide smirk. </p><p>“Nonsense, mistress,” I answered, this time using my exaggerated servant tone once more. “It’s my fault I had ruined your nightie. Sorry, let me help you handle it,” I said as I grabbed her nightie, and ripped it off her body. </p><p>“Yes, you definitely saved it from ruin,” she answered, unable to help her sarcastic tone even as she shuffled, unable to resist the temptation of covering her breasts. After all, while the earlier nightie hid nothing due to its transparency, it still gave her a clutch to convince herself that she wasn’t naked. </p><p>A clutch that I got rid of with extreme prejudice. </p><p>Yet, as I prepared another slice for her, she opened her mouth obediently rather than making me leave…  </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>My full focus was on the playbook as I flipped the pages slowly, examining each scheme carefully, what areas to cover for linebackers and under which conditions it needed to be used, as well as the calls that would trigger the formation, both from the coaches and from the mike. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to finish the relatively small booklet, especially since it only included only a part of the schemes. Before some of the more significant events in my life, I would have to read several times even to memorize a portion of them accurately, but when I closed my eyes, I was able to remember all of them easily. </p><p>After my growing experience with the System, I was able to recognize the source of sudden improvement easily. And guessing the particular responsible category wasn’t particularly difficult, Strategy and Tactics, with some significant help from Pattern Recognition. </p><p>Excellent, I thought even as I read the booklet again, just to make sure I was remembering them perfectly, testing my memory through a self-delivered quiz. Not only I was able to memorize the required positions for the linebackers, which was all that was needed for my position as a linebacker, but also the rest of the positions. </p><p>Memorizing the rest of the positions wasn’t exactly a big requirement for my position, as there was no chance I would play the mike position, which, in summary, was the quarterback of the defense, responsible for defensive adjustments against the changes in the attack patterns. Still, I wanted to test myself. </p><p>After I finished reading the booklet the second time, I picked a nearby pen, ready to test myself again. </p><p>However, before I could do so, I felt a familiar stirring. I closed my eyes, the state of meditation coming much easier after repeated practice, only to see a significant flow of intent… </p><p>I didn’t need to check my phone to see if Megan’s plot was in progress. </p><p>I still gave quick browsing just in case, mostly to make sure there was nothing that would get me kicked out. I didn’t expect it, but it was better safe than sorry. A quick check of the recent social media posts, showing some raunchy yet still safe posts of our recent adventure was enough to confirm my guess, that Megan’s plan was in effect, and in a form that wouldn’t trouble me.</p><p>At least, not trouble me extensively, I decided as I caught Thad and Carter looking at me, Thad with a big smile, Carter with a marked annoyance. </p><p>I ignored Carter’s gaze, which reminded me more of a disappointed teacher than an angry teammate. I had no intention of apologizing for it even if he was the captain, not willing to give him the idea that I would take his opinion about my social life. </p><p>Instead, I looked at Thad. He gave me a thumbs-up, and I smirked before I turned my attention back to my phone. </p><p>Going through the comments section, I had to admit that Megan had a real talent for creating online controversy, even better than she had been able to raise during the party. After all, the party one had been a spontaneous reaction, and this one was properly planned. </p><p> The photos they had selected to use were good evidence of it, limiting themselves to ones that were subtly suggestive rather than explicitly revealing, creating an even bigger buzz. </p><p>The correct skill for a modern world, I had to admit. However, I didn’t waste much time browsing my phone, just enough to get a sense of what was happening. Then, I closed my eyes, focusing on the metaphorical flowing sensation once more. </p><p>It was the first time I was able to feel the flow of Intent with such clarity, mostly thanks to sudden explosive intensity, and I didn’t want to lose the opportunity to examine it more clearly.  </p><p>I closed my eyes once more, meditating. With the intense flow to guide me, it was even easier to reach that weird mental space that contained both the System and my guide. Like before, my guide was devouring all of the intent, yet there was no noticeable difference in its glow, or the sense of pressure it provided. </p><p>She clearly needed more Intent — a lot more — to recover. </p><p>The same intent that I needed to support the System. </p><p>I tried to redirect the flow once more, not expecting it to work, as, during my earlier attempts, I had utterly failed to interact with it. </p><p>Yet this time, the flow split suddenly. It was hard to describe the sensation, just as the sensation itself… </p><p>Like trying to grab a flowing river with my hands. </p><p>Yet, somehow, I managed to succeed.</p><p>And just like that, the System started to receive the fuel it required. </p><p>Pity that I wasn’t able to maintain my grip for more than a couple minutes. The intensity of the flow was related to the explosiveness of the news. The shock value of the photos didn’t last for long, and as the flow started to decrease, maintaining a grip over the flow got harder and harder. </p><p>And, after a while, it slipped off my metaphorical fingers. </p><p>The drop of intensity didn’t surprise me too much, as the impact of news, especially the kind that Megan just launched, relying on visuals, was explosive only at the first exposure, and slowly lost in intensity. It still provided me a lot of Intent, but my guide devoured it. </p><p>I tried a couple of times to redirect the flow back to the System, wanting to gain some more improvement, but it failed to do so. Yet, I repeated it several times, until I was interrupted by a nearby cry. </p><p>“Let me go in, I’ll kill him,” shouted a familiar voice on the corridor, which had earned the gaze of Thad and Carter. Kevin, I recognized, as he continued to shout loudly. </p><p>I prepared myself to stand up, but no one entered, Instead, another shout arrived in my ear. “Don’t worry, he’ll come here and face you if he’s not a complete coward.” </p><p>Thad and Carter looked at me. Carter seemed even more annoyed by my presence — clearly unhappy that the team was getting too chaotic — while Thad looked alert, like he was about to jump onto his feet, no doubt to prevent me from going out even as more and more statements reached my ears about my supposed cowardice. </p><p>Ironic considering the reaction he would display if he had been the target. </p><p>I met with Thad’s eye and shrugged. “Don’t worry, I have no intention of starting a fight.” Then, I paused, letting my smirk widen. “At least, not I will be blamed for,” I added. Thad relaxed looking at my cold calmness. </p><p>The intention of Kevin and the other offensive players was rather clear. If I rushed out to face them, the blame would be much more mixed, especially compared to a direct invasion of our meeting room. And, as a backup player that was yet to play, I didn’t intend to find myself in a fight where the guilt was hard to ascertain. </p><p>They fell silent after a few minutes. </p><p>I pulled the papers in front of me, looking lost in my reading, while mentally, I focused on the System, curious whether I could have a better interaction with it after my latest small victory, but after several minutes, I failed to get anything useful. I would have loved to spend some more time, but the rest of the players started to arrive, interrupting my focus as they greeted me, their suggestive smirks — and the occasional gestures — showing Megan’s latest success. </p><p>But before I returned my attention to the meeting, I did one last thing.</p><p>I touched the System again, intending to trigger the Trait gains once more. Interestingly, as I pressed, I felt a sense of awareness. It wasn’t a deep, clear feeling, barely more than trying to see in a thick mist, but I could notice three distinct sources of light. </p><p>Their obscure nature was hard to describe, but one of them felt like a mixture of ink and wood, one had a feeling of constant movement intercepted by occasional pain, and the last group had an impression of … a mercurial alacrity. </p><p>My best guess, they were the impressions of the Traits I possessed. To confirm that, I reached further, and touched the first one, the one that reminded me of ink and wood. </p><p>[Tactics III, acquired]</p><p>[Pattern Recognition III, acquired]</p><p>[Strategy II, acquired]</p><p>[Seduction IV, acquired]</p><p>Not bad, I thought as the results confirmed my guess that ink and wood were about Tactics and other related Traits. In my subconsciousness, wood likely symbolized chess pieces, and ink was about drawing plans. </p><p>That impression made me happy, because it suggested that the System was integrated well into my subconsciousness. </p><p>I turned my attention to the rest of the developments. The jump in Seduction was more noteworthy, not that it surprised me considering the nature of the events that led to it. </p><p>Still, I couldn’t help but wonder whether it was just another part of the subconscious integration, giving me those traits just because I expected those based on the events. </p><p>Or it was the nature of the Intent that only supported certain types of Traits regardless of the nature of the gossip. </p><p>While I was focused on my internal ability, the players started arriving one by one. Interestingly, other than the occasional casual comments, none of them bothered to talk with me. I might have assumed that it was them trying to snub me, but they didn’t talk with each other as well. Instead, they picked a booklet and focused on studying. </p><p>No hint of their cheerful attitude from the party, or the explosive energy they displayed during the training. </p><p>However, as Coach Bill entered the room, his face harder than the wall, a remote already in hand, their attitude made more sense. </p><p>Especially when he pressed a button, and all screens started playing various scenes from our opponent of the week. “We have three challenges to face this week, their left tackle, making blitz almost impossible, their second wide receiver, who has a dangerous explosive speed and sure hands to catch contested passes, and their persistent running back,” he started without any preamble, not wasting even a second before he started going deep into the tactical challenges of the game… </p><p>What a serious man. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had a big smile on my face as I drove into the parking lot once more. The little pool adventure worked wonders to put me in a better mood, something that was significantly useful before a long tactical meeting.  </p><p>When I arrived at the stadium once more, I bypassed the locker room and walked toward the meeting room. There were still almost two hours before the meeting started, so I expected to arrive to an empty room. </p><p>I found the lights already turned on. Probably one of the junior coaches to complete the preparations, I guessed.  </p><p>I opened the door, only for my eyes to widen before I could take a step. I was surprised because I was greeted by six huge TVs fixed on the wall, with one composite one in the middle that almost covered the wall completely. Thin and shiny enough to shout they were brand new, I didn’t doubt that even the cheapest cost in five figures, and the one in the middle probably into high five-figures, maybe even into low-six. </p><p>And the library had computers old enough to rival the relics in our museum.  </p><p>I sighed resignation as I took a step inside. Like everything in life, if there was inequality, it was always better to be on the buttery side of the deal. </p><p>“Welcome to the hell, newbie,” was the first thing I had heard as I stepped into the meeting room, only to find Thad already in the room, greeting me with a big smile as he spoke. </p><p>If it wasn’t for his hulking stature and muscular body, it was easy to mistake him for a nerd. Papers piled in front of him, filling his huge desk. Only the middle of the table was empty, and only because he had a laptop — a sleek, expensive one — open, a game playing while he had a pen in hand, taking notes with a speed that would make a sociology doctorate candidate in her favorite class jealous.</p><p>But he wasn’t alone. </p><p>“Hi, Thad,” I said as I turned to the guy next to him. He looked small next to Thad, but it was just an illusion because he wasn’t a literal giant, barely six feet, with a physique that reminded me of a sprinter rather than a football player. His hair was black, with a skin color to match. Still, I didn’t remember him seeing him in practice, or at the party.</p><p>Still, his posture was far too confident to just be a new face.  </p><p>“Captain, this is our newest linebacker recruit, Teddy,” Thad explained. I nodded as I recognized Thad’s intent, subtly warning me about his position, in case I decided to run my mouth. For a blond giant with anger management problems, he was surprisingly sharp and thoughtful under certain circumstances.  </p><p>“So, you’re the surprise nerd that managed to ruin the night of those useless guys,” he commented, his tone surprisingly even. </p><p>“Yes, that’s me,” I said with a shrug. “As Thad mentioned, I’m Teddy, nice to meet you.” </p><p>“Carter,” he answered calmly, then his tone suddenly intensified. “Thad told me that you didn’t play football for almost three years.” </p><p>His tone was smooth, but that didn’t hide the combative nature of his words. He was clearly unhappy with the sudden addition to his team, even as a backup. </p><p>He clearly took his role as the captain rather seriously. </p><p>I said nothing, nor did I take it personally. I would have been unhappy with the sudden addition of a random player, especially one that came with such significant commotion. </p><p>Instead, I pulled out my phone, and showed him the copy of the report and the training plan Coach Carmen had prepared earlier today. “That’s my conditioning report, taken today,” I said as I passed to him. </p><p>There was no harm showing him that, since, as a captain, he would have direct access if he asked the coaches. </p><p>He swiped the screen several times as he intently read the contents before passing it to me. “Not bad,” he said before turning his attention back to Thad. “So, do you think we can defend our B-gap against their run game if they use a surprise gun formation?” he asked as he shifted his attention away, his concerns clearly satisfied. </p><p>He asked no questions about tactics and formations to me, as he clearly not expected me to know anything. A reasonable assumption, considering I was yet to flip a page of the playbook. </p><p>I wanted to interrupt their talk, but Thad once again reacted faster, and threw a booklet for me. “Our core zone coverage plays,” he explained before he turned his attention back to their discussion, discussing various formations and signals. </p><p>“Paper?” I asked even as I turned my gaze toward the many screens and tablets that filled the room. </p><p>“Coach Bill doesn’t like putting our active schemes on anything digital,” Thad explained. “The screens are there to watch the film of the opponents.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but shook my head in amusement as they returned to their discussion, amused by their lack of technological understanding. Even if they were afraid of hackers — which, considering the money involved in college football, was not exactly misguided — all they needed was to connect it to a computer with no internet connection, and it would have been safer than paper. </p><p>Naturally, I kept my mouth shut. I was already unwelcome before starting to throw my opinion about their operations. Certainly not as a chess player, and certainly not on their relative technology usage. Instead, I split my attention between reading the booklet and listening to their focused discussion about the merits of different formations, trying to decide which ones were more likely to be employed by the coach.  </p><p>Not that I missed the irony in their focus. They used nerd as an insult because I was a chess player, yet their studying was every bit intensive as I used for chess, the relative simplicity of football formations — compared to the chess, at least — was balanced by the uncertainty relating to the ability difference, performance of the players, and other factors like exhaustion and injury </p><p>However, as they spoke, I noticed something interesting. Particularly, the writing implement Carter was using. He was using a fountain pen, something that looked a touch out-of-place among piles of football equipment and high-tech screens.  </p><p>I wouldn’t be surprised if Thad had one, as I had seen just how rich he was. Multiple cars and a private villa sounded like a family that thought a fountain pen that was as expensive as a car was a good gift. </p><p>However, the fountain pen of the captain was different, the kind that looked sophisticated, giving the impression and complexity and money at the same time, but I recognized the signs of time on it despite good maintenance. </p><p>An interesting choice, especially combined with his clothing choice. A polo shirt, and khaki pants. Altogether, the more looked like a golf player than a football player. If his clothing had been similarly expensive, I would have guessed that it was a family memento, but I recognized the signs of someone trying to look richer and more sophisticated than their own means. </p><p>Once again, I kept my mouth shut, not really in a mood to delve into the reasons for his carefully-curated image. After all, I was the last person that could blame others for using carefully-crafted personas for their own benefit. </p><p>Instead, I focused on the playbook. </p><p>Just like Thad had mentioned, it was exclusively Zone coverage, and they were the simpler ones.</p><p>That didn’t surprise me. Essentially, there were two types of coverage, man coverage, and zone coverage. In man coverage, each defensive player was assigned to defend a particular skill player on the other side, with only one safety on the back of the line, while in zone schemes, each player had an area they were responsible for. </p><p>Technically, man coverage was the superior option left as it left no in the defense, and on average, the man coverage resulted in smaller plays from the opposing offense. </p><p>Of course, there was a reason zone coverage existed despite the superiority of man coverage. It came two-fold. One, man coverage was more challenging for the defensive players to employ. Not only physical mismatches had been punished horribly, but also each player had to read the offense much better to position themselves correctly. </p><p>So, to employ it efficiently, defense required both the physical superiority — or equality, at least — and a significant experience, a combination hard to come by, especially in college, with a revolving door of players.</p><p>The other, and arguably worse, a drawback of man coverage was that, if the play broke down, it resulted in higher gains, including very long touchdowns.  </p><p>The zone coverage was both simpler and safer in the application. Each player had a zone to defend, and they were not responsible for defending any movement outside their assigned area. </p><p>Unfortunately, with four linemen usually tasked to attack the quarterback, it left seven players to defend the whole backfield, which was hardly efficient. So, there were always gaps between zones, something a skilled quarterback could abuse easily. </p><p>Despite higher-than-average gains for the offense, it wasn’t as bad, as not only it was easier to implement, but also when failed, it didn’t usually result in horrible losses. </p><p>Ultimately, however, like chess, no scheme was so superior that it could be used exclusively. It always relied on trickery to make the opponent have misread, which was why coaches always did their best to disguise their schemes, trying to sell the man coverage as zone, or zone as man. </p><p>It was all about doing what others didn’t expect. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Not a bad start,” I whispered softly. “Continue with your performance, and you have the chance to convince me that you’re actually serious with your declaration of loyalty.” </p><p>“Of course—“ she started, but that was all she was able to say as I slide forward, clogging her beautiful mouth with my shaft once again. </p><p>Yet, this time, it wasn’t the only challenge I had in mind for her. “Strip,” I ordered, which didn’t help her surprise any. </p><p>That surprise only lasted for a second before she put her hands on her shirt, her fingers dancing skillfully. It wasn’t a sexy way of undressing, as her actions were too sharp, too utilitarian to reflect an aura of sexiness. Combined with the other activities she was delivering, it felt considerably better. </p><p>She even managed to surprise me in turn with the speed she was able to shed her clothing while busy taking my shaft to her throat, showing the benefits of her phenomenal flexibility as a ranger to the limit. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel curious about the limits of her flexibility as she gave me a preview, so the moment I pulled back, an order left my lips. “Turn your back to me, bend down, and grab your ankles,” I ordered. </p><p>She looked confused at the order, but that didn’t make her delay before complying. On the contrary, she was getting faster following my orders, showing that she was still adapting to her new role, and showing great gusto while doing so. </p><p>It didn’t take long for her to understand my aim as I rubbed my shaft against her entrance, earning a beautiful moan. “Ohh,” she gasped, unable to resist the pleasure. </p><p>“No moans,” I ordered, mostly to add a layer of punishment to our little game. After all, with everything she had done to me, she did earn some punishment. “You need to pay back for your disrespect.” </p><p>“Y-yes, my lord,” she whispered, unable to prevent a slight stammer as I rubbed my shaft against her wet lips. Yet, the speed of her adaptation to her role kept impressing me. </p><p>“Start moving back,” I ordered, asking her to move despite her challenging pose. Once again, it didn’t even stagger her as she worked her hips, and she started rocking back and forth, at a perfect pace, coating the top side of my shaft with her wetness. </p><p>I could feel her wetness intensifying with each passing second, her wetness turning into a beautiful river. She managed to follow my order and kept herself from moaning, but she closed her eyes and threw her head back just to process the unfamiliar sensation. </p><p>“Faster,” I ordered. Once again, her obedience was instantaneous, but this time, it came with another reaction. She started biting her lips to imprison her moans, hard enough to leave a mark on her lips. Seeing her pouty lips, ones that almost always carried a sharp, intimidating frown, struggle to contain the signs of pleasure was certainly beautiful. </p><p>Though, not as beautiful as the way her nether lips widened in preparation, begging for my invasion. </p><p>And, as much as teasing Isolde was tempting, it wasn’t as tempting as taking that invitation to drill her mercilessly. </p><p>“Open your eyes,” I ordered. </p><p>She did so, which hardly made her attempts to keep her moans inside easier. Yet, the challenge was nothing compared to the other source, the crown of my shaft slowly sliding inside her core, forcing her lips to reshape around. </p><p>“Yes,” she managed to whisper as the sensation of slowly being filled up hit her, only for my hand to explode on her ass, the spank cracking loud enough to echo. </p><p>“No moans,” I reminded her, then made a show of looking like I wanted to think. “Maybe I should stop. You clearly can’t handle it, if you can’t even fulfill the simplest of commands.” </p><p>“No, please,” she gasped as she pushed her hips back desperately, giving me her first disobedience. Yet, I expected it, so I pulled back as she did so, managing to keep the crown inside her without letting her slide more. I grabbed her hips. </p><p>“How dare you? Maybe I should stop if you’re not going to follow orders,” I ordered as my hand exploded on her ass, turning into a grip to immobilize her. Yet, I noticed her hands around her wrists getting looser. “Don’t change your pose,” I added, and she followed it quickly. </p><p>“I’m sorry, my lord,” she whimpered, the desperation of her tone shocking me, a tone that I had never expected to hear from her. “I … I have never felt something so intense. I … I lost control.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle, though it had a touch of pity. Maybe her issues with failing to get aroused were worse than I had expected, if she had turned this desperate this quickly. I wouldn’t have been surprised if it had been a weaker girl, but for all her faults, Isolde was strong. </p><p>And just how intense was her problem to make such strength turn into whimpers in just minutes — though, admittedly, my skill played no little role in the extent she was crumbling. “You’re lucky that I’m a merciful lord,” I said even as I pushed forward, impaling her mercilessly, which made my words rather ironic. </p><p>Isolde gasped as my shaft pushed in, forcing her virgin core to widen rapidly. It must have been an uncomfortable sensation, at least partially, but Isolde’s moan was one of pure pleasure, showing just how much she enjoyed the reckless invasion. Though, her moan wasn’t as decisive as the sudden trembling that started affecting her, showing that my reckless push also managed to trigger a climax.</p><p>That wasn’t a reason for me to stop, of course. I tightened my grip on her hips before starting to push forward recklessly, filling the cell with the sound of flesh hitting flesh with undertones of squishing. Her whimpers were quick to join, the invasion of pleasure breaking her commitment to keeping herself from moaning. </p><p>Her determination lost against her pleasure, and did so spectacularly. </p><p>“So, how’s the feeling of giving your first time to your lord,” I whispered as I quickened my assault. </p><p>Her answer came in the form of a whisper, though her tone was garbled as I rammed her faster, the combination of shame and pleasure enough to keep her mouth shut. Yet, even if she had been having some last-minute regrets about declaring her loyalty, her body clearly disagreed completely with such actions. </p><p>I continued my assault, her moans and cries creating a beautiful backdrop. Yet, when I pulled back, those moans were cut instant. “I’m sorry, my lord,” she gasped panickedly, not wanting to lose the pleasure she was receiving. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I just want to change positions. Sit on the bed, then, put your legs behind your neck,” I ordered, wanting to explore the benefits of her flexibility in a fun manner. </p><p>She followed my orders with a quickness that was only possible for a dedicated warrior, and before I could even walk to the bed, she was in front of me, her legs behind her neck, presenting her entrance like a gift. </p><p>I pressed my hands on her thighs, forcing her to stretch even more as I slid my shaft back in. </p><p>Then, exploded into action, drilling mercilessly. </p><p>It was even more aggressive than my earlier show, the position allowing me to put my strength into every push without a worry — well, the way the bed cracked was a sense of worry, but not a big one — as I taught her the true meaning of physical subservience. </p><p>Her cries exploded even louder, filling the room, once again making me very glad about the silencing spell I had used. As my cock disappeared into the depths that were untouched just moments ago, she was getting tighter and tighter under the exertion. </p><p>Under my assault, I could the reflection of another growing arousal in her beautiful eyes, her cries carrying the aura of surrender. Yet, along with that orgasm, there was fascination in her eyes, like she was unable to believe how such a pleasure was possible. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s just a preview,” I whispered even as I continued my reckless assault.</p><p>“Impossible…” she murmured, her tone getting dazed like she was unable to believe more pleasure could be possible. “So big, so deep…” </p><p>“Oh, sweetie,” I said, unable to help but chuckle at her reaction. After all, size was just a part of the equation, and while Isolde’s personal preferences indicated that she clearly needed it, the pleasure she was feeling was nothing compared to the ones she would feel with the assistance of a few select items. </p><p>I had a feeling that chains and collars would work particularly well on her. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t bother explaining to her that since I wouldn’t be able to use those at the moment. Not because of a lack of equipment, as magic was certainly useful to handle such deficiencies rather easily, but the lack of time… </p><p>After all, I still had a lot of work to do. </p><p>“Yes, yes, yes,” she started to whimper as the arousal started to reach the boiling point, like an addict that was begging for another dose. “So big… So good…” </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk smugly as I continued to drill her. Of course, Isolde wasn’t the only woman that had moaned under my weight with such intensity, but that didn’t change the fact that seeing such an accomplished warrior submit completely was fun. </p><p>Just like sunrises. It might not be the first sunrise one sees, but that didn’t take anything from the unique wonder… </p><p>Soon, her moans reached a point of climax, and her trembling started once again, but this time, she wasn’t alone. Her tightening triggered a climax of my own. My shaft tightened, filling her core with my seed with each twitch… </p><p>Properly marking her loyalty… </p><p>I pulled back, taking a deep breath as I watched her trembling body, her legs finally removed from her neck, and lay supine, listless, the rapid invasion of pleasure enough to break her resistance. </p><p>All I needed to decide what to do next, starting to work on her freedom… </p><p>Or maybe, test her loyalty once more…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Impossible,” I murmured, unable to prevent myself from watching the Spear of Scipio as it slowly floated into my presence. </p><p>It was truly impossible. The spear shouldn’t react to my presence.  </p><p>Not unless I had a bestowment ritual… </p><p>The presence of the bow and the sword that was floating toward me didn’t make processing that idea any easier, but the reaction of the Spear was simply too significant to focus on them. </p><p>If it had been any other circumstance, I wouldn’t have dared to use the Spear, afraid of the backlash it would create for daring to tap into its abilities. Unfortunately, the sight of three weapons floating toward me finally forced my opponents out of their passive state. </p><p>Three of them sent spells at me, two of them sending balls of flame, the other choosing to send an earth spike. Yet, it was evidence of their passivity that the two of them still stayed focused on defense. </p><p>Facing a rain of spells, with my magic still too wild to be used, my reflexes worked faster than I could prevent myself. My clawed fingers wrapped around the hilt of the spear and swung it in a familiar manner… </p><p>One that I had been on the receiving side hundreds of times, and repeatedly using an ordinary spear thousands of times to perfect when I was just a young boy, hoping that, despite my heritage, I would somehow use it. </p><p>A dream I abandoned years ago. </p><p>Yet, that dream was resurrected in a moment that I never expected, a warm sensation that I never felt before invading my body as I touched the spear, resonating with something deep inside me, the thumping of the spear following the same pace. I didn’t have time to enjoy the sensation, however, busy swinging the spear, deflecting the spells back to them with the same ease my grandfather would have done. </p><p>A familiar scene, though I had been on the other side thousands of times, usually hearing dismissive laughter from my grandfather with every spell he reflected on me, claiming that he just wanted to stay sharp while training me. That old codger even mocked me repeatedly about my destiny of never touching it. </p><p>Yet, the spear was in my hand, obeying me, and there was only one reason for that. </p><p>I had received an endowment ritual, a ritual that could only be conducted by a male of Scipio blood that also received the endowment ritual, and it could only be conducted when the target was a baby, just days after the birth. </p><p>And, considering the impossibility of my dear uncle doing so, there was only one possibility. My grandfather had cast the ritual. </p><p>This meant that all the times he told me that he had been ‘training’ with the spear was him training me, yet he never told me the truth, hiding it behind a layer of mockery… </p><p>Like my feelings toward him hadn’t been complicated enough. </p><p>Ironically, my ability to use the Spear of Scipio wasn’t even the most complicated question I was facing. For that, I at least had a reason to understand why I could use that. </p><p>I was only able to spare a glance at two other weapons that were floating next to me, just enough to get a general impression before charging forward. One was a sword, made from gleaming bronze but otherwise unadorned, giving an aura of bloodthirst, the other a bow, made of gold and ivory, its surface covered with curvy lines, foreign yet familiar. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t have time to focus on their details, not when I noticed four more spells flying toward me. I swung the spear once more, batting away another two spells back to my attackers, and dodged the other two before dashing forward, ignoring the weapons floating behind me. </p><p>Patrician weapons were not simple tools that could simply be used once picked up. The only reason I was able to use the spear was the endless number of times I had suffered under its unique abilities and my years of hopeless practice to copy its effects in my youth. </p><p>Picking random weapons was certainly not sustainable, as evidenced by the way the clunky way my opponents used theirs to defend themselves. They still managed to access some simple abilities like spell deflection, but that was not what made Patrician Weapons a strategic weapon that ensured the lineage of a Patrician family — at least allowing a collapsed one like Scipio to escape into Provinces rather than being exterminated. </p><p>Spell deflection was almost a side effect, one that came from their unique nature. Their true function was their special abilities. </p><p>The abilities were not that easy to discover, as my grandfather had lamented more than once. Some abilities required knowing the correct technique, while the others required more power than a casual user was able to invest — after all, not all families were lucky enough to have sorcerers in their direct line every generation. </p><p>And since my opponents were yet to use any other ability, it was reasonable to believe that they either didn’t have to know any other ability, or those abilities were not appropriate for the current combat situation. </p><p>Not that it changed the monumental impact of having that many Patrician weapons in the same room. If it wasn’t for the presence and the reaction of the spear — my spear — I would have assumed that they were just imitations, but there was no way I would mistake the Spear of Scipio for an imitation. </p><p>And I was in the secret base of a man that was able to collect more than a dozen Patrician weapons to the same room. </p><p>I really knew how to make enemies. </p><p>Being scared of a mysterious enemy didn’t mean that I would hold back against them. The things I had done up to this point were enough to ensure they would target me forever. And considering they had the treasured weapon of my family — however complicated my feelings were about it — meant that I wouldn’t make peace with them in any case. </p><p>Though, I would have preferred to handle my enmity from a position of strength rather than delivering it from their center of power with little preparation. If I knew the lengths of the opposition I would have faced, I would have arrived with better equipment. </p><p>All of those, I thought even as I charged toward the five mages that created the biggest threat for me, but with the Spear in hand, they were not an enormous threat that I needed to risk my life anymore. Their earlier advantage came from their weapons, giving them an edge to defend my spell. </p><p>With that gone, and my magic still blanketing the room, they were like a herd of donkeys to defend against a wolf. Technically, they had the firepower to defend against the threat, but lacked the attitude to apply that. </p><p>Ironically, their problem wasn’t the same as donkeys. Donkeys would have panicked and scattered, and they were clearly lacking in such base emotions. Ironically, their problem was the opposite, the lack of fear. </p><p>If there was one thing the endless tests my grandfather taught me, that fear was an even better weapon than anger if yielded correctly, the will to survive incarnate. </p><p>Fighting against someone without a number sense of survival was much better, especially since we had the power parity once more. They had their weapons, I had mine. They had their dragon hearts, and I had mine. They had their magic… </p><p>And I had mine, which, even impaired, still enough to challenge theirs — mostly thanks to the effect of the Spear, helping me to regulate my magic. </p><p>What I had and they didn’t have was the endless torture disguised as training, and a desire to survive. </p><p>I waved my hand, summoning fourteen bolts of lightning despite knowing that using any spell was dangerous. Just as I used a spell, I could feel the transformation getting stronger. </p><p>None of those bolts were strong enough to seriously wound them, but they did their best to defend them either way, lacking the tactical ability to prioritize their defense. Despite the odd number, the attack was. </p><p>They were spread in a square formation, with one defending them, giving them the ability to defend themselves from attacks from all angles. It was the most stable defensive formation they could create. </p><p>But with that stability, came weakness. </p><p>All that remained was whether I could leverage that weakness before my transformation caught up with me. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t bother to put my swimsuit back on as I walked to the showers, just wrapping a towel around my waist, as putting on a speedo while I had a raging boner would hardly be comfortable. </p><p>Of course, it was hardly pleasant to be blue-balled, but a public pool, even when it was blocked, was hardly the location to push Megan’s limits,  especially since she would enjoy cutting me off just when I reached the edge regardless. I couldn’t help but have a grudging respect for her personality. She had a killer instinct I wouldn’t expect from a girl who looked like a blonde bimbo. </p><p>Pity we would break up after the game. I would have loved to make her pay properly, rather than the little challenge I had deployed earlier. </p><p>My mind was busy with little revenge fantasies that wouldn’t come to reality when I arrived at the locker room. Which was still empty, so I threw my towel to the side, and directly stepped to the showers. </p><p>I was trying to decide to relative merits of quick masturbation and just showering, when my little mental arithmetic was interrupted by the sound of a door opening. </p><p>“Really, Megan—“ I started as I turned, only to see a very noticeable redness rather than the blonde I was expecting, walking toward me with a rather smug attitude. </p><p>“Can I help you, Kimberly?” I asked her, wanting to annoy her a bit since I didn’t appreciate the interruption to my little plan. Luckily, she didn’t bring her camera with her, which made me feel calmer than the alternative. </p><p>“Call me Kim,” she answer, her voice laced with a threat. Yet, her annoyance didn’t prevent her from walking forward until she stood at the edge of the shower. “I’m here to talk to you about our date.” </p><p>“Let me guess, you want it to be canceled,” I said with a sigh, though I couldn’t say that I was unhappy about the decision she was about to deliver. I wasn’t exactly flush with cash to make it a fun date, nor did I have a lot of free time. </p><p>I even joined the earlier pool adventure, however fun, only because of the extra traits such a scandalous reveal would bring. </p><p>“Not exactly,” she answered, interestingly, not stopping even after she stepped into the shower, reaching to turn off the water before she kicked her boots off and stepped inside. “I’m more interested in an express date, if you don’t mind,” she answered. </p><p>The idea of an express date was quite nebulous, but that uncertainty was quick to disappear as I watched her removing her pants smoothly, revealing that she was wearing a delicious g-string that didn’t exactly fit into the rebellious aura she was trying to convey. </p><p>Though, it wasn’t as clear as the way she fell on her knees wordlessly in front of me, pushing me against the ceramic wall, her lips already parted, going a long way to show that the idea of an express date wasn’t as unpalatable as it first sounded. </p><p>“You’re such a good friend, solving the problem your bestie created,” I said, couldn’t help but chuckle in amusement, though I decided not to push her too much when her warning came in the form of her teeth scraping against my length, suggesting that she was not above punishing me. </p><p>I decided not to tease the sexy redhead who currently had the advantage over me. </p><p>Luckily, the way her lips tightened around my shaft gave me something more important to focus on, especially when her hands joined our little game soon after, wrapping around the base, pumping with a matching pace. </p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured even as her lips and hands worked wonders around my shaft, though, the passion she was displaying in her presence was less about the little trick her friend pulled, and more about the strain she might have felt as she spent a considerable time photographing our aggressive foreplay.</p><p>Maybe Seduction was a tad more effective than I expected. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but grunt as the pleasure hit, especially since I was already not too distant from the climax. I took a deep breath, doing my best to prevent a quick release — which was much harder after the extended game I had played with Megan. </p><p>Luckily — or unluckily, from a certain point of view — Kim didn’t push herself to take my full length inside. Without the great explosion of feeling the tightness of her throat would have brought, I managed to hold back the temptation to release, giving me some time to resist. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I said, doing my best to sound casual even as I watched her. “Though, do you plan to actually start working on it, or do you plan to act as weak as the blondie.” </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she murmured as she pulled back momentarily. </p><p>I shrugged. “Hey, if you can’t handle it…” </p><p>“You’re really pushing your luck,” she responded, though the way her fingers dug into my leg, I decided not to push it too much. Then, her smirk widened. “But, if you’re challenging, let’s see if you can handle a proper one for more than a few seconds.” </p><p>She followed her statement with a surprising aggressiveness, her hands tightening around my legs as she pushed forward. Yet, her task wasn’t as easy as she hoped as my shaft hit her throat, a beautiful gag escaping despite her full mouth. </p><p>“Not as easy as you hoped, right?” I asked. It earned an angry glare, but she continued to push herself, managing to make my shaft disappear more and more. </p><p>It took a lot to hold back a moan of my own as the tightness of her throat wrapped around it tightly. </p><p>“I think you need a little help,” I suggested just as I grabbed her head without a warning. The widening of her eyes was beautiful. “Of course, you can just blink if you don’t think you can handle it.” </p><p>Her eyes flared in anger, but her eyelids avoided moving determinedly, taking my challenge. </p><p>I was impressed with her courage, but not enough to make an allowance for her before I pushed forward, and I did it mercilessly. A push was enough to cover the distance she had failed to take, impaling her throat completely. </p><p>The pain of such an invasion would have resulted in a desperate cry in anyone else, but Kim impressed me by restricting herself to a grunt between her gags. A grunt that implied a lot of pain, but also pleasure, suggesting a surprisingly submissive side to a girl that showed such aggression.</p><p>Or maybe, it was just her way of signaling her preferences.  </p><p>Incredibly, as I continued to impale her throat, she managed to keep her eyes open, her gaze looking up, her gaze between a belligerent sharpness and a submissive acceptance. A surprising paradox.  </p><p>That surprise didn’t make me stop. I continued to invade her throat repeatedly, without mercy, curious whether she would fold first, or my resistance would fail. </p><p>Ultimately, after the great challenge her friend had put on me, I folded first. </p><p> I exploded without a warning, filling her mouth with her reward. Her eyes widened as she felt the sudden throbbing, but it was too late for her to pull back even if she had the ability. “Not bad,” I said as I caressed her hair, while she stayed there, struggling to swallow, afraid of ruining her outfit. </p><p>When she pulled back, she had been coughing softly. </p><p>“Naughty, not warning me,” she said after she managed to get control of her breathing, spitting to the side, which was easy to wash away in a shower. She looked at me sharply, no doubt expecting an apology. </p><p>I shrugged, with no intention of giving her that. “It’s your friend’s fault, leaving me on the edge,” I said. “She took her reward and left, leaving me helpless.” </p><p>“Yeah,” she said as she stood up, chuckling despite her attempt to look angry. “Megan can be a handful to manage.” I shrugged, and she started walking away, the beautiful sway of her hips by no means a natural movement, especially with the intentional slowness she displayed when she leaned down to pick her pants,, giving me an extended glimpse of her tight ass. </p><p>Sexy enough to make a certain part of me grew again despite the earlier explosion. </p><p>Just as she was about to leave, she turned, gazing down to see the evidence of her work. When she looked up, she was sporting a playful smirk. “Pity you’re going to break up soon. We might have had some real fun otherwise…” she said before leaving. </p><p>I shook my head in amusement even as I returned to my shower. </p><p>No wonder they were best friends. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but smile in anticipation as I looked down at the caramel beauty in front of me, her legs parting readily as she pushed forward, more than happy with the punishment she was about to receive. </p><p>Not that I blamed her. Considering some of our earlier encounters in our relationship, it could be hardly considered a punishment, but I neither had the time nor the inclination to punish her for real, especially with the Princess’ team waiting on the edge, waiting to latch on to the opportunity to actually convert her to their side. </p><p>I was confident in preventing that, of course, but that was under the condition that I was around to intervene — a fact that I could no longer take as a given considering the recent chain of events. I couldn’t guarantee that I would be around, and it was for the better not to leave Oeyne’s vulnerable to their political predations.  </p><p>Of course, there was another, more primal, reason for my decision. It was hard to deny having such a beautiful and accomplished woman in front of me, parting her legs obediently to receive her ‘punishment’. </p><p>I couldn’t help but lean forward further and bite her shoulder, leaving a soft mark — one that I made permanent with a little application of a healing spell by modifying a scar-removal spell — to underline my ownership. </p><p>“You’re mine,” I growled as I grabbed her hips and impaled her, earning a loud moan. There was not a little bit of gentleness in my push, but she clearly didn’t mind that the slightest of her moan was any indicator. </p><p>Or the notification I just received, the numbers working excellently to show the depth of her pleasure. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 41%] </p><p>Meanwhile, my hands tightened around her waist, enjoying the feeling of her supple skin while her back arched under the aggressive invasion, her body melding against my transmission. </p><p>Yet, just because I decided not to punish her didn’t mean that I wouldn’t use the opportunity to drive my message deeper. “So, tell me, what was your biggest mistake,” I asked. </p><p>“Losing the game —“ she started, only to be interrupted by a slap to her beautiful breast, making it jiggle erotically, which was further enhanced by her beautiful moan. </p><p>“No, it wasn’t that. Try again.” </p><p>The pleasure invaded her body after my spank, but I was happy to see that, behind that, a thoughtful expression appeared as she considered my question again. “Betting too much —“ she started, only to receive another spank, this time twisting her nipple in the process. </p><p>After the twist, it took a while for her moans to subside, her body tensing as the pleasure reached a level that would have triggered an explosion if it wasn’t for the spell that kept her on the edge. </p><p>I kept that spell ongoing, as it was the only thing that underlined the sense of punishment. </p><p>Even though it came with a reward at the end. </p><p>“Try again, but this time, try to think based on my warnings.” </p><p>She paused for a long while, trying to think, which didn’t get any easier with the steady rhythm of my hips invading her core repeatedly. “P-playing with them,” she managed to stammer after a while, her hesitant tone interrupted by moans, making it even harder for her to answer. </p><p>I leaned forward, softly kissing the bite mark that I left earlier on her shoulder, then moving to kiss her neck. “Good work,” I whispered into her ear. I rose back, once again focusing on the steady movement of my hips. “Don’t forget that they are not our allies, and they have nebulous objectives. The less involved you get with them, the better.” </p><p>“But… But what if they ask me for more.” </p><p>“Tell that the headmistress has an urgent request from you, and start working on the most complicated, the most nebulous research project you have, and say that you’re under orders not to stop for anything except helping me forge the item they need once my research is complete.” </p><p>“But…” she gasped in shock. “Faking an order from the headmistress is —“ she started, only to be interrupted by another slap to her beautiful breast, this time hard enough to leave a mark. </p><p>“Who do you think you’re talking with. If I say the headmistress would send an order, it means that she’ll send an order. No question about that.” </p><p>As I talked, I let my hands wander, climbing up until they arrived at her spectacular globes. But this time, rather than visiting for a flash, they stayed on their glorious peaks, digging down harshly. </p><p>She moaned as I kneaded her tits aggressively, her moans rising even more as her tunnels tightened, extracting a moan from me as well. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 47%]</p><p>“Then, the next question. Tell me everything that happened during the game, particularly about the Princess’ handmaid. First, what was her name?” </p><p>“D-Delia,” Oeyne said. Unfortunately, with their spectacular ability to change their looks, it was impossible for me to be sure whether what Oeyne said was accurate or she had been in disguise. Yet, it needed to be asked before going to the next stage. </p><p>“Good, now, tell me everything you can remember about what Delia said and did,” I added. Her expression of shock was understandable. While she had an impressive memory thanks to her stats and could remember her actions in great detail even if she hadn’t paid much attention to them during the game, her current position wasn’t exactly conducive for accurate recall. </p><p>Luckily, my aim was not to listen to her observations but to add another layer of punishment to our game. Unfortunately, with their ability to modify their skills, anything Oeyne managed to notice would have been under subject. </p><p>Yet, it worked wonderfully to increase her strain even more, with the added benefit of exerting my power over her even more, triggering her submissive nature. </p><p>I focused on her body as she talked, squeezing and kneading her beautiful breasts while my hips worked steadily into her core. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 50% - Second Stage Completed +10000 Exp]</p><p>[New Perk: Mana Regeneration]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>It was always nice to receive another instance for mana regeneration, as if my recent experiences taught me anything, there was no such thing as too much mana. </p><p>Meanwhile, Oeyne was gasping in shock for a different reason. “A-another achievement,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Sweetie, when you’re with me, a measly achievement is the least of your rewards,” I answered as I leaned forward, interrupting her next words by pressing my lips against her busty chest, making her moan beautifully in the process. </p><p>With her arousal unable to come to full fruition thanks to my spell, her moans were getting more and more delirious. I smirked, but not just due to her amazing moans. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 55%]</p><p>It was amazing to see her passing another milestone without a skip, though I had a feeling that our earlier discussion played a significant role in increasing her trust in me, which, in turn, allowed her companion's progress to improve even further. </p><p>Amazing achievement. </p><p>I grabbed her tight yet bountiful ass, my fingers encasing her bubble butt in my merciless grip. She let out a beautiful gasp while I explored every single inch of her beautiful breasts with my tongue, each brush making her moan even harder. </p><p>“So, Oeyne,” I whispered when I pulled back for a breather, interrupting her chain moans. “Tell me. Are you enjoying this?” </p><p>Her answer was never in doubt. “Yes!” she cried loudly, her voice echoing against the walls, strong enough to deafen a weaker man. And, more importantly, it wasn’t the only action she displayed that had the potential to injure a weaker man. Her legs wrapped around my waist, carelessly applying her strength as she pulled me deeper, one that showed her growing arousal. </p><p>Not that I needed any other sign, not with the way arousal was dancing behind her lovely brown eyes… </p><p>“Do you think you earned a climax,” I asked, unable to reject the temptation of growing arousal? </p><p>“Y-yes,” she gasped in answer, though her usual confidence replaced by a hesitant tremble, successfully giving an aura of begging — one that was wrapped in a nice erotic package. </p><p>“How daring,” I growled, giving a menacing tone, one that made her gasp in fear, a fear that had absolutely no impact on her arousal. I replaced that with a smirk soon. “Luckily for you, you deserve it,” I told her even as I leaned forward to twist her nipple, while simultaneously canceling the spell that was keeping her on the edge. </p><p>The resulting explosion of moans and fluids was spectacular, especially with the speed she tightened around me, finally breaking my ability to reject the temptation of arousal, filling her… </p><p>Of course, that was not the end, not when I had been receiving such incredible benefits from our little dance. I let her catch her breath before we started again. For me, it was amazing from both perspectives, watching her moans intensify. </p><p>Though, as much as I loved her toned caramel legs wrapped around me, it wasn’t the reason I was pushing her without break despite having so many things to deal with — including a dragon to interrogate. </p><p>The answer popped into my sight after almost three hours of intense lovemaking… </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 75% - Second Stage Completed +15000 Exp]</p><p>[New Perk: Skill Share]</p><p>It was good timing, because, under the endless rush of pleasure, Oeyne was on the edge of collapse already, and the fresh pleasure broke her resistance. “A…another perk,” she gasped. “This time, even stronger.” </p><p>“I know, sweetie. I want you to be stronger in case you face a threat,” I added before leaning forward and stealing a kiss. “Now, why don’t you take a nap while I go and work. And don’t forget to stay away from the princess’ team, and don’t agree to anything before talking to me.” </p><p>“A-as you wish,” she murmured. “A nap wouldn’t be…” she added, unable to finish her sentence before the exhaustion caught up with her. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, how does it feel to be on the other side of the bindings for once?” she whispered as she leaned forward again, giving me another glimpse of her deep cleavage while she examined the chains that were keeping me in place. </p><p>“Can’t complain,” I answered as I looked at her, unable to hide the growing smile as I noted the careful way she listened to my tone, her smile getting wider. Without my phenomenal observation, I might have assumed that it was just the satisfaction of keeping her partner happy, but there was a certain urgency in her gaze. </p><p>She was too transparent for me to miss her aim. She wanted to ask for a favor. </p><p>I deliberately didn’t ask her about that. Not that I wasn’t curious about the reason. I certainly was, especially since with our relationship, she should be able to ask a lot of reasonable things of me. More importantly, it was clearly not a major issue, which would have driven her to a panicked state rather than her current impatient yet playful combination.  </p><p>However, just because I wanted to learn didn’t mean I was in a hurry to learn about that, especially not if asking directly would ruin the mood she was doing her best to establish. </p><p>She leaned forward further under my appreciative gaze, bringing her lips against the crown of my shaft, a little gasp escaping her beautiful mouth as her tongue jumped out, licking along the length of it. “Mmm, delicious,” she moaned in appreciation, though her satisfaction a touch exaggerated. </p><p>It was clearly an attempt to enhance my satisfaction before she finally asked for the favor she needed.  </p><p>Not that it was a great chore for me to stand on the other side of it, watching as Oeyne’s lips slowly travel down, the head of my shaft disappearing from the view as the warmth of her mouth hit. </p><p> I just leaned back, giving her the space she needed to work at the pace she desired. She did look a touch uncomfortable with the sudden freedom she found herself, expecting me to take back control at any moment, but that didn’t prevent her from going deeper. </p><p>The desire dancing behind her beautiful eyes didn’t allow for anything else. </p><p>It might be the favor that was making her push more aggressively than she might have otherwise acted, but ultimately, it wasn’t like she was committing a great chore that was anathema to her personality, not when our last time was too close for the memories of pleasure to fade away from her mind.  </p><p>I obediently stayed chained while she convinced me to work on my shaft splendidly, her soft fingers — which was a miracle thanks to the System considering her job as a blacksmith — and her even softer breasts alternated around my shaft, continuously maintaining a tense warmth. </p><p>A tenseness that was slowly getting more splendid as she got more comfortable with the unfamiliar position, slowly building up experience under the guidance of my grunts. Though, if there was one drawback to my current position, it didn’t allow me to grab her hair and pull it down, allowing me to leverage the tightness of her throat even more. </p><p>Luckily, she lacked the personality to continue teasing slowly and keep me on the edge, too direct to enjoy that aspect. I could only imagine how Cornelia would have reacted if I allowed her such power over me even for a fantasy. </p><p>Maybe I should visit her and try that… </p><p>As Oeyne pushed her head down, her throat clamping around my shaft, the pleasure that radiated worked wonders to bring my attention back to the present. </p><p>It was not exactly comfortable for her as well, indicated by her gags and gasps, but it was hardly the most uncomfortable position she had ever faced in our little games. She stayed focused on her task of bringing me to completion. </p><p>If I was a merciful man, I would have let it explode after starting to feel the stirrings of a climax, filling her throat with my seed. Yet, while I had many positive qualities, mercy was hardly one of those. </p><p>Keeping myself from climaxing was not difficult — though not trivial as well, not with the great pleasure her throat was providing for me. </p><p>It didn’t take long for her gaze to rise — without even pulling back, making the view even more amazing — to catch mine. “It’s your self-appointed task, sweetie,” I said. “You need to work hard and finish it.” </p><p>Even without angling for a favor, she wouldn’t have rejected such an order, but the presence of that yet-to-be-named favor forced her to go even deeper. Framing it as a challenge forced her to challenge her limits even more. She grabbed my hips and pushed herself down, enveloping my shaft even more spectacularly. </p><p>She moved even deeper, her throat around my girth much stronger than the chains around my wrists. She lingered there without taking a breath, going in and out, but never pulling back enough to allow herself to take a breath in the process. </p><p>As she continued bobbing over my shaft, I considered freeing my hands, to accompany her for more interesting tasks. </p><p>Before I could make that decision, however, Oeyne pulled back. “Surrendering already?” I said with mock disappointment. “Maybe I shouldn’t have trusted you to handle it…” </p><p>“In your dreams,” Oeyne growled as she looked at me, her determination to ‘win’ intensified even further with my constant mocking. Yet, even as she looked down, I could see her determination fading, her confidence damaged by her earlier lack of success. </p><p>I chuckled, which fueled her anger immediately. “I’ll show you,” she added as she shifted forward. But this time, she didn’t lean forward but shifted her hips, sheathing my shaft with her wet core. </p><p>Another moan exploded off her lips as she pushed herself down, skewering herself with my shaft, another moan rising in response. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 27%] </p><p>I smiled at the notification. It was progress that was never unwelcome. </p><p>Oeyne’s hips started to rock, unaware that she was working for another very useful perk for herself and strengthening me at the same time. Her hands landed on my shoulders for leverage, using her freedom to dance back and forth along with my lap as her warmth tightened around my girth. </p><p>My hands were tied, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t pull tricks in other ways. I cast a Biomancy spell, one that would block her from climaxing, making sure that she wouldn’t be enjoying herself too much without a consequence even as I deliberately left her attempts fruitless. </p><p>Oeyne rocked hard on my lap, unaware of the trap she had already stepped in, too distracted by the pleasure to notice my subtle spell. Soon, her face started to darken, the pleasure making her skin flush to deepen her caramel tone. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 32%] </p><p>The rapid progress was rather impressive, showing the depths of her pleasure. </p><p>She didn’t say anything as she continued her self-appointed mission, but that didn’t mean she didn’t make any noise. Her moans exploded against the walls.</p><p>Yet, it was the desperate quality in those moans that attracted me. It started slow, coming from subconsciousness, but for all her direct attitude and self-destructive ways, she wasn’t stupid. It didn’t take long for her to realize the unnaturalness of her explosion. </p><p>“What did you do?” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Hey, don’t go blaming me just because you’re not as good as you could be,” I murmured. </p><p>“You used a spell, didn’t you?” she blamed, though her hips didn’t stop even for a second even as she blamed me for that. </p><p>“Yes, but only on you,” I answered smugly. “After all, it would be unfair to finish before your guest, wouldn’t it be? Of course, if you beg for it, I might pity you and let it slide. What do you say?”</p><p>“Never,” she growled, her passion renewed by the challenge as her hips moved even faster. I could have tried to push for more, but that meant that they could have a unique approach to the other aspects of the game. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 36%] </p><p>“Good,” I said mockingly as her hips started moving once more, my teasing tone making her move even faster. “It’s good that you have the discipline to finish what you have started. Otherwise, we would stay here all day, not having any opportunity to talk about the favor you’re clearly about to ask.” </p><p>“W-what favor,” she gasped in shock, her expression beautifully twisted in panic while her hips stilled. “I didn’t say anything about a favor.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said as I smirked. “So, are you saying that you don’t have a favor to ask? If so, it’s clearly my mistake.” </p><p>She looked at me, her expression of panic would have been pitiful if she was a weak woman. But, considering she was a mid-twenty level blacksmith, strong in battle and in crafting at the same time, it only made the moment more erotic. </p><p>It was fun to watch such a self-possessed beauty panic over such a small thing, especially since if she stopped even for a moment to think, she would realize there was nothing bad about asking me a favor after everything. Yet, caught in a moment, she froze helplessly.</p><p>“No wonder you always lose while gambling,” I said with a chuckle, which made her expression flare in a momentary frustration. “Don’t worry, I’ll help you. Tell me what I do I need to do?” </p><p>“I… I lost while gambling,” she said, followed by a number that made my eyes widen. </p><p>“Damn girl,” I said even as I waved my hand, breaking the chains that were holding me. “That’s an impressive number. Who the hell had that much money.” Then, combined with her hesitation, it clicked with me. “Don’t tell me that you lost it to someone from the Princess’ party, after my warning.” </p><p>Her expression of desolation was beautiful. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll help,” I said, as I had no intention of abandoning Oeyne to their clutches. Then, I grabbed her waist and throw her on the other end of the bed, her back pressing against its soft fabric, her legs spread apart. </p><p>Then, I waved my hands, and her covers turned into chains, wrapping around her arms and legs. “But first, a little lesson about gambling irresponsibly…” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>There were good ways to wake up, and there were bad ways to wake up. </p><p>Waking up to the sweet chatter of the birds after a nap on the beach, with the sun warming up my bones was a good example of the good ways. Waking up on my desk with the blaring of an alarm, reminding me that a work day was about to start despite working until five in the morning, forcing me to face another day with little to no sleep — a scene that was more familiar in my youth, where I had been working to build up my business… </p><p>Then, there were excellent ways to wake up. </p><p>It was much rarer compared to more ordinary good and bad ways, but being woken up while buried in a comfortable bed, pronounced yet slight chill of the air conditioning just enough to tell me that I was naked.</p><p>Yet, that chilly sensation was absent in a certain part of my body, replaced by a wet warmth. A wet warmth that was moving beautifully. </p><p>I cracked my eyes to see the reason for it, only to see a naked back, her core busy devouring my shaft in a reverse cowgirl pose, carefully rising up and down as if she tried not to wake me up, her delicious red hair sprawled beautifully. </p><p>For a moment, I thought I was dealing with Tiffany, as the fragmented memories I managed to summon as I woke up told me that I had been with her for the majority of the night. Yet, the red hair that was dancing in front of me was not the same shade as her. </p><p>Nor the sexy naked body that I could see have Tiffany’s curves. Instead, it was much leaner and more athletic. </p><p>Then I remembered. I had returned to Jenny’s room after I had finished with Tiffany, sliding next to her sleeping figure for a good night’s sleep. Though, amusingly, I distinctly remembered putting on shorts and a t-shirt before going to sleep, both of which were suspiciously absent. </p><p>Apparently, my pregnant beauty was struggling with morning horniness… </p><p>I could have grabbed her and pushed her down to the bed, to help her deal with that particular problem more intensely, but after a small consideration, I decided against it. Watching her fit body carefully move up and down as she treated my body like a warm dildo was a much more entertaining way of starting the day. </p><p>And, the night I spent with that inexhaustible minx Tiffany after letting Umi escape exhausted me enough to make me appreciate the lazier method. I made no noise, giving Jenny the impression that her attempts to wake me up were successful. </p><p>I lay down, curious just how long it would take for her steady movements to reach completion. </p><p>However, before I could learn the answer to that particular question, the door opened. Jenny turned toward the door in a panic, her hands wrapping around her chest in an effort to hide her nudity. I prepared myself to stand up as well, only to stop when I realized the identity of the surprise guest. </p><p>Natalie, my dear boss, and the long-term girlfriend of the beautiful redhead that was busy rocking back and forth on my naked body. </p><p>A few months ago, that moment would have triggered a disaster of epic proportions. Even just a month ago, it would have created a spectacular row. </p><p>Yet, if I needed any evidence of the impact our warped relationship had on her prickly personality after three months of constant grinding, it was her muted reaction to the sight in front of her. </p><p>“G-good morning, sweetie,” Jenny stammered, clearly feeling self-conscious at the entrance of her partner, but not enough to actually stop. “You know how I feel in the mornings due to pregnancy,” she added, trying to rationalize her actions. </p><p>She was self-conscious, as, after all, their promise to each other was to only have sex with me as a threesome and not alone, a barrier that they had set up to protect the sanctity of their relationship. </p><p>Of course, Natalie never shared the same idea about the sanctity of their relationship, with no problems having some side-fun with her secretary, or sacrificing her body to me just to ask my assistance to cover the gambling debts she managed to acquire during a particularly bad bout of overconfidence. </p><p>Even going as far as betting her Jenny in a twisted seduction game.</p><p>Jenny was lucky that I joined their relationship to protect her poor innocence! </p><p>While Natalie closed the door and moved forward in a disappointed expression, Jenny continued to rock on my lap, encouraged by Natalie’s lack of a reaction — probably assuming that after last night’s show we had put for the camera, the restrictions in their relationship was loosened. </p><p>In truth, it was just another sign of Natalie’s growing obedience. She was headstrong, but after many confrontations that ended in a similar manner, she had learned that she was going to be on the losing side of each challenge. </p><p>And it wasn’t like my presence was a great disaster for her. Yes, she had surrendered her dominance, but in return, I had applied my significant business experience to save her department from almost certain disaster, the great results earning a nice bonus to her. The upper management was unhappy with her failure to kick me out, therefore requiring me to pay a very hefty bonus for me, but the improving profitability was more than enough to correct that. </p><p>Especially since they didn’t explicitly ask Natalie to do so, but trusted her personality to handle that.  </p><p>“How was your flight?” Jenny asked. </p><p>“Not bad,” Natalie answered as she walked next to Jenny, no doubt to pass her and go to the bathroom, but her girlfriend had other ideas. She grabbed Natalie’s arm and pulled her close, capturing her lips in a searing kiss with a passion that would have made me feel jealous… </p><p>If it wasn’t for her nether lips tightening even further around my girth. </p><p>I watched from my cracked eyelids as Jenny’s hands worked on Natalie’s clothes, quickly removing her clothes to reveal her underwear — a sexy black set. </p><p>Familiar, as I had been with her while she picked it — and christened it in the dressing cabin before I even paid for it. It looked amazing on her lithe body. </p><p>I didn’t miss the gaze Natalie threw at me when they broke for a breath, checking that I was still asleep. “Thanks, I needed that,” Natalie gasped beautifully, and as she did so, she grabbed Jenny’s waist and pulled her away from my lap, leaving my shaft naked. </p><p>It took quite a bit of effort for me to hide my smile, amused by her little rebellion. She wanted to stop my joy, but only after trying to make sure that I was still sleeping. </p><p>Such a cowardly move from my great boss… </p><p>I considered the relative merits of acting like I had just woken up, but then, I decided against it. I was just too tired to exert myself for such effort. I decided to let Natalie win for once.  </p><p>Yet, Jenny, our obedient cute redhead, decided to ruin both of our plans at the same time. “Good idea, let’s give him a real surprise,” Jenny whispered as she grabbed Natalie’s hair and pushed her down. </p><p>Surprised, Natalie failed to react. It wasn’t as rare for Jenny to act dominant as it once was — mostly thanks to my subtle training, using it as another method to dominate her — but still, it was a unique occurrence that only happened after my goading. </p><p>For her to take initiative was certainly rare. Maybe our earlier achievement made it even rarer. </p><p>I was lucky that Natalie was busy being surprised and Jenny was busy pushing her down, because I couldn’t prevent an amused smirk from adorning my face momentarily as I felt Natalie’s lips around my shaft, my poker face staggering for a moment. </p><p>Natalie might have been surprised by my move, but that didn’t prevent her lips from wrapping around my shaft tightly. After months of practice, she was turning into an amazing cocksucker. </p><p>Despite the source of our relationship, one thing didn’t change. She was a competitive person, and she did her best to improve in her tasks. </p><p>Jenny’s surprisingly harsh push certainly helped. </p><p>I let my body relax, preparing myself for an amazing morning ritual, watching Jenny push Natalie to give an amazing session of blow job. </p><p>Then, Jenny reached toward the floor, to pick something, only to increase my shock further when she rose, a pair of handcuffs in her hand. </p><p>Admittedly, I wasn’t as surprised as Natalie, who found her hands locked behind without a warning. Her eyes widened, but that was the limit of her reaction, though that was less about the great attitude she displayed as she handled that surprise, and more about her mouth’s occupation with her other tasks. </p><p>Though, I couldn’t help but wonder what Jenny had been planning to do with those handcuffs if Natalie didn’t drop by as a surprise. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I … I have lost,” Isolde murmured. </p><p>I was fascinated by her tone as she muttered those four words — one redundant. It carried a delicious mixture of anger and shock, which I expected. </p><p>What I didn’t expect was to catch a beautiful hint of fascination, one that almost felt like she had a rare phoenix sighting … well, I would have said that, but considering that there was already a phoenix upstairs, I had to admit that the saying lost its impact. </p><p>Yet, that didn’t change the incredible nature of her fascination, simple in nature as she looked at me. </p><p>As I looked at her sharp eyes gleaming in a different light, I didn’t need to rely on her mind magic. She had been bested in direct combat again, but that wasn’t the only reason for her fascination. </p><p>I was here, offering her freedom, from the same prison that Lancelot, the only person she had trusted, had put her into, destroying the same loyalty that I was so afraid of challenging. </p><p>Emma had been weak, the combination of direct power, fear of punishment, and the opportunity to escape from her own mistakes had been enough to conquer her. </p><p>Aria had been naive and idealistic in a way that was underlined by her lack of confidence, making it extremely easy to manipulate her. Though, while those same qualities made me fall for her, it hardly changed the initial difficulty of duping her. </p><p>Even Sapphire, despite all her political acumen, power, and worldly experience, had been easy to conquer. For her, it was her responsibilities, to try to manage an Empire with enough internal enemies to make it shaky before adding two mysterious external enemies that were stronger than the Empire… She was desperate for qualified help, even if that help came from a Dark Lord.</p><p>Isolde was different. She was simple, but not stupid, and her loyalty worked more directly. Oh, I had managed to use some insidious bargain to make her compromise some of her personal values, but, eroding those completely would have taken a long time. </p><p>And more importantly, completing it would make Isolde lose the exact qualities that made her valuable. It would have turned her into another Emma, weak and easy to manipulate, but without other qualities that still made Emma valuable. </p><p>Like stealing a beautiful dagger from an enemy by breaking it in half. It was better than letting it stay under enemy possession, but it was hardly the most efficient solution. </p><p>Yet, Lancelot, that self-serving, smug moron, solved the hardest challenge of my mission by betraying Isolde and Empire at the same time, leaving Isolde’s loyalty untethered. The same loyalty that would have taken days and weeks to break irrevocably, ruining it in the process, came free for anyone that could catch her while her mind was in free fall. </p><p>Extremely convenient for a Dark Lord who had just allied himself with the Empire, to fight against the same enemies that Lancelot started to support. </p><p>“Yes, you have lost,” I whispered after a lengthy pause, allowing her to process that even as I leaned against her body, her heartbeat clear against my chest. “What is your decision?” </p><p>A heartbeat that was getting faster and faster despite standing still. </p><p>“Is there a decision?” Isolde answered sharply. “I have lost the bet, and that’s it. My word is final, no matter the consequences.” </p><p>It was an honorable statement, but I had reasons to believe that the intent behind it wasn’t as honorable. She tried to keep her voice steady, but that wasn’t enough to hide the desperation from her tone. </p><p>She was afraid. </p><p>And I had an interesting suspicion about the source of her fear. “Still, maybe that was unfair, asking your loyalty by combat. Maybe I should just let you free and you can go back to your Queen—“ I said, only to be interrupted by a hopeless gasp. </p><p>“No!” </p><p>“No?” I asked, amused by the loudness of her cry — and glad that I had ensured our voices wouldn’t reach upstairs. “What do you mean, no?” </p><p>“I … I mean, I lost the bet, and I … I have to listen to your orders, all of them!” she stammered desperately, a longing in her tone, showing that she was desperate to find a new target for her loyalty. </p><p>How fascinating, I thought even as I tightened my grip around her arms, while she used the opportunity to push her body against mine, leaving no doubt about what she implied by the last bit of her tone. </p><p>If I was a less experienced man, I would have assumed that it was just her desire to find someone to be loyal to that was driving her after the shock of Lancelot’s betrayal, pushing her enough to sacrifice her chastity for that objective. </p><p>Yet, I was far too familiar with the matters of flesh to miss the carnal desperation in the movement of her hips, shouting her arousal. </p><p>A feeling of arousal that wasn’t there before we started, showing that she had been triggered by fighting. Or more accurately, considering that she didn’t show any such reaction when we battled back in my cell and I faked losing, her arousal was triggered by losing… </p><p>Just another amazing opportunity that idiot Lancelot squandered until I could come to her rescue. </p><p>“Really,”  I said with a smirk that slowly widened, which only worked to alight matching arousal in her eyes. “Let’s test your commitment to your loyalty, then, you weakling,” I added, the last word exploding like a whip, making her tremble. </p><p>Before the latest realization, I would have never dared to call Isolde weakling, afraid that it would trigger a reaction. Yet, at the moment, I wasn’t surprised by her gaze dipping down demurely. “Yes, sir,” she whispered, her voice beautifully vulnerable. </p><p>“Good,” I whispered, caressing her cheek with surprising gentleness, followed by an explosive shout. “On your knees, now!” </p><p>She followed that with military precision, her knees hitting the floor hard enough to make a sharp sound. Yet, any pain that she might have been feeling didn’t prevent her from following my next order. “Pull my pants down, and open your mouth,” I ordered. </p><p>She was quick to follow the order, once again giving my shaft the freedom it craved. She managed to exude an aura of desperate obedience, like a prisoner that was trying to save herself from prison, but that same impression was destroyed by her gaze locked on my shaft, fascinated. </p><p>Soon, her lips joined that betrayal. “So … so big,” she murmured. </p><p>It took a lot to hold back my chuckle, as I was by no way surprised by her fascination. It fit her personality too much. </p><p>“Let’s see how well you can handle it, then,” I ordered. “Open your mouth.” </p><p>Once again, Isolde’s obedience was instant. No bargaining, no asking for guarantees, no lingering. Her lips opened, allowing me to slide inside her. </p><p>And I did that mercilessly. I paused for a fraction of a second, and that was only to grab her head to make sure she wouldn’t hit her head against the stone wall, before I impaled her mouth in one merciless push, immediately invading her throat. </p><p>The pain of such an invasion would have resulted in a desperate cry in anyone else, but for Isolde, it only earned a grunt. A grunt that implied a lot of pain, but also pleasure, showing the submissive extent of her martial obedience. </p><p>It was not my habit to think of other men while such a spectacular moment, but I decided that Lancelot’s idiocy was special enough to earn that right, once again leaving another wondrously beautiful woman completely neglected even after accidentally seducing them. </p><p>Well, his loss, my glorious gain. </p><p>Then, after paying that small tribute, I turned my focus on Isolde, who was showing an incredible ability to swallow my shaft without the slightest complaint. And, even more incredible, she managed to keep her eyes open, her gaze looking up, each push destroying the fake emotionless obedience she tried to reflect, only to be replaced by the signs of deep arousal, each push making that emotion clearer. </p><p>And, never one to miss such an opportunity, I started to cast a spell on her body. One that was extremely complicated to cast, especially considering the benefits. Also, it was an extremely intrusive spell to cast. Since, by its nature it was similar to a ward, the Tether helped me to cast it, but even then, it was measured in minutes and not seconds. </p><p>It was a spell that teachers used on their students, allowing the teacher to monitor the movement of the pupil easier. Under normal circumstances, it would have been useless for anyone else, because the only benefit was to give a slight advantage in melee combat against the target.</p><p>Yet with such direct access, and such a long time to cast a spell, there were much easier and deadlier spells to cast against someone due to their nature, easily noticed while casting. Luckily, Isolde had the magical sensitivity of common rock, allowing me to cast that spell. </p><p>And the fact that she had more important things to focus on, such as the impediment in her throat, pushing her toward the land of unconsciousness. </p><p>I chose to cast that spell for one important reason. Considering just how aroused she got after losing her spar, I had a feeling that she would certainly request more spars to attain that same emotion, and rejecting those offers would damage her loyalty. </p><p>By casting that spell on her, it would give me instant feedback on her movements, allowing me to counter her attacks before she could even launch them, making sure she wouldn’t be able to defeat me. </p><p>Though, as an added benefit, it also gave me a real-time observation of her body as I impaled her throat mercilessly, revealing just how close she was to collapsing with my shaft preventing her from breathing. </p><p>To her credit, she made no move to make me stop, obediently accepting my invasion. </p><p>I pulled back for a moment to allow her to take a breath, but it wasn’t because I had a hint of mercy on her. She seemed more than willing to let that continue until she fell unconscious due to choking, but I didn’t want that. </p><p>Not when we were just starting…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Anger was a potent weapon, with the ability to deal an incredible amount of damage. However, despite its great capabilities, it was also an unwieldy weapon, with the potential to hurt its wielder even more than its target. </p><p>It was a lesson I had learned many times growing up as an orphan and as a bastard noble, target to the subtle insults and jeers of everyone from other nobles to servants. And, after many painful lessons in the form of beatings and worse consequences, I had learned to keep my anger down. </p><p>Yet, there were times I was unable to constrain my anger. The current moment was one of those exceptions. </p><p>The moment I had noticed the Spear of Scipio, the ancestral weapon of our family, something had snapped in me. My heart started to thump furiously, and even worse, my magic started to react, turning into a storm in my chest. </p><p>“Keep your magic down, you’re not fully cured. If you start casting, it’ll start resonating once more, and it’ll kill you,” the healer warned me even as she was busy trying to cast a ward of her own to protect us from the soldiers about to arrive to reinforce the mages. Luckily, she was aware to use a simple spell to keep her voice masked so only I could hear that, as that particular piece of information was too critical to be revealed. </p><p>I wanted to listen to her words, but my core seemed to disagree with that, thumping in my chest as it resonated with my rapidly beating heart, pumping magic into my body. “You better stay away,” I warned her even as tried to control my flaring magic, an attempt that turned out to be in vain as the big dragon heart on the platform started resonating. </p><p>A crackle appeared on its surface, one that turned into a lightning bolt, followed by several… </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t pay attention to that, not when a sensation of crawling on my arm, a glance down revealing scales climbing up my arm, while my fingers started to get sharp. It wasn’t the first time I had seen my arm transforming, but it was the first time I felt that same warm sensation crawling on my shoulder and my back, even creeping up my neck. </p><p>It wasn’t alone, because I could also feel doubt creeping in about whether I would be able to survive my own magic. </p><p>I would have done my best to retreat if the circumstances were even slightly different, hoping to use the distance to limit the resonance while I suppressed the mysterious transformation. </p><p>Unfortunately, the middle of a hostile patrician estate was hardly the location to linger. </p><p>I needed to kill my opponents before it got too late — the opponents that formed dangerous a defensive formation in front of me to delay me from doing that exact thing. The four of them created a square, ready to defend themselves from any direction, while the fifth one stayed in the middle, ready to support in case one of them faltered under a determined assault. </p><p>While fighting against a defensive formation was hardly the easiest thing to achieve while fighting against the time, I was still glad about their lack of initiative, making them miss the best window to kill me easily.</p><p>Though, things would have been more convenient without the anger burning in my chest, forcing my core to pump more magic, quickening my transformation even more. I tried to suppress the flow, but with limited success. </p><p>Yet, even as my body took a monstrous nature, I couldn’t help but glance at the ancestral weapon of my family resting on the wall like a trophy. </p><p>I wished that using the Spear of Scipio was an option. With the great abilities, hidden in its incredible potential, I would have been confident in victory without risking self-destruction by using magic. </p><p>My confidence was certainly not baseless. Patrician Weapons were mysterious weapons, more figments of legends than simple weapons. Their abilities were secretive, and their origin was shrouded in an even deeper mystery, one that went to the very founding of the City of Rome. </p><p>Yet, apart from their existence being linked to the founding of Rome, there was no agreement about their origin. Some said they were forged by Mercury himself on the orders of Jupiter, ordaining the Rome as the rightful dominion of Earth, while others claimed that they were forged by Remus and Romulus, from the corpse of a magical creature with the potential to destroy half of Europe if it had been alive, and used the power given by the weapon to establish the city — before ultimately using those weapons against each other, ending up with Remus’ untimely death.</p><p>Though, their source was not very important at the moment, not against the immense potential they represented. I knew just how potent they were from direct experience. </p><p>I had the misfortune of sparring against the Spear, wielded by my Grandfather. I still remembered the painful ease he had defeated me without using the smallest bit of his own magic despite forcing me to cast to the limit, easily batting away and cutting through my spells with a lazy swing of it. </p><p>And I still remembered him gleefully informing me that a bastard like me would never touch it while he used many abilities of the spear against me in quick succession — not that he needed them to win against me, but to drive his message deeper. </p><p>Those training sessions were particularly painful, making me fantasize more than once about the merits of throwing myself onto the spear, hoping to end them permanently. </p><p>Needless to say, I managed to survive those sessions, just like I was going to survive my current challenge.</p><p>Even if I had to fight against five mages armed with Patrician weapons and dragon hearts, while my own body and magic betrayed me. </p><p>My survival was not optional! </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t delusional enough to think that I had any chance of victory in a fair battle against five of them under the current circumstances. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t believe in fair battles. </p><p>There was one thing that was not in doubt. My biggest advantage lay in their impaired decision-making. I didn’t know the details of the method they had been subjected to enhance their loyalties, but one thing was clear, it had damaged their decision-making significantly, forcing them to react extremely poorly to unfamiliar situations even with their advantage, forcing them to stay reactive. </p><p>I needed to abuse that, I decided and flared my magic to the limit. Normally, if I used that much magic shaped in a spell, I had a good chance of defeating them, but even under the best of circumstances, forming that much mana into a singular spell was a veritable challenge, requiring absolute concentration and a lot of time. </p><p>The less said about my current control, the better. </p><p>Releasing it without a form had no offensive benefits, at least, no direct offensive benefits.  Yet, it simulated the unique chaotic environment of Mount Pyrenaean, blinding the magic senses of everyone, and since I had lived in such an environment for several months, it gave me the initiative to act. </p><p>More importantly, it wasn’t the only benefit of that move. It had released the growing pressure of magic in me, giving me back the ability to use magic. I was still not at my peak, of course, but I was no longer helpless either. </p><p>But that move didn’t come without a cost. The first disadvantage was naturally the expenditure. By releasing such an incredible amount of magic at once, another sorcerer would have drained himself and collapsed unconscious, maybe even dead. With the unique nature of my core, I was able to avoid that ignoble fate. My core was already pumping more mana into my body… </p><p>Which only sped up my transformation further. I could feel my left hand turning into a claw while my legs started to grow scales. </p><p>And the disadvantages were not limited to that. By filling the room with my mana, it only quickened the resonance process between my body and that biggest piece of Dragon Heart, the lightning covering its surface thick enough to hide it from the view. </p><p>I could feel a bond slowly appearing between us as it started to tremble badly. </p><p>Yet, my eyes widened as I poked that mental connection. It wasn’t the only connection I felt, but one of four. I couldn’t help but look at the other pieces of glowing crystals that were on the table, feeling the chill of death. </p><p>Handling just a piece of dragon heart was mortal danger. Four of them at the same time were just death, inevitable. </p><p>Yet, as I looked at them, I didn’t see any signs of a resonance. No lightning, no trembles, not even an increased glow. </p><p>Ironically, that mystery didn’t last long, because I had noticed three other objects flying toward me. Three weapons. For a fleeting moment, I had assumed it to be an attack, ready to throw myself to the side, only to abandon that tactic for two important reasons. </p><p>First, the weapons slowed down as they got closer rather than getting faster,  showing they were not an attack. </p><p> Second, and more importantly, I recognized one of the floating weapons. </p><p>Spear of Scipio! </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Excellent poses, keep going,” Kim shouted from the corner as Megan’s hips gained a wild range of motion, each rocking of her hips sending a not-so-inconsiderable dash of pleasure through my body.</p><p>I didn’t miss the mocking tone in Kim’s tone, and I had a feeling that it had something to do with seeing her friend who had saddled her with a favor-enforced date yet losing herself in the pleasure of the moment. </p><p>Megan said nothing, though, considering her lips were covered with mine as my tongue invaded her mouth, she didn’t have the option to answer even assuming she had caught that tone in the first place. </p><p>When I finally pulled back a minute later, Megan was breathing, desperate to catch her breath. And, as she did so, she had forgotten or ignored a very important fact, that her modesty — for a very loose understanding of the term — was being hidden by my chest. As she pulled back, I was greeted with a beautiful treat of her breasts. </p><p>“Much better than forcing me to keep my hands to myself, isn’t it?” I asked even as my hands continued to wander over her back skillfully, which didn’t help her recovery from the earlier treatment, still trembling softly. </p><p>Her answer was an angry glare, showing her unwillingness to admit it even as her hips continued to rock underwater. Yet, her impotent anger, paradoxically, made her even more attractive than her usual beauty. </p><p>It was hard to believe her airhead exterior and the sharp and prickly interior was hiding such a cute yet horny core. </p><p>“Do you think it’s enough?” Megan asked her friend once she managed to collect her breath, pointedly ignoring my comment. Though the continuous movement of her hips made her attempt to snub me rather pointless. </p><p>Maybe it was just a desperate attempt to sell her strength to her friend. </p><p>Kim smirked, showing that, if that had been the plan, it wasn’t working as well as Megan might have desired. </p><p>Unfortunately for Megan, that was clearly not enough for Kim to accept her payback was completed. “Not yet,” was her answer as she raised her camera. “We need something more suggestive, to make sure the leak has the intended impact.” </p><p>“How suggestive?” Megan asked, but before she could say anything, I pulled back out of her arms. “What are you doing?” Megan asked, curious at first, but her gaze widened as she realized I was fiddling with my speedo. </p><p>A push and a shake later, I returned to my earlier place, but without the painfully tight grasp of the stretched fabric. Megan’s gaze dipped down, the pool water hardly the most opaque of the materials, though despite her growing shock, she said nothing. </p><p>She clearly wanted to, but Kim was faster. “Excellent,” she commented as she looked at the floating speedo. “Very good instincts, worthy of a model. Now, go back to your work and solve my best friend’s great problem.” </p><p>I smirked, amused at her attitude. The more Kim spoke, the more I was finding the idea of them being best friends plausible. </p><p>I had expected Megan to order me to go back, words on my lips to tease her for her cowardly decision. Surprisingly, however, before I could utter those words, Megan grabbed my hair, pulling hard enough to extract a gasp, which, considering the daily pain I exposed myself to during football training, was rather incredible. </p><p>Her smirk told me that it was intentional, though a subtle disappointment was quick to return when I didn’t shout as she intended. </p><p>After all, I wasn’t unfamiliar with pain, and, more importantly, such pain didn’t usually follow by the amazing compensation of a pair of beautiful lips pressing against mine in a desperate kiss… </p><p>Or in the form of a pair of legs wrapping against my naked waist, trapping my shaft in between, rocking rapidly — quite reckless considering she only had her deficient bikini bottoms in between. </p><p> I decided to retaliate properly, curious just how much I could push the benefits of my Seduction Trait. </p><p>I started slow, taking a step forward to drag her toward the edge — extremely easy with the assistance of the water — and trapped her between my body and the edge. She responded to the increased pressure with a delicious moan, while I put my hands on her sides, the gentle dance of my fingers exploring her sensitive spots in a manner that was greatly contrasted by the movement of her hips. </p><p>The contrast between the sensations driving her even crazier. </p><p>I had to admit, she was beautiful with white skin glistening under the sun, her beautiful lips parted for her desperate breaths whenever she pulled for a breath. </p><p>Under different circumstances, I would have teased, keeping her on the edge carefully to make her payback for the terminated lap dance back at the party, but the fact that we had an audience changed things considerably. </p><p>I could still torture Megan while impressing my prospective date.  </p><p>I gave my fingers the freedom they yearned, and they leveraged that by slipping between our bodies, grabbing her surprisingly firm breasts. A moan exploded from her as I started squeezing her breasts, alternating between soft and hard. </p><p>The resulting moan of pleasure was beautiful, but not as much as the way her whole body started trembling helplessly, signaling an orgasm. </p><p>However, that was the start of my revenge. I pulled back, and my left hand stayed on her breasts, squeezing her globe and teasing her nipple in turn, but the real magic trick was delivered by my right hand, slipping inside her bikini bottoms — not that they were a difficult barrier to break. </p><p>My fingers danced around her knob rapidly, in a smooth dance that was only possible thanks to the smooth agility that was given to me by my Seduction Trait, invading her body with a fresh layer of pleasure before the aftershocks of her orgasm could subside. </p><p>“Careful, Megan, one of your tits is showing,” Kim called, not bothering to hide her amusement at the show, though not before she carefully examined the expression of her friend to make sure she was not in distress. </p><p>One of them, because the other was covered with my left hand. </p><p>“Good point, let me cover them,” I commented before Megan could gather enough wits to say anything, and leaned down, using my lips to cover her other breast. </p><p>“Excellent solution,” Kim commented, unable to suppress her laughter, though with an edge of arousal, showing that my efforts weren’t only working on the blonde beauty under my fingers — and my lips. </p><p>“Try not to play with her nipples too much,” Kim suggested, giggling. “She’s really, really sensitive.” </p><p>“Good to know,” I answered pulled back for a moment before returning to my task, squeezing and twisting and licking her nipples, even though by doing so, I had slightly compromised my promise of keeping her breasts covered. </p><p>Kim continued to take photos, but Megan just going to have to trust her friend that she would keep the sexier ones hidden. </p><p>“I’ll make you pay,” Megan managed to mutter her explosive moans, but only after a second orgasm hit and I pulled back, leaving her leaning against the edge of the pool, gasping desperately she tried to process her double-orgasms. </p><p>I was ready to answer before I realized that Megan already turned toward her redheaded friend once more, who was busy taking some very steamy recordings of the aftermath of our embrace, useless unless they had a very different leak in mind. </p><p>“Come on, Meg,” Kim said without even lowering the camera. “I’m an artist, you can’t expect me not to take the recordings of such a beautiful view.” </p><p>“I know, Kimberly,” Megan answered, though I noted Kim’s face scrunching at the mention of the name. “But be ready for payback,“ she warned as she reached for her removed top. </p><p>Seeing them bicker was fun, especially since their ease despite Megan’s mostly naked state suggested some very interesting details about their friendship, but that didn’t mean being ignored didn’t sting my pride the slightest bit after being responsible for such an incredible achievement. </p><p>After a bit of bickering, Megan turned to me, sauntering closer with a sexy expression, one that suggested that she was willing to pay back for the two great orgasms she had just experienced. </p><p>“Thanks, Terry,” she said with a huge smirk as she put her hand on my shoulder, letting fingers drag down my stomach until it dipped down, caressing my naked shaft suggestively. </p><p>Yet, I was familiar enough with her that once she pulled back after several soft pumps, leaving me hanging, I wasn’t surprised in the slightest. She used the ladder to climb out of the pool, giving one last amazing view of her mostly-naked body before she used a towel and covered herself. </p><p>“I think that’s enough for now. Don’t let me keep you from your important team meeting,” she said as she threw one last glance before she turned and started walking away, her hips swaying too erotically to be anything but intentional — especially with the way she wrapped the towel around her chest, leaving her dancing hips naked.</p><p>Kim just looked at me, her smirk no different from Megan’s before she followed her friend, leaving me with a raging hard-on in the pool. </p><p>Still, it was an amazing experience. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but smile as I walked away. </p><p>Getting kicked around in a locked room was certainly not a fun process. However, as much as I didn’t enjoy that part of the process, I appreciated the excuse to leave early. </p><p>Especially since I wasn’t the one responsible for explaining. </p><p>No, explaining to the princess how badly she had fucked up was not-Delia’s task. </p><p>And, as an added benefit, by taking time off from their project, I found myself a beautiful challenge. One that I hadn’t been dealing with for a while. </p><p>Finding a way to kill my free time. </p><p>I had to admit, going back to my room to laze around was tempting, especially since I had been dealing with a lot of things the last few days, and earned a bit of relaxation. </p><p>Yet, that was nothing more than a fleeting fancy. With everything going on, I didn’t have the luxury of resting, nor did I have the luxury of neglecting an opportunity to finally power up. </p><p>Soon, I was climbing down the familiar stairs of the Hall of Craft, easily staying out of their sight, ready to have a discussion with Oeyne. There were a few reasons for that decision. Progressing Oeyne’s companion process would give me a decent chunk of experience, while she also had several interesting tricks to make me relax. </p><p>And, last but not least, she had a really comfortable bed, which could be used for a quick rest after I had completed my more important objectives. </p><p>Since I didn’t waste my travel time, I cast a few healing spells to remove the marks not-Delia had left on my face while also refreshing my life force. </p><p>[-392 Mana]</p><p>[+1637 HP]</p><p>Yet, when I arrived at her workshop, I realized that I had forgotten to add a small detail. Oeyne was still sleeping — not without the assistance of a few too many drinks if the sharp smell of alcohol that filled her workshop was any indicator. </p><p>Well, no surprises there considering how we first met, I thought even as I looked at the caramel-skinned beauty in her bed, her skimpy nightie climbing high enough to give a proper glimpse of her body. </p><p>Someone had a fun night, I thought in amusement. Whenever I visited her, I faced one of the two equally likely possibilities, that she was working as a workaholic, or collapsed after a night of overindulgence as an alcoholic. </p><p>The only question was whether gambling was a part of her little game this time or not. </p><p>Since she was sleeping, I decided to take that as a sign and joined her — after removing my clothes and casting two spells, one to remove the thick smell of alcohol, the other to remove her hungover. </p><p>A little service to make sure she woke up happily wouldn’t be remiss, I thought even as I slipped next to her, letting my hands slip under her nightie, enjoying the warmth of her skin even as I spooned her. </p><p>If her sleeping shuffle was any indicator, I wasn’t the only one that found that comforting. </p><p>I set the sleep take me, not that I needed the rest, the combination of my Stats and my Biomancy tricks enough to keep me upright for much longer, but a touch of decadence wouldn’t be remiss… </p><p>It was her shuffling that woke me up. “W-what?” she mumbled, starting with a flare of panic, but it was short-lived, replaced by a more pleasant tone for the second half of her whisper. I kept my eyes closed, not revealing the fact that I had already woken up, wanting to extend my decadence, hoping that she would return to my arms without prompting. </p><p>Her warmth was simply too comfortable. </p><p>Oeyne clearly had other ideas, though, carefully extracting herself from my hug, and disappearing into her bathroom. Pity, I thought as I shuffled in her bed, trying to find a more comfortable position to continue my nap, ignoring my earlier decision to focus on powering up. </p><p>As much as I wanted to tease her while powering up, the warm whispers of my sleep were too comfortable to be denied. </p><p>Yet, before I could return back to my sleep, Oeyne returned to her bedroom, her looks refreshed. She was still wearing a nightie, but this time a white and lacy one, the kind that was far too fancy to be used to sleep ordinarily. </p><p>She climbed to the bed once more. I expected her to slide back into my arms, grabbing the opportunity to nap a bit more after the exhausting and alcohol-filled evening that she had — and more than likely, shocking amounts of gambling. </p><p>She didn’t follow my guess, instead choosing to linger on the other side of the bed, her gaze dancing on my naked body, her eyes clear of any persistent annoyance of hungover, or a sleepless night. </p><p>Maybe I had underestimated the impact of my healing spell on clearing hangover, especially combined with the impact of her high Endurance, I decided as I looked at her eyes, shining with a surprising clarity considering she was as far away as possible from being a morning person. </p><p>Or maybe, she was simply too enthusiastic about keeping me happy after our last time had resulted in her gaining a nifty little enchantment. </p><p>Curious about what she would do, I didn’t give any indication that I wasn’t sleeping, even when she put her hands on my thigh and pushed me slightly, making me lay on my back. And with me in that position, she had no problems reaching her ultimate target considering my nudity. </p><p>Ironically, holding my chuckles back was harder than hiding any other emotion, because even as she leaned forward, I could see a certain awkwardness on her beautiful face. </p><p>It wasn’t too surprising for her to feel self-conscious. It wasn’t our first time, of course, but it was the first time she was taking action without any kind of prompting from my end, be it an extended erotic massage, or something much more direct… </p><p>Like chaining her hands and testing the limits of her endurance. </p><p>That novelty value was the reason for her awkwardness, though it wasn’t alone on her face as her hands moved over my shaft, gently dancing around in an effort to bring it to life. Excitement and desire joined her expression soon, turning her awkwardness into an erotic masterpiece. </p><p>Admittedly, her lacy nightie that was barely capable of hiding her caramel curves — especially with her current angle — played a very important role in the erotic tale her body was exemplifying. </p><p>I continued to relax in the bed as her fingers wrapped around my shaft, moving up and down slowly with a fluidness that sent pleasurable shivers across my body as my shaft started growing, soon thick enough to strain her fingers as she tried to keep them closed. </p><p>Her fingers climbed even higher, grazing the crown, but this time, my attention was on the way she was leaning forward, her beautiful lips already parted. </p><p>She gazed at me to see whether I was showing any signs of waking up. And since she was unable to see through me, she pulled back. </p><p>Yet, that move was nothing compared to her follow-up, a surprising move that tested my desire to play along with her little surprise.  She stood up, only to open a nearby drawer, and pulled two pairs of handcuffs. </p><p>I suppressed several questions that tried to force themselves into existence while she quickly used them to lock me against her bedpost — though I wondered whether it was my growing trust in her, or my utter confidence in my own abilities to free myself from them if needed that allowed me to react with such calm.  </p><p>Regardless of the reason, I acted like I was asleep while she took her earlier position, her hands wrapped around the base of my shaft. But this time, there was a big improvement.</p><p>The crown was trapped between her thick lips, adding another dimension to my pleasure. I watched as she started moving up and down. Choppily at first, especially without my hands guiding her with the aggressive manner she came to expect. </p><p>That state of confusion didn’t last long. Soon, she adapted an impressive rhythm, alternating between fast and slow, driving me deeper into the pleasure, as if forcing me to admit that I wasn’t sleeping. </p><p>I chose to enjoy it passively because watching her as she slowly developed a technique of her own was a unique experience. It would have been a pity to interrupt that. </p><p>It wasn’t as simple as simply rejecting that, of course, as while the tone and position might be different, we had shared some very memorable events together, and, clearly, I wasn’t the only one learning about the body of his partner. She had discovered several interesting tricks in the process, and started applying them with devastating consequences.  </p><p>Curious just how many tricks she had managed to discover, I let her have free access to my body for the next several minutes, watching as she teased my shaft from every possible angle, her lips even occasionally dipping down to my balls, each second there renewing the flood of pleasure. </p><p>Soon, I was not too far away from a climax. And while letting that come as a surprise was an option, it wasn’t the most fun option. </p><p>Instead, I spoke. “What an excellent way to wake up?” I whispered softly even as I gave a tug to the handcuffs, acting as if I had just noticed their presence. </p><p>“I decided to be a good hostess,” she answered as she raised her body, her throaty tone sending shivers across my body. Then, she put her finger on the cleavage of her nightie. She didn’t pull it down hard, but her nightie wasn’t the most robust clothing in the first place, and her finger deepened the cleavage significantly. “Is my services satisfactory?” </p><p>“I would be remiss to comment on it before you show your full abilities,” I commented. </p><p>Her enthusiastic smile was very promising… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, you think you can handle anything I can handle,” Sarah said smugly even as she settled on my lap, her back pressing against my chest as she pulled herself close, my shaft trapped between her cheeks. </p><p>And, captured in a beautiful prison, it was growing back rapidly after its latest exertion. </p><p>Naomi just looked at her in shock, still panting after her spectacular climax. Then, her gaze dipped down, to the area our bodies were dangerously close, a hesitant expression on her face. Her determination flickered, only to renew when she noticed Sarah’s smug gaze. </p><p>“I can handle it,” she delivered confidently. Too confidently, I realized. It wasn’t hard to guess what was going on in Naomi’s mind. She was clearly thinking Sarah was bluffing. Though whether she doubted Sarah taking that final step, or having the courage to repeat it in front of her, it was a different question.</p><p>Either way, she overplayed her hand. Before Carrie’s exaggerated show the night before, I doubted Sarah would have dared to do so, but like before, it was the benefit of dealing with my beautiful nerds. They have no preconceived notions about sex, and since Sarah had suffered under Carrie’s courage the night before, she would have no problems with it. </p><p>“Oh, really,” Sarah said, suddenly sounding hesitant. “So, you’re saying that you’re willing to repeat everything I do. Promise?” It was an artificial expression, and not a particularly convincing one either, but for Naomi, already half-convinced with her assumption, it was all she needed to double down. </p><p>“Promise,” Naomi delivered confidently, her expression smug. </p><p>That smug expression flickered a bit when Sarah rose up enough to free my shaft from its prison, once again completely erect. Naomi’s expression recovered as she turned to Sarah, no doubt to tell her not to bother bluffing, when she noticed Sarah had already grabbed my shaft, aligning it with her entrance. </p><p>Naomi looked panicked for a moment, her mouth open to deliver a surrender, when Sarah changed the position, and when she lowered herself, my shaft was once again trapped in her crack. “I knew it, you’re a little coward,” Naomi said with a gasp of relief. </p><p>“Oh, we’ll see who’s the coward,” Sarah said even as she raised herself once more, enjoying Naomi’s panic as she lowered herself once more, once again rubbing against her crack, which made my erection even more unbearable. </p><p>This time, Naomi said nothing, even with the unfamiliar situation, smart enough to realize Sarah was acting far too confident after her bluff was called. </p><p>I decided to help her a bit, my palms making contact with Sarah’s nude back, massaging her for a while before traveling on her sides, caressing them before shifting to my ultimate tactic. </p><p>Sarah moaned in appreciation as I palmed her breasts, my hands big enough to completely cover their beautiful expanse, my cock still buried in her cheeks. “Not a bad start,” I whispered into her ear even as I squeezed her breasts, my fingers finding her nipples. </p><p>Sarah moaned loudly, her hips rocking as her cheeks massaged my arousal. Even then, she looked straight at her friend, their eyes meeting, one colored with confidence, the other… </p><p>Shock. </p><p>“Let’s see who’s the coward,” Sarah said as she raised herself once more. Not one to miss such an opportunity, I leaned forward, getting a beautiful whiff of her hair before nibbling at her neck, earning a delicious moan in the process as she paused. </p><p>The moans and gasps she was emitting were simply hypnotizing. </p><p>“Maybe—“ Naomi started, but that was all she was able to say before she was interrupted by Sarah’s moan. An excessively loud, deliberate moan as she started to sit on my erection, her gleaming core wrapping around my shaft, still wet from her lips earlier. </p><p>“Someone’s excited to give a show,” I whispered to her ear, soft enough to avoid Naomi’s ears — not that she was in a position to eavesdrop on us in the first place, her gaze locked where our bodies were meeting. </p><p>And Sarah, like the good friend she was, kept her legs wide, the direct view leaving no doubt about what was going on. </p><p>“So, who’s the … coward,” Sarah said smugly, though her pause was less about trying to emphasize, and more about the moan that was forcing itself out as she started moving down.</p><p>Naomi said nothing as Sarah started lowering herself even more, devouring my length with beautiful aggression. “You’re so wet, you’re flowing,” she commented a second later. </p><p>“Yes, she is,” I said even as I shifted my hands a bit, leaving her breasts free as I grabbed her waist, pushing her down. Sarah didn’t answer, too busy moaning explosively. She closed her eyes as she tried to process the sensation of invasion, still a novel presence. </p><p>I turned my gaze on Naomi, who was watching the procession with a delicious mixture of shock, arousal, and not an inconsiderable amount of anger. </p><p>Her mood was understandable, as she had come for a night of some intimate flirting, only to find herself in a tense competition with one of her best friends, and the fact that she was watching that friend taking the ultimate step. </p><p>In such a spectacular manner. </p><p>Realizing her victory, Sarah tried to lift herself up, no doubt to call it an end before chasing Naomi away, but I had other ideas, and absolutely no intention to stop. </p><p>My hands snapped onto her hips, holding her in place, making her jump up and down, each repeat pushing my shaft even deeper. Her moans got louder and louder, losing their earlier controlled attitude. </p><p>Naomi’s eyes dipped down once more, focusing on the junction our bodies met, widening as she watched a certain part of her friend widen further to accommodate my aggressive invasion. </p><p>“So, still in the mood to repeat whatever I do,” Sarah managed to squeeze in between moans, her eyes closing immediately afterward as she focused on the pleasure that was radiating in her body. </p><p>It turned out to be a critical hit to Naomi’s confidence, as she made a motion to stand up, panic invading her tone. Luckily, I was watching her prevent exactly that, and my hand landed on her thigh. </p><p>Hardly the most intensive way to keep someone in their seat, barely enough to give her a pause, but with her body burning in arousal, her nipples hard, it was all I needed. As my fingers danced on her inner thigh, her hesitation and fear were injected with just enough arousal to keep her in place. </p><p>She gritted her teeth before murmuring. “Oh, I believe I can do much more,” she managed to whisper. </p><p>The way Sarah’s eyes popped wide as she turned to Naomi was beautiful, shocked by her decision, before her expression slowly turned to indignation, no doubt shocked by her friend daring to say she would take a turn after that. </p><p>Admittedly, indignation was not a state she could justifiably claim under the circumstances. Not only she had been gleefully mocking and challenging Naomi only because she was confident Naomi wouldn’t take that step…</p><p>But also she had no problems taking a ride after another of their friends, even after seeing us sharing the same level of nudity. </p><p>On this exact couch, even. </p><p>Sarah opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, I put my hand on her leg, and squeezed hard, which was enough to remind her about her poetic hypocrisy. She gritted her teeth and held back whatever argument she was about to deliver. </p><p>And just like that, tables were turned. Naomi looked smug and confident — for a given value of confidence — while Sarah was squirming in discomfort, under the combined attack of the uncomfortable realization, and my iron grip as I continued to ram into her beautiful entrance repeatedly. </p><p>“It wouldn’t be fair to ask Naomi to take the plunge without showing her the full extent of the requirements,” I whispered even as I shifted my hands, clutching to her shoulders before pushing her down, impaling her even harder, her moans even more spectacular, her wetness reaching an unbelievable level. </p><p>Sarah moaned, not that she could do anything else under my iron grip, taking it to the limit under the circumstances. As her moans rose, Naomi’s momentary confidence shattered once more, though this time replaced by a different kind of fear. </p><p>The kind I had seen on her face when we exercised together, when I asked her to do a complicated move that she wasn’t sure of completing with her physical abilities. </p><p>Sarah, unaware of the changing nature of her friend’s concerns, focused on crying and moaning as she lost herself in pleasure, each second bringing a bigger flare of joy. </p><p>I said nothing, enjoying the sight of two contrasting beauties, nary a trace fiber between both of their bodies, every secret of their body on display, yet none of them bothering to cover themselves up. </p><p>The situation was far too gone for that. </p><p>Yet, I was willing to push the case even further. “Why don’t you stand up…” I said as I turned to Naomi, only for her to look at me in abject shock, thinking that I was asking to leave. </p><p>Like I would ever do such a thing after everything that happened. </p><p>“… take a seat that would give a better view to your dear friend. We don’t want her to miss anything, do we, Sarah?” I asked, slapping her ass. </p><p>“No! Don’t!” Sarah gasped, suddenly feeling self-conscious, which, under the circumstances, was more about me taking back control than the body she was displaying — after all, she had already displayed everything, leaving no secret between friends.</p><p>She recognized my tone, the same tone I used last night after taking control, and in the morning when we ‘played’ in the kitchen, pushing her even more than she had been expecting when she decided to fuck behind her friend. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, after all the goading she had thrown at Naomi since the beginning of our adventure, a panicked request was the worst thing she could do to stop Naomi, who was currently sporting a beautiful smile, noticing the opportunity to twist the situation. </p><p>It was a trap for her as well, of course, but it would be a while until she noticed it.</p>",
