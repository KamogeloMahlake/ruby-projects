    "content": "<p>When Helga slid closer to me, I decided to reward her courage by meeting halfway. The discussion on the complicated nature of the magic continued, but I lowered my voice a bit, and using a huskier tone, one that worked just as intended if her nipples trying to poke through her shirt was any indicator. </p><p>I refilled her glass, then picked a piece of cheese, and gently placed between her lips, and she bit sensuously, followed by a soft moan. “Are you tired?” I asked, and for a moment, she looked afraid that her hints were misunderstood, but it lasted only until I slid even closer to her, and placed my hands on her shoulders, rubbing gently.</p><p>“A - a bit,” she stammered after realizing what I was cluing towards, and leaned to my chest with a sigh while I started to rub her shoulders. The next moan that she let out was in no way exaggerated. It was not much of a surprise. After all, I managed to completely break Marianne through my skilled fingers, and Helga was already prepared to jump my bones. </p><p>A couple of minutes later, I removed her robe, which she let without the slightest hint of resistance. I noticed her hands landing on her own thighs, which, incidentally, caused her already short skirt to ride upward further, the sight of her toned thighs enough to make my mouth water. I let my hands drift down through her sides until they landed on her delicious thighs. “You seem restless, do your legs hurt,” I asked, and she nodded enthusiastically, not trusting herself to talk. </p><p>I just chuckled as my fingers danced on her thighs, slowly moving towards the inner area while climbing upwards bit by bit, tortuously slow. Her excitement, once clear as a day, started to darken with frustration. She sent a glance upward, only to meet with my smug smirk, telling her that I was very much aware of what I had been doing. I was curious just how long she would be able to resist the temptation… </p><p>The answer turned out to be not too long. When my fingers reached the edge of her panties, each caress driving it further but still studiously avoiding her core, Helga let out a guttural moan, and I found myself being pushed on the floor, Helga firmly sitting on my shaft. “That’s enough playing, you bastard,” she exclaimed even as she moved back and forth, enjoying a dry ride. </p><p>I had been planning to play with her a bit more, but then I was distracted by an announcement. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 1%]</p><p>[+200 Experience] 50% Penalty</p><p>The announcement managed to blindside me. Luckily, Helga was busy rowing back and forth above my shaft, her eyes closed to maximize her sensations to actually pay any attention to me, giving me time to process what had happened. </p><p>There was no doubt that the announcement was about Helga, the timing ruled out any other possibility. But I was mystified by the reason. After all, it wasn’t the first time I was being with Helga, and I had gone much further with other girls as well, especially Marianne, who hadn’t shown such a sign. And while I helped Helga, I also helped Aviada, to the point of saving her life… </p><p>But I hadn’t done anything sexual in the aftermath. </p><p>Maybe that was it, that I needed to both help the girl in a profound way, and also take its rewards. It was a good guess, but in the end, it was still a guess. I needed more experimentation to test its accuracy. Luckily, Aviada was a perfect candidate for that particular experimentation. </p><p>Then, a particularly tickling moan reached to my ears, and I decided that theorizing about the new feature wasn’t as important as tending the sexy blonde that was doing her best to grind my pants into nothingness. I placed my hands on her stomach, easily sliding under her blouse before starting to climb forward, revealing the beautiful smoothness of her stomach in the process. </p><p>Helga opened her eyes when my fingers started to caress the underside of her spectacular breasts, but they were filled with a deep need, a burning passion. Initially, I was planning to take it slow, but such a naked display of desire deserved a reward. Since my hands were already positioned appropriately, all I needed was to pull gently, and my enhanced strength worked wonders in completely ruining her blouse, leaving her half-naked. </p><p>A shocked yelp escaped her mouth, which I deliciously punished by a gentle slap to her breast, their impressive size dancing deliciously. She moaned in appreciation after the shock, not showing the slightest concern for her state of nakedness. Then, a mischievous expression popped on her face as she pressed her hands to my chest, her grinding picking up speed further. </p><p>And it worked wonderfully. My pants turned into a tight prison, begging to be released. An expression of joy was on her face, though it was equally strained by pleasure. I wasn’t the only one that was starting to feel the brunt of the extended session of foreplay, and it would hurt my pride if I surrender before her. </p><p>With that in mind, I slid my hands a bit further, my fingers already laced with an innovative mixture of transformed Biomancy and Arcana mana, a tricky construct that I created based on Helga’s ideas, and pressed them against Helga’s nipples.</p><p>[+2 Biomancy]</p><p>[+3 Arcana]</p><p>[-30 Mana]</p><p>[+300 Experience] 50% Penalty</p><p>[Achievement: Innovative Involvement. Leverage a brand-new technique to the noblest purpose of providing pleasure. +1000 Experience, +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma]</p><p>Thanks to the system, I knew that the technique was exceedingly effective, resulting in two separate skill increases and a very profitable achievement in addition to its usual experience reward. But nevertheless, Helga’s pleasure-filled face was a nice addition as well, confirming my success. </p><p>“That’s amazing,” she moaned helplessly as her grinding turned out to be even more heated, searching for a release that wouldn’t come; because that was another function of the small trick I had developed. She would not climax unless I broke the magical barrier I had constructed, or the pleasure reached a mind-breaking degree. And she realized that detail a moment later when her unbounded grinding failed to achieve the desired result, and she checked my face to confirm the results. “Okay, you magnificent bastard, you win!” she said, declaring surrender, though any sign of defeat was soon erased by hunger as she reached for my zipper. </p><p>A brief struggle later, my shaft was standing proudly, ready for any challenge. “Make sure to prepare it thoroughly before using,” I mockingly reminded her.</p><p>I had been expecting a counter-statement from her, but my shaft proved to be too fascinating for her to pay attention to anything else. Apparently, my recent boost in charisma worked even better than I had expected, and she was stuck watching my shaft in fascination. That hypnotizing effect only lasted for a moment, but even then, her eyes were rather glazed as she leaned forward to capture my girth between her lips. </p><p>And the moment her lips touched my shaft, her lips started dancing up and down, treating it like ice cream in the middle of the desert, hurrying to finish before it melted under the sun. She moved up and down, doing her best to swallow my length — though she only managed to take a portion despite her best efforts. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty</p><p>Watching her pouty lips dancing over my shaft was good entertainment, especially when the free dance of her dangling breasts were added to the equation, so I continued to lay without a movement, letting her do all the work. It was a nice change of pace, as other times I was doing my best to maintain whatever scheme I had been trying to achieve while also trying to ensure the target was adequately aroused to miss the details. After everything, laying on my back to enjoy the treatment had been a nice change of pace. </p><p>And Helga proved that she had no issues in doing all the work when she stopped the delicious treatment of her lips and sat on my midsection once more, stopping only to get rid of her panties. Her skirt was still on, but after she folded the hem a couple of times, it resembled a belt more than a skirt, showing the amazing sight of her slit devouring my shaft bit by bit. It wasn’t entirely trivial for her to swallow the whole length even if she was incredibly slippery, my girth challenging her elasticity to the maximum. She bit her lips, the pleasure and pain fighting against each other as she lowered her hips, but in the end, she was triumphant. </p><p>Only then she sent me a victorious smile as she placed her hands on my chest, her hips grinding me even more furiously than her earlier dry-humping, the gyration of her hips nothing less than poetry. “Faster,” I ordered, and she followed my direction without even blinking, her movements blurring with pleasure. </p><p>Since she was doing such a good job, I decided to reward her. With a flick to her nipple, I had dispelled part of the spell that was keeping her from climaxing, immediately followed by a silencing ward, not trusting the ancient walls to handle the explosion of sound. </p><p>And it turned out to be the correct choice, because when Helga opened her mouth, the resulting sound made me doubt that whether it was just a cry, or it was actually a sound-based attack spell. It left my ears ringing, while Helga collapsed to my chest after she spent the last of the energy she could spare to cry, the rest of her attention firmly on containing the aftermath of her explosive orgasm. </p><p>[+ 925 Experience] 50% Penalty</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 5%]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Expert Melee, Expert Biomancy, Basic Ranged] </p><p>Seeing another level was always a delight. And after a brief consideration, I picked to increase my close combat skills. Both Biomancy and Ranged was tempting, but I was supposed to meet with Aviada tonight at midnight, and I needed skills to suitably impress her. While my strength and other physical stats had suitably improved since our last meeting, an extra edge wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>“That … was … everything … I imagined … to … be,” Helga managed to whisper after lost her fight to be able to stand upright, and collapsed against my chest. I chuckled before leaning forward and capturing her lips, my shaft still inside her, ready for the second round. </p><p>[Level Difference of at least 50%! No Additional Experience]</p><p>Unlike the previous notification, this one wasn’t particularly welcome. I had been expecting something in those lines, but I was hoping for another reduction rather than a total denial. </p><p>Technically, due to lack of any additional experience, the smart thing would be to stop there, and continue only after I ensured Helga leveled up once more, but that decision was markedly hard to take when the aforementioned body lay above me, her lower lips still tightly grasping my shaft with the full intention to milk me until I was completely dry. </p><p>The decision made, I wrapped my arms around her waist before rolling, and she ended up underneath me, earning an enthusiastic giggle. Continuing to slide inside her until she passed from excess pleasure was the simplest thing to do, but I wanted to do something more entertaining. I grabbed the wine bottle, and slowly drizzled it over her amazing breasts, before leaning forward and slowly licking, sucking, and otherwise enjoying the vast expanse of her flavored breasts. Others might claim it to be a waste of good wine, but for me, that was the best way to empty a bottle. </p><p>When I repeated the trick for the second time, my hips started to move as well, slowly and sensuously, contrasting her earlier frantic crawling, but despite its slow pace, turning out to be more pleasurable for both of us. Her hands reached my back, her fingers digging deep into my shoulders, but with her limited strength, barely causing any pain against my boundless vitality. Still, the sensation was clear enough, which I enjoyed. </p><p>“Cum inside me, Caesar,” Helga moaned and since I wasn’t a rude bastard -or more accurately, wasn’t a rude bastard under these exact circumstances- I sped up, and her moans sped up along with it. I pushed, I licked, and I bit, and moments later, I started spraying inside her, accompanied by another string of cries that made my silencing wards work overtime. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 15%]</p><p>Still, when I collapsed next to her, our tongues gently dancing around each other, I was satisfied. With our enjoyment peaking, neither of us wanted to talk, so we let our bodies to talk in an extended post-coital session. But soon, the time of separation was there. She was too exhausted to continue -a drawback of her magic focused build- while I had other things to do, so after a brief discussion, we decided to separate for the night, agreeing to meet tomorrow morning for another leveling session. </p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>But for me, the night was just starting. After a brief shower, I was dressed in my combat outfit once more, with the sword in hand. I wanted to increase by close combat abilities, and I wanted to increase them significantly before the meeting with Aviada. With that in mind, once again I went to the most dangerous training forest -though I was tempted to just walk outside to test my limits. It was unlikely that I would meet anything more dangerous than the Shadow Wolf around the school, and I was much stronger than the last encounter, strong enough that I could take a couple of them without taking a wound. </p><p>But in the end, I decided to leave that particular challenge until I gained a couple more levels. Instead, I cast my protection spells and slipped into the Third Forest, the most dangerous training ground in the school. Without a companion to protect, I was free to turn into a shadow, stalking even the most dangerous predators the forest contained. Dire wolves, elemental hawks, demonic foxes, even occasional dragon spawn younglings… All fell underneath my blade, helpless to do anything more than flail in panic. </p><p>When I walked out of the forest three hours later, I was exhausted and drained, but victorious. </p><p>[-438 Mana]</p><p>[+8 Arcana]</p><p>[+4 Biomancy]</p><p>[+26 Melee] </p><p>I couldn’t help but smile at my gains.

    "content": "<p>I was tempted to sleep in the storage room that was still filled with the smell of sin and sex, but I had another blonde beauty that was waiting for my attention. Luckily, the meeting was arranged for late afternoon, which gave enough time to clean and dress into something more appropriate for a mysterious stranger, as well as stealing a better sword from the armory. It wasn’t enchanted, but it had a sturdier construction, and allowed me to channel my arcana abilities much easier, and I needed that if I were to impress Helga today with my display. And while there, I stole a bunch of throwing knives as well. There was no harm in having some extra equipment.</p><p>I wished that I could have stolen Marcus’ sword after killing the asshole, but going around with that kind of evidence wasn’t the smartest thing to do, even for a precious enchanted sword. </p><p>Soon, I was walking towards the third -and the most dangerous- training forest, dressed in grays and blacks of a warrior. Ranger's getup would have been even more appropriate, but I didn’t want to dress too similar to my Orlin disguise for Helga. The patrols around the forest were marginally more difficult to slip through due to state of alarm, but not enough to actually catch me. </p><p>After the patrols, it didn’t take long for me to find Helga, who stayed very close to the entrance, afraid of facing the monsters inside alone. It was justified. This section was mostly filled with class two and three creatures, but occasional class four and fives weren’t unheard of. Nothing as dangerous as the pack of elemental hyenas that attacked Aviada and me, but dangerous nevertheless. And with Helga’s research-focused development, even class three’s were a threat against her under the right conditions, not to mention her stamina wouldn’t allow a long engagement.  </p><p>I gestured her from the distance, followed by a small flare spell, the exact shape, and tone described in the letter, and she started walking towards me. Even from the distance, I could see her fingers tightening around her staff, cluing me about her doubts, but to her credit, determination shone on her face. </p><p>I slipped deeper into the forest as she followed me, trying to get out of the line of sight of the patrols, but staying close enough to allow her to follow. “Helga,” I said with a cheerful wave that was rather mismatched with the general mood, but she took it in the stride, and waved back. Maybe she appreciated my gifts even more than I estimated. </p><p>“Hello…” she said before stopping in sudden realization. </p><p>“You can call me Caesar,” I answered, not feeling concerned at giving my own name. With both Aviada and Marianne on the know, my identity was going to be revealed one way or another, so informing Helga about it wasn’t a big risk; especially not with all the secrets I had on her. </p><p>She nodded in appreciation before looking around in trepidation. “Are you sure that this is the best area for training. What if we get attacked by a herd.”</p><p>Her concern was not entirely unjustified. After all, this forest was dangerous not only because of the stronger monsters it contained, but also due to a limited number of students risking to farm here, occasionally allowing the build-up of a dangerous amount of creatures, such as packs of Dire Wolves, which was already dangerous with their class four status. “Don’t worry, I can handle it,” I said with a dismissive wave, choosing to punctuate my sentence by using one of my throwing knives into a bush about a hundred meters ahead, where a dire wolf was hidden, waiting for an opportunity. </p><p>Helga gasped at the sudden burst of action, which wasn’t entirely beneficial. Unlike the rabbits and foxes, Dire Wolf didn’t fear sudden confrontation, and dashed in an explosive rush, which met with an unfortunate end as I took its legs with a slash of my sword, arcana energy crackling around its edges. “Milady,” I said with a mocking bow as I pointed at the helpless creature, which was almost as big as me, like it was a cute gift.</p><p>[+1 Melee] </p><p>It was another point to her credit when she delivered the final blow to the creature’s throat using the small blade on top of her staff rather than wasting her magic. Then, her gaze turned to me, disbelief mixing with hope as she gazed me. It wasn’t hard to decipher her shock. Taking down a class four creature wasn’t an amazing achievement, but it couldn’t be said for immobilizing it with just a slash without actually killing. That required a level of power and finesse that was hard to find in a student.  </p><p>“That was…” she murmured, disbelieving. I had no doubt that she thought my level should be in the twenties, considering she had seen me display impressive abilities in melee combat, magical abilities, and research. Level twenty was rare, and most of them either took an important role in their families, or chose a cushy job in one of the large cities. If they were lucky, they could even get a guard post for the royal family. Someone close to that point that was willing to help an outcast like her was a miracle from her perspective. </p><p>And while I was not a level twenty -and couldn’t exactly compare against them in their selected areas due to my generalist status even with my stats- Helga didn’t know that. She lacked the combat experience to discern the details of my situation. And thanks to my extraordinary stats, I could put a decent fight against someone around level fifteen in a fight regardless of the type of combat thanks to my larger bag of tricks, which made her estimation not too inaccurate. “So, have you thought about the problem I outlined in my letter?” I asked her.</p><p>“Y-yes,” she stammered in shock, not expecting to have that conversation in the most dangerous spot in the school. But nevertheless, she started explaining rapidly, clearly not wanting to anger her new benefactor. “I was thinking that the spell matrix can be stabilized through…” And with that, we started an interesting raid, killing monsters and discussing complicated magical theory at the same time. </p><p>[Melee +6]</p><p>[Arcana +11]</p><p>[-523 Mana] </p><p>[Achievement: Charm through Charms. Make great strides in seducing a brainy lady through great magical aptitude. +500 Experience, +2 Intelligence]</p><p>Our expedition took almost three hours, and several dozens deceased creatures. When I finally called it to end, the sun was about to set. I was tired, because I was rather generous in mana expenditure, using it to try some of the theories we came up with Helga, but it wasn’t wasteful. How could it be when I had managed to develop a more dangerous variant of the mana bolt with just a couple hours of discussion, one that would have penetrated through the magical hide of a shadow wolf without depleting half of my mana. </p><p>I didn’t want to risk a repeat of the shadow wolf incident with an almost empty tank. Moreover, Helga was even more exhausted. She didn’t fight directly, but she also didn’t have my irrationally high physical stats, and spell practice drained her mana as well. But despite everything, there was a huge smile on her face. “So, did you level up?” I asked while we returned, ignoring the social taboo around the question. Inquiring about people’s status was one of the bigger taboo’s, one that hadn’t been processed lightly. </p><p>“Not yet, but I’m very close. I have gained almost eight hundred experience points in a day,” she answered with a euphoric smile, dismissing my social blunder without a thought. I shook my head, once again appreciating the unbelievable advantage provided by my unique status. For me, a thousand points was a slow day. For anyone else, a small miracle. “Just four more days, and I should level up,” she added, giving me a clue about her current level progress. But despite her enthusiasm, I wasn’t really happy with her progress. I needed her to be stronger, because I needed the spells she would develop, spells that would fit perfectly for my unique combat style. </p><p>I didn’t doubt that there was a challenge waiting for me in the future, and I needed to be prepared for it. </p><p>But while walking back, I realized that lady luck had other plans for me. When the familiar sound of the rush of dire wolves reached into my ears, I gestured Helga to take a defensive position while I stood in front of her, a sparkling mana bolt in my left hand, a glowing throwing knife on my right. I panicked, because I could identify at least five dire wolves attacking us. </p><p>When they dashed into the opening we were in, I realized my assessment was mistaken. It wasn’t five dire wolves, rather, it was four dire wolves, and one dire wolf alpha, which hulked almost double the size of the others, its eyes shining with an unusual experience. Effectively, it was at least class six, maybe even seven… </p><p>Luckily, I had gone through worse challenges when I was weaker. “Distract the alpha for a moment,” I ordered Helga. </p><p>“How?” she asked panickedly even as I dashed forward. </p><p>“Send something shiny towards it!” I shouted exasperatedly even as I met with the first wolf after throwing my knife and pulling my sword, who, surprisingly, was prepared for my display of speed. On my other hand, I still held my spell, ready to go. I felt the gaze of the alpha on me as it dashed towards as well, ignoring Helga completely, like it knew I was the real threat. Combined with the surprised adaptability of the other wolves, I suspected we had been observed during our hunt… “Wily bastard,” I murmured in annoyance. The monsters capable of tactics was the last thing I needed. </p><p>“Let’s see how adaptive you are, you bastard,” I murmured even as I changed the shape of the spell on my hands, and converted it into an area-effect slowing spell, something I just managed to create thanks to Helga’s clever ideas. </p><p>[-40 Mana]</p><p>Seeing the expression of surprise on the eyes of the Alpha was a delight, but not as much as when Helga’s spell connected with the bastard, covering it with a thick layer of energy, immobilizing it momentarily. With a glance I could see that it was a weak one, barely last a couple of seconds, but that was enough. The formation of wolves was based on its presence, and with it immobilized, it allowed me to cut through rest in just a second, leaving two dead, two too wounded to move. </p><p>I was already behind the Alpha when it was ready to move, cutting the hamstrings of its hind legs with just a slash. I smirked, it was amusing that he had died to the favorite tactic of the wolves. “Not bad. Let’s see whether we can double it the next time,” I said, making her chin drop in shock. “The rest is yours, milady,” I said exaggeratedly with a smirk, enjoying the way panic melted off Helga’s face, just realizing that the danger she had thought to be deadly just ended in a moment. </p><p>[Achievement: Martial Might. Save a damsel through an overwhelming display of power and initiative. +500 Experience, +1 Speed, +1 Precision]</p><p>[Melee +2]</p><p>She tried to say something, but words failed her repeatedly. She took a deep breath and walked towards the wounded creatures, finishing them with a stab of her staff. “That was … incredible…” she murmured when she looked at me once more, a familiar blush on her face. </p><p>I said nothing, but closed on her, far too close to be innocent, my breath landing on her ruby lips, which opened reflexively. I leaned forward like I was about to steal a kiss, only to stop at the last second. “Why don’t you go ahead pass through the guards, and meet me with the storage room we had met the last time in an hour,” I said, and before she could answer, already pulled back. </p><p>The expression of shock on her face, while she watched me disappear, was utterly delicious. </p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>       </p><p>When I arrived at the storage room a couple of minutes more than an hour later, Helga was already there, waiting for me with a nervous expression on her face. “You’re here,” she gasped, her nervousness instantly replaced by elation the moment she noticed my presence. Someone was enthusiastic, I noted with a smirk. </p><p>While she tried to calm her excitement, I examined her. One detail was very clear. She used the break to refresh herself, and done that very successfully. Her hair was still damp, and her face alight -but still more than her usual amount- makeup, highlighting her beauty to a level it easily surpassed the most girls. It was smart of her not to use that normally, as her position at the school was too fragile to actually take such a risk. </p><p>But the more interesting change was her clothes. Her robe was open, revealing that underneath, she was wearing a blouse and a skirt, both much tighter than her usual selection. Even better, the top two buttons lay unlinked, giving me a delicious hint of cleavage. She seemed ready and enthusiastic about being seduced. </p><p>Though, I wasn’t surprised. The civilian equivalent of our situation was a minor noble suddenly piling a maid with several precious gifts and great attention, with an implied mistress position to elevate her well out of her class. For Helga, supporting her leveling and research simultaneously was everything she needed, everything that had been denied in the school, and everything that she couldn’t attain back home; so naturally, she was feeling grateful. Combine that with my charisma, my rather impressive physical state, and the fact that I had valiantly saved her from a dangerous ambush just an hour ago… Well, it would be surprising if it would take more than a word to make her panties drop… </p><p>Normally, I was planning to go for a quick seduction, but funnily enough, seeing her so enthusiastic changed my mind. I decided to play with her a bit. Luckily, I was prepared. </p><p>“I had an interesting idea about managing area effects of the volatile fields,” I said even as I pulled a small blanket from my bag and spread it on the floor, gesturing her to sit. Her shocked disappointment was amusing. I sat down, continuing to talk about various implications of managing alternating magical currents. She answered my inquires perfectly, but failed to hide her disappointment. </p><p>I shook my head despondently. I had expected her to try better to seduce me, but apparently, her self-confidence was too weak after the struggle she had gone through. “Wine?” I asked, cutting our discussion on the magical theory to pull a rather impressive vintage of wine and a pair of glasses, both pilfered from the kitchen. </p><p>“I wouldn’t say no to a sip,” she answered, and I made sure to smile suggestively as I poured her a glass, which, in turn, allowed her to lean forward excessively, giving a deep view of her delicious cleavage. After she pulled back, I waved my hand, and a plate of cheese pulled itself out from the bag, following my magic, until it landed between us. I could have done it the same easily for the wine as well, but it required a personal touch. </p><p>“So, I think we were discussing the resonance effect between unequal constructs,” I said, picking up the discussion where we left off. Helga was much more enthusiastic as she started answering once more, her answers garnished with a lot of unnecessary arm movements, which helped her breasts to dance alluringly. A particularly heated move even managed to pop another button of her blouse, enough to conclusively prove the absence of a bra — not that I needed a proof after watching the free dance of her breasts for the last several minutes. </p><p>[+100 Experience] 50% Penalty </p><p>The disappointment I felt from the rather excessive experience penalty didn’t last for long as she lifted herself forward as she reached for the cheese plate, unnecessarily as she could have easily reached for it, but the reason was clarified when she decided to use the movement as an excuse to sit closer, desire clear in her eyes. </p><p>Well, who I was to reject such a beauty… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 11    Experience: 63075 / 66000 </p><p>Strength: 15    Charisma: 17</p><p>Precision: 12    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 17</p><p>Speed: 12       Intelligence: 14</p><p>Endurance: 10      Wisdom: 18</p><p>HP: 671 / 671    Mana: 345 / 957             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Expert Arcana [61/75]    </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [44/50]        </p><p>Advanced Melee [37/50]</p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Marianne’s breath escaped her mouth explosively as she collided on the floor. She lay motionless for a moment, trying to process the change in her addled mind, giving me just enough time to remove my pants, catching up with her in the scale of nakedness. I used the opportunity to remove her shoes as well, leaving her necklace as the only piece of accessory on her body. </p><p>Then, she managed to gather her wits enough to turn back, only to lose her breath once more. Unsurprisingly, I might add, even if it was a touch arrogant. During the last few weeks, my body had transformed from a shapeless blob into a chiseled masterpiece, a visual impact that was further enhanced by aura granted by my charisma. And to crown it all, my erection stood between my legs, dangerously present… </p><p>“N-no,” she managed to say in shock, but it was a fleeting denial, ready to flutter away with the slightest wind. A wind that I was happy to provide, I thought even as I pressed my hand at her entrance, delivering a jolt of pleasure to her naked skin. Whatever she was going to say next disappeared into a moan that echoed on the walls, loud enough to force me to rapidly construct a silencing ward to prevent a wayward servant from checking the room. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[-25 Mana]</p><p>“Really, you don’t want it,” I said even as my fingers danced around her clit, triggering a new wave of pleasure that threatened to drown her without the escape valve of a climax. </p><p>It took four tries for her to answer properly, the first three melting down whenever I gently caressed her entrance, aborting her words in lieu of another moan. “My virginity,” she managed to murmur at the fourth one. </p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me so, honey?” I answered with an exaggerated cheer. “That’s easy to solve.” What I was talking about was easy to decipher when I jammed my thumb to her backdoor entrance, which I already magically prepared and cleaned for an intense session of lovemaking. It didn’t prevent her from letting out a shocked cry, which was more pleasure than pain; inevitable at her current state. “Isn’t that better?” </p><p>“N-no,” she said, or more accurately, that was what I deduced she was trying to say. It was more of a gasp than a word, impossible to decipher even for my enhanced senses. </p><p>“Can you clarify, sweetie,” I said even as I pushed my thumb deeper, enjoying the way she had clamped around my fingers. She tried to shift position, but I was ready for it, and put my left hand on her back, pinning her in place. She tried to stand up, but it was a weak, reluctant move, easily aborted by the weight of my hand alone. And when my other fingers joined the fray by circling around her knob, even that ineffectual resistance faded away. </p><p>[+1500 Experience]</p><p>I maintained the position for a while, but my pace picked up speed. When I decided to let another finger to join my thumb in its efforts to loosen her puckered hole for the next step, I let my other hand start dancing on her back, bringing her pleasure to an even sharper state of overwhelming, </p><p>I could see that she was ready for the next step. The biggest evidence for it was the lack of protest even as I pulled my hand away, and placed my erection between her plump cheeks, sliding back and forth rapidly. This time, unlike my previous disguised state, there was no missing what was there, but like before, she let out no words of protest. She did send a glance back -which took a great effort on her part in her exhausted state- but in her eyes, there was only helpless surrender against the demands of her body.</p><p>“I hope you’re ready,” I said even as I changed the position a bit, aligning the tip of my shaft against her entrance, but just before I pushed in, I slapped my forehead in an exaggerated manner. “I forgot to lubricate it,” I said as I stood up and walked towards her other end. “Damn, what are we going to do?”</p><p>“W-what?” she murmured as she struggled to raise her head, and when she did so, she found herself just an inch away from my erection. </p><p>“Simple, honey,” I said. “I can’t, in good conscience, take your ass without a lubricant, it would hurt too much. If only there was a solution,” I said, making a show of waiting for a few seconds before letting my face brighten. “I found it,” I said even as I pushed my shaft forward, touching her lips. </p><p>The expression of scandalous shock on her face, thick enough to push through her pleasure-addled brain, was hilarious. It was likely that, as a noble heiress, she hadn’t once considered she would hear such a scandalous offer, let alone receive that offer in such a visceral manner. “I would never-” she started, but I was quick to cut her. </p><p>“That’s okay if you think that was enough for today,” I said with a shrug, but kept my position stable. The level of desperation on her face as for the first time, she realized the depth of her mistake, enhanced further by the inescapable situation of it. She could have called it off, of course, but we both knew that it wasn’t a real option, not with her body drowning in unmet pleasure. </p><p>She was mine. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said as I patted her head patronizingly, which managed to awaken her annoyance, even if it was just for a moment before it was drowned by her desperate arousal. “Now, open wide, it’s the time for your medicine.” </p><p>The humiliating way I formed that order didn’t prevent her from following it. She widened her mouth, surrendering to the inevitable invasion. The warmth around my shaft was positively delicious, enough to finally deplete my frayed patience. Instead of pushing it gently, allowing her to get used to my presence, I lunged forward in one sharp push, until the tip of my shaft was tickling the entrance of her throat. </p><p>It wasn’t the nicest thing to do, but the resulting pleasure was too thick to ignore. I grabbed the back of her head, and pushing her even deeper, preventing her breathing. She gagged and gasped in a vain attempt to breathe while I enjoyed the virginal tightness of her throat. The tremors of her desperate moans increased the sensation even further. </p><p>A minute later, in a moment of mercy, I pulled out, examining her face, tears of strain filling her face, but it was nothing compared to the euphoria that was on her face. “Did you enjoy that, you whore,” I said even as I caressed her cheek with a contrasting gentleness, and received an obedient nod in reply. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I pushed forward once more, invading her throat once more, this time even deeper. “Just tap my leg if you need a break.” And with that, one of the most pleasurable experiences of my short but renewed life had started. She coughed, wheezed, and trembled, but at no point, the tap that would make me stop had arrived. And despite the minutes that passed, she managed to stay conscious, probably only thanks to the supernatural endurance given to her by the system. </p><p>And with each passing minute, my pace increased, until I was fucking her face ferociously, in a way that doubtlessly damaged her throat — lucky that we both had access to healing magic to fix it later on. But the real surprise was the great tremor that caught her body a few minutes later, giving her an explosive orgasm. </p><p>[Achievement: Boundless Bliss.

But even then, I was familiar with the leveling up enough to pay the proper attention to the significance of the level up, and picked Arcana to improve. I needed to maximize the benefit of my studies with Helga, after all. </p><p>I didn’t need my enhanced observational skills to know that she was about to fall unconscious as the orgasm hit her with all the subtlety of a crazed dragon. But that would not do, not when I just started. The solution was simple, I put my hand on her body, and cast a healing spell that would remove the exhaustion and clear the mind. It was underpowered, of course, just enough to keep her awake, but under the control of the haze. And I didn’t bother to hide the move, as she was too far gone to notice it. </p><p>[+1 Biomancy]</p><p>[-10 Mana]</p><p>I had already pulled out of her mouth and had taken my earlier position behind her, my shaft -erect once more- pushing against her puckered hole. “You’re ready for the main course, right, slut,” I said, punctuating the degrading comment with a rather loud spank that sent her plump bottom rippling. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when she murmured weakly instead of the angry exclamation she would have used just minutes before. It was a pity that she didn’t reply with an explosive moan of acceptance, begging for more, but I had a solid read on her, enough to realize her shyness was the only thing that prevented it. Not to mention the fear she was feeling at the prospect of her first real anal experience.</p><p>Initially, I was thinking about letting her lay on her chest while I abused my full access to her bottom, but her shyness was enough to change my mind. I rolled her with a push so that she ended up laying on her back, her eyes widened at the unexpected eye contact. While she tried to process the new position, I took my place between her legs, and cast a small arcana spell to create a small bump on the mattress, just enough to bring her puckered hole into the perfect elevation. </p><p>The expression of panic and pleasure that danced in her eyes was delicious as I leaned forward, placing my crown against it. Her eyes continued to grow as my shaft slowly disappeared into her tightness. “Damn, your grip is delicious,” I said with a smirk on my face, which enhanced the scandalous expression on her face, even more, her lips tightened further in shock. </p><p>[+1500 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Tasty Technicalities. Convince a noble lady to protect her virginity in an unusual manner. +500 Experience, +2 Manipulation]</p><p>Her sudden shock was understandable. Clearly, she had to expect the experience to be similar to our earlier massage session, covered with a veil of denial that allowed her to act like it was nothing more than a professional treatment, just a bit more intense than the usual. But our current position was too intimate for her to maintain that particular lie, particularly thanks to our eye contact. </p><p>A moment later, she decided to take the simplest option, and closed her eyes. I had to intention of allowing such a simple plan to succeed after all the effort I had gone through, but I wanted to do that in a fun manner. Since her eyes were closed, she didn’t see the momentary glow of my fingers as I cast a small spell that would increase her sensation, nor she noticed its destination until my fingers clamped around her nipples. A gasp escaped her mouth as I squeezed her breasts, my perception providing me information about the exact pressure I should be using for the maximum benefit. She opened her eyes, but it lasted a fleeting moment when she met with my gaze, colored with a victorious amusement. </p><p>[+2 Biomancy]</p><p>[-50 Mana]</p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>But that was just a beginning. I pushed my shaft deeper and deeper, forcing frequent moans through the lips she tried to keep shut, with not an inconsiderable amount of assistance from my fingers mauling her bountiful breasts. This time, she managed to keep her eyes closed. </p><p>So be it, I decided as I leaned forward, and my lips pressed against her neck with surprising gentleness, leaving feather-light kisses that made her shiver sexily. It was effective, because the gentleness of my lips was contrasted greatly with the merciless pumping of my hips, drilling deeper and deeper into her tightness without a shred of mercy, the lubrication I had applied to her tightness that prevented her pain to rose high enough to cloud her pleasure. </p><p>Under the combined assault, it wasn’t surprising that her determination to keep her voice down hadn’t survived for long. Her moans rise unbidden, surprisingly melodic now that she deserted her attempts to stay silent. I was curious of the expression I would find in her eyes, but chose to continue my focus on her neck instead, determined to fill her with pleasure until her concerns drowned in a sea of euphoria. </p><p>The treatment lasted for several minutes before I pulled back from her neck, though I continued impaling her mercilessly. This time, when I met with her eyes, she made no effort to close them, her pleasure easy to read. “So, Marianne, what’s your opinion on the true version of my massage technique? Much better, right?” </p><p>In response to my question, Marianne did something I would have assumed to be impossible in her current state. She blushed cutely, so much that it tempted me to lean forward and catch her lips in a sudden burst of hunger. Her lips joined the dance in enthusiasm, her tongue readily accepting mine in response, answering my question much better than her words could. </p><p>[+500 Experience} </p><p>[Achievement: Unusual Usurpation. Manage to trigger a crush in a lady under unusual circumstances. +500 Experience, +2 Charisma]</p><p>The last achievement managed to put a smile on my face. When I managed to convince her to this moment through underhanded seduction, I was expecting to establish a love-hate relationship based only on physical needs from her part. Her crush was an unexpected surprise, but by no means unwelcome. On the contrary, it gave me another hook to convince her for more. </p><p>I changed position once more as my own pleasure started to become too high to contain. I pulled away from the kiss, and grabbed her hands for extra leverage before starting to slam into her in a renewed speed, each connection creating another naughty clap that filled the room. Her tits flailed wildly with each repeat, the way her butt was wobbling was enough to break the resistance of a less experienced man. </p><p>But the most important part was the expression of ecstasy on her face, her reason lost, stealing any recollection about her current location, or the significance of the events that brought her to this particular point. </p><p>The climax hit her as I started filling her tight hole with my seed, triggering a climax from her side as well. She gasped and moaned, trembling like an out-of-control earthquake, looking as delicious as a freshly-baked birthday cake…</p><p>[+2500 Experience]</p><p>Continuing further was a tempting idea, but after the emotional and physical ordeal she had gone through, Marianne looked just a dash away collapsing. Instead, I decided to lay next to her to leverage her recently generated crush. In her daze, she said nothing when she found my arms around her, embracing her with surprising gentleness. Though I was surprised when she leaned forward, initiating a kiss on her own volition for the first time. </p><p>I said nothing as I felt the softness of her chest against mine, the gentle kiss we shared reminiscent of the ending of a romance tale. I could feel my manhood awakening once more at the sensation, but this time, I decided to act patient. I wanted the moment to be clear on Marianne’s mind, that she was the initiator. </p><p>It took a while for her rationality to catch up. Her hand had been wandering over my chiseled torso, enjoying the contours, when it slipped too low and wrapped around my shaft. Even then, only after she delivered several enthusiastic tugs she remembered the full extent of the situation. </p><p>The yelp that escaped her mouth was cutest to date. “I need to go,” she stammered in panic even as she dashed towards her clothes, trying to put her corset in panic, only to fail due to her trembling hands. </p><p>“Why don’t you come here so I can help,” I said with a smirk. She looked at me in shock, like I had spoken the most absurd thing I could. “Really, that’s what you feel self-conscious about after everything,” I added, and she dipped her head. But her resurfaced shyness didn’t prevent her from walking to me, one hand between her legs to hide her treasure; a move that would have made more sense if my seed hadn’t been dripping out of her other hole. </p><p>She sat in front of me, and despite the temptation of pushing her down for another round, I kept my fingers on the hooks of her corset, slowly linking them. I didn’t miss the opportunity to sensually caress her skin, of course, something that she hadn’t missed. I even grabbed the shirt I ripped earlier, and repaired it magically to a workable degree. </p><p>[-7 Mana]</p><p>But when she reached for her ripped panties, I was quicker to grab them, and slid them into my pocket before she could say anything. “My payment for the services rendered,” I said with a smirk. She said nothing, and just continued to dress in a blush on her face, well-aware of my gaze watching her every movement. </p><p>She said nothing while she finished her preparations, but turned back after putting her hand on the doorknob. “This was a one-time thing, there’ll be no repeat!” she said in the sharpest tone she could manage, which would have been marginally convincing if she hadn’t run out of the room with a distinct stumble in her steps. </p><p>The repeat was inevitable. The only question was how long she would be able to last… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 11    Experience: 61975 / 66000 </p><p>Strength: 15    Charisma: 17</p><p>Precision: 11    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 17</p><p>Speed: 11       Intelligence: 12</p><p>Endurance: 10      Wisdom: 18</p><p>HP: 649 / 649    Mana: 763 / 935             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Expert Arcana [50/75]    </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [44/50]        </p><p>Advanced Melee [29/50]</p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p>",

    "title": "Dominating the Boss 17",
    "content": "<p>It would be a lie if I claimed that physical enjoyment had the priority in mind while I slid inside Natalie. Not because it wasn’t an amazing feeling -as Natalie’s tight grip was definitely something to cherish- but because it was the final step of my plan to dominate my dear boss. There was something uniquely beautiful in fucking her on all-fours while she was licking her girlfriend obediently, and to make things even better, said girlfriend had taken a joyride on my shaft just moments ago. </p><p>Just to underline my sense of superiority, I slapped her bottom, earning a dirty look in response, but before Natalie could say anything, Jenny already grabbed her hair and pulled her back to her slit, ruining Natalie’s token display of disobedience much better than anything I could have done. “Don’t stop, honey,” Jenny exclaimed as she threw her head back in joy, presenting her breasts to the maximum effect, tempting me to abandon Natalie to fill her instead, claiming ownership. Luckily, Natalie was no less delicious, helping me to resist the temptation. But more importantly, I wanted Natalie to beg for more in front of me like the slut she was, ruining any upper hand she had against Jenny for the future when she asked for a repeat. After all, this particular threesome was too delicious to only be a one-off event. </p><p>With that in mind, I decided to bring my A-game to the play, and suddenly picked up speed. The sound of our bodies colliding started to echo in the room, rocking Natalie’s body back and forth. The only reason she was still able to service her girlfriend was the tight grasp Jenny had on her raven locks, which doubtlessly added another layer of pain to her enjoyment with each rocking. Jenny seemed to miss that particular fact, and Natalie was too prideful to ask mercy for such a small thing. And I was enjoying the situation too much to interject. And just like that, Natalie’s muffled moans filled the room, soon joined by Jenny’s crystal-clear cries. </p><p>“Damn, boss, I would never guess you were this tight, you’re practically a virgin,” I said even as I spanked her once more, her bottom taking another small step towards the crimson. And it was even true, she was even tighter than our first time in the casino. Maybe it was the presence of her girlfriend, I reasoned, or the lack of an extended foreplay session, but whatever it was, I was enjoying it. </p><p>“It has been a while she had anything down there,” Jenny answered cheerfully, her statement broken into two by a moan. “After all, it had been quite a while anything had been down there, even a toy,” she continued, amusement slightly tinged by annoyance. Someone clearly possessed a penetration fetish, I reasoned with a smile, and moreover, Natalie clearly had neglected it, likely hoping that Jenny would lose her focus, but like any other attempt to suppress an obsession, it had the reverse effect. Now that Jenny was free to indulge her kink in multiple dimensions, she was determined to grasp its advantages completely, without mercy. </p><p>With a smirk on my face, I leaned forward, close enough to grab Natalie’s breasts, and started squeezing them hard, just the way Natalie liked, no matter how much she tried to deny it. At first, Jenny looked at me askew, the rough treatment Natalie was receiving a bit above her limits, but luckily, with her head buried between the legs of her girlfriend, Natalie failed to note the rope thrown by her girlfriend, and intensified her display of joy. That was all the evidence I needed, something I conveyed to Jenny with a quirk of my eyebrows. She just smiled sheepishly, her expression once again broken a moment later when a jolt of pleasure broke her focus. </p><p>And with Jenny distracted, I was free to bring a full range of slaps, bites, and squeezes on Natalie’s body, who, after all the times enjoying my treatment, was more than able to handle it. Not to mention, she had an ulterior motive, more time I spent on her, less I spent on her girlfriend. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of allowing even that sliver of victory. After a while, I gestured Jenny to stop holding her hair before grabbing myself, and pulled her head back painfully, so much that she had to push herself upright just to avoid the brunt of the pain. Ignoring Jenny for a moment, I leaned Natalie’s ear and whispered. “I have a new task for you. In the pocket of my jacket, you’ll find equipment to prepare yourself for anal,” I explained while making sure it went unheard by Jenny. Natalie looked rebellious, and I continued. “Either that, or I fill up Jenny for the rest of the night, your choice.” </p><p>That managed to earn a nod from Natalie, and she stood up. Just as she was about to walk toward my jacket, I whispered once more. “I recommend you to hurry up. Who knows how long I would be able to resist,” I explained her, and then watched as she dashed to my jacket, before changing her direction to upstairs. </p><p>“Where did Natalie go,” Jenny asked after her girlfriend had disappeared at the end of the stairs. </p><p>“We have agreed on a small surprise for you, so you need to be patient,” I explained even as I took a few steps towards her. </p><p>Though excited with the prospect of a surprise, Jenny didn’t look too pleased. “Couldn’t you have waited a minute or two, I was just about to climax again,” Jenny pouted, even as she parted her legs invitingly. </p><p>It would have taken a true idiot to ignore the invite. “Of course, just because she’s preparing a surprise doesn’t mean that we need to wait until her arrival,” I said even as my steps devoured the distance between us. When I arrived at her position, I slipped my arms under her knees and forced her to raise her legs, leveraging her flexibility as a pilates instructor to a maximum until her ankles ended up in my shoulders, her snatch positioned perfectly for merciless drilling. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked as I pressed forward, my arms pressing on the back of the couch from both sides of her, stealing her freedom of movement completely. And just like that, I descended her like a frenzied demon, my slamming echoing on the room even louder than what Natalie had gone through. With her backside firmly planted to the seat, Jenny had no freedom of movement, forced to passively accept my merciless assault, no different than a toy. </p><p>And from her words, she was very much enjoyed the situation. “Oh yes, fuck me! Impale me! Ruin sex for me!” she exclaimed in rapid succession, her words blurring together with her moans until they turned out to be barely intelligible. “I’m your slut, dominate me!” </p><p>“Yes, you’re my slut,” I answered calmly, mostly enjoying the situation, though a part of me couldn’t help to imagine Natalie’s expression, who was doing her best to quickly prepare for anal sex just to save her girlfriend, the same girlfriend that was begging for me to stretch her like a balloon. </p><p>It wasn’t a shock that Jenny was able to resist my merciless assault barely a minute before she started trembling under a monumental orgasm. “Yes, that’s the best fuck I have ever experienced! Impale me more-” Jenny continued, only cut short by a searing kiss I had delivered on her lips, her tongue more than ready to meet me halfway. Even as she trembled, I continued to slam into her repeatedly, rapidly building up for another orgasm. </p><p>When I heard a door upstairs, I decided to move onto the next stage of my plan. “I’m about to cum. Do you want me to pull out, or do you want me to fill you up?” I asked. </p><p>Jenny’s answer was even more spectacular than I had hoped. The first part came wordless, her legs wrapping around my waist with a surprising strength that was only developed by endless hours of exercising, cutting my path to escape. “I will kill you if you dare to pull out!” she exclaimed, far too gone in pleasure to fully process the implications of her request. “Now fill me to the brim, you magnificent bastard!” she exclaimed. </p><p>And the timing couldn’t have been more perfect. I started spraying her insides the moment Natalie had appeared on the top of the stair. She dashed forward, but there was nothing she could do to prevent it. There was precious little I could do, even, because I was pinned tightly by Jenny, and forcing myself out would require more time than I required to fill her completely. And the most important fact that, I didn’t want to pull out, so I pushed as deep as I could manage while my body continued to spurt strings of joy. </p><p>I pulled out when Natalie managed to arrive, but at that moment, though it didn’t really help Natalie’s desires, as I was spent other than the occasional errant drop. Natalie’s gaze danced between her dazed girlfriend who was dripping a thick flow of my seed despite her best efforts to use her two fingers to keep it in pace -her other hand busy squeezing her breasts for additional stimulation as she tried to manage the after-effects of another orgasm- and my shaft, dripping and still half-erect after its monumental explosion. </p><p>Then, Jenny managed to say something that shocked us equally. “It’s a better idea than adoption, isn’t it?” she asked, catching me flatfooted with the idea of suddenly being a father. But for me, the shock lasted for a moment. After all, I had no commitment on the subject, meaning even if they actually went through with the baby, I could easily deny the involvement, or limit it to mostly financial contribution. And on that aspect, I had no issues. </p><p>Natalie was much more shocked. “You’re a bit late,” I said with a smirk even as I wrapped my fingers around her wrist, and gently pulled her towards the nearest chair. In shock, Natalie failed to react, caught flatfooted by the sudden probability of becoming a mother. It was clear that they had talked it before, but it was equally clear that Natalie hadn’t been expecting things to happen this quickly. </p><p>In a sense, Natalie was lucky that I had the perfect plan to distract her from her impending motherhood. Facing the amazing view, my shaft was already erect, so when I sat down on the chair and pulled Natalie on my lap -both of us facing towards Jenny-, she let out a shocked gasp once my shaft pressed against her recently-cleaned puckered hole. She gasped in shock, and tried to escape, but my grip was tight around her waist. “Honey, either this, or I breed Jenny until I can make sure that she’s pregnant. Your choice,” I told her. </p><p>That was enough to break Natalie’s reluctance. After all, it didn’t matter much to Natalie. According to our bet, she was supposed to obey and serve me for the next year, meaning I would have a lot of opportunities to break through her backdoor. So, instead of pulling away, she slowly pushed herself down, swallowing my shaft bit by bit. I let her control the pace, a small reward for her obedience. </p><p>Meanwhile, Jenny was shocked at the view. “Honey, is that going into your ass?” Jenny asked in shock, and Natalie nodded, her lips firmly shut to keep her pained yelps in, but gaining only limited success in the process. After all, losing her anal virginity was a painful process, especially at first. At that point, Jenny stopped masturbating with her cum-covered fingers and stood up, giving Natalie a hug. “Oh, honey. That’s an amazing gift! You’re the best!” Then, she started kissing Natalie passionately.  </p><p>Though I was willing to bet that, despite the amazingness of the body that delivered it, Natalie wasn’t entirely happy with the sudden hug. The reason was simple, the sudden movement pushed her down, ending up most of my shaft lodged in her bowels, causing a painful jolt. Still, Natalie managed to keep her voice to a minimum, and the small escaped moans were muffled by Jenny’s lips. But when Jenny pulled back from the kiss, she had done something that was even more surprising. She had pushed her fingers into Natalie’s mouth, her cum-covered fingers that were busy digging through her stained tunnel just moments ago. “It’s a reward,” she explained, not giving Natalie a chance to reject, and she was not in a position to resist. </p><p>Jenny pulled back as quickly as she had started. “I have an even better idea,” she said in excitement and dashed upstairs, my seed dripping down her legs freely. </p><p>“So, does it mean that I’m a father now,” I whispered into Natalie’s ears, earning a scathing look despite the situation. I was quick to punish her, pulling her down harshly, forcing her to yelp in pain as her asshole stretched to its limits. </p><p>“Don’t even joke about it,” she managed to say after several quick breaths to contain the pain, a duration which I used to a maximum effect by sliding my fingers into her slit, starting to pump mercilessly, turning the situation into a pseudo-double-penetration. She gasped once more. “It’s just a passing fancy, we’re not ready to have a child,” she explained. </p><p>“Best of luck,” I countered her. “But she seemed quite enthusiastic. I’m sure you heard how she begged to be impregnated, and her leg strength was not a joke either. There’s no benefit for you fighting a losing battle.” </p><p>“It’s none of your business,” Natalie spat a scathing answer rapidly, and received the corresponding punishment just as quick. </p><p>“Considering a considerable part of pregnancy process was done by me, and the fact that I’m somehow going to fuck her partner in the ass for the next year means that I’m going to be somehow linked to the process,” I explained in amusement, enjoying the sudden windfall of interjecting myself into such a private subject. But before Natalie could answer, Jenny appeared on the stairs, bringing a surprise along. On her waist, a considerably-large strap-on was firmly attached, and from her enthusiastic gaze toward Natalie, there was little mystery how she imagined to use it. </p><p>“That’s why you don’t repress people’s kinks,” I whispered into Natalie’s ear, amused just how much things had gone out of control for her. Not only her girlfriend had surrendered herself to me, and enthusiastically watched as Natalie lost her anal virginity, but also she was going to be a willing participant. That was even better than my dreams. </p><p>“You don’t mind if I join, do you,” Jenny asked as she closed in the distance.  </p><p>Natalie opened her mouth to answer, but I had the perfect way to silence her. I quickened my anal assault, and her words disappeared. “Nobody asked you,” I whispered into her ear before turning my attention to Jenny. “Sure, the more, the merrier. And actually, let me help you.” With that, I stood up while still keeping my shaft in, forcing Natalie to stand up with me as well, the unfamiliar angle enhancing the anal strain she was in even further. </p><p>“Thanks for the invite,” Jenny said with an exaggerated cheerfulness before sliding into Natalie, creating an uneven, but a still delicious sandwich. Jenny attacked Natalie’s lips, who could do nothing but obediently accept her wandering tongue, while her hips started pushing back and forth. I made sure to match my pace to her furious assault, and Natalie, stuck in the middle, started moaning helplessly, the pleasure impossible to resist, turning her into a helpless toy.</p><p>It was even better than my wildest hopes for the night. With this, iron links that pinned Natalie helpless turned titanium, completing my quest of domination. </p><p>Nobody messed with me without paying the price… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had sent away Camilla after a brief stop in my apartment, where I delivered a small bag to Camilla - to be used in the evening activities with Megan. Only then I went back to my room to sweep through, making sure there was nothing incriminating laying around, and also placed a couple of bugs and secret cameras, just for insurance in case things went off rails. </p><p>It was already evening when I finished, so I sent Camilla a message, telling her to be at Megan’s room in ten minutes, and after a brief shower, I took my seat in front of my computer, waiting for Camilla to arrive. While I waited, my gaze danced on Megan’s delicious body, wearing only a tight tank, her panties the only other piece of clothing on her body, revealing her delicious legs for my viewing pleasure. </p><p>I would admit that watching her lazing around the room with a complicated expression on her face was tempting, especially after enjoying the way these legs had wrapped around tightly. For a thin girl like her, her legs were able to put out a surprising display of strength as they wrapped around me. I could have just sent her a message, and she would end up in my room once again, ready to follow my directions. </p><p>But I managed to resist the temptation. After all, I had promised my cute assistant that she would have been the one to teach Megan a little lesson after all the times she had been used by her, and it would be rude to change the plans at the last second; especially after seeing her excited expression after seeing all the toys. </p><p>Though, resisting that temptation when Megan sat on the edge of one of the chairs, my name on her lips while her fingers disappeared inside her panties turned out to be a challenge; though it was always nice to see that the time we had spent together was rather memorable. Luckily, before my willpower was strained any further, a knock was heard on the door, and Camilla entered the room, a bag in her hand. </p><p>“What are you doing here,” Megan asked Camilla, surprised at her sudden arrival, and barely had enough time to pull her hand out. </p><p>“Somebody dropped it in front of my door. Apparently, it’s supposed to be yours,” Camilla answered calmly rather than in her usual almost-whisper tone, making me proud. She was starting to develop a backbone under my treatment, and that was something every teacher wanted to see. </p><p>“Who! Who gave you that?” Megan asked as she jumped up to her feet, the sudden movement having a delicious impact on her breasts. </p><p>“What part of being dropped in front of my door is unclear?” Camilla asked, once again making me proud. “They were already gone when I managed to reach the door.” </p><p>“I see…” Megan answered, a frown on her face as she looked at Camilla’s face. “Do you know what’s inside.” </p><p>“A bunch of toys,” Camilla answered. But before Megan could inquire further, I had already sent the first message. ‘Have you checked the present I had painstakingly prepared for you, my dear leader,’ I wrote. </p><p>When the phone buzzed, Megan stopped Camilla’s interrogation for a moment, and turned her attention on her phone, a frown appearing on her face the moment her gaze fell on the screen. ‘The bag is from you?’ she wrote back in answer. </p><p>‘What do you think?’ I wrote. </p><p>A frown bloomed on Megan’s face while she wordlessly walked towards Camilla, and pulled the bag off her hands. Camilla gave a knowing smirk, though even through the camera, I was able to read the flash of anger in her eyes. But she was a smart girl, and she had no trouble keeping it hidden from a distracted Megan, especially when she knew the next step of my plan. </p><p>Meanwhile, Megan went through the content of the bag, her expression darkening with each sifting of the contents. Soon, her face had turned into a fiery storm. ‘What’s the meaning of this! You can’t expect me to use all of them,’ she wrote. </p><p>‘Do you want to bet,’ was my answer. ‘I have gone all the trouble of collecting these, and I won’t be happy if you just go and ignore my efforts. My feelings would get hurt, and that’s the last thing you want.’ </p><p>‘You can’t ask me that!’ was her answer. </p><p>‘I can, and I will. I have already given you a simple task, seduce one little measly professor, and you failed your task. This is punishment.’</p><p>‘But I already seduced him,’ she wrote even as an indignant expression on her face. </p><p>‘… and you have the evidence for that?’ I asked. </p><p>‘My phone malfunctioned,’ she typed rapidly, but from her expression, I could easily read that her hopes of getting out of the situation were disappearing. </p><p>“So, what was inside,” Camilla asked, but went ignored while Megan was busy furiously typing her answers, giving me a litany of reasons why it was unacceptable or unfeasible, each easily punctured as balloons trying to resist a combat knife. </p><p>A while later, I gave her a final ultimatum. ‘Make a decision, either you use these toys with the assistance of your little slut and send the resulting video evidence to me, or I inform our previous esteemed leader that just how badly you have failed on your task.’ The sullen expression that appeared on her face was amusing to see, tempting me to send one last message. ‘And don’t forget to act properly submissive. I had put a lot of effort into putting these tools together, and I don’t want it to go to waste.’ </p><p>Megan looked at the screen for a couple of seconds, but when her fingers touched the screen her phone, the last embers of her rebellion was already extinguished. ‘You win,’ she wrote in surrender before turning to Camilla. “These are for a bet with a friend, apparently, she was being funny by dropping them with you,” Megan said as she pulled the first few items from the bag, namely, a pair of handcuffs, a lacy blindfold, and a velvet paddle colored in an ominous black. </p><p>“It must be an interesting bet,” Camilla countered, the smirk on her face highly unusual. She took a step forward, her fingers squeezing in anticipation. “So, should I leave you alone so that you can focus on your bet.” </p><p>“Actually, no,” Megan answered, a frown appeared on her face as she tried to process Camilla’s uncharacteristic confrontational attitude, but with everything else going on, the important details managed to slip through. “I was thinking maybe you can help me fulfilling the bet.” </p><p>“Definitely not if that means that you’re going to use them on me,” Camilla answered with an exaggerated, her breasts dancing wildly with the motion, her bra absent since I had confiscated it in our previous encounter. </p><p>This time, Megan’s frown was even more pronounced, finally realizing that something was significantly different from Camilla. She stood indecisively, looking like she was preparing herself for a confrontation, so I decided to help my assistant a little, and sent her another text, asking whether the show had started. Megan sighed, deciding to focus her immediate problems first. “Actually, no,” Megan explained, keeping her frustration in check reasonably well. “The bet means that I’ll be the recipient.” </p><p>“It’s alright then,” Camilla answered cheerfully even as she reached for the handcuffs. “What’s the safe word?” </p><p>“There’s no need for a safe word. I would not need one,” Megan answered, her chest pushed out pridefully. The safe word part was a part of my orders, but her unnecessarily prideful display came to me as a surprise. Maybe she was trying to act dominant against Camilla to remind her of the proper balance between them. But if that was the case, that was a rather poorly thought-out idea, as it only galvanized Camilla further. </p><p>“So, you’re saying that for the next couple of hours, I’m allowed to whatever you want, and you have no right to reject?” Camilla said, as enthusiastic as a little lioness going for her first hunt. </p><p>Her enthusiasm made Megan do a double-take, unhappy that her statement only provoked her previously-submissive girlfriend. At that point, the reasonable thing would have been to give her a safe word nevertheless, but Megan was too prideful to take a step back. “Exactly, do your worst,” Megan answered even as she put her phone on the bed, video recording already engaged. </p><p>“Really?” Camilla countered. “Then, lay on the bed,” she said even as she started going through the stuff in the bag. When she pulled back, she had a pair of silk ribbons in hand, and slowly walked towards Megan’s side, gesturing her to give her hand. Megan looked uncomfortable at the prospect of losing her freedom at the first minute, as the lack of safeword had much more implications when she lacked the freedom of movement. Still, her pride was strong, so she maintained her silence even when Camilla tied her other arm. </p><p>But when she pulled another pair of silk ribbons from the bag, Megan finally reacted. “Isn’t it a bit too much?” she asked even as Camilla wrapped the soft fabric around her ankle. </p><p>Her answer was a slap on her thigh. “Did I ask for your opinion?” Camilla said, trying to look impervious and domineering — but only with limited success. Still, combined with the shock of the unprompted spank, it managed to shut Megan up enough for Camilla to finish tying her up. Then, she took a step back, enjoying the sight of the redheaded beauty, forced into a spread-eagle position with midnight-black ribbons. “Now for the last touch,” she said before placing the lacy blindfold of the same color on her eyes, the sight delicious enough to make me wish I was there. </p><p>“Camilla…” Megan murmured, her voice trembling, but my assistant ignored as per my suggestions, and instead, walked towards the fridge to pull a bunch of ice cubes. Then, she went back to the bag, and pulled out a scented candle, manufactured for bedroom activities, and a silver blade. A gash escaped Megan’s mouth as she felt the cold blade against her skin. “Is that a knife!” she asked. </p><p>“It is, so I recommend you not to move,” Camilla ordered. Megan opened her mouth to argue, only to receive a flick on the lips as a warning, though she got the message only when Camilla pressed the blunt side of the knife against her wound once more. The knife took a scenic route between the valley of her breasts, slowly trailing down, leaving the tank top in pieces in its wake. When the task was finished, Camilla pulled away from the top with a negligent pull and tossed it away, then subjected Megan’s panties to the same treatment with a simple slash, ultimately, leaving her completely naked. </p><p>The next thing Camilla grasped was an ice cube, pressing it against Megan’s chest to do a small circle, earning another gasp from her. When she pulled away, her eyes fell on the candle that was resting in the middle of the other tools, and for a moment, I thought that she had forgotten the crux of my lessons. But only after a step, she stopped, and instead started undressing, slowly and sensuously, giving an amazing show despite her lack of awareness about the recording. She was giving a show, because I had explained to her it would help her get into the correct mood. </p><p>The top went out first, revealing her spectacular breasts, unrestrained by a bra, their taste still on my lips after our brief but an intense encounter. Her shoes were gone next, flying away with a swing each move. Only then she slowly slid out of her skirt, leaving her completely naked. At that point, Megan was getting a bit restless, so she dragged another ice cube over her body, earning another gasp in the process, before walking away towards Megan’s wardrobe, following the second part of my advice. </p><p>If you want to be in control, you first need to dress the part. </p><p>With that in mind, Camilla dug through the wardrobe until she pulled a little red g-string, which only helped to display her shapely bottom even better, and a transparent red robe that looked rather striking against her caramel skin. I would have liked her to complete the set with a sexy bra, but it wasn’t really likely that she would be able to fit one of Megan’s. She pulled a pair of black stilettos to complete the ensemble before walking back to Megan, each step creating a distinctive click on the floor. </p><p>Her changes were obvious. Just by changing her clothes, she transformed into a new, much more confident woman, her gait confident and domineering. And just to display that confidence, she lit the sensual candle before raising it a bit higher than the distance I recommended, therefore allowing it to cool a bit more before it contacted with Megan’s skin. Though, ultimately, it wasn’t really surprising. It was the first time Camilla was displaying her bondage skills, and a bit of reticence was to be expected. </p><p>And it’s coldness was relative. After all, it was still hot wax, and a shocked cry escaped Megan’s mouth the moment one of the red drops connected with her previously-flawless skin. “What the hell, Camilla!” she yelled in shock, but in response, she just received another drip of hot wax. </p><p>“We’re playing, of course,” Camilla answered with a calmness that even surprised me, so Megan’s shocked expression was understandable. “Though, if you think you can’t handle, you can always beg for me to stop.” And just like that, Megan’s complaints were cut like a knife, unwilling to tarnish her pride for just a bit of pain. Camilla let out an excited smile as she grabbed another ice cube, and drew a gentle circle around her belly button, making her shiver helplessly, caught flatfooted by the sudden change of temperature, something Camilla quickly leveraged by dripping some more hot wax on her, making her gasp in shock. </p><p>She alternated it a couple of more times, but meanwhile, slipped a couple of ice cubes into her mouth, sucking them gently to cool her mouth, then she leaned forward to capture Megan’s nipple between the cold prison of her lips. Megan gasped once more, but this time, it was quick to turn into a moan when Camilla stayed stuck around her nipple, gently sucking while her free hand danced over her skin, enhancing her moans. </p><p>As the minutes passed under Camilla’s patient treatment, Megan slowly started to forget that it was supposed to be a punishment. “It feels amazing! Make me cum!” Megan moaned, but only to receive a spank for her trouble. </p><p>“You’re my toy for the night! How dare you try to order me!” Camilla bellowed in a surprising display of confidence, and underlined her statement by grabbing the velvet paddle, and landing three quick beats on Megan’s hips. Playing to dominatrix was definitely helping her to find her confidence. </p><p>“I’m sorry!” Megan exclaimed in shock, caught flatfooted by Camilla’s stiff punishment. “Please forgive me, mistress.”</p><p>Megan’s last sentence surprised me just as much as it surprised Camilla. After all, neither of us was expecting Megan to fold this easily, even for an empty display. Maybe the earlier kidnapping attempt shook her more than I first presumed. </p><p>“Good girl,” Camilla answered, patting her head softly as if to reward a small child, but then her hands started travel lower, passing through her neck, and arriving at her breasts, gently digging into Megan’s suppleness, though she was still merciless enough to let another drip connect with her skin whenever Megan opened her mouth in preparation for another sentence. And with each drip, Megan moaned louder and louder, her excitement starting to increase when Camilla’s hand started to travel lower until it arrived at the treasured location between her legs. </p><p>Since Megan was already gushing her wetness, all it took was a soft caress for her to shudder helplessly. “Please, I need it, mistress. Please let me cum!” Megan begged, the passing of time hadn’t been particularly gentle on her while she was wrapped tighter than a Christmas present, helplessly waiting to be untied. But Camilla ignored her begging in favor of gently caressing her entrance, each passing second making Megan moan louder, particularly intensified when Camilla occasionally dipped her hand into the ice bucket before continuing her intimate massage, her other hand still holding the candle, occasionally dripping wax on Megan’s skin, marring it further with temporary red patches. </p><p>“Do you think you deserve a reprieve?” Camilla suddenly asked, not stopping the treatment Megan was receiving even for a moment. </p><p>“Yes, mistress,” Megan moaned, this time, her statement much more genuine. </p><p>“Wrong!” Camilla exclaimed, her hand, rather than caressing Megan’s core, landed a string of painful slaps on Megan’s breasts, destroying her equilibrium even further. </p><p>“Mercy,” Megan called, though her cry wasn’t purely pain. I was even willing to bet that it was more pleasure than pain, marking a perfect time to push into the next stage of the proceedings. And Camilla, fittingly for my prized student, managed to recognize it as well and stood up, extinguished the candle, and placed it on the side. Then, she removed the blindfold from Megan, who instantly turned a pitiful needly glance towards Camilla, her arousal dominating her mind. </p><p>However, heedless of her looks, Camilla walked towards the bag of toys once more… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had always been a light sleeper, so it wasn’t surprising that my sleep was dispersed the moment I felt alongside my body, though my arms wrapped around its source reflexively. I heard a gasp the moment my arms tightened. I opened my eyes, only to find the agitated -and very naked- figure of my problem student Megan. </p><p>“Let me go,” she ordered me in a manner she obviously thought as commanding and cold, but she was too experienced to successfully hide the tremble in her tone. </p><p>“And what if I don’t,” I answered with a smirk. It was obvious that she was trying to leverage the practiced coldness of an heiress to push through the vulnerability. After all, it couldn’t be comfortable for her that she basically bared her soul -and body- naked for a professor she hated, even when saving her from the obvious kidnapping was factored. </p><p>“How dare you-” she tried to start, only to be cut off by a moan. The reason, my fingers, gently caressing a particularly sensitive spot on her neck, which I had discovered during the previous activities. “Cut it-” she tried, but her attempt foiled by yet another soft caress. </p><p>“Don’t be rude,” I ordered even as I brought my other hand to her thigh, squeezing suggestively. “You’re a guest, and it’s unseemly for a guest to shout like that.” </p><p>“I want to go,” she whispered, but this time, there was an easy-to-detect tremble in her tone, the same needy tone that she carried when she was in the shower, begging for my touch. </p><p>“Of course,” I said, even as I brought my hand higher, just an inch away from her slit, its wetness obvious for my eyes. “Do you want to go now, or would you like a repeat first.” </p><p>“I would like to go now,” she repeated, but the wavering in her tone was obvious. All it would take was a little push, and she would comply. Instead, I pulled my hands away and left her alone, much to her surprise. The reason was simple, I was curious about her reaction. </p><p>Her first response was a silent surprise, like she hadn’t been expecting her simple request to be fulfilled. And it would be a lie if I said that while watching her naked body, I wasn’t tempted to push her down and trap her between my body and the mattress slamming repeatedly until I broke the bed. There was something about taming arrogant rich girls in such a primal way that made it truly enjoyable. But also, it was the pursuit that made hunting fun, and I wanted Megan to run away to recover a bit before I pounced for the final time. I was curious about how long she would last. </p><p>She harrumphed in disdain after her surprise finally drained, and stood up, trying to take the blanket to cover her body, but after a snort from me, she realized the ridiculousness of it, and let it go. She walked towards the pile of discarded clothes, bent down to pick them up, and giving me an amazing view in the process. She noticed my attentive watch and cattily commented. “Do you mind?” </p><p>“I do mind, actually,” I commented, my eyes firmly on her body. “Why should I deprive myself of such a nice view?” </p><p>“Pig,” she murmured, but her actions were in contrast to her words. Not only she hadn’t gone to the bathroom to change, but also she maintained a sensual pace as she dressed, giving me a rather excellent show. “I’m going away now, you better never talk about what had just happened if you want to keep your job,” she explained, before stopping for a second. “Actually, you better forget that it ever happened, clear?” she followed, and I chose to nod, unable to keep away my amusement. </p><p>With that, Megan left my apartment, leaving me alone. The moment she disappeared, a serious expression appeared on my face. While spending time with her had been fun, the appearance of my old business partners was quite a risk. There was a limit of effectiveness for the plastic surgery, and if I continued to intercept them, it was a matter of time before I was recognized. I needed to call some old friends, no matter how inconvenient it might be. </p><p>With a sigh, I reached for my burner and quickly typed a familiar number. The voice on the other side was sharp and dangerous. “Who are you, and how do you have this number?”</p><p>I didn’t let the naked hostility in his tone to affect me. “Are you always this hostile when greeting old friends, chief,” I said amusedly, but my tone was different than what I had used while teaching in the college — yet another part of my disguise. </p><p>“Holy shit, that’s a familiar voice. Marcus, is that you?” said the voice on the other side, the hostility instantly converted into an amused shock. </p><p>“Sharp as always, chief. How are you? Still trying to teach a bunch of green detectives how to wipe their own asses?” </p><p>“I wish I could say otherwise, but that’s, unfortunately, the case. Even worse, the recruits are getting dumber every year? Does every smart boy have to go to crime instead of trying to prevent it.” </p><p>“Well, crime pays better,” I countered in amusement. “Still, look from the bright side, there are worse options. They might choose to be an investment banker, or if they were feeling particularly heartless, lawyer.” </p><p>“That’s true, there are worse things than organized crime,” said the other side from the phone. I smiled. It was the reason I liked the police chief, even when he was leading the organized crime, doing his best to destroy us. He was an old shark, alert and dangerous, but he had a sense of humor. Also, I was lucky that I had recognized the danger he presented, and chose to occasionally tip him about the operations of my rival -both in other organizations, and in my own organization-, and in turn, he wasn’t as rigorous while chasing me. All around, it had been a nice deal. </p><p>“It feels good to catch up, but I’m sure you have a reason to call, especially after the stunt you have pulled,” the old chief said. “By the way, I’m still angry about it, after you have pulled that shit, the mafia turned into an irritated wasp nest, creating chaos wherever they went.” </p><p>“Sorry about it, but you know how it is. I saw a chance, so I took a shot. The rest was just bad luck. But the reason I have called because I have seen some of my old buddies,” I said before giving a small breakdown of the event, though I made sure to tell the story like I was a passerby, not wanting to be identified. I didn’t expect the chief to suddenly change his operating mode and target me, but it was better to be safe than sorry. </p><p>“That’s a tough situation,” he murmured after I explained the whole situation. “Are you sure she won’t just accept protective custody.” </p><p>“Not likely. I have done a bit of digging, and her family started to have some dealing with my old buddies. At that point, I doubt if she even gives a statement without a soulless lawyer wetting her every word.” </p><p>“That’s too bad. I wouldn’t have minded having an excuse to go after the big boys, and trying to kidnap a rich white girl is exactly the case that would allow me to push things into upper echelons.” I understood his disappointment very well. For all its supposed duty, the police was a highly-political organization beholden to whims of old men who liked power and benefits a lot more than they cared about public good, but a case attractive enough to catch the public imagination would allow things to </p><p>“Why don’t you send an undercover agent to gather some information while also doubling as protection.” </p><p>“That wouldn’t work,” answered the chief. “Without the victim's cooperation, my detective can’t stay close enough to be effective, nor can gather information effectively.” </p><p>A smirk appeared on my face. “What if I told you that I have a way so that she can stay close to the target.” </p><p>“How are you-” he started before suddenly coming to a stop. “You know what, I don’t want to know. The less I know, the more distant I would be when it finally explodes,” he said with cheerful resignation. “And I don’t suppose you’re willing to do it for free, for the safety of the city?” </p><p>I snorted. “That’s a nice dream, but I want two things. First, I want a favor, which I’ll cash on a later date.” </p><p>“That works,” said the old chief without hesitation. After all, it wasn’t the first time we had such a deal. “What’s your second request.” </p><p>“I have a certain detective in mind for the assignment.” </p><p>This time, a surprised laugh came from the other side. “Damn, boy. I didn’t know you were suicidal. After your last encounter, are you sure you want her any closer than fifty miles.” </p><p>“What’s life without a bit of danger,” I answered even as the moments that led to that spectacular explosion popped into my mind, a smile appearing on my face. “Just arrange her to join the college as an exchange student, and give this number by saying it’s the number of her handler. I’ll handle the rest.” </p><p>A chuckle was my answer. “It’s your funeral,” he said, and we continued talking several minutes more, focusing on the details of the assignment, and its possible implications. Still, a smirk was on my face as I imagined her arrival. Things were about to get really excited here… </p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>The next few hours after dealing with Megan was rather annoying, especially when I went through my apartment to make sure nothing incriminating was lying around. It seemed prudent with the incoming presence of my rival. I wasn’t planning to have her as a guest in my apartment of course; I was aiming to stay under her radar despite the circumstances. But, safety was paramount under the circumstances, so I stayed focused. </p><p>My next destination was my office, with a similar thought in mind, but I stopped when I came across a happy encounter, namely, my new assistant Camilla, dressed in a long skirt and an equally-boring top, walking around in the gardens, alone and distracted. A smirk appeared on my face as I sneaked towards her, staying on her blind spot trivial after all the times I had stalked people, usually with much deadlier aims. </p><p>I moved even closer when she moved into a blind spot that lacked any cameras, which was also quite difficult to be seen from outside, I quickly closed the distance, still careful not to make any sound that would alert her. “Hello,” I whispered when I was just a step away from her, and she jumped in panic, a cry ready on her lips, only to be prevented by a searing kiss. I kept my eyes open, enjoying the sheer panic on her panic slowly melt away as she managed to recognize her assaulter, but mattered little against her out-of-control heartbeat. </p><p>Soon, it clicked to her that we were in a public place, lacking my understanding about the lack of observers. “What are you doing!” she whispered in panic as she tried to push me away. “What if someone sees us!” </p><p>“Then they see us,” I answered dismissively as I closed the distance once more. She took a step back in panic, only for her back to press against the wall. I followed immediately, locking her in place while pushing my foot between her legs, more to caress her inner thighs than to prevent her escape, as she was too docile to react like that in the first place. </p><p>“But…” she started, but her words were easy to cut when I leaned forward, my lips leaving a passionate yet gentle kiss over her neck, turning into a gasp when I softly nibbled her skin. She said nothing as I slid my hands under her skirt, slowly dragging them upwards, revealing more of her creamy-chocolate legs with each passing moment to any passerby that we might have, her heartbeat going out of control further. Her silence lasted until my fingers found the edge of her underwear — another boring piece, I surmised from the feeling on my fingertips. </p><p>“That’s too much!” she exclaimed in panic while I pulled her panties down, but a stiff glare was enough to silence her. And since my head was already raised, it was convenient to close in with another searing kiss that cut her breathing while her panties ended up around her ankles, and one of my hands started to traverse the same path under her skirt once more, this time, target location bereft of protection. </p><p>Her gasp when my fingers touched her nether lips was beautiful, but not as much as her wetness, proving that despite all the claims of fear, she was enjoying the sensations fully. With that in mind, my fingers slid inside her tunnel, and started pumping mercilessly without a warning, triggering a chain of helpless moans that was muffled by my lips. </p><p>Distracted by more important things, she didn’t react when I pulled her top up, nor I opened her bra -again plain boring- to throw it on the nearest trashcan. That managed to bring her out of her daze, and she looked at me with emotion what I might call anger on a kitten, cute rather than intimidating, especially when mixed with arousal. “I’ll discard any piece of underwear that I find boring, so either acquired better ones, or start walking around commando, your choice,” I explained, not stopping the merciless pumping of my fingers even for a moment. </p><p>“But…” she murmured with a sudden bashful expression before cutting her words halfway. </p><p>“Continue!” I ordered, curious about what she managed to feel ashamed under the circumstances. </p><p>“I…” she murmured while I slowed down my assault, but kept my fingers buried deep inside her. “I can’t afford,” she murmured after a moment.</p><p>“Not a problem, we’ll go shopping together,” I said, and she looked at me once more, her expression sterner than I had ever seen on her face, signaling that I finally managed to hit a critical spot. It was either a concern of accepting charity, or thinking it was a payment for sexual favors, but since both conversations would be unnecessarily boring, I cut it off. “Think it off as the stipend for your assistant role, because you’ll still be responsible for reading all the papers,” I explained her, which was enough to take the edge off her expression, the remainder melted under a renewed assault of my fingers, some buried in her while others mauled her rather spectacular breasts. </p><p>And with the risk of crisis resolved, I was free to push for more. “We’re going to go shopping tomorrow,” I ordered her while I grabbed her wrist, and brought her hand to my zipper, expecting her to do to rest. She didn’t disappoint, her fingers found the zipper, pulling it down with a great hurry before freed my shaft from the uncomfortable grasp of my boxers. </p><p>Her reward, obvious…</p><p>I pulled my fingers out her tunnel, their presence immediately replaced by my shaft, pushed deep without mercy, enough to force a cry of her, this time, without my lips to muffle. “You need to be careful, my silly assistant. What would have happened if someone heard that? Imagine the scandal, prim and proper scholarship student caught in the garden with a teacher.” </p><p>“No!” she gasped in mortification as I reminded her something she had ignored in the heat of the moment, that we were still in a relatively accessible public space, and all it would have taken was a bored student walking around to ruin everything. “We need to stop,” she begged. </p><p>“Not before I finish,” I countered, definitely not willing to cut things short just when they were about to get interesting. “So, if you want to reduce risk, start moving your hips more, and keep your voice down.” She nodded and tried to raise her hands, but that would have been too easy, so I grabbed her wrists and pinned her arms to the side instead. “No cheating, dear Camilla,” I reminded her with a smirk, awakening her panic once more. </p><p>The next few minutes passed in a mixture of amusement and pleasure. Amusement, because watching her struggle as she tried to keep silent, helplessly biting her lips, was amusing, while the pleasure I was feeling jumped up with the additional effort she started putting, her hips gyrating amateurishly, but with great fervor, compounded by the great view of her breasts, jumping up and down with each push in a way only a top-grade one could manage. </p><p>Soon, her gasps rose a point where she could contain, especially when a rather stiff orgasm hit her mercilessly. Since I was a merciful guy, I decided to help. I pulled out her, and let her arms go. Her legs, trembling with pleasure, wasn’t ready to carry her weight, so she slid down, which was perfect for my purposes. I grabbed the back of her head to prevent it from hitting the concrete while I slid the full length of my shaft through her thick lips, effectively silencing her. There wasn’t a lot of noise she could make while her throat was clogged with my shaft. </p><p>And since there was no risk of alerting others, I took my time enjoying the grip of her throat beat by beat, until I finally hit my limit, and pulled out at the last second, only to cover her amazing breasts and beautiful face with my seed. Her dash to the shower, acutely aware of the film that covered her body despite her attempts to wipe them down was too tempting to ignore. </p><p>“Good work,” I said with a smirk as I sat next to her, our bodies touching. “Now, let’s talk about tonight’s activities with Megan. I have an amazing idea for her punishment.” </p><p>The possibility of teaching her rich girlfriend/bully was enough to awaken her from her daze. She turned to me even as she tried to reach for a napkin, but stopped once when I gestured her to leave them in place. I wanted her to stay marked while we discussed the next stage of my plan, another small thing to destroy her shyness. With a smile, I continued explaining in great detail, because likely it was going to be the only session they would have before my dear rival arrived and complicated everything with her presence…</p>",

    "content": "<p>It didn’t take long for me to find Marianne, as only one of the storage rooms had an unlocked door. An amateur mistake, if a servant had passed around, they would’ve locked her inside. She could have blasted herself out magically, but I didn’t think that she would appreciate the resulting paperwork. </p><p>When I walked inside, I used a simple spell to lock the door behind me, as I didn’t want any interruption. In the room, Marianne was waiting for me on a chair, but jumped up to her feet the moment I had walked inside. I could see the nervousness on her face, but no fear, making it unlikely that she had been planning an ambush. </p><p>“You’re the one that invited me here,” I said, but kept my voice soft, to avoid making the situation too confrontational. </p><p>Her blush intensified under my expectant gaze, but it didn’t prevent her from speaking out. “I wanted to talk to you about something you promised to do,” she said, managing to keep her voice even, but I could see just how much effort it took for her to maintain it. </p><p>“A promise?” I said, despite fully knowing what she had been talking about. She whispered something, too low to be heard even with my enhanced senses. “Sorry,” I murmured. “Can you repeat it in a voice that I can hear.” </p><p>“You mentioned that you might be willing to give me a massage,” she whispered, but this time, it was a whisper loud enough for me to hear, even with her voice dwindling alongside the sentence. </p><p>“Yeah, I remember mentioning something like that,” I said, doing my best to suppress a hungry smirk, but only with partial success. I had been expecting her to eventually fold to her own desires, especially since I had blocked the option of Cornelia, but I hadn’t been expecting it to be so soon. Apparently, the treatment she had received during my undercover-maid career had spoiled her worse than I had been expecting. </p><p>She waited for me to continue, but I was contending in stopping there, and waiting for her to continue. It took several seconds for her to realize I was finished, and an equal amount of time to gather her courage for the next words. “May I take you up in that order,” she managed to say, this time managing to keep her voice about a whisper, but barely. </p><p>Stringing her along was a tempting idea, but in her fragility, it was equally likely that it would backfire, sending her with a retreat. It wasn’t a risk I was willing to take, simply because she wasn’t the only one that was feeling horny. I temporarily lost my access to Helga after discarding my ranger personality, and my attempts to woo Aviada had been delayed thanks to her ex-fiancee —though luckily, not anymore. Willing access to Marianne was not something I could gamble. “Sure,” I said with a shrug before turning the impact of my charisma to the max, my speech skill helping me to time the delivery perfectly. “I could never disappoint such a lovely lady.” </p><p>“T-thanks,” she stammered, a sudden blush invading her face. I suspected that the beginnings of a crush rooted in her, the help of the mystery that surrounded me helping it significantly as well. If there was one thing I learned from my encounters until now -confirmed by wisdom- women loved the aura of a mysterious stranger. </p><p>“Would you prefer to use the storage, or would you like me to sneak into your room,” I said, only after letting it leave my mouth that I noticed the rather dangerous slip I had made.</p><p>“You can sneak into my room!” she said in alarm, making me curse myself for the momentary slip. Apparently, even my wisdom stat wasn’t the panacea for the foot-in-the-mouth disease. </p><p>“Well, I have a couple of paramours that I had occasionally met in their rooms, so, as long as you lower the wards and leave the door unlocked, it’s not that hard of a challenge,” I said in a casual tone. There were three reasons I came up with that excuse. The first, it further devalued the secret of my status in her mind. The second, it normalized our situation while simultaneously suggesting that anything between us would stay secret as well. Third, people liked to know they weren’t alone in breaking the rules. </p><p>The fourth, it implied that I wasn’t good at magic, not enough to break a standard alarm spell without triggering it, without me explicitly committing to that fact, so if needed, allowing me to break it without being busted. Assumptions could be as dangerous as a sword if wielded correctly. </p><p>I could see the curiosity flashing on her face the moment I had mentioned my other supposed paramours, which then turned red as she imagined the implied scenes… “Here is fine,” she murmured hurriedly. </p><p>“Sure,” I said, then noticed a cot that was lying on the floor. “I see that you’re already prepared.” She nodded softly. “Why don’t you lay down and we can start.” I let my smirk widen. “Unless you want to remove your robe, of course.”</p><p>“No, with robe is fine,” she said rapidly as she threw herself on the makeshift massage table she had prepared on the floor. </p><p>I was amazed at the speed she was folding. Apparently, she was weaker to the withdrawal of pleasure even worse than my wildest expectations. As I closed in, my attention was grabbed by the subtle shiver of her skin, signaling her anticipation, mixed with trepidation. After all, to her knowledge, it was the first time a man was touching her skin in such an intimate manner. </p><p>I started by her neck, applying the full range of my massage skills to the fore from the start, trying to show her the difference between the so-called apprentice and the master. Thankfully, I had never applied my full range of capabilities while I was under the guise of Selena, not to mention my capabilities increased quite a bit due to my stat increase since our last encounter.  </p><p>And it showed. A subtle purr started before even the turn of the minute, though it was short-lived, terminated the moment she realized she was making it. She sent a fleeting glance towards me to check whether I had noticed it, only to find a smug smile. “Maybe it was a bad idea-” she started as she tried to rise, for the first time realizing the vulnerable situation she put herself in. </p><p>The interruption came in a fun way. I slid my hand down as she started to speak, pressing a sensitive spot, and a pleasure-filled gasp interrupted her words. “If you prefer,” I answered callously, even as my hand danced on her back, destroying the stiffness that had been accumulated. “But you’re rather stiff, are you sure you want to stop early.” </p><p>If she could have answered in the first few seconds, the answer had been likely to be positive, but with her mouth occupied by moaning, she failed to answer. And when she managed to control her voice, the situation had changed. With her heartbeat thumping under my finger, clear despite the layers of clothing on the way, I doubted that it would be effective. “Maybe a just another minute,” she murmured, sealing her fate even if she didn’t know it yet. </p><p>From my end, the next half an hour passed in a familiar routine, pleasuring her without touching any scandalous spots while carefully reading her reactions to keep her on the edge. It was another sign of her naivety that she failed to recognize that tactic until it was too late despite already experiencing it several times from his disguised persona. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>I smiled at the notification. Not because of its value, as it was rather paltry for such a long effort, but it lacked the penalty indicator, suggesting she was still at a higher level than me, which meant that I still had a convenient target to level up. Especially important, because I was yet to discover how the penalties were going to scale up with the level difference. </p><p>“Raise your arms,” I ordered her in a soft but even tone, one that expected casual obedience, like a teacher asking a student to show her answer. Under normal conditions, even with my speech and charisma, it wouldn’t have worked, but the situation was far from normal. She raised her arms, and I pulled her robe off her, its buttons I had untied beforehand without her noticing. </p><p>It took surprisingly long for her to realize that she had lost a layer of clothing, leaving her shirt and skirt with the task of protecting her body. Both were relatively conservative, but regardless, the lost layer meant that even the simplest of my touch had a renewed intensity. It was certainly amusing that when she turned her head in a way that she considered subtle, trying to come up with a way to argue against me removing her robe, but a mocking glare was enough to deter her, reminding her just how much it took to realize it. </p><p>It was another mistake, of course, but at this point, it was inevitable. She had been struggling under my touch, making things awkward in a way that would ensure a difference of opinion, without causing a total crisis. </p><p>Still, there was a lot I could integrate without giving her a reason to raise that difference of opinion. I focused along her spine, occasionally dipping as low as the small of her back before rising up, every retreat earning a disappointed sigh that she no doubt thought as unheard. </p><p>She was finally ready for more. </p><p>At first, I limited myself to intensifying the movement of my fingers, pushing her even closer to the edge, so that an accidental touch would be enough to put her on the other side. I could see her legs starting to rub against each other, which, unfortunately, would be enough to push her over the edge, so I placed my knee between her thighs. </p><p>“Mercy,” she murmured as she sent a pitiful expression to my way, but it met with an infertile field. Why would I let her escape my trap after spending all that time </p><p>“You want your release?” I asked, this time, abandoning my clinical tone for a dark amusement. Earlier, that tone would have sent her away packing, but now, it only made her shiver helplessly. She nodded. “Answer using words,” I countered, my smile widening. </p><p>“Yes,” she murmured. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I grabbed her shirt with both hands, and with a rather loud noise, ripped it off, the enchanted fabric unable to resist my improved strength. She shouted in a panic, but her attempts to stand up prevented by my hands, rubbing her now-naked shoulders. “Calm down, sweetie, the shirt blocks most of the pleasure, so I got rid of it. Of course, if you want to experience the weak version…” </p><p>“No, that’s fine,” she answered after a moment’s indecision. Her flare of disobedience dissipated, leaving me free to rub her naked skin, to mentally prepare her for the next step. </p><p>While on that step, I couldn’t help but think about Cornelia’s failure to instill obedience on Marianne, which was a poor showing of skill on Cornelia’s part. All she needed was to drag her around a bit, dangling the prospect of the pleasure in front of her, and Marianne would have folded like a house of cards. But instead, Cornelia prioritized her immediate pleasure with her usual impatience, forcing her to look alternatives where she could dominate with her power. And if all went according to the plan, that approach would be the reason Cornelia ended up in front of me, bent and weakened. </p><p> I turned my attention back to Marianne, who was rumbling and mewling under the throes of pleasure, her rationality dwindling with each passing second, replaced with mindless arousal. It was the time to enhance the situation with a touch of magic, I decided in a sudden moment of inspiration. With my advanced biomancy, it was easy to put a temporary spell that would prevent her from climaxing no matter how much pleasure she felt. And applied slowly, she didn’t have a chance of noticing the spell in her distracted state. </p><p>[+2 Biomancy]</p><p>[-30 Mana]</p><p>And with the specter of accidentally making her climax gone, I decided to cut loose, my hands dancing over shoulders without restraining before started a journey south, destroying the hooks of her corset one by one, each ruining her coverage a bit more. But she missed that development, preoccupied with the unbroken rise of pleasure that nevertheless failed to break the dam that held it together, failing to turn into an unquenchable flood. </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>I moved onto her thighs, leaving her corset parted open, which partially revealed her spectacular breasts, tempting me to attend them, but I had a more precious target in mind. After I arrived at her thighs, I suddenly reversed the direction, but with a caveat. My hand was under her skirt, pushing it up, revealing her milky thighs bit by bit while also caressing the softness of her inner thighs. </p><p>Her moans increased further, to a point when she didn’t reach when her skirt received the same treatment with her shirt, abandoned to the side, its task left to her panties, which was rather insufficient in hiding her deliciously-curvy bottom. </p><p>Her thoughts finally managed to push through her haze when I sank my fingers mercilessly to her bottom, abandoning any pretense of giving a massage, mauling her flesh for my own pleasure. She tried to rise, using her trembling hands to support herself as her torso separated from the makeshift-mattress. “That’s too much,” she managed to say, miraculously, without being interrupted by a moan, though that determination only lasted a moment, and one escaped her mouth, functioning as the punctuation for her sentence. Unfortunately, it was a question mark where an exclamation mark was needed. </p><p>I elected not to answer, instead of letting my eyes dance over her torso pointedly. It took a moment for her to realize her corset hadn’t risen with her, leaving her breasts naked for my perusal. A yelp escaped her mouth as she pulled one of her arms from the floor, trying to wrap around her chest to hide her breasts from the view. It had limited success, as her breasts were too magnificent to be hidden behind her fragile forearm. </p><p>“Sexy,” I said as I leaned forward, my knees still on both sides of her hips, and closed in towards her. Panic danced behind her eyes, but otherwise, she was frozen in panic, the thick layer of pleasure that filled her mind preventing her from taking an action. </p><p>I grabbed her hair, just rough enough to create another layer for the pleasure she was drowning in, and leaned to her lips to a torturous slowness, and pressed my lips against hers, which stayed firmly shut. </p><p>At first, that was. </p><p>She lacked the strength and, more importantly, the willpower to resist the assault of my tongue into her mouth, which invaded the target without opposition. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Pushy Persuasion. Use an aggressive approach to seduce a nice-mannered beauty. +500 Experience, +2 Strength]</p><p>Her arm trembled in shock, which forced her to use the other for support as well, leaving her breasts naked. The room was chilly, so in my usual merciful state, I decided to help her, my free hand sinking into her breasts. She tried to moan, but it dissipated between the assault of my tongue and the tight grasp of my lips. </p><p>My pants were getting uncomfortably tight, but still, removing them would be too extreme for the moment. But luckily, it wasn’t the only solution. I lowered my body until my hardness was stuck between her rather generous booty, receiving a delicious massage as I moved back and forth, and the pleasure compounded when her hips started to move in the same rhythm with mine. </p><p>She deserved a reward. My hand, which was previously occupied with her breasts, started to travel down, and reaching her panties. I kept it over rather than sliding inside, but the difference wasn’t big, as the fabric, drenched in her juices, was well-past the point of being able to perform as a barrier, however feeble. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>Under the multidimensional assault she was suffering, it didn’t take long for her surrender to be complete. Her lips joined the heated dance as a participant rather than a helpless observer that suddenly found herself on the scene. I stopped grabbing her hair, preferring to enjoy the expanse of her breasts, but it didn’t earn a negative comment, just more moans.</p><p>But kissing and caressing her wasn’t the only thing I had done, no matter how enjoyable it had been. I was simultaneously using my magic to prepare her backdoor for the eventual assault, cleaning and lubricating at the same time, another spell she failed to notice in her distracted state. Biomancy had so many amusing little applications. </p><p>Meanwhile, the treatment she received continued to intensify, my fingers dancing around her clit, increasing the build-up of pleasure further and further, her moans getting desperate enough to escape the confines I painstakingly built. </p><p>[+3 Biomancy]</p><p>[-15 Mana]</p><p>[+750 Experience]</p><p>Then, without a warning, I grabbed the edge of her panties, destroying them with a rough pull. She was still not completely naked, but considering that it was limited to her shoes and a necklace that dangled between her breasts, I would admit that it wasn’t a big issue…  </p><p>It was the time to move onto the second act, I decided as I pushed her on the floor. </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 10    Experience: 50475 / 55000 </p><p>Strength: 13    Charisma: 15</p><p>Precision: 11    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 15</p><p>Speed: 9       Intelligence: 12</p><p>Endurance: 10      Wisdom: 18</p><p>HP: 550 / 550    Mana: 630 / 710             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (50/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [50/50]        </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [44/50]        </p><p>Advanced Melee 29/50</p><p>Basic Speech 25/25        ]</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

After passing the border, finding their tracks took another minute, delaying me further. I walked as fast as I could while following the tracks of four men in the middle of the night, afraid that I was too late. </p><p>Luckily, I managed to arrive on time. I could see the men closing towards Aviada, their weapons weren’t drawn yet, but the same thing wasn’t true for Aviada. Even from the distance, I could see that she was ready to burst into action, but she held herself back. Even with her sword, one against four wasn’t the best odds to take. </p><p>I moved closer, not only to be able to listen to them, but also to be near her in case things devolved into violence suddenly. But I was careful, because one of them had established a ward to keep the monsters aways, which unfortunately also worked against people. I needed to create a backdoor before sneaking into the perimeter. “Marcus,” I heard Aviada saying. “What do I owe the presence of your ugly mug at this hour. Were you looking to have quality time with your friends? I heard that couples occasionally use the forest for that purpose.” </p><p>The men were facing the other way, but one of them stiffened at Aviada’s words, giving me a good idea which one was Marcus. Unfortunately, I still didn’t know who the fuck was Marcus, or what he was trying to do. “I came to protect you,” Marcus said, an obvious lie Aviada didn’t bother to weigh, her sword still at its half-raised position, ready to burst into action in any second. </p><p>“Yes, that’s obvious,” Aviada said. “Four brave, strapping men, led by a former fiancee I humiliated by canceling the wedding after publicly beating him, following me in a dark forest… I never felt safer in my life.” I had to admit, I was impressed with Aviada, even against the obvious mortal danger, there was no stopping her.  </p><p>“Bitch,” the one that I identified as Marcus shouted, preparing to charge, and from the way Aviada smiled, she was counting on that. Unfortunately, one of the others, the only one without a visible armor, grabbed his arm and whispered something, keeping him back. “The only reason you won was because of the unfair advantage given by your sword.” </p><p>“Is this what you tell yourself when you cry yourself to sleep every night while trying to forget your humiliation,” Aviada said, but this time, Marcus was expecting a taunt, and let it go with a shrug. Meanwhile, I managed to create a temporary gate on the protective field of the ward, slipping into the perimeter without alerting the mage. </p><p>“You wish,” said Marcus. “I have no problems teaching you your place, permanently I mind you, but I’m feeling merciful. Relinquish your sword, and I’ll forget the damage on my reputation due to your cheating.” </p><p>I heard one of his hangers snort in amusement, clearly not buying the impression Marcus was trying to sell, but that didn’t make him move. I didn’t know who Marcus was, but considering the number of guards he managed to suborn, it was likely quite rich. </p><p>“Any time,” Aviada said, lifting sword even higher, its edge catching the glint of the moonlight. Combined with Aviada’s tall stature, and the ease she could handle her impressive sword, it was an impressive sight. Too impressive, because Marcus took a step back even as the others moved forward.  </p><p>“Not when you still have that cheating sword,” Marcus said. “I want a fair fight.” His sneer made it obvious that the meaning he assigned to fair greatly differed from the common usage. “You’re going to use this one instead,” he added, throwing a steel sword towards her. It was a terrible sword, rusty with several chinks around its horribly maintained edge. It was more effective as a blunt weapon than as a bladed one. </p><p>“Are you sure?” asked the grunt in the middle, who had dressed as a mage. “What about the shadow wolf-” he tried to continue, but Marcus cut him off with an angry statement. </p><p>“Cut it out. How many times I have to tell you that it was your imagination. There is no way she would be alive if a shadow wolf actually passed the breach, and even by a miracle she managed to kill it, she would have more than a couple of wounds as a result.” </p><p>I nodded, glad to discover the people behind that particular mishap. Meanwhile, Aviada was carefully examining the additional muscle he brought with him, trying to decide whether to take her chances against four of them rather than languishing her sword, but in the end, she sank her sword to the ground, and picked the one Marcus had discarded instead. </p><p>“I’m going to teach you a lesson, bitch! You’ll pay for humiliating me,” Marcus murmured as he raised his own sword, an enchanted masterwork, though obviously inferior to Aviada’s ancestral sword. With that, he charged forward, and their swords connected with a loud noise.  </p><p>The others spread out a bit, their hands on their weapons, ready to interject if things went bad. Aviada must be aware of it as well, because she was stronger and faster than her current display. She was trying not to give others an excuse to pull back. Marcus was a skilled warrior, but not on Aviada’s level. </p><p>But their formation had a very important advantage. They were spread around, leaving their mage, the only one that could notice my spellcasting, alone. </p><p>I took a breath before dashing forward, molding mana to create the quickest illusion I had to construct in my life. The mage noticed the surge of mana, but the veil of illusion hid him from the view, and his cry muffled by the silencing spell that followed. Both were simple spells that he could dispel in a second, but a second he didn’t have. My dagger was in hand when the distance between us dwindled into nothing, and the dagger sank into his throat, while my fingers pressed against his mouth, preventing him from shouting. </p><p>[+3 Melee]</p><p>His fingers clamped around my wrist, trying to push me away, but even with the adrenaline, his strength was nothing. It didn’t take long for him to start moving, and I dropped him on the ground, another illusion allowing me to steal his guise. I modified the veil of illusion to hide the still-bleeding body on my feet, and continued to watch the battle. </p><p>Aviada was still fighting defensively, and she didn’t have a scratch on her, but the same couldn’t be said for Marcus, who had two bleeding gashes, one on his arm, the other on his cheek. I started to gather mana, to be used in a surprise assault, while Aviada abandoned her defensive stance for a ferocious assault. Marcus’ sword flew away, but he managed to avoid the assault. Aviada rolled to get her enchanted sword. </p><p>“What are you waiting for, you numbskulls!” Marcus shouted in anger. “Kill the bitch!” </p><p>It was the sign I was waiting for. I turned all the mana I had gathered into a mana blast, and threw towards the nearest target. It wasn’t a spell that was preferred despite its strength, because it was slow to cast and easy to avoid, not to mention it didn’t work well with magical resistance of the monsters. </p><p>But it was an excellent spell to get rid of a surprised human opponent, my target grunt realized a second before his head disintegrated into a pile of ash. I stopped maintaining the illusion over me, and Marcus’ eyes grew when he noticed two of his grunts were already fallen. </p><p>A mistake, because Aviada used the opportunity to get rid of the other grunt, leaving Marcus with two-to-one odds, with him at a disadvantage. A bad matchup for a guy that needed three helpers just to feel confident enough to fight against Aviada. “Please,” he whined, his earlier confidence nowhere to be seen. “We can-” he tried to continue, but Aviada cut his words with a slash of her sword, separating his head from his body. </p><p>[Achievement: Speedy Saviour. Arrive at the last minute to save the life of a paramour. +500 Experience, +2 Speed]</p><p>“That was interesting,” Aviada said as she looked at me, still breathing hard. </p><p>“I’ll say,” I said. I thought about calling her on the unscheduled midnight trip, but after a moment, I decided to let it go. She didn’t have a personality that could take criticism, and for better or worse, the issue had been resolved. There was no need to create an argument that would break the mood when I was receiving a grateful look for saving her life. A more suspicious person would have explored the possibility of my involvement considering my lucky appearance, but luckily, Aviada had a more direct personality, which made the situation more fun. </p><p>“So, what now,” she asked. </p><p>“We need to put things in a way that would look like a fight between them,” I said, pointing at the four bodies lying in the different levels of dismemberment. Without saying anything else, I used my arcana abilities and levitated all four of them, shuffling them around it created a convincing crime scene, and another spell to remove the signs of our presence, including the footprints. I even changed the shapes of their wounds to make it more convincing. It wasn’t enough to trick a good ranger, but I was willing to bet that the guard that allowed them to pass would do his best to stick to the most obvious explanation, not willing to reveal his own involvement. </p><p>[-85 Mana] </p><p>[+2 Biomancy]</p><p>After that, we left the forest, keeping silent, partially to reduce the chance of getting caught, partially to give Aviada the time to process the situation. I was tempted to ask her to spend some time together, but unfortunately, that was not a possibility, not when there was a risk of escalation. Things were complicated enough without being caught out in a state of undress. </p><p>“By the way, why are you dressed like a servant,” Aviada asked, not bothering to whisper since we were alone in the corridor. Another careless mistake, as just because she couldn’t see anyone didn’t mean that there was no one around. </p><p>I sent a pulse to make sure we were alone before answering. “Nobody really notices a servant,” I explained, but chose not to elaborate further until we arrived at the crossroads. “As much as I would like to spend some time with you, tonight is not the best for that. I’ll see you in a few days, okay.” </p><p>She nodded, and before she could say anything else, I turned and left, annoyed by the necessity of letting the damsel go after saving her from distress. Still, I had a better place in her mind. And hopefully, she would remember her gratitude in our next encounter. </p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>The next couple of days passed in a blur. Once again, I walked around the school, dressed as a maid, trying to get the latest information, but it turned out to be a challenge. The death of four students, two of them heirs to their houses, had managed to create quite a bit of stir. Thankfully, from what I could gather, the guard did the smart thing and used the story I had kindly prepared for him, which kept Aviada’s name out of the proceedings. All the gossip was about a duel gone wrong. </p><p>With that closed, I decided to went back to the library, but not before I sat in my room, penning a rather long letter, using careful penmanship that wouldn’t go remiss in a love letter, except for the complicated diagrams underlying the magical calculations. In the letter, I had detailed a rather complicated issue I was having on creating arcana bolts that would be effective against high-resistance monsters without wasting too much mana. I still remembered the danger I had run against the shadow wolf. I would have likely died if I had missed my attack. </p><p>But the technical challenge I was facing wasn’t the only reason for the detailed breakdown of my own experimentations, as I had no doubt that Helga would require only a day or two at most to discover most of the things I discovered. No, I wrote a detailed explanation simply because, it was complicated enough to show my credentials, which would impress her more. At the end of the letter, there were several instructions for her to take for our meeting as well.</p><p>I felt a strange mixture of stress and excitement as I joined the usual morning meeting of the library staff, listening to the head librarian to distribute the tasks for the day. A wrong move here would have ruined everything I had worked for, but I couldn’t help but watch her in appreciation since I had discovered the femininity that laid under her carefully-crafted serious facade. Too bad that I lacked the ability to make a move on her. </p><p>Maybe soon. </p><p>With that done, I once again moved to the back of the library, where I was once again tasked to gather the books that lay forgotten on the desks. One of the benefits of being known as an idiot, I was able to finish the tasks that were expected of me in a few minutes, and started walking around, searching for my targets. </p><p>Helga, I was able to find first. I used the same trick, examining the books she was studying to deploy the letter I had written for her. She looked around when she received it, but unlike the last time, it was a look resigned to failure, not expecting to see anyone around. </p><p>But the way her face brightened by every word on the letter was a sight to see. She was barely able to hold back shivers of excitement as she finished the letter, and dashed away to find the books she was looking for. The fact that she enjoyed the task I had given her was a positive development, meaning I would have more space to push in other areas before making her crack. </p><p>That task complete, I moved onto my next one, namely, finding Marianne, which, unfortunately, took quite a bit longer than my first self-appointed task. It was well past noon when I finally saw Marianne in the library, walking towards the less-occupied parts with a clear determination. Feeling curious, I walked towards the main corridor, close enough to alert her to my presence, but she continued to walk despite her intensifying blush, her gaze occasionally lingering over me.  </p><p>She clearly wanted me to follow her, which meant I pointedly ignored her presence and continued my job, until a cough had disrupted my concentration. I turned towards the noise, only to see Marianne standing there. “Yes, sweetie,” I said as I turned a not-so-gentle smile towards her, carrying the full brunt of my rather impressive charisma score. </p><p>“May I talk to you for a moment, M-” she started, only to come to a sudden stop. She didn’t know my real name, and she was smart enough to realize that referring to my unflattering nickname wasn’t the best way to start a discussion. “Please,” she added instead, trying to recover ground after her near-disaster. </p><p>“Sure, go ahead,” I said confidently, because I knew there was no one else nearby, thanks to the low-powered proximity wards I had set up around us. Thanks to my growing strength, hiding my situation was not the number one priority anymore, because I had to option to claim that I had been hunting alone during the night, as I was finally strong enough to survive such an ordeal. But the fact that I could survive the impact hadn’t meant that I was willing to announce my situation to the whole school just yet, hence the wards. </p><p>“Maybe in somewhere less crowded,” she whispered nervously as her eyes darted around. “Meet me around the storage rooms, the ones that are after the kitchen.” At that moment, I was glad for my observational capabilities, because, without it, I would be too afraid of a trap to follow her. But she was like an open book, and I could read everything through blue depths of her eyes. </p><p>“Whatever you wish for, my queen,” I said, tackling an exaggerated bow to the end, which wasn’t a cure for the shyness she had been displaying. She managed to give a trembling nod before dashing away, leaving me free to return my task; even if it was for just a few minutes before I disappeared after her.</p><p>I wondered what awaited me at my destination… </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 10    Experience: 47225 / 55000 </p><p>Strength: 11    Charisma: 15</p><p>Precision: 11    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 15</p><p>Speed: 9       Intelligence: 12</p><p>Endurance: 10      Wisdom: 18</p><p>HP: 530 / 530    Mana: 650 / 710             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (50/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [50/50]        </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [39/50]        </p><p>Advanced Melee 29/50</p><p>Basic Speech 25/25        ]</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>After seeing Marianne sending that message, I made sure to stay around close enough to notice when she was leaving, but far enough to avoid being noticed, not wanting to discourage her from visiting her good friend Cornelia. It was good that I did, because only a minute later she stood up and moved for the door at a speed that could almost be described as dashing, proving the effectiveness of my massage tricks. </p><p>I followed her of course, only stopping a moment to disguise myself as a non-descriptive servant on the way, my mind on the ways of breaking them quickly. A servant accidentally coming across them was an option, but not a good one, considering Cornelia’s response when I stumbled on them. That night, the only thing that saved me was their belief in my inability to speak about it. So, it wasn’t my preferred way of interdiction. </p><p>That track of thought turned out to be useless when Marianne took a direction towards the outside, rather than the storage rooms like I was expecting to. Instead, she took a path that would directly lead to the training forests. </p><p>The same place that was out of commission due to elemental hyena incident. </p><p>I continued to follow her from a distance, but this time, not because I was needed to break the ploy, but to watch her reaction when she was being turned away. </p><p>Soon, she arrived at the forest, only to find several guards around the perimeter, some already having arguments with the entitled students that weren’t very familiar with the concept of rejection. Marianne was no different in that aspect, of course, but her non-confrontational attitude prevented her from making a spectacular mess. </p><p>Frustrated, she turned back, only to meet with Cornelia at the halfway. Another heated discussion started, mostly in whispers which I was too far away to hear, but their body language was easy to read. Cornelia, always as fiery as her hair color, wasn’t happy about being denied, and Marianne was doing her best to calm her down, but succeeding, she was not. </p><p>Feeling adventurous, I decided to use their distraction to slip a spell on Marianne, one that would increase her arousal markedly, but hopefully not to a point that would make her check for external influences, which would make a great experience. After all, the situation she was in was already arousing.   </p><p>[+1 Biomancy]</p><p>[-15 Mana]</p><p>Marianne wasn’t able to prevent Cornelia to walk towards the guards. It was a loud, annoying, and ultimately, fruitless argument, and in the end, Cornelia was so annoyed that she even tried to grab Marianne to drag her along. Marianne pulled back, with enough presence of mind to realize the questions that would arise if she was seen like that. </p><p>She followed Cornelia, but her earlier enthusiasm was absent, clearly would prefer to write-off the night instead of staying alone with Cornelia. Not surprising, considering Cornelia’s explosive anger and her sadistic tendencies. </p><p>I decided to do the gentlemanly thing and help Marianne. I stopped following them, instead, changed my disguise from a servant to a maid. My destination: Cornelia’s rooms. </p><p>The idea was simple. With her obvious internal political battle and the existence of secrets she was eager to hide, it was the best way to remove her out of the equation, not just for the day, but for a foreseeable future, making her too afraid to wander away, afraid of losing her secrets. </p><p>The presence of maids was so common that sneaking into her room didn’t take any effort. The first ward at the entrance was stronger and the more intricate than the last time, but considering the monumental increase in my arcana skills, it didn’t take a moment to pass it. The second ward that blocked the entrance for her private room suffered the same fate. </p><p>In her angry state, I had a feeling that Cornelia would settle for a sub-par location to hide, therefore risking not only her presence but also Marianne’s in the school. Everyone knew things like that happened behind the closed doors, but exposed publicly allowed everyone to target the victims sanctimoniously. </p><p>I didn’t want to lose Marianne, not when I managed to train her perfectly. </p><p>Still, being in her room without the obligation to erase my track was a huge benefit, so I went through her library, stealing several precious books and scrolls that belonged to her family, focusing on the topics that Helga was interested in. One benefit of spending years in the library, I had the ability to instantly appraise the value of any written item. I didn’t bother with money or other valuables. There were easier ways to acquire them. </p><p>After that, I molded a generous amount of mana, some as a shield, some to form a kind of magical lockpick. The latter, I didn’t bother to form carefully. The wards on Cornelia’s box was still too strong, and even if they weren’t, my aim was to make her cautious enough to force her to stay in her room, not to send her to a crusade across the school, searching for her treasured secrets. </p><p>In a manner of speaking, I showed the lockpick into the intricate web of wards that protected Cornelia’s most important secrets, then dashed away even as a flare of alarm rose, a magical push that alerted Cornelia that her secrets might not be a secret anymore. </p><p>[Achievement: False Flag. Engineer a heist to block a rival from having fun. +500 Experience, +1 Manipulation, +1 Precision]</p><p>A strong rush of flame rose towards me, but my shield was already in place, diverting it long enough for me to get out. I dashed away, ignoring the panicked shouts of the maids, slipping to the first side corridor that wouldn’t have anyone around, changing into a servant. </p><p>I changed my disguise four times until I could walk into my room, slipping the sack with the books underneath my bed. From outside, I could hear the commission going on. I needed to be careful with the disguises for a foreseeable future, I noted. But it was a worthy sacrifice. Not only I pushed Cornelia out of the equation for a while, but I also had the perfect bait for Helga. </p><p>Considering the indignity she suffered from Cornelia’s hands just to get a peek to those secrets, I had a feeling that a fun reward awaited me… </p><p>But I didn’t have much time to spend imagining that, as I needed to go back to the library. Unlike the past, Marianne knew a part of my secret, and there was a chance that she would get suspicious if I wasn’t around when she returned. Yet another change of clothes later, I went back to the library, to do the same mind-numbingly boring tasks. </p><p>Unlike my expectations, Marianne didn’t return to the library. But it was okay, because she wasn’t the only blonde with something going on. Helga was in the library, in her usual position, in a forgotten but defensible corner of the library, with several thick tomes open in front of her. </p><p>I could see a hint of depression on her face, which was understandable due to the ‘disappearance’ of her ranger friend, unaware that he was closer than she might think. A pity that revealing the truth wasn’t an option. </p><p>But that didn’t mean that I couldn’t distract her in a different manner. A little mystery would go a long way to give her something other to do than pining after an imaginary person. First, I passed near her with my cart, close enough to see which books she was reading. With my intelligence and my knowledge about her ultimate research objectives, it wasn’t really difficult to guess which book she might want to pick next. </p><p>I prepared three identical notes, all with a subtle spell that would trigger a few seconds after touching, and slipped them inside the three books she was most likely to pick next. A neat trick to impress and unbalance her at the same time. It was a simple note. </p><p>‘Helga,</p><p>If you’re interested in having a better deal than what you currently have with Cornelia to support your research, come to the storage room six fifteen minutes after midnight. </p><p>This is a one-time offer that will disappear if you reject, or mention it to anyone else.</p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>A mysterious helper.’</p><p>With the notes discreetly slid inside the books, I pulled away to maintain the distance, waiting for her to take the bait. Her fast-reading shortened wait quite a bit. Several minutes later, she stood up, and picked one of the books I predicted. Her reaction when the note slipped out of the box was comical. I had to struggle to keep myself from laughing, which would have revealed my hiding spot between the shelves. </p><p>The sudden flash of energy that devoured the note hadn’t exactly made her any calmer about the situation. She looked around, trying to see someone around, but I was hidden well enough to avoid detection. She looked around for a few times, trying to find the culprit. Failing that, she walked away, her dilemma visible on her face. </p><p>I watched her walk away, curious what she would choose tonight… </p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>For the encounter with Helga, I picked a different set of clothes, predominantly black and gray, with a high collar that functioned as a mask when I lowered my head, its ability to hide my identity enhanced further with a hood. It wasn’t the best way of walking around without being noticed, but my aim was to sell the story of concealment rather than actually hiding myself. </p><p>I arrived at the target location almost an hour before, subtly setting up several wards to dissuade any servant from walking in. I kept the wards as straightforward as possible. Helga would be quite alert, so, trying to slip an inventive ward that would affect her mood was an unnecessary risk. </p><p>Not that I needed it. Not only I knew one of her deepest secrets, but also the thing that forced her to that was in my possession. The deck was sufficiently stacked to my side, making further magical assistance a bonus I could dismiss. So, after making sure that we were going to stay alone in the storage room, I pulled back into the shadows, waiting for her arrival. While waiting, I practiced a bit to find the perfect voice I should use. </p><p>The door opened right on time, but before anyone entered the room, a subtle wave of magic spread through the entrance. A simple identification spell, trying -and failing- to be subtle. “No magic,” I called even as I reached and disrupted the spell, with more power than necessary to highlight the fact that I could afford to do so. After all, not only I had a higher level than her -knowledge courtesy of the system- but also I had a very high and balanced mental score, making my mana abnormally large for someone at my level. </p><p>[-30 Mana]</p><p>No answer came. If it wasn’t for the wards, informing me that there was only one interloper, I might have beat a hasty retreat. Moreover, I was sufficiently familiar with her methodical but slow spellcasting enough to make sure that I had the correct visitor. Not that she had the option to convince someone else to assist her. She had enough trouble meeting with people that wouldn’t stab her in an opportune moment. </p><p>Despite everything, there was a silent pride on her shoulders as she walked into the middle of the room, the robe tightly wrapped around her. “Who are you, and what do you want?” she asked with a mostly-stable voice, trying and failing to hide the inflictions underneath it. </p><p>“My identity is unimportant for the moment,” I said with a throaty voice, one that suggested darkness, but also a mystery. “And on what I want, you have that backward. I have something you want.” With that, I kicked the scroll I had prepared for her, based on the same excerpts from the books I had stolen from Cornelia earlier the day. </p><p>She didn’t immediately reach for it, which was a plus, showing her caution. Moreover, she hadn't immediately used magic, showing her obedience by following my earlier directive. “You can test the scroll,” I allowed, not wanting to escalate the situation unnecessarily before I could establish a more reasonable basis than being a formless voice in the dark. </p><p>She was careful as she slowly prodded the scroll with arcana energies, methodically exploring to see if there was any trap, but ultimately, she spent far less time than she could, correctly deducing that if I wanted to harm her such a direct manner, I would have used something much more direct. Her eyes grew in shock as she slowly unfurled the scroll, taking an account of the content inside. “How…” she murmured. </p><p>“I have my ways,” I answered, even as I stepped out of the shadows. I could see her stance stiffening, but it was the only outward expression she had given. </p><p>“I’m assuming it’s not for free,” she said in resignation, which was a lesson she knew well. Nothing was for free in these halls. I nodded. “What’s the price for it?” </p><p>“I want you,” I answered even as I let a crooked smile spread to my face, bringing the full impact of my charisma to the surface. But even that wasn’t enough for a bitter expression to spread to her face, mixed with resignation. She reached towards the top button of her robe. </p><p>“Not like that,” I cut her off, sharply, acting like that misunderstanding was her mistake. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she murmured, caught flat-footed by the sudden change. </p><p>“I want your loyalty,” I said. She looked at me uncomprehendingly. “I’m watching you for a while. Despite the absolute lack of support, you have done a lot to survive, not hesitating to make the difficult calls when it’s necessary.” I waited for a bit. “But it’s not enough, is it?” </p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured, not willing to admit. </p><p>“How many levels you have gained since you joined the Silver Tower,” I asked. </p><p>“What it is to you?” she lashed out, feeling angry at the mention of her level, which was understandable. I didn’t know her exact skills, but it was obvious they were more focused on the research rather than combat, the only reason she was able to get a scholarship in the first place. However, it also meant that it was almost impossible for her to grind alone. And she was a pariah, meaning no one supported her in the school. </p><p>“Just a curiosity, but you don’t have to answer. It’s not hard to guess that you hadn’t gained a level since you joined the Silver Tower. How long it has been? Almost two years, right?” </p><p>She flinched at the reminder. “It’s not that important,” she defended herself. “I can always maximize my level after I returned to my family.” </p><p>“Yes, but then you won’t have access to the best library in the world,” I said. The second best according to one of my achievements, but that wasn’t a point that needed to be raised, not without being able to explain how I know. “Would you be okay to waste everything you have worked for, that making every humiliation that you endured to go to waste.” </p><p>“And what,” she spat angrily as she gathered her arms around her chest. “Are you going to make all better?” </p><p>“I can help you level up, and in return, I want not only full access to your research, but also your assistance on the tasks of my choosing.” </p><p>I could feel pride and happiness emanating her when I mentioned her research. With everyone else treating her efforts as a waste, she clearly enjoyed the recognition I gave to them, making them a part of such an important bargain. “How can I be sure that you’re going to deliver what you promise,” she said, trying to make it sound like she was still against it, but I knew her tells enough to read her acceptance. </p><p>“Well, then, what about a preliminary deal. I push you over level ten in three months, or you can call the deal off?” </p><p>She caught herself nodding halfway in. “Maybe I’m already higher than that,” she tried to say, but her frustration made her lie obvious. I didn’t even bother to answer, just sent a glance towards her, which made her blush. “Do you think you can help me gain three levels,” she countered, this time underplaying her level by one. A good attempt, too bad for her that I had been cheating. </p><p>“As long as you follow my words, that’s quite doable,” I said. After all, all I needed was to mortally wound a few hundred class five to eight creatures. I could easily forge a new permission slip when the forest was reopened into training sessions to a more dangerous area, and help her level up. </p><p>“When?” she said. </p><p>“Likely in a few days. The forests are currently closed due to a breach incident,” I said, giving a brief explanation of the rumors behind the sudden change, making sure to keep my voice to calm but impactful. But even as I gave the explanation, I could see her relax. My charisma and speech skill was really giving their worth, making her mellower by each passing moment. </p><p>[Achievement: Patient Poacher. Take the first step of converting a target into a long-term loyal follower by sacrificing short-term fun. +500 Experience +1 Charisma, +1 Wisdom]</p><p>“I think we can call it a night, since we agreed,” I said, giving three more scrolls towards her, but this time, using my arcana abilities to make them float. “Take them as an advance,” I said, then started to walk towards the door, satisfied with the meaningful stride in my mission to convert my first long-term ally. </p><p>“When are we going to talk next,” she said just as I was about to disappear at the doorway. </p><p>“I’ll find you,” I said before slipping away, once again using the first opportunity to disguise myself into a servant. A minute later, Helga passed me, not even making a note of my presence, proving the effectiveness of my subterfuge skill once more. </p><p>It was late, but I decided to take a brief walk outside before going to my room. Being in the same room with Helga brought some memories to the surface that should best be left untouched for an easy sleep, and the cold wind would work efficiently. </p><p>And it was a good thing I did, because I noticed a familiar raven-haired figure walking towards the training forest, her sword strapped on her back. I didn’t bother to call her, assuming the guards would prevent her from entering. But that turned out to be a strategic mistake, because the perimeter guard acted like he hadn’t seen anything, but sent a small signal after she passed. </p><p>“Damn it,” I murmured as I started looking around, trying to identify a spot I could slip between the guards. And seeing four figures, all heavily armed, using the same entrance to slip into the forest made that need even more immediate. </p><p>I needed to hurry up! </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 10    Experience: 46725 / 55000 </p><p>Strength: 11    Charisma: 15</p><p>Precision: 11    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 15</p><p>Speed: 7       Intelligence: 12</p><p>Endurance: 10      Wisdom: 18</p><p>HP: 510 / 510    Mana: 650 / 710             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (50/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [50/50]        </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [37/50]        </p><p>Advanced Melee 26/50</p><p>Basic Speech 25/25        ]</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Things were about to get heated, but not in a way I might have preferred, I thought as I shielded myself and Aviada from a burst of fire, courtesy of the pack of elemental hyenas surrounding us. </p><p>[-20 Mana] </p><p>Taken alone, elemental hyenas weren’t exactly a challenge for my level. Compared to other class six creatures, they neither had the strength or the endurance to justify their rather high experience gain. As their name indicated, they had the ability to use elemental magic, but not in a level that would be truly staggering, even for someone around level five or six unless they had really terrible stats. </p><p>The problem was their unique ability to link their casting power to create much stronger effects. So, larger the pack, more devastating their attacks became. The only thing that kept them from becoming a threat against the towns and cities was the fact that only very rarely a pack had more than a dozen members.</p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t one of those rare times, as I doubted that I would have been able to resist a fireball from a full pack, especially with the relative combat-weakness of arcana magic. Seven hyenas weren’t trivial by any stretch of the word, but it wasn’t too hard to handle as well for a level ten tag team, especially when one of them was equipped with a spectacular enchanted sword, while the other had an average stat score over ten. </p><p>And the earlier arcana bolt I had sent worked in my benefit as well, distracting three of the hyenas enough to prevent them from joining the spell, hence the ease I could block their assault. But I could sense they are gathering their magical power for another spell. </p><p>While they were doing that, I leveraged the proximity ward in place to get an instant sense of their formation. The three I had assaulted with the arcana bolt had pulled back towards the leader of the pack, which was easy to detect because the gathering mana was centering on it. Luckily for us, their pulling back had left their formation unbalanced, with two of them far enough from the rest. </p><p>“Attack left, I’ll distract the others,” I ordered Aviada, as sharp and commanding as I could manage. We had the advantage, and I wanted to keep it. She said nothing as she charged forward, while I sent a wave of concussive force towards the main pack of the hyenas, forcing most of them to jump away. </p><p>[-50 Mana]</p><p>Their spell fizzled. Without the contribution from the rest, the leader’s assault only managed to create a weak bolt of fire, which I pushed away negligently. Under normal circumstances, my strategy would be a horrible one for a level ten mage, wasting a huge chunk of mana for a temporary benefit. But I had two advantages that changed the situation. First was my mana poll, which was significantly higher than any other level ten thanks to my high stats. </p><p>The second was Aviada, who already managed to slay two hyenas caught flatfooted by her assault. I watched her from the corner of my eyes, my attention split between the supernatural grace she displayed while destroying those monsters, and the way her sexy body coiled in the process. </p><p>[+75 Experience] 25% Penalty!</p><p>The leader of the hyenas noticed the threat our approach represented as well, and responded with a bolt of lightning. Aviada charged the larger pack, ignoring the threat it posed, trusting me to handle it. I had no problems creating another shield, dispersing it. </p><p>[-25 Mana]</p><p>The rest of the battle collapsed rather easily. Hyenas, even the elemental variety was rather cowardly, and seeing half of them dying without inflicting the slightest damage was enough to destroy their resolve. They tried to rush away, but I chose to cast another spell, binding them in place. Another wasteful spell, as it only held them in place for a moment, but it was enough for Aviada to finish them all but one. </p><p>[-50 Mana]</p><p>The last one, realizing the danger Aviada was posing, decided to attack the seemingly weaker target, and dashed for me with great speed. Not fast enough that I couldn’t nail it with an arcana bolt, but I was aware the disdain Aviada had for magic, or more acutely, mages that did nothing but staying behind while raining spells, so I used telekinesis to grab my discarded sword instead. With my strength and its momentum, the last hyena hadn’t had a chance of survival, cleaved into two with a calculated swing. Unnecessarily brutal, but I had a feeling Aviada would appreciate it.  </p><p>[+1 Melee] </p><p>“That was fun,” Aviada murmured as she pressed the tip of her bloodied sword on the ground, noting the cleaved presence of the last hyena. She stood like that for a moment, giving me the full view of her breasts, the view enhanced further by her breathing, then she brought her arm over her chest, a smirk on her face. </p><p>“Watching you dispatch them was a true pleasure,” I said, letting my eyes dip down her chest pointedly. I had a good enough handle on her personality to know that trying to hide my gaze would earn no respect from her. And letting her take the experience of seven moderately-high class creatures without a word didn’t hurt either. </p><p>She said nothing, but her seductive smile was answer enough. She walked towards her clothes, dispatched on the ground, and passed them to me. “Could you fix them for me,” she said. I did so without complaint, considering I was the one responsible for it. Of course, if I had the choice, I would have preferred her to stay like that, but it was the second assault, and it added some urgency to our situation. </p><p>While I fixed it, she once again stabbed her sword to the ground and turned her back to me. But, rather than asking the bindings back, she raised her arms. As a gentleman, I had to help her, of course, so I started to wrap the bindings around her chest once more. If my hands touched the soft skin of her breasts, it was completely accidental! </p><p>[+150 Experience] 25% Penalty! </p><p>She turned back to me, and after the slight delay while she put her shirt back on, we were ready to talk. I could see that she had a serious expression on her face. “It confirms that yesterday’s assault was not an accident,” she said.</p><p>“Yes,” I answered, but my tone wasn’t as somber as her, which made her look confused. “It’s not as bad as I feared,” I continued. “It proves that whoever was involved, they don’t have the ability to pick the exact creature they let in. The likeliest possibility is that they weakened the wards on the outer walls, and bribed a few guards to look the other way.” </p><p>“How do you know that?” she asked. </p><p>“Would you have sent a pack of hyenas to fulfill a task where a shadow wolf failed to achieve?” I asked, and she just nodded. “I think the best thing to do for me to disappear, while you find a teacher or guard captain you trust, and tell them that you met with some extra-strong creatures in the training forest. That would force them to update the wards, which would make a repeat of the situation impossible.” </p><p>“And the conspiracy?” </p><p>“It’s best if we don’t mention it,” I explained. “We still don’t have any evidence, and it’s for the best if you don’t make an enemy of the guards. Them looking away is bad, but we don’t want them to get directly involved in the conspiracy as well.” </p><p>It was a testament of the trust I had managed to generate in such a short amount of time that she just nodded in acceptance. Clearly, she had a distaste towards more concealed forms of doing business, and was more than happy to leave me on control. For a few minutes, I carefully went over all the things she needed to mention and avoid, handling the conspiracy far too important to prioritize flirting at that point.</p><p>“So,” she murmured, sounding no less disappointed than I was. “That’s it for tonight, I presume,” she said. </p><p>“Unfortunately,” I answered. “And it’s best if we don’t meet here tomorrow, as there is no doubt that there will be a lot of guards around tomorrow.” She looked downcast, but I was quick to console. “But don’t worry, I’ll make sure that you’ll get a note about our next meeting. Until then, goodbye,” I added. </p><p>I leaned close, and put a gentle kiss on her cheek. The unexpected closeness made her blush. “See you around, milady,” I said before walking away, feeling her gaze over me as I disappeared amongst the shadowy foliage. </p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>The next day, I was wandering around aimlessly in the library, trying to penetrate the mystery around the mysterious assaults against my newest possible paramour, but I managed to hit a barrier. </p><p>I had been hoping that the servant from the last night who worked as the lookout would give me a clue on the identity of the instigators. Unfortunately, when I went in the morning, I learned that he had been found murdered at the spot of the breach, and the official statement claimed that he was a hidden mage that was responsible for opening the breach, who died when the first wave of creature had passed. </p><p>I didn’t believe a word of it, of course. It was clear that the instigators and the guards in their employ -either bribed or a part of the scheme- covered the situation by sacrificing him. It was a masterful stroke, I decided, successfully shifting the blame while plugging a potential information leak. Too bad that it made my investigation significantly harder. </p><p>Luckily, I saw a familiar face entering the library, promising to alleviate the mindless drudgery I had been experiencing. I saw Marianne browsing between the shelves, moving deeper as her face was scrunched with focus as she looked for a particular topic. And to make it even more fun, she was in the deeper parts of the library, not exactly as obscure as the location of her adventures with Cornelia, but hidden enough for a little chat. </p><p>I sneaked close until I was sufficiently close. “May I help you?” I asked, making no attempt to hide my voice. </p><p>She flinched as she rapidly turned, the way she stumbled suggesting that agility was not one of the stats she managed to increase. “You!” she said with a sharp tone, but luckily, she had enough presence of mind not to shout. </p><p>“Long time no see,” I said with a cheerful manner even as I let the full impact of my charisma to the surface. “Is there anything I can do to help, like assisting you to find the book you’re looking for.” </p><p>“Not likely,” she said but when I looked at with an amusing questioning. </p><p>“Really,” I said. “Honey, I’m sorting those shelves for the last several years. Don’t you think there is a slight possibility that I might know where to find a few obscure books?” </p><p>“Maybe you do,” she murmured, avoiding my gaze. I listened to her calmly as she rattled the names of several books in rapid succession. </p><p>“I’ll be back in a minute, wait for me here,” I said, and jumped back to the library. The books she asked for were quite obscure, but luckily, she was looking at them at the correct section, so it didn’t take long for me to assemble them. When I walked in front of the same shelf a few minutes more, I had several books in my hands, and she was sitting a chair, looking uncomfortable. I was glad to see she hadn’t used the opportunity to get away. Misguided pride was always useful. “Everything you asked for, honey,” I said as I placed the books in front of her. </p><p>I could see that she wasn’t entirely happy about her pet name, but also, she wasn’t in a position to antagonize me over it. She chose silence as she opened the first book, and started browsing, a not-so-subtle message, tying to indicate her busyness, likely hoping that I would just go away. </p><p>I had no intention of letting the opportunity slip away. Instead, I turned back, making a show of reorganizing the shelves. My back was turned, but it wasn’t hard to conjure a small mirror in an obscure place, angled correctly, allowing me to watch her while keeping her obvious. </p><p>The way her eyes darted between me and the small corridor between the shelves that led towards the more crowded areas of the library, assessing the merits of staying versus beating a hasty retreat. Her desire lay on the latter, but her pride didn’t allow her to take the former. Though the role of her underdeveloped sense of danger couldn’t be overstated, not knowing even in a relatively open location, things I could do. </p><p>But first, I needed a way to ensure my ploy wouldn’t be destroyed by someone dropping by. It took all of my concentration to establish a weak proximity ward, barely more than a tripwire. I could have established something stronger, but it might have alerted Marianne. Or even worse, the head librarian might have noticed it despite the distance between us. Discovering the existence of her hidden femininity didn’t mean that she suddenly became any less threatening.</p><p>With that complete, I turned away from the shelves, and towards Marianne, who was looking the books in front of her with a deep concentration, so obviously fake that I would have known she had been watching me regardless. I didn’t call her on that, as her ploy forced her to stay silent as I walked towards her. </p><p>The fact that she didn’t flinch when I put my hands on her shoulder was yet another evidence of her awareness. She tried to stand up, but with the strength difference between us so great, I was able to prevent that instantly. She could have used the magic of course, which I couldn’t have prevented without escalating into a battle, but it seemed that she was equally reluctant to take that step as well. </p><p>“What are you doing,” she asked even as I started to squeeze her shoulders in a complex pattern. </p><p>“Giving you a massage,” I said in such a natural, matter-of-fact tone that it surprised her into inactivity. “Without Selena, you’re looking really tense, so I decided to help you a bit.” It wasn’t even a lie. She was much tenser than the last time, likely the combined effect of a sudden lack of massages, her inability to get some quality time with Cornelia, all compounded by my knowledge of her secrets. </p><p>I leveraged the full effect of my increased stats and everything I had learned during the sessions I was disguised as Selena to the maximum effect. Subjected to that, I wasn’t surprised when the first thing that left her mouth was a helpless whimper. “That’s enough,” she said, but that would have been more effective if it wasn’t interrupted by a moan when I destroyed a particularly tense knot on her shoulders. </p><p>“Are you sure,” I asked even as I continued the systemic destruction of the knots on her back, each earning another moan. </p><p>She stayed silent for a moment as she mulled on the answer. Well, not exactly silent, as occasional gasps and moans still escaped her lips. More accurately, no answer left her mouth while she considered her answer, each passing second swaying her decision a bit more. “A bit more wouldn’t hurt,” she whispered in a defeat, one easy to digest if her quickening gasps was any indicator. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>After her explicit approval, I decided to move onto the next stage. I gently pushed her forward, my hands wandering along her spine, a journey ending on the small of her back. I was tempted to dip deeper, treating myself for another dose of her spectacular bottom, but I kept myself back. No need to push her too much in our first encounter -from her perspective. </p><p>But being restricted to her back and shoulders didn’t mean that I was helpless. As her tenseness slowly decreased, the nature of my touches changed from clinical to sensual, something that she elected not to comment, too distracted by her pleasure. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>The speed of her change was over my expectations, making me consider the relative merits of pushing for more, but a warning from my proximity ward invalidated that option without reaching the decision. Luckily, our uninvited visitor wasn’t walking towards us, meaning, I was able to take my tame pulling back, waiting until she was just at the edge of another loud moan before pulling back. </p><p>“Much better, right?” I said with a proud look on my face. </p><p>She opened her mouth, but stopped just as the first word was forming on her lips. I was willing to bet my ability to gain experience that she was about to order me to continue before realizing the position such a request would put her under. Instead, she nodded wordlessly, and turned back to the book that was still open in front of her. </p><p>My attention was already on the shelves when another student walked into the same part we were in, and I walked away, distant enough to hide from Marianne while still keeping tabs on her. I watched as she sent a message through magic, an expensive spell, which cost quite a bit of mana even in short distances, therefore used only in emergencies. They were almost impossible to track. Luckily, I had a good idea about the identity of the recipient. </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 10    Experience: 45725 / 55000 </p><p>Strength: 11    Charisma: 14</p><p>Precision: 10    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 14</p><p>Speed: 7       Intelligence: 12</p><p>Endurance: 10      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 500 / 500    Mana: 670 / 680             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (50/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [50/50]        </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [37/50]        </p><p>Advanced Melee 26/50</p><p>Basic Speech 25/25        ]</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn’t too far behind Aviada in entering the forest, but while she decided to stand as a part of the house, I had sneaked around the perimeter, sneaking through the ward rather easily. It wasn’t a weak ward, but the fact that it was mostly geared to contain monsters made my work much easier. </p><p>After a pause where I removed my servant disguise and changed into my hooded cloak, I dashed towards the opening where we promised to meet, killing occasional dire rabbits and foxes with a swing of my sword. Melee fighting might not be as effective as magic in killing strong monsters, but it was much more efficient when targeting the weaker ones. Also, it allowed me to maximize my melee skill. </p><p>[+2 Melee]</p><p>Thanks to my quick pace, I stepped into the opening soon after Aviada, but as I stepped in, I couldn’t help but do a double-take. The subtle, but extremely effective change in her attire had caught me surprised. She was still wearing the cloak she had been when she left her room, but it was unclasped, revealing what she had been wearing underneath. </p><p>As the last night, she chose to wear a simple shirt rather than armor, but the shirt didn’t have the same cut. It was tighter, still easy to move in but enough to add a hint of sexiness, something that was further enhanced by the small dip in the chest area. It wasn’t a particularly deep cleavage, but with her chest size, it hadn’t had to be to look sexy. And the fact that she was carrying her bloodied sword with an obvious mastery just enhanced the impression. </p><p>“How are you this fine evening, my noble savior,” I said, going with a classical noble opening, but with just enough derision to indicate it was a joke. </p><p>“Rather well, mysterious warrior,” she said, the subtle pressure on the word of mysterious hinting that, unlike last night, she expected some explanation. </p><p>I gave a mock bow, which made her chuckle. Then, when I started walking towards her, suddenly, I felt several triggers in my proximity ward, in the familiar presence of rabbits. The same motion I pulled my sword, I killed the closest one. Another swing killed one more. </p><p>The reason for the sudden assault would have been obvious even if I couldn’t feel the presence of the lure spell. But more interesting, now that I was near her, I could feel that it wasn’t her that cast it, but the sword, making it even more precious than my initial assumption. </p><p>A glance at her showed that she was busy watching me even as she killed her share of monsters. What she was expecting to see was obvious, so I decided to give it rather than pointlessly extending the situation. With a wave of my hand, I created ten different arcana bolts, each flying towards the target without missing, and killing them. An impressive-looking spell that required great magical expertise. Unfortunately, it didn’t do much damage, even struggling with class one creatures with stronger damage. On the plus side, it was cheap.   </p><p>[-5 Mana]</p><p>“Impressive,” she said even as I stopped feeling the effects of the lure spell. “It’s rare to see a mage that decides to learn the way of the sword, and even rarer to find one that could wield it half-decent, which makes you a curiosity,” she continued as she closed in. </p><p>I might have taken insult to her arrogant way of talking, but the hint of interest underneath her tone went a long way to soothe my pride. “I aim to please,” I said with another exaggerated bow, but she continued watching me without a hint of humor. “Let’s just say that for reasons too long to explain, I had to fake being an Abnormal since I was a child. A drawback to it that I lacked the resources to guide my development, and being a master of both blade and magic seemed too attractive. When I finally managed to arrange to come to Silver Tower, it was too late to turn back, so I leaned in my unique situation further.” </p><p>“Does it work,” she asked curiously. </p><p>“That’s a loaded question. The utility it gives is certainly useful, but it comes with a rather big trade-off in maximum power. But all around, it works well for my lonesome road.” </p><p>“I understand,” she said with a nod, which didn’t surprise me. After all, I had constructed the story based on the information I was able to gather this morning. The story was structured in a way that would get her sympathies, showing both self-sufficiency and courage while plagued by the kind of structural problems she experienced in her life. Even better, it true enough to sustain any examination she could bring to bear. </p><p>For a moment, the silence stretched, then she said. “It must be disappointing, unable to live up to your promise,” she said. “Even with such a specialization, you were able to kill a shadow wolf alone. I can’t imagine how strong you would have been otherwise.” </p><p>“I find it’s for to best not to focus too much on what might have happened if the dice of fate rolled differently. I am here, and I’m strong enough to defend myself and mine. The only annoyance is the role I had to take as a stupid library worker, but I’m used to it, at least. Also, I can’t say that I was able to kill a shadow wolf by myself. Your help was decisive.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” she said, waving the compliment away. “I have seen the state of it when I arrived. It was just a matter of time before you killed it. And more importantly, you managed to avoid its ambush in the darkness, alone, at a time that you have no reason to expect such a danger. I doubt that there is a handful of the students that would manage such a feat in the school. I don’t doubt that there are even some teachers that would have fallen to it.”</p><p>I just nodded in appreciation. What she said was correct, though it was more about the match-up between my skill set and the strength of the monster. I certainly wouldn’t expect to survive against a more well-rounded monster in that caliber - not yet at least. “But that still leaves the question about who was responsible for its presence.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked. </p><p>“It’s already unlikely for a shadow wolf to sneak through the wards around the school unless it was tempted by something.” She glanced towards her sword, but I cut her off. “No, the lure your sword has is not loud enough to be felt outside of the wards. But if I wasn’t closer, using magic, I have no doubt you would be its target,” I added, subtly reminding her that my presence saved her life, as some hidden appreciation wouldn’t hurt. </p><p>“But if it wasn’t my sword, what was it?” she asked.</p><p>“That’s the question,” I said. “But the fact that it managed to sneak in without raising any alarm while guards were absent is definitely suspicious. Until we can find better evidence, it’s better to assume that it was a conspiracy aiming one of us, and try to stick into the crowds as much as possible.” </p><p>“But that’s not possible,” she answered. “I have my reasons, but I can’t afford to slow down my leveling!” </p><p>I could feel the strength of her determination as she spoke. Luckily, I had no intention of actually dissuading her. “Well, if you’re determined in that, maybe we could work together. It would be safer.” I could see she was dissatisfied with it, so I quickly moved to placate her. “I have no problems with you getting the lion’s share of the rabbits and other critters. I don’t really need the experience from them,” I added, reinforcing her impression that I had a very high level, which made any possible benefit from the rabbits even less important.</p><p>“That might actually work,” she murmured, looking thoughtful. Then, a smirk spread onto her face, adding a teasing quality to her face. “Of course, I need to make sure you’re good enough to keep up,” she added. </p><p>Despite knowing just how ill-advised it was, I decided to answer her challenge by pulling out my sword. “To the first blood?” I asked. </p><p>“That works,” she answered, but even as the answer left her lips, her sword was cutting the air with great speed. Unfortunately for her, I could see her readying for that surprise strike before she could even move, and leaned back slightly, enough to make the sword miss me in a hair’s breadth. </p><p>That show of courage worked wonders in enhancing the hint of respect in her eyes. It was not without a reason. Only through the absolute confidence in my agility and perception, I was able to take that risk, because I had seen just how effective her sword had been on a class eleven monster. A mistake might cost me my life, but once again, I found such a risk was easy to take to impress such an unusual, yet impressive, specimen of femininity. </p><p>She attacked once more, but this time, I parried. She looked dissatisfied by the path I took, but that was replaced by surprise when I changed the trajectory of my sword at the last moment, and rather than meeting the edge, pushed away on the blunt side. Or more accurately, tried to push as I found out that she was a great deal stronger than me. It was around fifteen, if I were to guess. </p><p>If her smirk was any indicator, she was aware of the gulf between our strength, and had no complications to leverage that. Instead of letting her sword fly away, she kept them in contact, changing the angle to rub the edges together. I took a step back, but not before she took a huge chunk out of my sword. </p><p>Intending to spice up the fight a bit, I raised my hand, about to send a few arcane bolts to her, to see how she would react, but the sight of sudden disappointment stopped me. Clearly, she was hoping for a martial only fight. Since impressing her was much more important than winning, I used the mana I had molded for a repair spell, dragging my finger along the edge of my sword to fix the edge, and reinforcing it a bit for the good measure. Just like that, the smile was back on her face. </p><p>[-10 Mana]</p><p>“Handy,” she said cheekily before rushed towards me once more, this time much faster, showing that her strength wasn’t the only physical stat she had been focusing for. Her agility and speed weren’t anything to scoff either, though they were not at the level of her physical strength. </p><p>Once again I pulled back. I was afraid of meeting her strength and superior technique, supported by her more than decent agility. Her better reach made the situation even worse. My enhanced melee helped, but only a little. The only thing that allowed me to put a decent resistance was my mental abilities, particularly the manipulation, tricking her with a number of feints, preventing her from fully focusing on the assault. </p><p>But even then, the duel continued only because she wasn’t applying her maximum capacity. It was obvious that she was more than capable of taking the victory in a purely-physical contest. But at least, I was giving enough to make it fun for her. </p><p>A minute passed with attacks and ripostes. I could see the beginnings of boredom on her face as she got a hang of my fighting style, and I chose that moment to push her sword with a display of agility I kept hidden, and stepped inside her guard. She could have killed me easily in that position, but wounding me slightly was out of option. </p><p>My sword slashed for once before I pulled back. “Just a bit more,” I said, but while saying that, a flirting smile was on my face. The reason, the large gash I had left on her shirt, revealing a delicious view of her flat stomach. </p><p>[+20 Experience]</p><p>For a moment, her expression was blank as she gazed at me, making me afraid that I had pushed the situation too much. But even then, I kept my smile steadily, and bringing all the charm that could be sustained by fourteen charisma. Luckily, it was enough, and a blush spread on her face, followed by a flirting smile that somehow managed to look intimidating at the same time. She charged with a skill that she hadn’t displayed before, and soon, I had a matching cut on my shirt. </p><p>“Just a bit more,” she said, mirroring my phrase, and from there, the game was afoot. For the next few minutes, the duel continued with a renewed sense. It took a minute for my shirt to fell in tatters, leaving my upper body, and my brand-new muscles, in the display, but it wasn’t entirely one-sided. I had managed to leave chip away her shirt enough to leave the task of covering her breasts to her chest bindings, which was, from what I could see, quite tight. </p><p>[+180 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Ferocious Flirting. Flirt through a combat situation risky enough to cause death in a mistaken move. +500 Experience, +2 Strength]</p><p>A smirk boomed on my face as I felt a renewed power filled my muscles, and I started pushing her more aggressively. My strength was still far from hers, but fresh two points were enough to enhance my strategic options significantly, especially since she wasn’t expecting it. When I parried her next assault, I made sure to put enough strength behind my blow to make her sword veer out of my way, leaving me free to cut into </p><p>To her credit, she recovered quickly, but not fast enough to prevent me from leaving a vertical slash on her chest bindings. I wasn’t able to cut it completely, but it loosened enough for her glorious breasts to show their full potential, while also giving me a good view of her tanned breasts.  </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>Her surprise lasted only for a second before she assaulted with a renewed vigor, revealing that just how much she had been underplaying her ability. Her blade swung with a skill that she hadn’t displayed before, and my sword flew away from my hand without the slightest resistance. </p><p>She smirked as she brought the sword to my neck, creating a very small nick, but it hurt quite a bit despite its size, another indicator of the rather impressive value of her sword. Her chest puffed with the pride of her victory, which, under other circumstances, might have annoyed me quite a bit, but since my attention was more focused on the great view created by her move, I let the situation slide. She was aware of my gaze, and quite satisfied by it. </p><p>[-5 HP] </p><p>[+150 Experience]</p><p>“That wasn’t terrible,” I said with a challenging smirk. “But how about a more even fight, no weapons,” I added, which made her courage waver for a moment, but my speech skill wasn’t only useful for the situations I could talk. A quirk of my eyebrow gave the impression of an unintentional noting of her reluctance for a challenge that she wasn’t holding an overwhelming advantage. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when she pushed her sword into the ground with a renewed challenge on her face. “Let’s do it,” she murmured. I couldn’t help but smirk as I lunged forward, feinting an assault before pulling out at the last moment. She managed to react at the last second, but with significantly less skill than what she had for the sword fight, suggesting that she had picked a more specialized combat skill rather than picking melee. </p><p>Another assault later, took a hold of her arm, but only for a moment, because I didn’t want to give her an opportunity to grab me. I didn’t want to convert the situation where she could bear her full strength. But while I was pulling back, I kept a hold of her shirt, which, thanks to all the cuts over it, came off with a ripping sound, leaving her chest-bindings as her only protection. </p><p>Her arms rose to her chest in reflex, but a moment later, she let them fall, choosing to lunge towards me instead of trying to secure her modesty. The adrenaline was working even better than I could have hoped for, loosening any inhibition she might feel. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>With another level so close to attain, once again, I was tempted to push my luck. During the next attack, I managed to twist after grabbing her arm, and took a position behind her, forcing her arm behind as well. A yelp escaped her mouth, but it was cut short when I pushed my shaft onto her tight ass, stripping the pretense of the situation. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Basic Stealth, Advanced Melee, Advanced Speech] </p><p>I quickly selected melee before shifting my attention back to the situation. She was frozen, so I decided to introduce some movement to the situation, and started the dance of my hips. “Do you surrender?” I asked. </p><p>“Never,” came the answer, but she was unable to hide a rather obvious sense of desire from her tone. I could feel that a rather fun event was about to happen. </p><p>Naturally, the involvement of the conspirators chose that exact moment to come to the surface, in the form of a trickling in the proximity ward I had set up. “Duck,” I called her even as I raised my hand, glowing with a bright purple as a bunch of elemental hyenas burst into the opening, ready to attack.</p><p>I sent the bolt to them, disrupting their formation even as Aviada rolled for her sword. But despite the danger, I saw the opportunity to boost my experience. I ‘accidentally’ hooked my finger to her already-damaged chest bindings, and her momentum did the rest, leaving her half-naked, her breasts dangling under the effect of the sudden momentum change. </p><p>[+150 Experience] 25% Penalty due to level equality!</p><p>I couldn’t exactly say that I was happy learning her level, as, from the way she fought, I had been willing to bet that she was stronger, but she probably just had a higher-than-average stat distribution, supported by a bunch of over-specialized skills. At least, the angry glare she sent me was promisingly playful as she took a defensive position. </p><p>Watching the way the moonlight danced over her tanned skin was a promising idea, but unfortunately, I had more immediate concerns, such as, the pack of elemental hyenas that was ready to pounce.  </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 10    Experience: 45200 / 55000 </p><p>Strength: 11    Charisma: 14</p><p>Precision: 10    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 14</p><p>Speed: 7       Intelligence: 12</p><p>Endurance: 10      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 380 / 500    Mana: 550 / 680             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (50/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [50/50]        </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [35/50]        </p><p>Advanced Melee 25/50</p><p>Basic Speech 25/25        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I woke up with the first rays of the sun, which was insufficient as rest, as while I recovered the mana I spent during my rest, I had to spend almost all of it recovering several hit points. It was tempting to sleep a few more hours to recover some more, until my library shift started, but another information-gathering task awaited me. </p><p>[+4 Biomancy]</p><p>[-400 Mana]</p><p>[+113 HP]</p><p>Once again in my servant disguise, this time as a stable-helper, I slipped to the warrior section of the area, and worked there for a couple of hours. With my latest radical jump in strength, the work was rather easy even in my exhausted state, something I had appreciated a lot. </p><p>More importantly, I had managed to collect a bit information about my mystery helper. It turned out, it was easy to make idle servants gossip about a sexy woman over six feet tall and an aggressive demeanor. Unfortunately, due to traditional roles expecting a noble lady not to dirty her hands with such nonsense, exacerbated by the said aggressive demeanor, there was a fair bit of resentment towards her, which meant that there was a lot of inaccurate and plain vicious gossip about her, and even for me, separating them was a difficult task.</p><p>Some claimed that she killed all of her brothers, while others claimed she hunted the men stupid enough to get near her for sport, while simultaneously claiming that she was a whore that had routine intercourse in the monsters in the forest, and a lot of other ridiculous claims. The only consistent thing was she was a part of a small house with a glorious past, and she decided to take the path of the warrior after the untimely death of her brothers to raise her house reputation, rather than doing what was expected of her and find a decent match, while focusing on the magical arts. </p><p>The other undisputed fact was that her sword was a treasure onto itself. That, I had no trouble believing, because that monster of a sword had cut through a class eleven monster with just a cleave, with only a modest strength of six to support it. Yes, shadow wolves weren’t known for their defense, but only because of their scarier abilities. </p><p>So, when I stood on the line, listening as the head librarian stood ahead of us, my mind was still on the task of separating useful information from garbage, when I noticed a slight limp in her steps. It was a simple thing, barely noticeable even with my perception, but it was enough to pull my attention. </p><p>I started to watch her body language with my full attention, which was hard due to a rather thick robe she was wearing, but thanks to the wide variety of experience I had with loose-style female robes -both wearing them for disguise and peeling them off from sexy ladies- I was able to catch a limp on her steps, which she was trying to hide. </p><p>That made me look even deeper, which allowed me to catch the other signs of a wound she was trying to hide. Curious, because she had a reputation for a highly-accomplished mage. I didn’t know whether she had any healing abilities, but it shouldn’t be hard to find a decent healer, which would keep it secret for her even if she wanted to keep it hidden. Which meant that it was either something recent, something she couldn’t ask any help for, or something that couldn’t be cured by a regular healer. </p><p>Another mystery. It was a pity that this one, I couldn’t have risked trying to solve it. </p><p>But there had been an unexpected side effect of my careful examination. It forced me to register all of her qualities, such as the rather lovely structure of her face, disrupted only by the tight way she gathered her lovely chestnut hair in a tight bun, stretching her skin to an unpleasant sharpness. Her lips, forcibly thinned to hide the fact that they were thick enough to be pouty. Her beautiful brown eyes, hidden behind a pair of edgy, intimidating glasses. </p><p>And just like that, something clicked in me. I had been tricked by her demeanor and the mode of dress, registering her as an old lady past her prime, something her reputation as a war hero only reinforced. But now that I was examining her, I could see that she was a beautiful woman in her early thirties, using every little trick available to her to look stern rather than cute. </p><p>[Achievement: Crack in Character. A new patch created by noticing an interesting detail. +100 Experience, +1 Perception]</p><p>Of course, that didn’t change the fact that she was a very accomplished mage, with a level close to thirty based on the stories on her achievements, and with a personality pricklier than a dire porcupine, which made trying to reach her a dangerous proposition. Still, I had a feeling that it wouldn’t keep my back if the situation presented itself. </p><p>But that was something for the future. When she finished giving the tasks of the day, I once again slipped towards the less-visited parts of the library, busying myself with books of combat magic. The last night’s encounter proved to me that I was under-equipped in terms of combat spells, and desperately needed a variety over pure blasts and shields. </p><p>After finishing my work, I was expecting to return to my room for a quick rest. Some of my mana had been replenished thanks to my leisure working pace in the library, but I wanted to sleep until it was the time to meet with Aviada to top it as much as I could manage. I wanted to be prepared for another surprise like the wolf. </p><p>My surprises were yet to be over, however, when I noticed a familiar figure following me in a way that she thought as stealthily. Marianne, my favorite massage customer. She had a hood over her face, and a cloak around her body, but it was a terrible disguise. Her curly blonde hair peeked through, and there was no cloth in the world, enchanted or otherwise, that could hide her delicious curves. </p><p>I was tempted to change my path towards a more crowded part, just to watch her trying to dodge the suspicious gazes of the passerby, but I had a feeling that Marianne wouldn’t be able to weather too many of those glares before skunking away, and I was curious about what she wanted to talk about. </p><p>Instead, I took a turn towards a more deserted area that held the unused beddings and other types of inventory, giving her a chance to close in. I watched from the corner of my eyes as she closed in, but she lost her confidence in the last second. A ridiculous lack of courage, as thanks to experience modifier, I knew for a fact that she was stronger than level ten, but she still failed to close into an abnormal. Yes, she was a healer, but it didn’t justify it. </p><p>I had to get lost, walking even deeper into the unused parts of the tower, for her to gather enough courage to confront me. And even then, it took a few minutes for her to take the decision to dwindle the distance. “Stop,” she finally called as her steps quickened, and I turned towards her, the blank look of the Mule on my face. </p><p>In her hurry, her hood had fallen back, revealing her face, her pinkish color signaling the stress she was feeling. She took a deep breath, trying to gather her composure before starting to speak. “You’ll call your maid back to here!” she ordered. </p><p>“What?” I answered, adding a thick tone of surprise that suggested I failed to comprehend her question. </p><p>It was fun to watch her lose her wind against the unexpected wall of stupidity. She stilled for a second, restarting her thought process, and repeated, this time, much slower. “Your maid, Selena. Write home, and call her back.” </p><p>“Why?” I said, but this time, I didn’t bother to sound like the Mule. I have dipped my head down, letting the shadows of the corner to hide my expression, and while she was distracted by the question, dispelled most of the subtle disguise that was hiding the effects of my charisma increase. </p><p>“Because I order you to do,” she answered, like it was obvious. </p><p>“Really,” I said while raising my head once more, but this time, there was no illusion that hid my expression. She flinched, stunned by the sudden change of the situation. “So, I have to bother writing back to home and angering my stepmother, just because you’re feeling horny,” I added, the smirk on my face widening with every single word that departed my lips. </p><p>“W-what,” she stammered, missing the irony of mirroring my earlier phrase. </p><p>“Come on, Marianne,” I said, taking a step towards her. Trying to process the new situation she found herself in, she struggled to process my words, but she took a step back nevertheless. “Isn’t Cornelia enough to fulfill your needs that you needed to bother my poor maid.” </p><p>It would be a lie if I said that I didn’t enjoy the expression of shock that spread onto her face when I mentioned her secret paramour. Her face turned chalk-white as she realized that her most important secret was known by someone that was much-less Mule-like than she had assumed. </p><p>Her shock soon turned into panic, and her hand jumped up, a ball of fire crackling in her palm, reminding me my closest brush with the death, even closer than the fight against the shadow wolf. But this time, I wasn’t a weakling barely strong enough to hurt a fly. My hand moved in a flash and pushed her wrist up, sending her attack haywire. “Rude,” I murmured. </p><p>Her reaction was rather immediate. I felt a sudden shift of mana, indicating that she was preparing for a huge attack. I could have shielded myself, but that would reveal my magical aptitude as well, something I wanted to keep hidden as much as possible. Instead, I pulled my dagger, and pressed under her chin, sharp enough to remind its presence without actually drawing blood. “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” </p><p>Just like that, the pressure from her assault dispersed, and I pulled the knife away. She was trembling badly, but I wasn’t feeling charitable after her attempt to erase me from the face of the planet. She leaned against the wall, and took a few deep breaths, trying to calm herself. From her reaction, I could see that she was even more removed from the danger than I had assumed, even when considering her specialization as a healer. </p><p>“Are you well enough to talk, or should I try to find a seat for myself while waiting for you?” I said, not so charitably warning her. </p><p>“But… You… Mule… How is it possible,” she murmured, with long breaks between the sentences, trying to process the fact that the idiotic but harmless worker she had seen around had such a dangerous secret in reality. </p><p>“For reasons that would take too long to explain, I had to arrange being sent here to avoid assassination, and that idiot persona was a part of my disguise, because it was useful. You can’t believe the secrets you find when people think you’re stupid enough to mix up and down.” I stopped for a second, my smile gaining a dark quality. “Or in second thought, you know exactly what kind of secrets that might be found, don’t you, sweetie,” I added, caressing her cheek softly just to reiterate the situation. </p><p>“Why are you telling me this?” she asked, clearly confused. </p><p>“Because you can’t tell anyone,” I said, but even as I said that, I realized it sounded like something a third-rate villain might say before killing his victim, so I quickly amended. “Because the things I know about you are much more dangerous, so you would be an idiot to reveal that. I would just lose my cover, which, for reasons that would stay hidden for now, starting to outlive its usefulness. How would your family react if they knew your unholy relationship with a woman from a rival family?” </p><p>My lengthy explanation was enough to push the situation for her. “What do you want?” she asked in surrender. </p><p>“Don’t be down, sweetie, I don’t need anything from you,” I said, which made her react incredulously. “Don’t be too shocked, while there is quite a few I could force from you, I’m not in a habit of blackmailing helpless damsels.” Which was a bald-faced lie, as I had no complications about using the said blackmail to my benefit, but the way she reacted to the situation revealed that she was even easier to manipulate than I had first assumed. Why should I have an angry servant while I could have a devoted one instead? </p><p>“So, you want nothing,” she reiterated, relief overcoming her surprise. </p><p>“Well, I wouldn’t say no if you occasionally drop by for a quick chat. Boredom is the biggest problem in wearing the disguise of an idiot. And with my loyal maid gone, I don’t have anyone to talk to. Before she departed, we were talking for hours, where she told me about her day.” </p><p>“She tells you about her day,” Marianne said, her panic invading her voice once more. </p><p>“Yes,” I said, stretching the word like it was a particularly delicious piece of food. I let my gaze fell down, devouring her body. “She told me everything, including the rather interesting adventures she had during her latest job assisting a rather curious noble lady.” I made a show of zipping my mouth, signaling that it will stay a secret. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured, but her voice was more stressed than relaxed. I understood where she was coming from. My commitment to stay silent wasn’t worth much with her information being worth so little. At least, that was what I had made it look like by revealing it in my own choice. </p><p>“Of course, I shouldn’t have to say it, that it needs to be a two-sided act, even including Cornelia. If you choose to talk to her about anything about me, I might find myself explaining some of your adventures without her.” I stopped for a moment, then continued with a teasing manner. “But it shouldn’t worry you. Luckily, she is even-tempered enough to handle it, right?” </p><p>That, despite the tenseness of the situation, managed to earn a snort from her. It wasn’t a perfect joke, but delivered by the supernaturally good timing and tone, enhanced by my speech skill, it worked wonders. It was an interesting tone, timing, and pacing of the words had even more important than the meaning they hold. </p><p>“So, what now,” she said, calmed after her short laughter. </p><p>“Nothing much, you’ll stop searching for Selena, as she had to leave for another task for the family, and I don’t want anyone to start asking about her linked to me. There was a reason she didn’t wear her family's allegiance openly. On that topic, even among the servants, you need to be more careful who to trust. You’re lucky that I don’t have any ulterior motives towards you,” I said, probably uttering the most bald-faced lie that had ever left my lips. </p><p>“I understand,” she said in a slight annoyance for being patronized, which was my intention. Slight annoyance was much easier to manage than fear of one’s safety. </p><p>“Excellent. Try to drop by occasionally, as it will get without Selena’s company,” I said and started walking away. But just before disappearing around the corner, and facing at her, who was watching me with confusion, still trying to process the sudden change in the situation. “And, feel free to drop by if you want to receive a massage from Selena’s master, satisfaction guaranteed.”</p><p>[Achievement: Foxy Flirting. Twist dangerous and threatening situation into not-so-innocent flirting. +200 Experience, +2 Manipulation] </p><p>It was amusing to watch her dash away with panic, so much that I was tempted to follow her, applying a more direct method of seduction. Unfortunately, I still needed rest for tonight’s meeting, in case that shadow wolf wasn’t the only thing that was planned by the shadow planner. </p><p>I wasn’t willing to believe that a shadow wolf accidentally sneaked into the level one forest the same night the guards decided to be suspiciously absent. </p><p>When I went back to my room, I chose to take a small nap, ignoring the temptation to start playing with the trophy bones I had picked. Even without spending it frivolously, I would be around three-quarter mark after another nap. I didn’t even spend it to fully recover my HP, why should I waste it for a few pieces of bone. </p><p>I left my room about an hour before the promised meeting time, once again dressed as a servant. My first stop was the armory, and I managed to steal a sword and a dagger without much difficulty, dismissing the fact that their absence would cause some headache for the quartermaster. Their count was, unlike the ones marked garbage, was limited. They weren’t masterpieces in any stretch of the word, and they didn’t have a scrap a magic of their creation, but they were quite a bit more reliable than the one I had picked from the garbage, even after the magical treatment. </p><p>After that, I stayed in my servant guise while walking towards the female warrior section, waiting for Aviada to appear. Not because I wanted to talk to her, but because I wanted to see if her passage would trigger a spy. </p><p>A few minutes later, Aviada appeared at the entrance, and started walking towards the forest. I didn’t have to wait for long, as one of the servants disappeared suspiciously the moment he had seen her, and a moment later, I felt a flare of magic. Even around the warrior halls, it wasn’t that uncommon enough to be noteworthy, but not enough to make the servant’s disappearance just a coincidence. </p><p>With the conspiracy targeting my new friend confirmed, I quickened my steps towards the forest, just in case the planner in the shadow decided to act quicker than I feared. Aviada was too interesting to lose quickly. </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 9        Experience: 43700 / 45000 </p><p>Strength: 9    Charisma: 14</p><p>Precision: 10    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 14</p><p>Speed: 7       Intelligence: 12</p><p>Endurance: 10      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 370 / 450    Mana: 535 / 612             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (50/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [50/50]        </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [35/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech 25/25    </p><p>Basic Melee 23/25        ]</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Natalie said nothing in response to my assertion of victory. And she didn’t like she could, her face twisted between a mixture of shock and anger, a view that made me only harder — a considerable achievement considering I had a magnificent redheaded pilates instructor on my lap, riding me with the same desperation of a traveler lost in the desert, drinking water. Her nether lips were tight around my shaft, signaling it was a while since she had tasted the unique touch of a male. </p><p>Luckily for them, I was there to help selflessly. </p><p>Oh, how I wished that I could hear Natalie’s thoughts, though luckily, reading her face was a good tradeoff, watching her shock dancing against her desperation. I could see that she wanted nothing more than pull Jenny away from me, but she kept herself back. And our position made things even better, with Jenny on my lap, jumping enthusiastically, there was no doubt about her voluntary participation. </p><p>Distracted by her enjoyment, Jenny hadn’t noticed as Natalie stumbled closer without bothering to keep silent, her heels clanking on the floor. From Natalie’s confusion, it was clear she was yet to decide how to react. Luckily, before she could make a decision, she had collided with the table, making Jenny aware that there was a third person in the room. </p><p>“My love,” Jenny moaned the joy, which added confusion to Natalie’s expression. “Thank you, this is the best present ever!” Then, she had registered that Natalie’s expression was a bit weird, but she was too distracted to decipher its reason. “You don’t mind that I started before you arrived, right? It was just supposed to be warm-up, but I got greedy.” </p><p>Natalie looked at us empty, still trying to process what was just happening. It was a familiar expression, the same that she had in the night at the casino, failing to process the fact that she had lost, and lost badly. She opened her mouth to say something, but I didn’t know what. I doubted that even she knew. </p><p>Naturally, I interjected. I had won already, but looking at the possibility of enjoying Jenny’s tight body all night long, I didn’t want Natalie to ruin it with a careless word. “It was an excellent idea, Nat, to invite me for the surprise threesome you have planned for your girlfriend,” I said. “I’m honored to be a part of the love between such an impressive couple.” I was laying thick, but I wanted Natalie to understand the situation correctly without making Jenny suspicious, and take the clue and prevent her from ruining her relationship. Not because of any sudden struck of mercy, of course, but having both of them together would doubtlessly be even more enjoyable. </p><p>Not to mention the possibility of a threesome… Natalie might be a vile bitch, but she was utterly delicious.</p><p>Jenny tried to keep her gaze on her girlfriend, but I didn’t want her to suspect from anything, so my hand slid through the silky strains of her auburn hair and pulled her for a sudden heated kiss, one that shocked her with its suddenness, enough to make her try to pull back, but I didn’t let her retreat. Why should I when I could feel her resistance crumbling after just a few seconds. </p><p>I could see that she missed the variety in her diet. She responded to my aggressive kiss in kind, trying to devour my lips with desperation. My tongue joined the fray soon after, trying to push through my lips to invade my mouth. I let her have a fleeting victory before my counterattack turned the tables, allowing me to enjoy her unique taste mixed with wine. As our tongues twirled together, her hips started to gyrate even more, bringing my pleasure to the next level. </p><p>The kiss lasted a while, and when I finally let her pull away, Jenny had already forgotten the presence of her girlfriend behind her to turn her full focus on riding me until I was bone-dry. Her lips clamped on my neck, leaving a trail of bite marks. Meanwhile, I looked at Natalie, who was still watching us with daggers in her eyes, but her shock was mostly gone. I gestured her to undress. </p><p>Indignation flared in her eyes, and her mouth opened to deliver what was no doubt a poisonous angry exclamation. But I raised my finger warningly while mouthing silently, telling her that it was an order, and reminding her about the bet itself. I didn’t say anything else, but Natalie was smart enough to get the implied choice between the order or the consequences of rejecting said order. </p><p>Of course, technically, this situation didn’t count, as the exact wording of the bet only covered my office, but Natalie wasn’t in a state to remember that particular detail. Even if she did, it wasn’t the best place to argue about the details, she could turn back and leave, but that would mean leaving her girlfriend in my arms for the rest of the night. Talking with Jenny about the truth of the situation was even worse for her, which would require revealing the bet itself. I doubted Jenny would be understanding at that particular point. </p><p>The conflict on her face was obvious, but it only made the situation more arousing. The clock ticked while she struggled to decide, but I didn’t bother to make her hurry. Her anguish made pleasure from Jenny’s treatments even more delicious. A while later, an expression of resignation passed through her face — a welcome detail but ultimately unsurprising, considering the number of times she had surrendered to me, trying to clean up yet another mess of hers. </p><p>She reached to her back with a mechanical movement, only to be stopped by another gesture, asking her to slow down. She stopped for a second, her anger sparking once more, but that only enhanced her striking sexiness as she started swaying with an imaginary rhythm, anger mixing to her sensuality, slowly getting rid of her dress. The way her obedience increased was getting more and more delicious. </p><p>I watched silently as her dress slowly slid down, revealing her tight breasts, once again filling me with a desire to paint them with teeth marks. And luckily, unlike the other times, I was free to do so without making her girlfriend suspicious, a natural consequence of having said girlfriend on my lap, moaning with enjoyment as I explored her depths. </p><p>Natalie’s show deserved more than just one spectator, I suddenly decided, as I suddenly grabbed Jenny and pushed her onto her feet, only to pull her down once more before she could stammer a question, but with one great difference. She was facing towards the entrance of the room rather than my face, meaning, she had a prime view for the strip-show her girlfriend was providing. </p><p>“Sweetie, you’re so sexy!” Jenny exclaimed, though I was willing to bet her loudness was less about the half-dressed state of Natalie, and more about the orgasm that was steadily coming closer. Natalie’s resentment was clear for me, but Jenny was far too gone to notice it, her moans getting closer and closer. </p><p>Meanwhile, Natalie’s dress finally slid down her hips, revealing the absence of a certain piece of underwear. “You naughty girl,” I murmured in enjoyment. She had prepared for a naughty evening, though whether it was like that from the beginning, or it was a gift from Elena to me, I didn’t know. “Now, why don’t you crawl towards us and give your girlfriend a special kiss.” </p><p>That was enough to make Jenny’s eyes open in shock, especially when Natalie had actually followed my order and fell on all fours without much delay, slowly crawling towards us. Her surprise was understandable. Natalie thought herself as a dominatrix, meaning she would be rather stiff and uncompromising for poor Jenny. Luckily for her, I was here to right the wrongs. </p><p>“You’re being rather flexible today,” Jenny managed to get out between her moans as she watched Natalie crawling ever closer. Her hands were already caressing her body, adding yet another layer to her pleasure. “Maybe we should have guests more often,” she added with the best approximation of a teasing tone that she could manage under the circumstances. </p><p>Natalie didn’t appreciate the comment, but her situation didn’t allow for a truthful answer. “Why not?” she murmured without committing, trying to cut the discussion short. I was all for cutting talking short, so I grabbed her hair, not bothering to moderate my strength, and pulled her closer until her lips were pressed against the bottom of my shaft. A pained yelp escaped from her lips. “Lick!” I ordered. </p><p>Her eyes were burning in anger at the treatment, but still, she followed the order without losing too much time, and she started licking. </p><p>Lost in the pleasure, Jenny’s shock at my rough treatment didn’t last long. “Yes, work that shaft,” she ordered with glee while she continued jumping up and down, somehow managing to get even tighter. But soon, she decided to have a more active role, so she pushed my hand away and grabbed Natalie’s hair with a visible glee, enjoying the sudden turn of the situation, pulling her up just a bit, so that Natalie ended up licking her. I wouldn’t say I was perfectly happy with losing Natalie’s lips, but Jenny deserved that much. “Lick it, and lick it good!” she ordered. </p><p>It was a pity that I lost my opportunity for enjoyment, so I started looking for alternatives. My hands were free, so there was nothing to prevent me from slowly caressing her stomach while moving up, until I came to a sudden stop at her perky breasts, stopping there to enjoy their firmness, occasionally squeezing her nipples painfully. All the while, my lips reached to her cheek, leaving a trail of kisses with a gentleness that contrasted my otherwise rough treatment. </p><p>Under the assault from both sides, it didn’t take long for Jenny to reach a climax. A sudden cry escaped her mouth, bouncing at the walls rapidly until it turned into a beautiful echo while she shuddered helplessly on my shaft. She got even tighter, squeezing as she tried to milk me, but I kept myself back. As much as I wanted to fill her, I was afraid that it would make Natalie flip. I was definitely going to do that tonight, but I wanted her to get used to the situation before. </p><p>“Why don’t you sit here, boss,” I said to Natalie once Jenny let go of her hair, too busy trying to contain the invasion of the pleasure. I received a glare in return, but that glare only resulted in a slight delay before she followed my order, disguised as a courtesy call. She stood up, and a little drop of arousal trailed down her leg, telling me that, despite her distaste, she was still enjoying the moment at a primal level. For a while, we sat there in an awkward assemble. I was drowning in accomplishment, Jenny was drowning in pleasure, and Natalie was drowning in helplessness. It was a perfect moment.</p><p>Natalie tried to slide away, but I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her closer until our shoulders touched, and then my finger slid between her legs, teasing her wetness. She didn’t appreciate the attempt, but after all the times we have been together, I knew exactly which buttons to push. My fingers slid into her tunnel, teasing her in soft, long slides with an alternating rhythm. And since my other hand was idle, my fingers found Jenny’s knob, gently teasing her while she tried to recover. </p><p>Soon, Jenny started to recover from the monumental explosion of pleasure she had experienced moments ago, and turned to Natalie. “You’re the best girlfriend,” she exclaimed as she reached for Natalie, and started kissing her. Natalie didn’t look satisfied despite the approval of her girlfriend, though the reason wasn’t a mystery. After all, my shaft was still inside her, and her hips were grinding softly, already trying to start a second session. And my hands, caressing their gentlest place, didn’t help. </p><p>“I’m sure she’s trying her very best, but you’re being rather selfish,” I quipped a few seconds later, underlined by a gentle slap to her bottom. In response to my slap, her grinding quickened immediately, probably a sign of Natalie’s subtle training. Too bad that she was weak on the most important part, ensuring the loyalty of her pets. </p><p>“What are you talking about?” Jenny asked, but blushed when I pointed downward, to the exact location our bodies melded together. “But I don’t think Natalie wants a turn, she’s not exactly a fan of that part.” </p><p>“Really?” I said with a mocking grin, though only Natalie was looking my way to enjoy that particular view. “Still, seeing your obvious enjoyment, maybe she would enjoy a try. Why don’t you ask her?” I said, once again underlining my comment with a gentle slap to her bottom.</p><p>“If you insist,” Jenny said with a playful giggle, something Natalie didn’t enjoy, but her lack of enjoyment was nothing compared to her distaste for the question that was about to come, especially when I gestured her to accept. “Sweetie, do you want to take a test drive in this stick car?” Jenny asked after turning to Natalie. </p><p>“Why not?” Natalie answered with a grin that she tried to make it look nonchalant, but came across as stony. Luckily, Jenny was too busy being shocked by her words to pay attention to her expression. </p><p>“Really?” Jenny asked in shock. “But you never wanted to, even after I asked you so many times,” Jenny asked in fascination. I barely kept myself from facepalming at Jenny’s innocence, though I can see why Natalie wanted to keep her in the hold. Sexy, smart, yet somehow gullible and trusting when it came to the relationship. Pity that she fell into the hands of two deviants like us.  </p><p>“Well…” Natalie murmured, drifting out as she tried to come up with an answer. “You looked like you were enjoying it. So there’s no harm in trying.” </p><p>“Excellent, and if you enjoy, maybe you won’t be so against the occasional spice,” Jenny exclaimed as she lifted herself from my lap. She might be trusting and innocent in terms of relationship awareness, but she was turning out to be real minx when it came to sexual appetite. Then, she turned to me, her red hair sticking to her sweaty shoulders, giving her a slightly used look, but it only made her sexier. “You better make sure she enjoys it, mister!” she said with a playful finger-wagging. </p><p>“I’ll do my best, mistress,” I gestured before turning to Natalie. “So, let’s see whether I have what it takes to make you go back on solids.” Natalie didn’t answer while Jenny fell into a giggling-fit. I ignored the redheaded beauty, no matter how much her cute giggles wanted me to push her on the floor and take her until she was moaning my name. </p><p>Natalie stood up and took a step towards me, trying to hide her reluctance, but before she could sit, I stood up as well. She looked at me questioningly. “Jenny, why don’t you sit on the couch, and Natalie, you can take all fours. I’m sure some familiarity will make the situation even more enjoyable.”</p><p>Jenny enthusiastically jumped on the couch, her legs already parted, revealing her neatly trimmed lips. Her enthusiasm wasn’t a surprise since I knew about her desires. Natalie took a doggy position, her head already between Jenny’s legs. “Nat, if it gets too rough, just say please, and I’ll make sure to stop. Alright?” I said, amused by the stinking gaze I received in response. After all, it was my intention to give her one thing to stick to prove her pride. Natalie was predictable enough that I knew she would keep silent unless I actually started to torture her. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked as I took my position behind her, slowly sinking into her wet snatch, proving that despite her distaste, she was still enjoying the moment. </p>",

    "title": "Mafia in College 14",
    "content": "<p>Megan was trembling badly as we watched the disappearance of the car which carried her almost-kidnappers, her arms tight around my torso. Normally, I would be focused enjoying such a touch, but my mind was focused on the fact that my cover identity, after all the work I had put on, was under risk once more. And to make it even more annoying, I didn’t have anyone to blame, not even myself. Who could have guessed that the annoying student I had tasked myself to discipline would have been targeted by the mafia? </p><p>It was pure bad luck, just like the time my carefully planned heist had fallen apart. </p><p>For a moment, I was struck with a desire to curse the skies, asking what I had done to deserve it, but my mind was ready to provide a string of memories; fortunes I had stolen, knees I had broken, wives I had seduced, partners I had cheated… Okay, maybe I had occasionally done a couple of things that made me deserve such things. Still, it was annoying. </p><p>“Let’s walk before someone comes along,” I said as I patted Megan’s shoulder, dragging her towards my room, the nearest safe house I could bring her. She said nothing, just followed the direction my arm around her shoulders provided, not too different from a wind-up toy, still in shock, trembling like a winter leaf… </p><p>I said nothing until we stepped into my room, observing my surroundings, and positioning us in a way that no one would see her identity. An inquiry about a relationship between a student and a teacher wouldn’t be welcome even under the normal conditions, and with the risk of discovery from my old buddies on the table, the situation was so far away from the normal conditions that it was patently funny. </p><p>“Are you okay,” I asked her after we have stepped inside my apartment. </p><p>“Should I be!” she said, her tone a mixture of crying and shouting. “Sorry,” she added instantly, a shocked expression on her face, likely because she had just shouted at her savior. </p><p>“Don’t be sorry,” I said even as I caressed her head, letting her know that there were no hard feelings between us. “You have been through a terrible ordeal. Just take a deep breath, and try to calm down.” She tried to take a deep breath, but it ended up in rapid breathing that bordered on panic attack. “Maybe a shower would be better,” I said even as I dragged her towards the bathroom. The caress of the warm water worked well to combat the adrenaline shock. </p><p>I decided to the gentlemanly thing and kept her company in the shower! It wasn’t like I was unfamiliar with her body, after all. First, I helped her to undress, rather easily considering it was the second time I was helping her to get out of these exact clothes — and the first time was in slow motion, making it educational! </p><p>I turned the shower on before I move onto the undressing part, to make a shower warm and ready for our arrival. Then, I moved onto the next part of my task, freeing her body from the confines of her clothes while also managing to get rid of my own.</p><p>I enjoyed the sight of her body once more as I dragged her to the shower. Her red hair spilled on her naked shoulders, partially covering her perky breasts. My gaze slid down to her flat stomach, evidence of her great genetic gift reinforced through a careful application of diet and exercise. Her legs, toned to perfection in endless hours of training, had a little treasure hidden in between which still oozed with my seed, courtesy of our earlier encounter. </p><p>While I would have liked to spend a few minutes visually devouring her sexy little body, her need for a shower was more immediate. I gently led her in the moment water reached the perfect temperature, enveloping the body with the sensation of burning without actually scalding, creating little clouds of steam. </p><p>A relaxed gasp escaped her mouth as soon as she stepped under the shower, the warmth acting as a substitute for the feeling of feeling protected. Her breathing started to slowly get into control, finally giving her enough presence of mind to look around. </p><p>At that moment, I expected her to try to bargain in order to kick me out of my own shower, not that I would be very happy about it. But apparently, my earlier actions gained me more credit than I first suspected, because when she grabbed my arm, instead of trying to push me out, she chose to wrap it around her shoulder, leaning on my chest for support. </p><p>We stayed like that for a long while, her tremblings subsiding by each passing minute. Then, she started moving once again, but this time, it was much more controlled than adrenaline-fueled trembling, focused on her hip area, awakening a certain part of my body in the process. Her reaction to adrenaline shock was rather familiar, and like the other occasion, I had little complications in helping a lady quell these desires. </p><p>Still, her need for tenderness for obvious, enough to make me forgo my rougher tastes, at least for the moment, and slowly dipped my head down, capturing her lips in a lingering kiss as her body melted against mine, her back still pressed against my chest. At first, the kiss was soft, almost chaste, limited to tangling of our lips. Soon, her tongue tentatively joined the fray, asking for entrance, and I met her halfway, suppressing my natural instinct to dominate her outright. </p><p>Soon, I let my free hand join the fray, gently caressing her skin to help her calm down. Keeping completely away from the naughty spots was an impossible challenge, but I managed to keep it down to a manageable level despite the temptation of her erect nipples, surrounded by her cute pink areolas.  </p><p>But my patience had limits, not particularly strong limits either, and she was quick to break them. She pulled away for a moment, using the break to shift her position until we were face to face. She rose to her tiptoes to catch my lips in a much rougher manner, one hand slipping through my hair, allowing her for a painful grip. Though it wasn’t as triggering as her other hand, caressing my chest roughly enough to leave red marks behind, all the while her teeth scraped against my lips roughly.  </p><p>“Playtime is over,” I murmured, the playful expression I donned not particularly light. I stepped forward. It wasn’t a quick move, not that it had to be, the small space in the shower not giving her an area to maneuver, and even under the best of conditions, she lacked the power to push me back. Inevitably, she ended up squeezed between my body and the wall, but she was most interested in maintaining the kiss, her lips clenched against mine. </p><p>A shift of my hips, and the top of my girth was wrapped by a different kind of warmth than the one that the water provided. A tighter variety, one that I had started to become quite familiar after our earlier encounter. But the roughness of my entry only made her more enthusiastic in her kissing, her hands their position to reach to my poor shoulders, digging them in a painful manner. </p><p>A hiss escaped my mouth, and when I looked down, I only found a mischievous expression on her face. “You asked for this,” I said, reminding her that it was her fault for opening a door without knowing what lay behind. If she wanted rough, I would give her rough, I decided even as my hand shifted to her hips, positioning her perfectly.</p><p>Her moans rose high the moment I impaled her with the fullness of my length, earning a moan that was loud enough to make me glad about ensuring the sound-proofing in my apartment was up to the task. With my grip in place, I started slamming her repeatedly, shower barely enough to wash away her dripping wetness, each contact exploding on her naked skin with a delicious crescendo, mixing with her staggering moans. </p><p>“Thank you,” she managed to stammer between her moans, her hands hooked around my neck, more to maintain the closeness rather than balance, I presumed, because her back was still pinned against the weathered and faded ceramics of my shower, giving her all the support her trembling legs stopped to provide. </p><p>“For the grades?” I asked with a grin on my face, amused by the exact moment she chose to talk about the kidnapping attempt. Normally, I would have counted it a failure on my part on not bringing my partner enough pleasure to delay any talking attempt, but her moans, interrupting each word with great accuracy, told me that it was not a deficiency on my part that drove her to speak. </p><p>“No, silly, for saving me,” she answered, punctuated by a gentle slap on my chest, a sound that barely survived against other noises filling the small cabinet. “I didn’t know that would have happened if you hadn’t been there…” she added, her green eyes pinned against mine. I barely held back on seeing the signs of the crush dancing in her eyes. I had a feeling that Megan wouldn’t be any less bothersome with her crush than her earlier misguided attempts to put me in place.</p><p>A moment later, I shrugged. It was surprising how much trouble I was willing to accept if it was coming from a sexy redhead. </p><p>“It was my pleasure,” I answered without breaking the treatment she was receiving. “I couldn’t have let those monsters get away with hurting such a precious treasure, after all,” I added, not slowing down the treatment. She chose to show her appreciation in the form of her legs, wrapping tight around my waist, once again making it impossible to pull out. I hoped that she was on birth control, but I was too distracted to actually care. But I wasn’t too distracted to subject her into a little questioning. “By the way, do you have any idea who they are?” I added, wanting to leverage her distraction to the maximum effect. Confused and distracted, she was not in a position to selectively manipulate the information she provided. </p><p>“I think it might be about the new business associates of my father,” she murmured in a haze while still trying to control her pleasure. She might have had an easier time if I slowed down the relentless assault she was under, but watching her struggle to string together half-broken sentences under the delirium of pleasure was too entertaining to forgo. </p><p>So, I listened to her explanation while making sure I continued to impale her rapidly. Her explanation was staggered significantly once or twice as the pleasure became too much to resist, triggering yet another climax, leaving her more ragged than ever. Towards the end, her voice was cracking under the combined effects of exhaustion and constant moaning, but she somehow managed to continue talking with an unexpected display of stamina. </p><p>And from what I could piece together from the broken expressions of her already careless observations, her father had a new business partner, one that visited their house once or twice with a suspicious number of cars in escort, their occupants staying in the car for the whole length of dinner, shouting their connection to the shadier side of the business. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t give me a clue on their identity. The simplest conclusion was to say that they were from a rival family to my historical associates, and Archie was sent to sabotage or subvert that budding connection, but it was dangerous to assume that the family was a monolithic organism working towards a single goal; it could as easily be an internal power play from one lieutenant to another. My own little heist was not too different from the latter option, after all.</p><p>I didn’t bother to explain Megan any of that. My situation was suspicious enough before revealing a working knowledge of the high-level mafia politics, and she wasn’t exactly a bank vault in keeping secrets. Even if her developing crush worked enough to make her wish to keep silent, a semi-skilled information gatherer would learn her secrets without even making aware of the said attempts. Luckily, I had a different option to distract her. A grunt escaped my mouth as she managed to speed up my pleasure to escape velocity, and I filled her with a fresh load. </p><p>She only moaned in response. </p><p>She put her legs on the floor only after she made sure to extract every single drop, but her trembling legs were barely able to hold her upright. I turned off the water while she tried to stumble out of the shower, her grip only thing to keep her in place. But after the extended treatment, I was even hornier, and the way her hips swayed as she walked away despite her trembling legs didn’t help any. Nor did her skin, covered with shiny droplets of water, making me even hornier. </p><p>Luckily, the solution for it was rather simple. Before she could realize my movement, I was already behind her, and a swipe threw a bunch of freshly cleaned towels to the floor, and a gentle push later, Megan ended up laying on top of the pile of towels, her back resting against their soft surface, her legs distant enough to allow me to sneak in. </p><p>And before she could even comment on the new position, I was in her once more, ravaging her mercilessly. The only change was rather than merciless drilling, I moved in a soft manner, slowly pushing my whole length inside her, waiting for a moment before pulling out just as slow, repeating the move repeatedly. She didn’t exactly complain against the sudden second round, her arms once again wrapped tight around my neck. </p><p>“So, where did you learn it,” she mentioned even as she arched her back, a move that perfectly accentuated the perkiness of her breasts. </p><p>“Oh, kinky,” I answered, once again deflecting her question. </p><p>“No, silly,” she answered with a surprisingly cute blush under the circumstances, an expression that contrasted rather sharply with the expert way her hips were grinding. “I mean, where did you learn how to fight like that.” She stopped a moment to wrap her legs around, pulling me even deeper. “It was amazing,” she added, her obvious hero worship further underlined by the possessive grip of her legs. </p><p>“I’m afraid the answer is a bit cliche, I grew up in the bad part of the town,” I said even as I slid inside her repeatedly. And it was actually true. I grew up in a declining down, the only merit of being on the edge of the territory of four different families. In such a place, there was two option, disappear or fight; I couldn’t have stomached the former. I told her a true version -but very abridged with any possible identifying details removed- of my story, minus the part that I had worked as an enforcer of course, suitably reframed as a bouncer position to a little-known club. </p><p>In the middle of my story, she decided to shift positions without warning, and amused by her initiative, I let her. I ended up on my back, with her sitting up on my midsection, rocking her hips sensually, her enthusiasm more than enough to compensate her otherwise average skills. Her lack of surprise wasn’t surprising though, why would she try when any boy closer to her age barely last after being blasted by her sexiness. </p><p>“I’m coming,” she moaned, interrupting yet another unimportant detail of my life story, more fiction than fact. I shut up, turning my focus towards the enthusiastic dance she was displaying enthusiastically on my lap, each move pitting the firmness against her momentum, creating a beautiful battle to watch. At that point, it was inevitable that when she tightened with yet another climax, I triggered as well. </p><p>She collapsed against my chest, her arms once again enveloping my chest tightly, like she wanted to ensure that I was going to stay. But her drooping eyelids promised a bit of trouble. With a sigh, I stood up, and lifted her in a bridal hold, carrying her with me towards the bedroom, not neglecting to pick a towel for her hair as well. Thankfully, our tumble in the pile of towels worked enough to dry both of us. </p><p>Her body exhausted with repeated doses of confusion, fear, and an impressive number of bursts of pleasure, I wasn’t exactly shocked when she was unconscious the moment she made contact with the bed. And considering everything that happened, I couldn’t exactly say laying next to her for an early nap wasn’t tempting. </p><p>But I had one more thing to do before that. I walked and turned my computer on, and after activating several security measures to ensure no reasonable way of tracking back to the source, I sent a quick mail to an old rival about the renewed activity in my old family. Risky, but I hoped that a whole mafia family would be a more interesting target than a retired enforcer. </p><p>Then, with a sigh, I returned to my bedroom, spooned the still-naked body of Megan, and pulled the covers over us… </p><p>Sleep didn’t take long to arrive… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I left Marianne’s maid behind, still dressed as Selena, after explaining to her that there had been an emergency decision taken by the house, calling me back to their estate, something she didn’t enjoy hearing. Regardless, I walked away, but my blood still flowing quickly in my veins. I needed some physical exercise to throw away the excess energy if I were to catch any sleep. Unfortunately, I didn’t have any convenient target for my favorite physical activity, now that the library was out of commission for that purpose. </p><p>Luckily I had an alternative, though an inferior one. Physical combat. I stopped by my room and picked up a sword, though this time, I didn’t bother dressing in a fake warrior costume with all the armor, instead choosing a hooded cloak that would hide my identity as I sneaked into the forest. During my earlier visit, I have seen that the security there wasn’t exactly I would call alert, especially after the nightfall, where most students were smart enough to avoid the time that favored the monsters. They were still patrols around, of course, but they were aimed to prevent monsters from entering, not students from leaving. </p><p>For me, the increased risk was an acceptable trade-off for reduced oversight. I was starting to get chafed by all those fake identities as I got stronger. Not enough to fore-swear their usage, but I could feel the temptation to be actually known, rather than acting as a scavenger. But before revealing myself fully, I needed to make sure my combat skills were appropriately in place.</p><p>Once again, I sneaked into the weakest forest, one that was filled with class zero dire rabbits, and class one dire foxes, intent on cutting another path through them, getting more skill points while simultaneously exhausting myself enough to be able to sleep. For more than half an hour, I continued, chasing and killing monsters, mostly by my sword, but also relying on my magic on occasion, trying to integrate some quick blasting spells to my combat routine, or curing occasional wound I received. It was tempted to drain my mana by casting life-spells on the creatures, earning a huge boost in my biomancy skill, but I still kept most of my mana pool untouched just in case. After all, I didn’t have anyone to support me if things went sideways.  </p><p>[+9 Melee]</p><p>[+2 Biomancy]</p><p>During that journey, my concentration was only broken when I saw the same warrior girl I had seen before, once again cutting a swathe through a pile of monsters, each blow felling at least two dire rabbits. </p><p>For a moment, I just stood there, appreciating the view. Standing straight, she was tall enough to tower over me by several inches, and the great sword she carried just added the majesty she displayed. Her raven black hair shone under the moonlight, each swing making them flew with the wind. Her muscles, while showed, wasn’t large enough to detract from her sexiness, and they shone with a sweat thick enough to signify that she had been fighting here since I had last seen her hours ago. </p><p>It was an interesting situation, not because she was able to down those weak monsters in one blow, as it was an achievement anyone could replicate, but because these rabbits were still attacking in a rush, which would have meant that she had to have some kind of magical effect driving them to attack. An interesting solution, considering that each kill resulted in one or two experience. A truly torturous way of leveling up. Also, it was dangerous, even in such a well-vetted area, because it wasn’t unheard of for perimeter wards to fail, and a stronger monster to slip in. And while a dire rabbit was manageable even when driven into a frenzy by magic, the same couldn’t be said for an elemental bear or something more dangerous. </p><p>But still, I doubted that she was swinging her sword non-stop for the hours I was away. For once, even for a Melius with endurance focus, swinging that sword for hours was no small feat. But maintaining a proper mindset for the battle was even more difficult. And if one’s focus faltered in the dark, even the weakest monster could be deadly. </p><p>My assessment was correct, it turned out, when I felt the dispersion of a magical field, and the rabbits froze for a moment, taking an account of their situation before dashing away in panic. She pressed her sword on the ground, leaning on it as she battled for her breath. </p><p>It would be a lie if I claimed that I wasn’t tempted to stray into the blood-soaked opening and try to strike a conversation, but in the end, I decided otherwise. Even with my speech skill and charisma, approaching an alone lady exhausted in battle in the middle of a deserted forest was an unnecessary challenge, especially when I didn’t even need to train my speech. </p><p>With that decision, I turned my back, and went deeper into the forest, which was easier than I had been expecting because of the small depopulation caused by the nameless battle maiden. </p><p>After a minute of walking, I received the best confirmation I could about the accuracy of not spending all of my mana. I was cleaving another rabbit, an innocent creature if I discounted its teeth, strong enough to dent steel, its eyes, glowing with an eerie red, and its thirst for human blood; when I felt a warning flash from my proximity ward going off in a way, buzzing with a strength I never felt before. </p><p>The same moment, I heard a soft noise, one that might be easily mistaken for the breeze. If it wasn’t for the proximity ward, I might have fallen for it even with my wisdom and perception stats. But with the warning, I decided to listen to my instincts and threw myself to the side while hastily constructing a shield, the strongest I could manage in less than a second. </p><p>[-50 Mana]</p><p>[-30 HP]</p><p>It turned out to be a good decision, because a black paw appeared from nowhere, mid-swing, barely slowed down by the barrier as it swung close to my face. A cold sweat spread to my body when a part of my brain decided to assess just how close I had been to an early demise. Sometimes, high intelligence and wisdom carried its own side effects. </p><p>I constructed another shield as I rolled on the ground, this time strong enough to hold back the follow-up attack, and observed the enemy in front of me that almost killed me. A curse escaped my mouth when I noticed my enemy, while it attacked my shield ineffectively. </p><p>[-50 Mana]</p><p>A shadow wolf! </p><p>I had no idea why a fucking class eleven creature was on the premises, nor I had time to speculate. I needed all of my attention to survive. I felt the time slow down as adrenaline was pumped into my veins. I tried to remember everything I could remember about them. </p><p>They were nocturnal hunters, and had a reputation for killing the whole parties who dared to camp in the deeper parts of the forests. They were pretty rare, as they were territorial enough to not to allow another shadow creature in their domain. They were fast, strong, but all above, stealthy. </p><p>Funny enough, the last part gave me confidence. I wouldn’t say that the shadow wolf was weak for its class. Its reputation as a party killer was well earned, hunting the stragglers one by one in the night, then melting back to shadows before the rest of the party could respond. </p><p>Luckily, I was well-equipped enough to deal with it thanks to my unique set of skills. I had high enough perception to catch its sneak attacks with the help of my proximity ward, and my agility was high enough to allow me to avoid its lightning-fast dashes. While I would have preferred to have a higher speed, my precision was enough to allow a successful counter-attack. And most importantly, I could cast defensive spells instantly, without trying to coordinate with a mage. Fuck every book that claimed multi-classing was a bad idea. I was alive because of it.  </p><p>It attacked the shield that separated us, but once again, failed to penetrate through the barrier. It proved it smarts when, instead of trying to break through the shield by brute force, it turned into a dark cloud, mixing into the darkness, effectively becoming invisible. </p><p>My grip on my sword tightened even as I molded some mana to my left hand, ready to go off. My perception was doing overtime while I waited for its assault. Just like before, it came in a flash. Unlike the last time, I was ready, coiled like a spring, and the moment I received the warning from my proximity ward, my sword flashed, meeting its paw halfway. </p><p>The creature pushed me back even as it roared, and the screech of the metal reached my ears. Who could have guessed that the damaged sword I had stolen from a garbage can wouldn’t have lasted against a semi-legendary creature! But the sword was just a distraction, only there to delay it while I brought my hand under its chin, and sent a bolt of eldritch energy to the soft spot under its chin, putting as much as energy I could manage in a spell.  </p><p>[-165 Mana]</p><p>It proved fast enough to prevent it from stabbing to its brain, but it wasn’t a complete waste. When it pulled back, a part of its face was absent, and along with an eye. Most of its chin was gone as well, removing the threat of a bite attack along. However, it looked pissed, something that was confirmed a moment later when a furious roar reached my ear. </p><p>And against its fury, I had a broken sword and a mana pool half empty. Trying to repeat the same tactic was tempting, but I wasn’t willing to bet against its adaptability. So instead of trying to sneak, it chose to rush in a furious assault. I rolled away at the last second, but it wasn’t without a cost. I carried a mark of its fury on my left shoulder, deep enough to be deadly if left untreated for a while. Still, I was alive, which was much more important than the alternatives. </p><p>[-220 HP]</p><p>I could barely able to stand up when it came with the same furious rush. I sent another bolt of energy, but it just dodged, giving me a second to put another barrier around me. It collided with it, but failed to break through it, which made it roar once more. </p><p>The scene repeated a couple of times, while I tried to come up with a spell it wouldn’t be able to avoid while doing the sufficient damage, but came blank. There was a reason most preferred elemental magic for pure combat purposes. Even my melee abilities were useless with my broken sword, with a reach barely longer than a bread knife, and a blunter tip. </p><p>I was just contemplating a range of suicidal tactics to increase my chance of survival by a sliver when I heard a shout. “Catch.” Both I and the wolf turned towards the sound, and we saw the same female warrior I had observed earlier, but her presence took the back seat against a more important detail. Her greatsword, traveling towards us while turning like a wheel. </p><p>The wolf dodged away easily, but I had a more interesting plan, and less suicidal than the others I could think of. I dispelled the barrier, and took a soft step forward, stretching my abilities to the limit as the sword passed the same space I was occupying just a second ago. My hand flashed, making me thankful for my precision, which, combined with my melee, allowed me to catch the sword midway.</p><p>I let its momentum force me to turn, but I directed towards the same area the wolf was trying to land. It realized the danger it was in, and tried to shift back to its shadow state, but it was too late. I swung the sword in a great cleave, aiming its legs… </p><p>The result was spectacular. I was expecting it to wound one of its legs, deep enough to hurt its mobility if I was lucky enough. I certainly wasn’t expecting it to cut through its legs like a knife through the butter, effectively immobilizing it. The sword had some serious enchantment on it, I realized, enough to make it a true treasure. </p><p>[+6 Melee]</p><p>It collapsed on the ground, helpless, but it was silent like it understood the fate it awaited him, and accepted. It was an alpha, and was willing to accept its fate with honor. One last chop would have ended it. </p><p>I didn’t want to be the one to deliver that swing, however. While I was dealing with the creature, the surprise guest of the night closed in the distance, and looking at the creature with awed eyes. “A shadow wolf,” she murmured in fascination. </p><p>“A rather interesting surprise, don’t you think, milady,” I said, feeling jovial now that the danger had passed. Then, without a word, I twisted the sword so that I was holding the tip, while the hilt was facing hers. “Thanks for the sword. It is magnificent.” </p><p>“It is amazing, isn’t it,” she said with a sudden display of joy. “It’s the miracle that carried our house name for seven generations, and now it’s my turn,” she added, this time with a sense of challenge, like she expected me to push back. She probably received rather skeptical comments on a woman having such a lofty goal, I realized. She relaxed when I nodded respectively rather than making an issue. “Wouldn’t you like to finish it before giving it back,” she continued, gesturing towards my own broken sword. “Yours doesn’t seem to be up to the task.” </p><p>“It certainly isn’t,” I added. “But rather than taking it myself, I would like to gift that kill for the gallant damsel who chose to save this knight in distress.” </p><p>She giggled at my comment before turning a serious expression. “Are you serious?” she asked. I suddenly had a feeling that, if I tried to do that with a weaker creature, I would receive a rather angry retort about her not needing handouts, but a class eleven creature wasn’t something to be dismissed by pride. I could easily imagine certain nobles paying hundreds of golds for the privilege of delivering the killing blow, thus getting the experience. Of course, for me, the sacrifice was meaningless, considering that I would earn no experience from the deed. </p><p>“Like a heart attack,” I said. “It’s nothing less than a magnificent lady like you, beautiful and courageous deserves.” She tried to look angry, which gave me another insight into her personality. Under normal circumstances, the same words would probably result in a beating. Luckily, the situation was rather far away from the land of normalcy. </p><p>“If you insist,” she said as she took the sword. “But I insist that you get its carcass. Otherwise, it would be too much.” I nodded, and she swung her sword with great expertise, lobbing the head of the creature with a wide swing. She looked at the empty space in front of her, no doubt watching the notification that appeared in front of her with fascination. But she wasn’t the only one that </p><p>[Achievement: Deadly Dowry. Leverage a deadly catch that brought you to the brink of the death to catch the attention of a dangerously sexy lady. +1000 Experience, +3 Strength]</p><p>The achievement had been a nice bonus, not that I needed assistance in deciphering her suspiciously curious glances towards my way. I ignored her for a moment, and used my biomancy to heal myself, at this level, it was still very ineffective for it, but I could stop the bleeding at least. </p><p>[+1 Biomancy]</p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>[+15 HP]</p><p>But stepping the bleeding wasn’t the only reason I used the spell. She still didn’t know who I was, and the situation was as favorable as it could get to reveal a part of myself, and getting an ally, which had the potential to turn into ally with benefits if everything went well. </p><p>“I wouldn’t have expected a mage skilled enough to take a shadow wolf in single combat. I thought your ilk chose to hide behind proud soldier for protection rather than risking their precious hide.” </p><p>“You would find out that I’m a rather unusual mage, in more ways than one,” I said even as I let my hood to fall down, giving her an unrestricted view of my face. She might be the first one that saw it for a while, because I had started to use an illusion to hide it while I went around in Mule identity. I had to do it, because fourteen points of charisma were rather attention-grabbing. </p><p>“It seems so,” she said, unaware that the night wasn’t enough to hide her blush from my eyes. “But I feel curious just how much.” </p><p>“I would like to explain it, but I fear that the commission might bring some guards here, and I have some reasons to hide my prowess, the general distaste for mages who actually decide to fight instead of hiding behind the others only one of it,” I said, once again glad for my speech skill. I would have focused seducing her, but I expected guards to appear any second, and more I could carve off this monster, the better. </p><p>“Interesting,” she murmured, her eyes alight with interest, in more ways than one. The situation was basically a cheat code for seduction, I had to admit. A handsome, mysterious warrior of a great aptitude, cloaked in dark, suggesting a greater mystery was too tempting to deny for a brave warrior like her. “Maybe we could meet tomorrow night and you can explain those mysteries better.” </p><p>“Agreed. It’s a date,” I said, followed by a wink to reveal that the word choice was intentional. </p><p>She blushed. “Good,” she murmured. “By the way, my name is Aviada,” she said. </p><p>“A magnificent name for a magnificent name,” I said, enjoying her intensifying blush. “And I’m Caesar,” I answered, using my birth name for the first time in a long while. It tasted weird in my tongue, but for the first time in my life, it felt right, that I was finally strong enough to fulfill the implications of the name, which belonged to the biggest hero my city had ever produced. </p><p>“An ambitious name for a mysterious stranger,” she said before disappearing behind the trees. After a brief pause where I repaired my sword, I started skinning my trophy. The more I could get before the guards arrived and I had to disappear, the better. </p><p>After half an hour of tense skinning, and cutting, where I managed to extract every valuable part of the wolf, I had realized that there were no guards coming, which was curious. I didn’t expect them to respond instantly, but even if the wards somehow failed to warn them, they should have heard the battle, or at least, felt the magic I had used. The blast that took half of the monster’s face was not really sneaky, both visually and magically. </p><p>But still, no guard came, and I burned the worthless remains of the wolf -relatively worthless, as they could easily be sold to several golds, but I currently lacked the opportunity to do so, and it might be hard to explain how the Mule suddenly came across a shadow wolf spleen or intestine. But the head, I took along with the skin, bones, and some highly-magical parts like its claws, my biomancy once again coming useful in processing them for storage. </p><p>But burning and processing those took the rest of my mana, and when I returned to my room, I was completely exhausted. But despite my exhaustion, the sleep proved elusive. A part of it was my sudden brush with death. Just a moment’s delay, and I would have died. Still, the sudden appearance of the monster, and the guards’ suspicious absence was more important. Something told me that things were planned, and while I could be the target, my instincts told me otherwise. </p><p>It seemed like I had a mystery to solve if I wanted to keep my new paramour alive… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 9        Experience: 43400 / 45000 </p><p>Strength: 9    Charisma: 14</p><p>Precision: 10    Perception: 10</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 12</p><p>Speed: 7       Intelligence: 12</p><p>Endurance: 10      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 187 / 450    Mana: 15 / 585             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (50/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [50/50]        </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [31/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech 25/25    </p><p>Basic Melee 23/25        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but feel infected by Marianne’s excitement on the way to her bathroom. She didn’t say anything, but also, she didn’t need to. The spring on her steps, the way her walk quickened, and occasional fleeting glances she sent back like she was trying to make sure that I was following her were enough. The way her body swayed with sexy energy despite her hurry, driven unconsciously by her arousal, was just another piece of evidence I welcomed, and an erotic marvel to watch. Something the system agreed wholeheartedly. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>As she stood next to her bed, she waved her hand, and extinguished all the lights in the room, except a small ball of flickering light, filling the room with shadows and mysteries. The view was no less heavenly as she stretched her body on her bed, her damp skin shimmering under the flickering lights, once again straining the cover of the towel. But thanks to the lesson with Helga and my week-long training, my illusion abilities were at another level. </p><p>I loosened the second towel that kept my boner in check, putting an illusion to hide the resulting tent. Marianne was too distracted to notice the usage of magic around her, so she busied herself in sinking her face on the pillow, leaving her naked body under my hands. </p><p>But she chose to speak before I could climb onto her bed. “There are some massage oils on the small table next to the mirror,” she informed. I didn’t say anything, not that she expected me to. After all, one of the traits of a good servant was to understand the desires of their mistress without excessive questions. </p><p>And I know exactly what she desired, but it was unfortunate that it wasn’t yet the time to give her that. After picking up the oil bottles, I sent them a small wave of magic, using my biomancy to get a better understanding of their qualities. It was one of the disregarded benefits of biomancy, to analyze and manipulate the material produced by plants and animals, even long after their extraction. Most nobles found such things inferior. Why shouldn’t they, when they could just hire a commoner alchemist to do the same things for a few pieces of silver instead. </p><p>Of course, by doing so, they surrendered the ability to manipulate these materials at will, an ability I had every intention of abusing. It took just a few seconds for me to analyze them and learn of their effects, and another few seconds to increase some aspects of it, such as the subtle sensation of heat they produced, or the additional sensitivity they created on any skin they were applied. </p><p>Marianne had no idea what she was about to experience. </p><p>I climbed on her bed, the small bottles next to me, carefully placed on the bed with their tops firmly shut. One of them, I picked, dousing my hands with a generous dab. Then, I put my hands on the softness of her back, moving along her spine in a tortuously slow pace. For the first ten minutes, she was subjected to relatively conservative treatment, enough to make her moan occasionally as she once again started journeying the road towards the climax, but I hadn’t done during the previous massage. And considering she just had one in the bath, I didn’t need my enhanced perception to know that she was slightly disappointed. </p><p>And disappointing such a beautiful lay wasn’t the gentlemanly thing to do, I decided to pick up the pace. The movement of my hands quickened, subjecting her to alternating pressure, and before my hands even started to explore the sides of her breasts, her moans rose both in volume and in frequency. </p><p>But I had too much to do to enjoy that small achievement. I changed position, so that I was sitting on her calves rather than her thighs, which gave me the access I needed. But I didn’t dive into my target instantly, instead, I focused on her thighs, which devoured my fingers in their thick sexiness. I treated the vast expanse with large circles, slowly moving onto her inner thighs, each repeat driving me closer to her nether lips, which was shining bright with her arousal. </p><p>But this time, I had no intention of giving her an easy escape. My fingers danced on her entrance, only occasionally straying into the areas that gave her a jolt of pleasure, but as usual, never enough to push her through the barrier. Watching her squirm in a helpless pleasure was too amusing to miss. My fingers occasionally strayed into the confines of her slit, which earned a rather loud moan from her as well.  </p><p>[+800 Experience] </p><p>From a technical perspective, the best thing to do was to keep the position for a length of time until she started to lose her coherence, but it came with one huge drawback. It required me to resist the temptation of her arousal-stained nether lips, begging me to test her obviousness in an escalating manner, which might or might not include a certain throbbing part of my body. </p><p>“If you may turn around, mistress,” I said with the usual inflectionless voice of my fake personality. She followed it in an instant, giving me a view of her face, wrapped with her soft blonde hair, her lips formed a pout to allow her to breathe easier, which had quickened to remove the heat she was under. Unfortunately, there was only one way to remove that heat, and she wasn’t going to receive it for a while. </p><p>I folded a towel for her face, covering her eyes, which she actually unfolded further, covering most of her face with it, clearly hoping to use it to hide the effects of arousal from her body. Which was pretty ineffective, as her body was an open book to read. Still, it helped me to act in more freedom. But it wasn’t the only thing I had in mind to provide myself with that freedom of movement. While I covered her breasts with oil, I also constructed a small ward that I invented myself over her face. </p><p>It was a simple thing, a very weak ward, once triggered, that would block the light for just a second. I invented it, not because it was a hard design that required my particular genius to create, but because it was almost completely useless. But, under the unique conditions I was in, it would block her sight for a second in the case that she removed her towel, allowing me to put things into order, avoiding a crisis. </p><p>With that done, I started subjecting her chest the same treatment her back received, but in a more torturous manner. First, I started on her sides, then slowly focused on her stomach, once again with large circles that allowed me to caress the edge of her breasts. When it was time to move onto her breasts, she was already squirming helplessly under the effects of an orgasm that was denied for long. </p><p>The strength of her wiggling only intensified as I focused on her oil-covered breasts, their already-high sensitivity enhanced even further. I stayed extra-careful, as I learned my lesson about her increased sensitivity on there. I acted slowly, every little caress causing her to squirm more. With each second, I started to take more liberty in playing with her breasts. Pushing them together, sinking my fingers deep into them, even twisting her nipples on occasion. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>But I didn’t stay there. Wanting to leverage her utter distraction further, I leaned forward to fulfill a desire that was filling my heart since the first night I had been bathed with that beautiful image. I leaned forward, and captured her nipple between my teeth. Softly at first, but seeing that she didn’t react negatively, I decided to push even further. My tongue joined the fray, wrapping around her nipple, my lips working overtime, and if her moans were any indicator, I wasn’t the only one that was enjoying the change in the circumstances. </p><p>I decided to reward her enthusiastic acceptance, and placed my knee between her thighs, close enough to rub her nether lips. The blunt treatment was exactly what was needed to push her even closer to the climax without actually letting her arrive there. Once again, the jump in her moans signaled that it was working excellently. </p><p>There was a limit I could resist the allure of her breasts. While covering them with bite marks would have been satisfying, but one of the things that would push her out of her haze, so the option was out. But she was still half-gone under the effect of her denied orgasm, I decided that it was the time to be adventurous once more. Since I had long removed the second towel to constrain my erection, I only needed to pull my towel to the side for the grand reveal. A small treatment which ensured that my shaft was covered with the same slippery, arousal enhancing liquid, I slid it between her breasts, then squeezed them to enhance the situation even further. </p><p>Honestly, I was expecting just a moment’s pleasure from that risky move. In my mind, the unfamiliar effect of the move would jolt Marianne from the pleasure-filled haze she was deliciously suffering under, which would force me to use the second of darkness provided by the ward for frantic hiding. </p><p>Surprisingly, it didn’t work like that. Instead of pulling the towel on her face in confusion, trying to see the source of the unfamiliar sensation, she continued to lay motionless, the slight increase in the volume of her cries the only difference. Encouraged by the opportunity, I started sliding in the prison created by these heavenly mounds of flesh, each push bringing me closer to a climax of my own. </p><p>Under those circumstances, managing the level of her pleasure, under those circumstances, were extremely difficult. Too much pleasure, and she might climax, ruining all the effort I put in to push her towards a climax. Any less, and her haze would disperse enough for her to wonder about the nature of the weird cylindrical object trying to wear down a path in the pristine valley between her breasts. </p><p>Previously pristine valley, if I were to be accurate, as the sensation from the situation, assisted by the effect of the massage oil that was having on me, was enough to push me towards a climax of my own. I pulled at the last second, spraying her breasts with my seed, but once again, it went unnoticed, probably dismissed as another dab of massage oil. Well, who was I to disappoint? I started spreading that on her breasts while continuing my not-so-kind massage. </p><p>[+1500 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Precariously Painted Peaks.

And while both stealth and ranged combat sounded like decent options, the applications of biomancy, even at the basic level, was too interesting to not to further that area further. </p><p>With that done, I once again focused on the busty beauty that was lying in front of me, waiting for an orgasm that was still far away. “It’s time to turn your back, mistress,” I said, as I had spent quite a bit of time with her beautiful breasts. Once again, it was time to focus on other areas. Even as I said that I dispelled the darkness ward, which surprisingly went unused. I couldn’t help but think about all the other implications it had. </p><p>It was amusing to see an expression of begging in her eyes as she pulled the towel away, but even more amusing was the conflict she felt, keeping her mouth closed, feeling unable to ask me to work a bit quicker. With a grumbling expression, she once again lay on her back, her bottom slightly up, indicating that she was ready for much more. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had to disappoint her. Instead of pushing her hard, I put my hands on the small of her back, caressing her body softly. Her moans didn’t take to rose, tainted by a pang of hunger I intended to let continue. I didn’t stay in the more secure areas forever, of course. Soon, my fingers were dancing between her lower cheeks, even caressing her puckered hole a bit. That temptation, I managed to resist; for tonight at least. </p><p>It didn’t take my fingers to drift down to her entrance, probing it softly for a moment before moving upwards to her clitoris, creating a few soft circles which tempted her with the promise of the finish line, a promise that turned out to be empty when I chose to slow down just as she was speeding up. </p><p>“Are you enjoying the massage, mistress,” I murmured. “It’s not to harsh for you, right?” </p><p>“No,” she murmured in a muffled voice. “Actually, I wouldn’t mind if you were a bit harsher,” she said. </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I said, and even as I said that, I pushed two of my fingers into her slit, while used my other hand to subject her bottom to a harsh, but pleasurable treatment. Her moans picked up speed, but I stayed limited. She started gasping soon after, stiffening under the anticipation for a final, but once again, it was false hope, as I chose that exact moment to slow down the treatment she was receiving. </p><p>“Faster,” she murmured a few more minutes later, but there was a desperation in her tone that I decided to take it as a warning. I risked her wrath if I decided to extend that edge play for more. This time, I didn’t bother to answer with words, just changed the pacing of my fingers from a gentle rub to a frantic push, her warm juices squeaking nicely. Under the sudden change of pacing, her climax took seconds to achieve. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>However, that was just the beginning of what I termed as the second phase. My fingers stayed inside her, slamming in mercilessly despite her rising frustration. But meanwhile, my other hand started traveling up once more, until it slid under her body and grabbed her breasts. </p><p>The resulting moan would be enough to bring a dead man back to life. Considering that, it shouldn’t be a surprise that my shaft jumped back to full hardness the instant my ears communicated that sound to my brain. I squeezed her breasts harder, enough to leave my mark, knowing that she could easily heal herself after the treatment. Soon, she was at the edge of arousal once more.  </p><p>I decided that it was the perfect time to experiment on my biomancy skill. Not only she was far too gone to notice the effects, but also I needed to improve it more. And what riskier situation than using that skill on a master of healing herself. I molded the mana carefully, in complete contrast to the frantic dance of my fingers, creating a temporary, but a complicated spell. I waited to a moment her moans were particularly loud, then let the magic spread onto her body. </p><p>[+3 Biomancy]</p><p>And from there on, there was only one way of testing whether the spell worked. I discarded the last bit of constraint that was keeping my fingers in control, subjecting her body the most intensive assault my enhanced body could sustain, my perception giving a real-time breakdown of her responses, while my precision and manipulation providing me with the best way to leverage these openings.</p><p>[+800 Experience] </p><p>Her moans rose to a point I hadn’t heard before, filled with pleasure and desperation, getting louder with each passing second. But, she didn’t climax, prevented by the nifty spell I managed to sneak in. </p><p>For a moment, I lamented the fact that I didn’t have the chance to pull back and watch her from afar, as she needed my constant attention to keep her in that hyper-sensitive state. Still, I couldn’t say that it was a big sacrifice, not when my fingers danced in her ever-flowing arousal, while the others sinking deep into her breasts freely without a word of protest. </p><p>She might be a bit slow to understand she was being played, but she was smart enough to realize there was something wrong with her state. “What’s going on,” she managed to slur in her dazed state. “I feel like I’m about to explode.” Luckily, it seemed that she was too distracted to muster the concentration for a magical assessment, which would put me a rather dangerous situation. </p><p>“It’s the effect of the second phase, milady,” I explained, while my hands still continued their tasks without skipping a beat. “It takes a while to end, but the effects are worth it.” Then, in a sudden hit of insight, I decided to change the play a bit. “But if you want, I can move onto the third phase. It’s a bit harsher in the application, but should work in a few minutes.”</p><p>“Do it,” she exclaimed, not for the first time, committing to a mistake under the effects of her arousal. Unfortunately for her, I had no intention to let it slip in a moment of mercy. With two fingers still inside her entrance, blasting mercilessly, my thumb found her puckered hole, and still slippery with massage oil, it didn’t take too much effort to slip inside. </p><p>“What are you-” she started, which soon turned into a helpless cry as I pushed more of my thumb into her hole, exploring another part of my discovery. </p><p>“The third phase, mistress,” I said even as I sped up the treatment even more. But I needed to push even more if I were to prevent her from raising an argument against it. For that, I made a quick change in plans, and pulled my hand from her breasts, and leaned down until my head was between her legs, my tongue out. </p><p>“You-” she started, but whatever she was about to say, died before she could utter a second word when my tongue found her slit, covered with her juices, and started beating it mercilessly. In her aroused state, her reactions were an open book, allowing me to optimize my approach pretty quickly. “Please-” she attempted once more, which collapsed soon after. </p><p>“The third phase is working amazing, mistress,” I said, pulling back for a moment before returning my attempts to get a full comprehension of her taste. “And if I may say, your taste is delicious.” That was a rather extreme thing to say, but I was also aware that I had pushed my disguise more than it could bear. It was time for my maid to disappear. </p><p>The third time she tried to open her mouth, I was even quicker to prevent. A second finger slipped into her asshole, which turned her attempt to a pained cry, as it was a rather untimely attempt from my part. But the pain was quickly drowned by pleasure if her reaction was any indicator.</p><p>I lost the track of time as I let myself under the control of my instincts, drilling her both holes at the same time, one with my tongue, one with my fingers, which soon turned into four, introducing her into anal play with a rather harsh lesson. I was distracted when a sudden explosion of a delicious aroma filled my tongue while she started to shudder so hard that, I would have thought that she was having a stroke if it wasn’t for my medical knowledge.  </p><p>[Achievement: Magnificent Massage.

I pulled back, and examined her body, covered with sweat, rocking, but it was nothing compared to her face, her haughty expression replaced by a pleasure-filled one that would compete against the best courtesans. </p><p>Still, there was the mystery of how she managed to climax. At first, I thought that the spell broke because I somehow constructed it wrong, but an examination showed that her pleasure reached to such a point that the spell failed to keep all of it back. And, since it was the last encounter maid Selena was going to have with her, what was the harm of having one last joke. I destroyed the spell, which flooded her system with a fresh dose of pleasure, enough to trigger another orgasm before even the first one subsided. </p><p>As she started rocking, edging unconsciousness, I leaned forward and whispered into her ear even as I grabbed her hair rather harshly. “I hope you enjoyed the third phase, mistress.” She tried to answer, but it was at that moment the unconsciousness overcame her, and she collapsed. </p><p>As I threw one last glance to her blemished body, I couldn’t help but pity losing my access. Unfortunately, I pushed my luck as much as I could. I quickly dressed and left, leaving her naked body sprawled on her bed, used and exhausted. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>I needed to find her maid, and explain about my ‘sudden transfer’, while also conveying her mistress’ strict orders about being left alone tomorrow in her room, with no one to enter. </p><p>I wanted Marianne to wake up used and exhausted, enough time to process what had happened.

    "content": "<p>The next couple of days passed in a surprising normalcy, especially considering I was a mercenary spy that had been tasked to infiltrate an ancient magical organization that employed supernatural warriors, not to mention I was supposed to do in a Thin Place, a location where the walls between dimensions had been damaged enough for all kind of creatures to enter. </p><p>But somehow, my first couple of days had passed, untainted by any of them. Boredom was good. It allowed me to learn a lot about the school, from the balance between various student clicks to the best places to hide a body if necessary. </p><p>I hadn’t completely avoided work in those two days of course. Why would I, when I had managed to identify the perfect target to infiltrate the inner circle of the Huntress? The same target that had been walking through the corridor with a great hurry to get the class on time, after one of her bullies delayed her by messing up her lock. </p><p>Making sure the bullies increased the pressure had been trivial. A whisper there, an offhand comment there, and suddenly several self-important girls, still annoyed in their failure to get Allison in their little group, decided to take it out of Emma, who managed what they failed. Not all of their plans were successful, I had been careful to dismantle several of their plans, always making sure Emma noticed my help while looking like I was trying to stay hidden, subtly building a basis for trust. I had been hoping that it would be enough for her to talk. </p><p>But apparently, she was too shy for it, hence the reason I was carefully waiting around the corner. I stepped forward just in time for her to yelp in panic, but not giving her enough time to stop, resulting in a text-book movie scene of sprawling books. “I’m sorry,” she exclaimed even as she tried to collect her juice-covered books -evidence of yet another bullying attempt-, though they were absent from her body. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s not a big deal,” I said, waving it off as I helped to collect her books, giving me an excellent opportunity to let our fingers touch. Her gaze darted upwards at that moment, a cute blush fighting against shock. “It’s you,” she murmured in surprise. </p><p>“How are you doing?” I answered. “Everything alright?” </p><p>“Y-yeah,” she stammered. I let my gaze slid towards her ruined books, just long enough to convey that I was aware of the real state of affairs, but avoided saying anything. “It’s a bit difficult,” she admitted readily, her social anxiety doing most of the work. </p><p>When I looked at her eyes, I had a deliberately-crafted expression of sincerity. “I understand that asking help is difficult,” I whispered her even as I gently grabbed her fingers, which made her blush hard. “But please, the next time you feel troubled, call my number. I promise that I’ll help.” </p><p>She stopped for a second, her expression turning into an unfamiliar seriousness as she looked for any hint of insincerity. Unfortunately for her, I was well-trained enough not to let anything slip. “I will,” she said even as she nodded gently, her blush intensifying further. </p><p>“See that you do,” I added even as I gently caressed her cheek before leaving, leaving her frozen behind. It was rather forward, but also necessary to break another barrier of intimacy between us. </p><p>But the real ploy happened during the evening, right after her Gym class, happy to see Emma staying behind as the rest of the class went to the locker room, clearly trying to avoid the crowd. A happy development for my side, because my plan wouldn’t have worked if she went inside with the rest of them. </p><p>Emma went in only after the rest of the girls left, and I sneaked a few minutes after, and stole all of her clothes. And to make things even more fun, I unlocked her phone using the password I had acquired earlier, and changed several of the recorded numbers, making sure that the people that she might call first, like Allison, had been replaced by a number that was going to ring busy. Then I left the locker room, ignoring the temptation to get a peek while she was in the shower. </p><p>It was almost fifteen minutes later when my phone rang. “H-hello,” said a stammering voice from the other side, her shyness thick enough to have its own physical presence. </p><p>“Emma,” I said in concern. “Is there something wrong?” </p><p>“Yeah,” she murmured, but stayed silent until I prompted her to continue. “Someone took my clothes, while I was in the locker room,” she said, then continued with a whisper that I was barely able to decipher. “Can you help me?” </p><p>“Sure, what do you need? Do you need me to reach someone,” I said. </p><p>“N-no. I can’t reach my friends, so probably they are too busy to reach,” she explained. I wasn’t surprised when she didn’t ask me to go to their houses, after all, what if her friends were busy with something supernatural. “Can you get me some clothes from the storeroom, there should be some leftover from the sports teams.” </p><p>“On it. Luckily, I’m still at school, so it shouldn’t take more than ten minutes.” Of course, that was unnecessary, as I already picked some clothes for her, carefully to make them quite a bit of fun. </p><p>Eight minutes later, I was knocking the door of the locker room. “Emma, it’s me, Rodnick, may I come in?” I called. </p><p>“A minute!” called a panicked cry from the inside, and I only entered after receiving the affirmation. Once entered, I noticed the distinctive hair of Emma, peeking from the corner, her blush visible despite the distance. She pulled back when she saw me, and yelled. “You can drop the clothes on one of the benches.\" </p><p>“Of course,” I called as I walked forward. “By the way, I’m sorry but these were the only ones that I was able to find, I hope they fit.” I know they wouldn’t, as I had carefully selected them to be barely enough to squeeze in, but still tight enough to look painted. After all, I didn’t her to just go back home after thanking. “I’ll be just outside if you need anything else.” </p><p>It wasn’t exactly shocking when Emma didn’t say anything for the next ten minutes, though I heard a couple of panicked gasps. “Is everything okay,” I called. </p><p>“Are you sure there was nothing else in the storage room.” </p><p>“Not sure,” I called. “I’m not exactly familiar with the layout, but I probably missed something. But are you dressed?” I said, not wanting to let the tension drain through several trips between the locker room and the storage. </p><p>“Y-yes, but-” she said, but I interrupted her explanation by opening the door, only to come to a sudden stop, an involuntary whistle escaped my lips. The reason, the way Emma was dressed, my selection creating a much better impact than I had been expecting. </p><p>Her usual clothes included loose jeans and oversized sweaters, making me think that a chubby and slightly misshapen body lay underneath these fashion monstrosities. But dressed in a tight white shirt and a short plied skirt, I could see that just how mistaken I had been. </p><p>She wasn’t thin by any sense of the word, but there was a huge difference between chubby and deliciously curvy, and she was firmly on the second camp. The white t-shirt stuck against her breasts, firm enough to stand deliciously curvy without a bra to support, a firmness she failed to hide completely even with both of her arms. The shirt was the correct length, but thanks to the extra curve forced in by her breasts, it was short enough to reveal a thin strip naked around her belly, showing a hint of muscle even, hinting some training with Allison. </p><p>Things in the bottom half were even more entertaining. The cheerleader skirt I had picked her was the correct size, but it didn’t help much when it was designed to be worn with tights underneath and fly with the slightest movement, therefore leaving her thighs completely naked for my viewing pleasure. And what a pleasure it was. </p><p>A shy gasp escaped her mouth as she realized I was frozen, examining her body, and in her panic, she had done something extremely ill-advised. She made a sudden turn, which made her cheerleader skirt rose just like it was designed to, giving me a fleeting view of her most secret place, a detail that she somehow missed in her chaotic state. </p><p>“Come on, Emma, you don’t have anything to be ashamed off,” I said with a tone that conveyed my appreciation, a statement that she didn’t react to. “We need to leave before the school is closed.” </p><p>“Maybe I should go to the library,” she said, her back still turned. </p><p>It wasn’t something I wanted, as it was the operating center of the Huntress Allison and her Handler, which would have ruined my plan. “If you think so, if you think you can handle facing the students currently studying there,” I said, reminding her that her friends wouldn’t be the only ones in the library. </p><p>“But using the bus while dressed like this would be even worse!” she exclaimed in panic, her posture slouching even further - which had the added benefit of pulling her skirt higher, once again giving a glimpse of her curvy ass, beautiful enough to deserve to be immortalized on a renaissance painting. </p><p>“You’re right. Why don’t I drop you at your house? It’ll be for the best.”</p><p>That was enough to turn her back once more, but this time, with a pleading expression on her face. “You would do that?” she asked hopefully, unaware that there were very few men in the world that had the willpower to reject a request from her while she was dressed like that. </p><p>“Why wouldn’t I,” I said with a shrug while keeping my eyes on her face. Earlier, I had shown her that I liked the way she looked, and now I was proving that I was gentlemanly enough to keep my gaze away from the spectacular view she had on display. “Let’s go, and I’ll walk in front of you to alert in case anyone walks by.” </p><p>“Thanks,” she whispered, her embarrassment burying anything else. She picked up her bag, but I took it from her, offering to carry it, and we started walking. Much to my displeasure, we didn’t come across anyone on our walk, which would have given me an excuse to hide in a closet, though the small distance between the door and my car was more than enough to compensate. </p><p>For once, the chilly weather stiffened her nipples until they were poking through the shirt rather distinctively. The second, in her hurry to reach the car, she was walking hurriedly, and her hands were on her skirt, trying to prevent an accident, but with limited success. Also, it left her breasts free to dangle with every step, a motion that was quite successful in convincing me to change my plans. </p><p>With her attention focused to minimize the flesh she was revealing, it wasn’t exactly a challenge to swipe her house keys. When we arrived at my car -a modest secondhand device, nice enough to run without an issue, beaten down enough to avoid attention- I stood at the passenger side, opening the door for her. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured as she stepped inside, her attention on her skirt to avoid any accidents, but failing to attain a complete success, giving me another small reward. When I took the driver’s side, her bag was already on her lap, preventing any more accidents, her arms crossed over her chest. </p><p>We started talking after she described the directions to her house. I kept the discussion on non-consequential topics, her hobbies and such, wanting to help her feel comfortable around me, and even then, she had trouble joining the discussion, still too overwhelmed. “By the way, did you checked whether you have your keys,” I reminded her. </p><p>“No,” her desolate reply came after a long and frantic digging through her bag. “What am I going to do!” </p><p>“Hey, no need to panic. How about if we stop somewhere so you can shop,” I offered. She looked shocked at the suggestion, but I continued like I didn’t notice. “I’m sure we can find something more fitting from my wardrobe, maybe an old sweatshirt or something. Or maybe we can drive down to your friend, and you can see whether they are at home, if you don’t mind being seen by the neighbors in those.” </p><p>The last part was enough to dissuade her from the last part, and we started driving. I stopped in front of a midscale brand, which was known more for their stylish evening wear. “Maybe we can drive down to another place,” she whispered. “This place is a bit out of my price range.” </p><p>“Nonsense, it’s my treat,” I cut her off, amused by the way her eyes grew. It was obvious that she wasn’t comfortable with the idea, but also, she lacked the personality to push back against my strong statement, especially after all the help I had been giving her. When I opened her door with a pointed look, the only thing she could have done was to stand up. “Feel free to go directly to the dressing cabin, I’m going to pick something for you,” I added, and she nodded. </p><p>Luckily for her, the store wasn’t exactly crowded. The saleswoman sent her a dissatisfied glare, not happy with the young woman dressed in a manner that was fit for a streetwalker, but Emma was already in the cabins before she could say anything, I waved off her concerns. Instead, I started walking around, picking a set of underwear for Emma. Luckily, thanks to her current clothes, I had a rather accurate idea about her size. </p><p>Now, I needed to convince her to try some fun ones… </p>",

    "content": "<p>It has been a week since the Head Librarian arrived. A week since I discarded my ranger identity, cutting away the most satisfying interaction that was available for me. A week since her indomitable presence destroyed any opportunity for a carnal encounter in the library for horny students, destroying my voyeur activities as well. While in the library, I stayed in my Mule personality all day, afraid of awakening the suspicion of her steely eyes. </p><p>I still didn’t know if Cornelia had managed to find another location for the encounter. I tried to find out, using subtle inquires while dressed as a maid, but until to date, I wasn’t able to find any solid evidence. Even Marianne didn’t call me, or more accurately, her faithful but dim maid Selena, for another bath, cutting that path as well. Meanwhile, Helga was always in the library, throwing herself on her studies with an enhanced fervor, trying to fight sadness through overworking. Luckily, with the Head Librarian in place, nobody dared to mess with Helga, afraid of getting the attention of Iron Lady. </p><p>The only benefit was I was able to maximize every skill I had, other than melee, which I picked accidentally during the middle of tasting Helga for the first time. I even made great strides in using my biomancy abilities, giving me the ability to heal myself, albeit slowly and with a significant mana cost, and making changes on my body and my face, enhancing my subterfuge capabilities even further. </p><p>I wasn’t able to increase my stats in any way though, which didn’t surprise me. There was no way that such an obvious thing hadn’t been tried before, and it would have created a big event if it actually worked like that. </p><p>But these weren’t the only thing I had done. For the first time since I had gained my powers, I strayed outside, scouting the surrounding areas of the Silver Halls, fighter and ranger part of the school. There was a large forest in that area, specifically for training purposes, consistently under high-level patrols to ensure that no dangerous monster lived there. It was even separated into several sections, each for a different level of capability. </p><p>For a week, I watched as the usage patterns, which hours were the busiest, how people gained admission, which parts people were allowed solo, and many other small details. Luckily, I had a lot of disguises for that. Thanks to all the improvements in my magical capabilities, I no longer needed a secluded area and several minutes to create a workable disguise. A second in a concealed area gave was enough for me to layer the illusions into an unbreakable structure that would pass the muster for any reasonable assessment. </p><p>Though scouting wasn’t the only thing I had done. I also managed to sneak into the storage room disguised as a servant, an unimportant one that held the broken equipment, too damaged to be worth the effort of repair. But I had an excess of mana, and after a few tries, I was in possession of a cheap set of well-maintained equipment. A chain mail complete with its helmet, a longsword, and to complete the set, a buckler. </p><p>I even managed to steal a used permission form before it was burned by the guards, allowing me to forge a fake one, giving me admission to the safest part of the forest, with the added exception that I was to be allowed there during both day and night. Very rarely there was anyone in the forest during the night, as with the limited vision greatly increased the risk of an ambush from one of the monsters. And during the night, there was no guarantee that a stronger monster hadn’t infested the forest.  </p><p>Under the right circumstances, even a class one monster could kill someone that it was supposedly harmless against. I hoped that my high perception, supported by a proximity ward, would be enough to offset the disadvantages. After all, going there during the day, a time where it was crawling with students hoping to farm a few more experience points to get another level, was not an option. I couldn’t afford the risk of getting caught.  </p><p>I walked into my room, and a servant, carrying a large sack left the room. Another stop in a dark corner, and a young warrior continued his way, a sword on his belt, a buckler on his arm, his shining sword and his proud look all shouting a green warrior with little experience. A common view, as many minor houses had spent minor fortunes to get them in the Silver Halls, who then walked around like they were at the king of the world until they angered someone strong, teaching the difference between the pretenders and the real deal. </p><p>For my current purposes, unlikeable and easily forgettable worked just fine. Just to enhance the impression, I even used by biomancy to temporarily reduce my height a couple of inches, loose clothes hiding my muscles, weakening the personality I reflected even more. </p><p>At the entrance of the forest, I passed the permission to the guard wordlessly, distinctly turning my nose up to them, following the finest noble tradition, and then walked into the forest. I walked into the shadowy part of the forest, without a light source with me, hoping that two moons shining in the sky, one full, the other half, making it bright enough for me to see around, though not as much as without the crimson light of the third one. </p><p>I maintained my pompous walk until there were several trees between me and them, cutting off the path, then dropped my pompous walk, replaced by a soft prowl, the sword in hand, but also ready to send a blast of pure magic if things get dicey. Just to keep things extra safe, I established a proximity ward around, preventing sneak attacks. </p><p>My luck seemed to be working, because the first monster that I met was a dire rabbit, a class zero creature that was two feet tall and four feet long, relying on its agility and stealth to do the job, as it lacked any other quality. One of the best targets for leveling for the weaker people, as especially during the day, on an open field, it was one of the easiest threats to handle. Its teeth, longer than three inches, was a big threat, but it was just a bad matchup against me. It jumped at me from behind, but I was much faster, and pushed my sword to its threat halfway.</p><p>[+1 Melee]</p><p>Realistically, I wasn’t expecting any experience, but I wouldn’t be sad if something had changed and I received some. Not that I really needed it, as even if everything had been normal, even a class one creature would have given me a couple of points of experience at best at my current level, and a for class zero one like a dire rabbit, even one experience was unlikely. That was how classification worked. If a creature killed gives a hundred experience to a level five slayer, it was categorized as class five, and if a level seven received a hundred experience, it was classified as class seven. </p><p>But it was extremely hard to push through higher levels, because not only more experience was needed to advance higher levels, but also the monsters got stronger faster than their class might indicate at first glance. A level three warrior could kill a class three creature without a low chance of dangerous injury under equal circumstances, but it was reverse for a class ten. The monster would win nine out of ten fair battles, most without a considerable damage. </p><p>That was one of the reasons nobles were almost only ones that were able to push through level ten, and only the major noble families had the resources to push their members over twenty without excessive risks, supporting their hunt with a small army, though only if they were lucky enough to have members with a level cap over twenty. It wasn’t unheard that a noble family to collapse in a generation, because lady luck decided to give them a generation limited to single digits. No matter the support structure, it was hard to maintain a strong estate by a bunch of level sevens.  </p><p>I was distracted by another dire rabbit assault, which was a bit surprising, because they weren’t really smart, they usually avoided people with bloodied swords. Still, it took just a slash to destroy it. I might be just a beginner in sword fighting, but I had ten points in both agility and precision, meaning a class one creature was nothing more than an excuse to practice my technique. </p><p>Encouraged by the effectiveness, I started moving deeper and deeper into the forest, killing dozens of dire rabbits, but didn’t bother picking anything off them, because they were effectively worthless, even their meat was horrible, only consumed by peasants in times of hardship. There were a lot of those rabbits and they bred quickly, which was the only reason of their continuing survival. Their females gave birth each week, with their litter reaching full size in a few weeks. With that numbers, it wasn’t hard to imagine them actually invading the world without other monsters hunting them for sustenance.</p><p>As I moved deeper into the forest, I had to fight a few dire foxes, class two monsters quite a bit more dangerous than dire rabbits. For once, they had teeth long and sharp enough to kill a low level warrior if caught unprepared, but also they had a rudimentary understanding of tactics, using foilage and other physical objects to sneak before covering the last dash. Unfortunately, the proximity ward turned their effort into a waste, and they fell to a swing or two. That rhythm, I maintained for almost an hour, with a rather decent return in terms of skill. </p><p>[+7 Melee]</p><p>Just as it happened with my magical skills, it was impressive just how a few skill points changed everything about the way I fought. My swings flew sharpers, my stances more balanced, my timing more precise. </p><p>I was planning to extend my expedition, but then a rather impressive figure passed nearby, quite a bit over six feet, and carrying a sword even taller, its enchantment thick enough to be felt . But not even for a moment, I had though it was a man. She wore a shirt instead of armor, and even though it was a loose, shapeless shirt, it failed to hide her rather impressive bosom. </p><p>But she swung her great sword with an amazing expertise, suggesting that she was either had a very high level, or was lucky enough to get a specialized combat skill. Melee allowed its user to master a lot of weapons, but sword mastery was obviously superior in terms of effect at the same skill point. There was no exact calculation on it, but approximately, expert melee provided the same benefits as advanced sword mastery, meaning that it wasn’t very preferable. Luckily, while I picked melee accidentally, it fit to my situation much better. </p><p>I needed to sit on my place, but I couldn’t help but feel intrigued as she cut through the small and medium sized creatures, not even stopping for a breath. But then she disappeared between the trees, and I decided to return. While following a sexy warrior strong enough to kick ass was a tempting idea, she was noisy enough to get the attention of the others, and the last thing I needed was someone trying to talk to me in this disguise. </p><p>I left the forest, and after another break, I was once again a servant carrying a huge sack. When I arrived back to my room, I was planning to dress back to my unloved library assistant identity, but a note slipped under the door, from Marianne’s maid, asking Selene’s help to prepare another bath. </p><p>“It was about time,” I murmured with excitement as I quickly dressed into my female disguise. I was starting to worry that I had pushed Marianne too much during our last session. I found the old maid in the storage room, boiling the herbal water, and after a quick talk, once again I sent her for an early night, promising to tend Marianne for the rest of the night. </p><p>I had some very interesting ideas on how to tend her. </p><p>After two repeats, preparing the bath required no thought, especially since the completely mastered arcana and subterfuge increased my capabilities much more. I even had a reasonably convinced that my illusionary disguise would hold naked unless she started to get handy. As while I could hide my manhood from her eyes, but illusions didn’t work on touch. But I wasn’t worried about that, as I doubted Marianne would have any concerns on somehow making a servant to feel good. It was all about her pleasure, well to her knowledge, at least. </p><p>I walked to her bedroom after finishing the preparations in the bath, only to find her sitting on the bed, wearing just a dressing gown, loose enough to reveal that it was the only piece of clothing on her. A book was in her hand, but I was familiar with her expression enough to recognize she wasn’t paying attention to it. Combined with the restless tapping of her feet, it suggested some interesting things. “The bath is ready, mistress.” </p><p>[+60 Experience]</p><p>The notification I just received was very good news. Not because it gave me a lot of bonus, but it told me that Marianne was higher level than Helga, meaning I would still receive complete reward for my efforts. </p><p>“About time,” she said, quite a bit louder than necessary, but surprisingly, it wasn’t an angry exclamation, which would be the emotion I would have expected to see in a spoiled noble girl bored while waiting. But then she started to walk quite bit faster than the usual, uncaring of the way the front of her dressing gown sliding open even further, it gave me a better idea about the reason for her touchiness. </p><p>It seemed that Cornelia failed to find an alternative location for their private encounters. </p><p>Excellent, I thought as she opened her arms, and I freed her body from her robe, leaving her in her birthday suit, and she walked towards the bath with the same hurry she displayed earlier. I followed her in the same pace, so when she sank into the bubbly water, I was in my usual place behind her, with the bath glove in my hand. </p><p>Her arousal was palpable, begging for me to mess with her like the previous time, making her suffer under a slow tease. But that would be too easy. After our last encounter I had gained a new skill, and I couldn’t wait to test it on her. </p><p>Under normal circumstances, trying to use a biomancy spell on her would be a horrible idea. She was famous for her prowess with healing magic, which made her uniquely qualified to detect my manipulations on her body, however weak they were. But unfortunately for her, two facts worked against her. She didn’t expect any magic from a poor maid, doing her best to help her mistress; and more importantly, arousal had a tendency to make her distracted. After all, she managed to miss how I had been pleasuring myself in her rather plump bottom the last time. </p><p>With decision made, my attention back on my job. After the progress of the last time, I didn’t spend much time on washing her arms or her neck, and quickly moved onto her shoulders, rubbing them with wide back and forth moves that allowed me plenty of contact with her breasts, touching them just the way she liked, something I had ample opportunities to learn. </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>And her moans suggested that she enjoyed my ‘accidental’ touches quite a bit. I continued in the same vein, each move allowing me to move deeper and deeper onto her chest, her moans getting louder and louder. It was clear that she stopped trying to hold her moans back, which made sense after the way our last encounter ended. Why should she feel self-conscious about a few little moans after I had finger-banged her into multiple orgasms. </p><p>But her obvious arousal gave me the opportunity to test my expanded magical abilities. Carefully, I have molded some mana, and cast a spell on her to increase her sensitiveness, a spell that I invented by reversing the working principals of a painkiller spell. The intelligence boost from my latest achievement worked wonders, allowing me to successfully apply the tricks I had learned from Helga. </p><p>No matter how measured, I was still taking a significant risk, so when instead of an angry shout, another moan left Marianne’s mouth, I realized that my spell had successfully affected my target. Powered by the realization, I let the glove to slip away from my hand, and started caressing her breasts with both hands, throwing away the pretense of helping her to bathe. </p><p>“Yes, squeeze them harder!” Marianne murmured with a great fervor, signaling her enjoyment of the choice. Encouraged by her response, I sank my fingers in the depths of her breasts, increasing the enjoyment we both received from the situation. I couldn’t help but smirk as my fingers sank deeper and deeper into her large globes, finally fulfilling one of my dreams. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>I certainly hadn’t been expecting her to start shuddering with a surprise orgasm. I either miscalculated the effects of the spell, or her breasts were even more sensitive than my wildest hopes. Regardless of the reason, it was a positive surprise, so I moved to the other side of the bath while she trembled silently, enjoying the aftershocks of her orgasm. </p><p>It wasn’t a spectacular orgasm when compared to the others she experienced after the extended edge play she had enjoyed -and suffered- the last time, so her recovery didn’t take long. But when she opened her eyes, I was already rubbing her feet dutifully. </p><p>“You’re really good at this,” she commented even as she leaned back, after everything, uncaring that it revealed the white skin of her breasts, marred red by my enthusiastic massage. </p><p>“Thank you, mistress,” I said in a fake obedience, my eyes on the ground, which also helped to hide my smirk. A good thing, as my smirk conveyed an unmistakable sense of dark satisfaction which would have jolted her out of her dazed state. “My previous mistress was really diligent on baths and massages, and she taught me well.” </p><p>“She should be proud, you have magic hands,” Marianne said, unaware of the literal truth she had stumbled upon. I continued her massage, and soon, her moans started to increase. </p><p>“Thank you mistress,” I repeated. “You honor this little servant with your kind words.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” she said, followed by another moan. “It’s nothing less than you deserve. Actually, I’m going to tell Griselda to give you a silver coin, for your discretion and your exemplar services.” </p><p>Once again, I thanked her with the appropriate glee of a servant who just managed to get a small fortune. But I found her referring to my discretion interesting. It seemed that after that fateful massage, she spooked enough to check the maid gossip network. I was lucky that she didn’t went any deeper, because it would have revealed the non-existence of a maid named Selene, forcing me to throw away yet another identity. Not a huge deal on the larger scheme of the things, unless the worst somehow happened and she managed to trace it back to me, but still inconvenient. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t a concern for now, not that it meant that she would escape the punishment she just earned. She managed to worry me, even if just for a moment, and there should be a cost attached to it… </p><p>“Should I continue, mistress,” I murmured. “Or would you like to receive another massage. Maybe we can even move into the second phase.” </p><p>That managed to jolt her out of her relaxed state. “The second phase?” she murmured in shock. “You’re telling me that the previous one  wasn’t the complete massage.” </p><p>“No mistress, I had to cut it short because you were feeling exhausted. But I can show the rest of it as well if you’re in the mood.” </p><p>She chose to stand in the bath in lieu of an answer, then stepped out of the bath while I dashed out, towel ready. She opened her arms, fully displaying her nakedness while I dried herself quickly. She didn’t even bother to wrap the towel around herself, and started to walk towards her room, completely naked, the dance of her hips spectacular. </p><p>[+400 Experience]</p><p>It was going to be fun… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 8        Experience: 32900 / 36000 </p><p>Strength: 6    Charisma: 14</p><p>Precision: 10    Perception: 10</p><p>Agility: 10    Manipulation: 12</p><p>Speed: 7       Intelligence: 12</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 328 / 328    Mana: 510 / 520             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (50/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [50/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech 25/25</p><p>Basic Biomancy 25/25    </p><p>Basic Melee 8/25        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was walking in the library, once again dressed in my least favorite disguise, made worse by the fact that technically, it was my real identity, trying to look busy. I had been expecting to have a casual walk around the library while waiting for the workday to end, hoping that Marianne would call her new ‘maid’ for another massage session, or failing that, deciding to have another encounter with Cornelia in the library. But my plans went awry in an unwelcome manner when the assistant of the head librarian burst into the opening, and started raining orders with great urgency. </p><p>“What’s going on,” asked one of the others, unhappy with the sudden intrusion. </p><p>“I tell you what’s going on,” he shouted. “I learned that she is coming back tomorrow.” No one asked who he was referring, the underlining terror in his voice could only refer to one person. The head librarian, one of the most famous war heroes of the Empire, and the undisputed ruler of the library, was coming back. And everyone knew that they would be on the hook if there was even one thing that was out of order in the library. </p><p>It wasn’t hard to slip away in the chaos, as no one would remember to look for me as they burst into a flurry of activity, some for cleaning the floors, the others to make sure the books were in the correct order. It wasn’t hard to understand why. The head librarian had no mercy when it came to any disruption in her domain, and if something was out of place, the staff would be on the hook for it. </p><p>But even as I faded away, I had to fight against disappointment. Because with her arrival, not only I would have to throw away my ranger identity, afraid of being caught, but also Cornelia would no doubt stop her library adventures. Arrogant she was, but not enough to intrude into the head librarian’s domain, especially in such a vulgar manner. Even her family couldn’t have saved her from the consequences. </p><p>An important detail started to worm itself into my mind. I needed to talk with Helga before I shelved my ranger identity for good. While silently disappearing would have no cost to me, it didn’t sit right to me to leave Helga waiting desperately for Orlin to appear. I owed her enough to explain it to her. </p><p>This time, I was careful to pick and even more secluded corner to put on my disguise, in case one of the frenzied library workers dropped in. I even put a simple proximity ward as a safety measure. While doing that, I couldn’t help but wonder just how easily I could control the mana flow to form a ward, not even needing to use an anchor. Another evidence of just how important the skills were. Without them, I doubted I could replicate that feat without months of dedicated study, and even then, it was in doubt. </p><p>The same applied to the magical parts of my disguise. Just a moment’s concentration was enough to put the spell on, something I was sure that even a master of arcana couldn’t replicate easily, because the magical ability was just a part of creating magical disguises. Shaping them was a significant part of the challenge, and thankfully, my subterfuge skill was ready to assist me in that area. </p><p>But just as I was about to put the last touches in my illusionary disguise, an exhausted look, I remembered arcana wasn’t my only magical skill anymore. I carefully gathered my mana, just a dash of it, and spread it into my body, to look like I was exhausted. </p><p>[HP -20]</p><p>A pained yelp escaped my mouth as I lost control of the spell. Apparently, experimenting with an unfamiliar spell while targeting myself was unwise. Who could have guessed? </p><p>While it was tempting to play around to get it right, I was rather short on time, so once again, I went back to my illusion skills to give the impression that I was slightly exhausted, then dashed towards the last location I had seen Helga. </p><p>Luckily, she was still at the last place I had left her, a book open in front of her. She didn’t look like she was paying attention though, the dreamy look on her face suggested her mind was on something other than the dusty tome open in front of her. From her rather persistent blush, and her shy smile, I could make an accurate guess about her dreams. </p><p>Unfortunately, I needed to break her from her happy daydreams. I walked into the opening. Helga looked up, distracted by my sudden intrusion. When she saw me, she smiled at first, then noticed my haphazard state. “Orlin, is something wrong?” </p><p>“Yeah,” I answered as I walked near her, but didn’t bother sitting next to her. “I have just talked with the caravan master. We’re going to leave early morning, tomorrow.” </p><p>Helga said nothing, but her hand, clamping onto mine, tight enough to actually hurt despite the obvious difference in strength and endurance, conveyed her desperate sadness more than words could. I sat on the seat next to her, allowing her to process the situation. At least, I owed her that much. There was no hiding the tears that were slipping from her eyes. “So soon,” she murmured minutes later, a whisper so low that it required me to stretch my enhanced hearing to the maximum to catch a glimpse of it. </p><p>I gently caressed her hair and pulled her to my chest, which made spill her tears even faster. I could understand where she was coming from. Like me, she was alone for years in the Silver Tower, but unlike my previous state, she had an understanding of what that loneliness meant. </p><p>“Unfortunately, things end,” I murmured. “Being nomads give us a different understanding of relationships. In our tribe, we don’t measure the relationships based on its longevity, because we never know whether we would survive enough to meet again. We believe everything is valued by the impact it created, feelings it awakened, and memories that remained. And what we have a beautiful one.” </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>My words only made her cry harder, but it wasn’t a bad thing. Instead, I let her continue to cry as she got louder and louder, trying to process the shock. It was the most emotional I saw her being, which told me that my actions might have larger impacts than I might have thought. It wasn’t enough to change anything in my master strategy, but maybe some little tweaks were necessary. </p><p>My self-inspection didn’t survive for long. She started kissing me without a warning, pulling my attention back to the present in a memorable manner. This time, I followed her rhythm, my arms gently wrapped around her neck. She deserved that much consideration. The kiss stretched for a long while, conveying everything she wanted to say but couldn’t find the words for.</p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Sensual Sendoff. A beautiful, emotional kiss that conveys feeling after an emotional farewell talk. +300 Experience, +2 Charisma]</p><p>When she pulled away from the kiss and jumped up on her feet, I thought that she had been overwhelmed with emotions and wanted to get away. And when she started walking away, it seemed that my assumption was correct. At that moment, I decided to let her go, allowing her to process the departure however she wished. The least I could do after the bastardy I had subjected her to. </p><p>But two steps later, I realized that she was still holding my hand, trying to pull me along. In a rare development, I was stuck in place, surprised by the sudden development. “Come on, let’s walk,” she said as she tugged her hand once more, a sudden determination on her face overcoming sadness in her tear-streaked face. </p><p>“Where,” I couldn’t help but ask. </p><p>“A hidden place, to make a memory both of us would remember fondly forever, one that would burn bright in our memories,” she said. That clued me what was about to happen, and I followed her. It didn’t take long for me to recognize the path we were taking. Ironically, to the same location Cornelia had subjected her to the bondage. </p><p>While we walked, I could feel her casting several spells, each targeting her own face. When she next turned to me, at the same opening I watched her resist Cornelia’s crop to get scraps of information as a reward, her face was clean, tear tracks and redness gone, replaced by a soft make-up. A utilitarian application of magic, I took note in amusement for a moment, before she clamped on my lips once more, this time with a lot of tongue, promising passion and desire… </p><p>When she pulled back for a moment, I didn’t think that she had changed her mind, because I could feel her gathering magic in the familiar shape of a proximity ward, which she established in a speed that would surpass mine, but not with a great margin, which gave me confidence that I was finally showing some decent improvement in my magical abilities. </p><p>But constructing wards weren’t the only thing she was doing. She used one of her hands to create shapes into the air in temporary anchors, while the other danced over the buttons of her robe, determined to free her body from its restrictive cover. As a gentleman, I did the kind thing and followed her lead, my cloak and shirt meeting with the floor at the same time with her robe. </p><p>She licked her lips with lust as she examined my chest, its tanned looks a part of the illusion I had set up, but the muscles were all real, another gift of my enhanced stats. I waited until she completed the second ward, ensuring not a wisp of sound would escape its confines. Meanwhile, I carefully examined the hidden spots which I used earlier to great benefit, ensuring that they were empty. </p><p>When the construction of the ward finished, she jumped at me with a palpable desire, throwing her shirt away, revealing a utilitarian corset underneath. Her body deserved something sexier, but I didn’t make it a problem. After all, it wasn’t going to stay on for long. </p><p>She hit my body with great speed, but I was ready, and it didn’t even shake me. Her legs wrapped around my waist to keep her afloat while her lips met with mine with a desire that surpassed even her previous kiss. Her grip around my waist was tight enough to keep her in place without slipping, and her arms were around my neck for further support, but nevertheless, I placed my hands on her bottom. </p><p>Purely to help her, of course. What ulterior motive could I have in putting my hands into her plump bottom? And if my hands had slipped under her skirt while doing that, I could guarantee that it was an accident. </p><p>But as our tongues battled for supremacy, one of my hands decided to get a solo adventure. It climbed upward until it found the strings that kept her corset together, and pulled them open one by one, in a sensuous pace that contrasted greatly with her frantic kisses, every little caress on a recently freed section of her back increasing her pace further, something I was happy to match. </p><p>Her corset stayed in place even after it was completely untied, pinned in place between our pressing bodies. Something I wanted to find a solution. In the end, I decided to stick with the basics, and slipped my hand into her short hair, and pulled her head back. A moan escaped her mouth as she pulled back, and her corset slid away, finally revealing her beautiful breasts on my reach.</p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p> I decided to do what the situation begged me to do, and buried my face in her bosom, generous in size and nakedness, enjoying the warmth of her skin most intimately. That close, I could hear her heartbeat, but frankly, I found the prospect of testing the softness of her breasts more interesting, especially after seeing their gravity-defying achievement to stay up. My hands were busy, but my lips were still available for the test, so I clamped around her breast, extracting a moan of her. A cry left her mouth when my teeth joined the test, but it didn’t exactly convey unhappiness. </p><p>“They are amazing,” I murmured in astonishment as I pulled back for a moment. My compliment worked wonders on her face, her arousal pushing away the last scraps of hesitance. </p><p>Even as I captured her lips once more, I took a step towards the nearest shelf, and pushed her until her back pressed tightly against it, just enough to allow her to loosen the grip of her legs without losing the position. </p><p>But then, I realized one thing, that I needed to break off the kiss to ask her to loosen her legs, so that I could remove her skirt. Luckily, there was an easier way. I grabbed the zipper, and pulled it down, and when it reached the bottom, I continued pulling, but created a small ethereal blade, a trick that had been taught by the same busty blonde that was currently coiled around me, and cut rest of the distance. </p><p>Her skirt fell on the floor, followed by her panties just a moment later. She must have hated it, because the next second, she took revenge, grabbing a hold of my pants, and melting both it and my underwear in a superior display of magic. Something I could do, but not based on the capability I revealed to her. She pulled back, a smug smile on her lips, finding a rather amusing amount of pride in her achievement.</p><p>Though her smugness melted into a panic when I shifted her a bit, aligning my shaft to her entrance. “Are you sure?” I asked her, giving her the choice, something she deserved to have under the circumstances. It didn’t take long for her to construct her determination from the uneven stones of panic. </p><p>No answer left her mouth, but then again, it wasn’t really necessary, not when she restarted our kiss while choosing to lower herself, my shaft sliding into her wetness, I couldn’t help but moan in pleasure, as it was a sensation I had never tasted before. She lowered herself until her barrier prevented the passage, which then I destroyed with a sharp push. </p><p>She was mine! </p><p>[+2500 Experience] </p><p>[Achievement: Salacious Study. Take the virginity of a sexy bookworm in the second biggest library of the world. +1000 Experience, +4 Intelligence]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Basic Observation, Advanced Biomancy, Basic Melee] </p><p>Normally, the impressive gains of the system would have garnered significant amount attention from me, especially the skill selection, not to mention the library of the Silver Tower being the second biggest library was a very intriguing detail with a lot of implications, it was supposed to be the biggest one. But there was a limit to my patience, and having a sexy bookworm on my lap, determinedly pushing herself even deeper onto my shaft, giving me a tour of her untouched territory definitely registered as one. My attention wavering, I blindly picked the last skill on the list, and then turned my attention to more important topics. </p><p>Such as, giving my favorite blonde the best experience of her life. Carefully reading her expression, I helped her to raise herself back up, her walls, unfamiliar to a foreign presence, trying to squeeze me to death, but only managing to make the experience even more pleasurable. Our kiss oscillated between sensual sweetness and burning passion rapidly enough to give me a whiplash, but it made the moment even more special. </p><p>I pulled back to get a better view of her expression, which was a delicious mixture of pain and arousal as she wrapped her arms tighter around my neck, trying to push herself even deeper in her determination, trying to devour my shaft. I decided to help her a bit, and pushed my hips upward in a sharp motion, forcing myself deeper despite her tightness. </p><p>A pained yelp escaped her mouth, but there was no hiding the fact that she enjoyed the sensation immensely. And since her back was still against the shelf enough to provide extra support, there was no point in keeping my hands on her hips, while they could be assigned for more fruitful tasks. I grabbed her breasts, and squeezed them mercilessly. From everything I had seen, it wasn’t unfair to say that her tastes fell on the rougher side. Whether it was about her personality, or it was an effect of her deal with Cornelia, I didn’t know. Nor I had time to ponder, because the next notification the system gave me. </p><p>[+150 Experience] 25% experience penalty due to level equality with the target  </p><p>That was unfortunate, I thought, using the full extent of my willpower to not to mutter those words loudly, as that way, ridiculous misunderstandings lay. The fact that I had limits on the experience gain was unwelcome, though made sense. Otherwise, there was nothing preventing me from being locked into a room with any random woman, and quite a bit of food and water, to infinitely grind level. </p><p>But once again, I shelved the thought, focusing on the delicate art of pleasure, my sole target being the sexiness wrapped around my presence. I rocked back and forth inside her, each push loosening her further, allowing me to slide deeper and deeper. Soon, she pushed her weight against the shelf, enjoying my presence with her eyes closed. I used the opportunity to enjoy her curvy body, covered by a thin sheen of sweat, her heartbeat strong enough to make her chest ripple… </p><p>She was beautiful. </p><p>I shifted my hands back to her hips, this time, not to keep her up, but to align her perfectly before attempting a total invasion. She moaned painfully even as her eyes jerked open, but her only response to connect for another kiss, our tongues battling once more. Even when the frequency of my pushes increased, she kept the kiss connected, though the twirls of her tongue getting more and more desperate. It wasn’t hard to recognize the signals of an impending orgasm. </p><p>When she clamped around me without a warning, my only reaction was to wrap my arm around her waist. Once again I walked while carrying her around my waist, but this time, each step moved my girth inside her, which, combined with her arousal, making her cry so loudly that I feared about whether the silencing ward would be able to hold her presence. </p><p>[+750 Experience] 25% Penalty!</p><p>I actually stopped for a moment to check the ward, but her magical abilities proved strong enough to match her sexiness, so I continued my walk, each step creating another explosion of pleasure for her. Then, I sat on the table, with her still on my lap, giving her the control of the situation. </p><p>I was surprised when she started jumping up and down on my lap with a reckless abandon, surprising me with her display of initiative. For some reason, I was expecting her to be more hesitant when the situation was left to her control, but I was no way dissatisfied. Her hips moved faster with each repeat, like she was testing her rapidly expanding limits, and the sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the opening. </p><p>In her hurry, it didn’t take long for her to start trembling with another climax, her eyes clouded with pleasure. Once again I wrapped my arms around her waist, this time pushing her on the table, pushing into her franticly, as I could feel my own climax closing in. </p><p>I impaled her again and again, watching her pleasure-filled face, subtly changing with each repeat, while her walls wrapped me snugly. It was truly heaven. It was a pity that I hadn’t had any more time with her, that I needed to disappear after today. And even for this session, it was obvious that she was drowning under the effects of the unfamiliar pleasure. Another orgasm, I thought that she might handle, but anymore, and I wasn’t sure that she could return back to her room, which would create a scandal that neither of us could handle. </p><p>With that in mind, I didn’t resist the sensation to explode when she tightened with a third orgasm, though I managed to pull out, spraying her spectacular breasts with my seed, not wanting to leave her filled with my seed. With an endurance of eight, I wasn’t willing to bet on chance of not impregnating her. </p><p>[+1500 Experience] 25% Penalty!</p><p>I sat on the chair, trying to catch my breath as I watched her trembling in pleasure, fighting against unconsciousness, while I fought against the temptation of sliding inside her once more. </p><p>She managed to push herself to a sitting position, and captured my lips in one last, lingering kiss, one surprisingly somber considering what had just happened. “Go,” she murmured. “I want to stay inside your memory like this, in all my exhausted glory.”</p><p>“As you wish, beautiful,” I said, and stood up, but before leaving, captured her lips for one last lingering kiss, promising that I would remember her. I knew that it wasn’t honest, but at least, she would have the special memory of our first time for an eternity… I pulled my shirt on, and created the illusion of a pant before leaving the opening. “Goodbye,” I whispered, then disappeared in the depths of the library…  </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 8        Experience: 31140 / 36000 </p><p>Strength: 6    Charisma: 14</p><p>Precision: 10    Perception: 10</p><p>Agility: 10     Manipulation: 12</p><p>Speed: 7       Intelligence: 12</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 308 / 328    Mana: 460 / 520             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (48/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [45/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech 25/25</p><p>Basic Biomancy 16/25    </p><p>Basic Melee 0/25        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Standing in front of the gate for Central High School, I was having trouble believing that I was going to spend my whole year there. It had been years since I had done any full-time education, and even then, it was hardly conventional. While it was normal for an eighteen-year-old boy to not wanting to the school due to a range of reasons, be it boredom or bullying, my reason was rather unique.</p><p>And it was about the state of the disrepair the school was in -though it was a small miracle it passed a health inspection to allow it to function as a school. The garden was an unpleasant mess, filled with trash and occasional debris, and the building itself was littered with patches of broken paint, shattered windows, even occasional scorched spot; carefully created to give the impression of out-of-control gang warfare, though not well enough to trick me. Still, most of the details were actually correct, suggesting that gang warfare was just a front for something more. </p><p>Something more sinister, something more dangerous… </p><p>Something supernatural… </p><p>Funnily enough, even the presence of deadly supernatural dangers wasn’t the source of my reluctance. After all, I couldn’t have done my job with distinction if I was afraid of a short tumble with an extra-dimensional demon or an eldritch abomination strong enough to pop my head like a grape. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to work as a troubleshooter/spy for a shady governmental agency. It was a tough job without a certain disregard for mortal danger after all. </p><p>No, my reason for not liking the assignment was simpler. I didn’t want to be stuck to the same location for a whole year. Boredom was one aspect of it, but more importantly, holding a stationary position meant that instead of ambushing my targets like I was used to, I was going to be the one being ambushed. </p><p>Moreover, for all my achievements, it wasn’t my combat skills that allowed me to get the position. No, I was there, because I was the only spy in the agency under twenty-five, meaning I was the only one with a realistic chance to integrate the situation with a subterfuge. Apparently, teachers were a much more difficult cover story, enough that the last two attempts had failed, rather spectacularly, even. </p><p>One would think that infiltrating a shitty school shouldn’t be trouble for an organization that, for all intents and purposes, was a spying bureau. Unfortunately, the school was under observation by another organization, the Council of Nine. Not only it was older than his own nascent organization, or even older than almost all countries, but also they had access to several supernatural resources. Through both, it was trivial for them to set up background checks for teachers deep enough to catch any irregularity on the carefully-prepared backgrounds of the spies. </p><p>I was here basically as a bet that they weren’t extending the same resources for every single student, likely betting on the fact that anyone without decades of training wouldn’t be really useful in here, something that couldn’t be attained by someone that was yet to enter his third decade in life without a supernatural trait, something that would be quite easy to detect through scrying spells. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, I was quite unique. </p><p>But consideration on the extraordinary development of my skill set had fallen wayside when my attention was grabbed by a particularly striking young lady, prowling the corridor like she owned it, briefly pausing riposte the verbal jab from another girl who had dressed in a stylish manner that shouted rich girl, sexy enough to hold my attention if it wasn’t for my target. </p><p>I knew the name of the prowling girl from the extensive mission dossier. Her name was Alicia Turner, and she had a pretty normal background for most of her life. An average student whose poor grades more about her lack of focus rather than ability, her above-average athletic abilities applied to get a position on the cheerleading team. A divorced family, custody taken by her mother, with a big sister three years older than her spending most of her time in college. In other words, a completely ordinary background. </p><p>That all changed three years ago, where a confusing police report about her beating two homeless attackers to death with her bare hands; a police report that had disappeared just a few minutes after it had been registered, and soon after, Alicia had fallen off the grid, only to appear three months later, as a student of Central High School, a place with a suspicious number of disappearances, including death of another female student just days before Alicia’s transfer, who had a suspiciously similar background in terms of disappearing police reports and sudden bouts of violence. Rather suspicious. </p><p>Of course, for the people with access to the supernatural world, there was a simpler explanation. Alicia was a Huntress, a part of the supernaturally enhanced female warriors, with a special aptitude to remove threats that the public wasn’t aware of. Of course, the exact details of their powers, their endowment process, or other limits were mostly unknown to anyone other than the Council of Nine, who had the monopoly in managing and leading these warriors in their long and shrouded history. </p><p>I was here to penetrate that mystery. </p><p>Though not only for that, I decided. I would be lying that if I was going to keep my penetrating activities limited to mysteries surrounding her. Seeing her pictures was one thing, but observing her as she walked the corridors with all the grace of a tigress, the tightness of her jeans revealing the shape of her fit hips that nevertheless didn’t give a true hint of the power that was hidden in her depths. Her top was equally tight, displaying her relatively small as much as her tight sports bra had allowed. Of course, I also noticed three well-concealed weapons on her body, one blade under her boots, one thin knife hidden in her sock, and a barely noticeable of a sword in her bag, likely a gladius if I was calculating the length and width correctly from its subtle outline. </p><p>Altogether, she was a delicious, but dangerous package, and even the thought of unwrapping her sent my heart to overdrive. It wasn’t exactly professional, maybe, but they should have thought that before sending me directly after two months where I hunted several snow demons at Eastern Alps with almost no human contact. After that, the school with a gaggle of sexy girl in my age was simply a buffet, and the spectacular Huntress in front of me was the dessert. </p><p>I was tempted to go and talk with her, but such action would bring on the scrutiny I was trying to avoid, so instead, I turned my attention away from her, and started walking towards the first class in my schedule, tasked to observe everything around the school, a phase that might take weeks before I had a mission with the slightest hint of action. A mind-numbingly boring task altogether... </p><p>Luckily, there was a lot of eye candy around to make the part palatable…</p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>For more than once I had to identify the power balance between the paramilitary rebel groups to incite infighting that would make their group implode, all the while masquerading as a fresh recruit. Compared to that, a school filled by hormonal high-schoolers might as well be an open book against my skills. I had managed to map the power structure of the school in less than two days; every petty block, influence area, and possible developments, including a couple of teachers that were likely acting as an informant for the Council of Nine. Though most, I just ignored, focusing on the people around my target, Alicia. </p><p>Alicia’s core group had been surprisingly small. She had her primary handler, a woman in her thirties, taken the lore of the librarian for disguise, quite a sexy one at that even though she tried to hide it with poor makeup and serious clothing. It was easy to discover Alicia was spending most of her time in the library, working as her assistant, which gave her the excuse she needed. But I stayed away from the library. There was no way the handler of a Huntress was inexperienced, and poking around her domain was an easy way to bring unwanted attention, followed by my likely disappearance. It was best not to poke around before I could get a better handle of her abilities. </p><p>Luckily, Alicia had a more accessible chink in her armor, namely, her two friends. I had been expecting her to be friendless, more focused on her extermination missions, so learning that she had two close friends surprised me. I was especially pleased when, after a brief observation, I discovered that they were a pair of normal students without any martial training, but still aware of Alicia’s true nature. I was willing to bet that their relationship started when Alicia had saved their life from mortal danger. </p><p>Her friends were named Emma and Harrison, and from what I could gather, before they started hanging around with Alicia, they were unnoticeable by the other students, happy in their nerdy world, though they were getting more and more attention by hanging around with Alicia. Harrison had a quite obvious crush on Alicia, while Emma nursed an almost equally obvious one toward Harrison, which he somehow managed to miss. How, I had no idea, as I managed to notice it remotely. </p><p>Moreover, I was able to catch my ticket into the group just as easily. Some of the mid-tier girls were quite annoyed by the fact that Emma was friends with Alicia without doing anything to deserve her popularity -not helped by the fact that Emma had a cute kind of beauty, but lacked the confidence to flaunt it by wearing optimal attire or makeup, flaming their jealousy even further. So, these girls took themselves to educate her about the place she deserved through petty bullying whenever she was alone, something she was too shy to fight back, or ask help. </p><p>Hence the reason I had registered into the computer class, a class that neither Alicia nor Harrison took, leaving Emma defenseless against possible pranks by the other girls. For the class, and for my general prestige, I chose my style carefully. There was no way my dressing could be classified as sharp or classy, and definitely not rich, as in a high school, the only thing that created more buzz than a rich transfer student was a slutty teenager. So I dressed poorly, but not as poorly to make it a conversation topic, nor geeky enough to catch the attention of the nerds. As far as the school was concerned, I was another gray transfer student, the kind that might disappear the next day with exactly zero impact. </p><p>I went to the classroom several minutes to spare, examining the setup. I needed to pick a seat close enough to allow me to interact with my target, while still allowing me to observe the whole class. Not that I was expecting to be attacked, but old habits died hard. I doubted I could give my full focus to the task in hand if my back was against the entrance or against the window. I could still function, of course, but it would be much more stressful; not a good start for an assignment that would take weeks, or even months. </p><p>And there was the question of where Emma would sit. Normally, one might expect her to sit closer to the teacher, but I felt that I had enough handle on her personality to know that she would choose one nearer to the back of the class, avoiding teacher’s attention. After all, if she had been willing to ask for help, she would have asked Alicia’s help, or brought it to the faculty’s attention before things had escalated to this level. </p><p>Confident in my deduction, I chose a seat towards the back of the class, but not the one that was directly next to the one that I expected her to pick. My presence would probably have been enough to drive her to another seat, and even if it didn’t, it might have dissuaded her bullies from taking action, which would have ruined my plans to play the gallant knight. </p><p>I took my seat, observing the small trickle of students. Computer class wasn’t one of the popular ones, a combination of bad teaching and old equipment. Most students were in the class a few minutes before the teacher, but Emma waited until the last moment, entering the room just a couple steps before the teacher, who was far too bored and depressed to even comment about it. </p><p>The clothes Emma was wearing was even more drab and unnoticeable than her usual picks, a horrible dark gray top that looked loose enough fit an obese person, and slightly tighter sweatpants, just enough to ensure their presence around her waist. Her makeup was practically nonexistent, and her lovely brown hair was gathered in a careless ponytail. Not a bad attempt to stay invisible for an amateur, though she had overplayed it a bit too much. She dashed towards the back of the class and huddled to a corner, just another part of her attempted invisibility, and turned on her computer. </p><p>But her attempts to hide was doomed to failure, like a dove that had tried to hide only after catching the attention of a pack of hyenas; camouflage was no help once the scavengers had discovered the hiding place. A few minutes into the class, two girls changed their seats, picking two directly in front of Emma. </p><p>“It’s a wonder how useless and ugly some people could be, but still dare to come to the school,” said one of them in a stage whisper, while the other giggled before answering with a comment on the bone-breaking smell of certain people. Neither comments were true, of course, but that mattered little for the bullies; as accuracy was seldom needed in insults, especially targeting someone with poor self-esteem. For Emma, it was doubly so, because, during the night, she had been dealing with supernatural dangers, only to find herself unable to defend against the smallest insults. </p><p>I waited for almost ten minutes, listening to their escalating insults, before pulling a small thermos of coffee from my bag, and walked towards Emma’s bullies. “Sorry, girls,” I murmured, acting shy. “Can you show me how to do we login to the assignment server?” </p><p>“Here,” barked one of them while clicking a folder on the desktop, clearly marked as assignments. “Are you blind?” </p><p>The next thing I was going to do was already planned, but her annoying attitude made it even more satisfying to actually go through with it. I made a show of pulling back in panic, but ‘somehow’, the head of my coffee mug fly off, drenching both girls with lukewarm, smelly coffee. </p><p>“I’m so sorry!” I said exaggeratedly, but chose that moment to make eye-contact with Emma, and winked at her. She gawked at me in shock while the girls raised hell, insulting my clumsiness repeatedly until teacher fed up with it and allowed them to leave early to clean themselves, with a strong admonishment towards my way to be more careful, all without the slightest change in his bored tone, devoid of any infliction.</p><p>I walked back to my seat, only stopping enough to send another wink towards Emma’s way to communicate that it hadn’t been an accident before taking my seat. For the rest of the class, I acted like I was listening to the class, though I made sure to occasionally glance towards her way, catching her looking at me with every repeat, only for her to avoid in an instant, with a noticeable increase in her blush.  </p><p>I had been hoping that she would gather enough courage to stay after the class to talk, something she obviously wanted to do, but her shyness proved to be stronger, and she was the first one to dash out of the class when it finally ended.</p><p>No matter. It wasn’t like I lacked the opportunities to arrange a more impressive first encounter. </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>The next few encounters between me and Emma had progressed in the same manner. Spread across a few days, I had managed to block several bullying attempts, some more directly, some more obscurely; just hanging enough to make eye contact with Emma in every repeat, but never initiating a discussion. She hadn’t done so as well, despite her obvious desire to do so. And from a perspective, it had been a fortunate development, because, during one of those nights, I had an unlucky encounter with a minor demon, which caused a nasty bruise that took a few days to recover, one that I needed to keep hidden to avoid suspicion. </p><p>She managed to finally break her silence in one early morning. Her bullies had tried to corner her in front of her locker, timing their imitation of an assault when Alicia was in another wing of the building for her class, but one of them had stumbled at the last moment, courtesy of my carefully-positioned leg, collided with her friend, and allowed Emma to slid away before they could envelop her again, all without a physical confrontation that she lacked the courage to start. </p><p>I managed to slip away before the bullies could identify as the source of their troubles, but this time, when I returned to my locker a few minutes later, Emma was waiting for me at the corner, obscured from the view of the others, standing still despite her wavering determination. I gave her a wave and a wink as usual, but this time, she chose to speak. It was a soft, wavering hello, one that was easy to miss in the background noise, but I decided to cut her some slack. </p><p>“Hi,” I answered, but didn’t really struggled much to actually bring things to a new level. </p><p>It several more seconds for her to speak once more, once again in a barely-audible whisper. “Can we talk for a moment?”</p><p>“Sure,” I said as I took a step forward, bringing me in the same cozy nook she had been hiding. She took a hurried step back to keep the distance, but that didn’t make much difference, as the nook was quite small. “How can I help you?” </p><p>“Why are you helping me?” she said, her tone, while still being a whisper, carrying a much sharper impression, hinting a steely personality that I might actually like, one that she had to have to stand against the horrors of the night. It was too bad that it flashed only momentarily before disappearing behind the wall of crippling shyness. </p><p>“I abhor bullies,” I explained simply. She looked shocked, but I continued before giving her time to come up with a response. “I don’t know why you’re not fighting back or bringing the faculty on it, but I’m willing to believe you have a reason that makes sense, at least to yourself. But still, I can’t really resist someone in need.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured. “But it’s for the best if you don’t. I need to face them alone.” </p><p>“If that’s your choice,” I said with a nod. “But I have a condition.” </p><p>A more confident person would have bristled against the forced condition, but again, she wouldn’t have been in this situation if she had been a more confident person. “What is it?” she murmured. </p><p>I quickly scribbled a number to paper and passed it to her. “It’s my number. I want you to call me if they dare to actually do something bad enough that you need help. I won’t accept it otherwise.” </p><p>“But…” she murmured, but I cut her off. </p><p>“That’s non-negotiable,” I continued in a sharp, but compassionate tone. “It’s clear that you want to hide the situation from your friends or family for some reason. It’ll be better if you know that you have someone in your corner to help you when needed.” </p><p>Several expressions danced on her face, from shame to exultation, but in the end, it settled into a determined calmness with a hint of hope. “I accept,” she managed to murmur, and dashed away before I could say anything else. </p><p>“Fucking finally,” I murmured after she disappeared, happy that I could finally move to the next phase of my plan...</p>",

    "content": "<p>With her pride on display, stoked further by her anger, I had been expecting Megan to start with an aggressive blowjob. Unfortunately, her spark turned out to be weaker than I had hoped, her lips clamping around my girth, moving up and down in a semi-mechanical fashion, not giving an impressive display of ambition or skill. </p><p>Nevertheless, she raised her eyes confidently, expecting to find an expression of ecstasy, but unluckily for her, I wasn’t an academician that spent my life hoping to get a moment’s attention from one of the more popular girls to fill my social hunger, nor I was a tasteless jock with a brain addled from too much training; I looked back with the same clinical expression, showing that I wasn’t impressed with her display. </p><p>Funnily enough, the flare of anger on her face was more pleasurable than the limp grasp of her lips around my shaft, despite her sexiness, making her look like a petulant teenager that failed to get what she had wanted. But once again, anger proved its worth as an aphrodisiac, and her beats quickened, boosting my pleasure nicely, not that I had any intention of informing her about that. “That’s all,” I murmured dismissively. “Maybe I was being generous with C.” </p><p>“You bastard-” she spat as she pulled out, about to launch an angry tirade, but I had more interesting things in mind. </p><p>“A spoiled monologue would hardly help my enjoyment,” I added, my expression sharp enough to convince her that I would cut things early if she launched that. It was an excuse she should have taken, but her aim was long forgotten in her focus on her wounded pride. </p><p>“I’ll show you skill,” she murmured before she leaned forward, inadvertently silenced due to her need to widen her mouth enough to swallow my girth. She managed to push halfway without an issue, but the rest of the distance required a significant effort, the crown pushing against the entrance of her throat. </p><p>It didn’t take long for her to retreat from that particular objective, not feeling brave enough to take my thickness to her throat. I was tempted to push her head down, making her cover the rest of the distance by force, but the way her hands started to dance on my balls enough for me to put that idea to the corner. </p><p>For now, at least. </p><p>She pulled back, but only to put her tongue out for a moment, giving a sensual caress along my length, which managed to earn an honest moan from me. “Not bad, isn’t it,” she asked with a smirk before swallowing the head once again, engaging her tongue to give an impressive show of dance. </p><p>“It’s definitely impressive,” I said, which made her smile despite her full mouth. “For an appetizer, of course,” I added, sealing that smile back once again. </p><p>I was expecting another petulant argument, so I was surprised when she pulled back once more with a stiff expression, trying to force a smile into existence; but with very limited success. She pushed herself onto her feet, her naked tits dangling attractively. “Of course,” she said as she grabbed the zipper of her skirt, disengaging it with one sharp move. It slid down, leaving her in just her panties, a small red thong that might as well be invisible for all it managed to achieve in terms of concealment. “Of course,” she murmured with a tone a femme-fatale might choose before delivering a lethal strike from a difficult-to-see angle. </p><p>But she chose to turn her back and sat on my lap once more rather than to reach for a weapon, hoping to defeat me in the arena she believed herself to be more advantageous. Her hips started to grind my lap once more, but this time, her thong as the only barrier, thin enough for me to feel her wetness, evidence for the fact that she was forced to be here did little to reduce her enjoyment. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said even as I put my hands on her body, enjoying the softness of her skin. “You’re on the right track,” I added as my other hand slipped through the red strands of her hair, looking for a good grip. But unlike my usual demeanor, I gently guided her head to the side rather than a sharp pull, revealing her neck to my attention. My lips found her skin, her heart thumping in excitement, leaving a lingering kiss on her neck. </p><p>The way her eyes darted in a delicious kind of panic was rather cute, suggesting that I managed to discover a sensitive spot. She continued to move, her attempt to obscure my success obvious, but failing to achieve a noticeable success. She tried to continue the task in hand,  her attempts to look impervious foiled by the panicky desire dancing in her gaze. </p><p>That cute expression of helplessness was enough to make me change my plans. Initially, I was planning to turn the tables on her by subjecting her to rough treatment, but her vulnerability to a softer treatment was enough to make me change my mind. Teasing her until her already dubious self-control shattered completely was the more satisfying route. </p><p>With that in mind, I kept my lips on her neck, abusing the sensitive spot I had just discovered for all that was worth, making her moan a string of cries, cute enough to contrast with the wordy image she tried to project in her life. And my hand, slowly exploring her body to discover other sensitive spots -with a decent success rate- didn’t make it any easier for her to resist, her cute moans getting louder and louder. </p><p>“How is now,” she asked in a tone that would have been mistaken for confident if it wasn’t for its trembling while she quickened the dance of her hips, the last-ditch attempt to maintain the illusion that she had the control while trying to distract me from my job. </p><p>I played along. “Much better,” I answered while pulling back, freeing her neck from my insistent attention. “Your acting is much better now, enough to make me believe that you’re actually enjoying it if I didn’t know any better.” </p><p>“Yeah, right,” she chuckled, her eyes sliding away to hide her lie, which further underlined the extent of her loss of control, reminding me that I was dealing with an unexperienced heiress. “I really need that grade,” she murmured. </p><p>“Is the grade that important to you,” I said even as I dragged my finger along her spine, making her shiver erotically, one that tempted me to push the deficient cover of her panties to the side and take her rapidly, but still, I was more interested in testing the limits of her patience. </p><p>“Isn’t that obvious? Do you think I would have humiliated myself like this if it wasn’t important?” she asked, but once again, her tone disagreed with her words, suggesting that she was happy with my gaze. Meanwhile, my hands were even hungrier while dancing on her body, teasing in a way that she never tasted before, making her react like a virgin bride. “Now I feel bad, forcing you to struggle for a measly grade. You can leave, you have earned your grade.” </p><p>The shock on her face was pretty enough to almost trigger a premature accident, but luckily, my experience prevailed over my desires. “What- why?” she stammered, extremely unhappy about the loss of her excuse. She took a deep breath, desperately trying to think. “I can’t accept,” she spouted rapidly a moment later, an expression of realization appearing on her face. “I can’t accept something I didn’t deserve. I’m going to earn that A.” </p><p>It took all of my willpower to keep myself from laughing out loud. Not only she clearly hadn’t worked a day in her life for her privilege but not bothered by her status, but also she was in a professor’s room, trying to use her sexuality to take a shortcut for a grade that she didn’t deserve. Using that as an excuse was just funny, tempting me to underline it to see how she would try to get away from it, but my patience had some limits as well. And my sexy but spoiled redheaded student, desperately dancing over my naked shaft, trying to come up excuses for why I should take her in my office until she fell unconscious between cries and moans… </p><p>“I can only respect such a selfless dedication,” I said, and even if she heard the mocking edge my tone carried, she acted like she failed to notice in favor of raising herself off my lap temporarily, using the space to let her panties to slide down over her deliciously toned legs until they met with the floor. I leaned back while she returned to her earlier position, sans the absence of her panties. </p><p>I couldn’t help but gasp as she grabbed my shaft, aligning it correctly before sinking down, and a heavenly warmth started to envelop my girth bit by bit, starting from the crown. Ignoring the temptation to push myself up in a manner that would test her capacity, I moved upward until my hand was around her body, teasing previously-discovered sensitive spots with a reckless abandon. </p><p>Meanwhile, she continued to slowly sink deeper, her arousal helping her to do smoothly. But the physical ease of the job was deeply contrasted by the utter confusion adoring her face, shocked by the reaction of her own body, trying to process the moment. Imagining what she was thinking was not too hard. A spoiled princess like her, especially with her extraordinary beauty, probably was used to much more different type of sexual adventure; where the male spent all of his time and effort trying to woo her, only to fail in the actual act due to their excitement. The exact opposite of what was happening right now, pushing her into unfamiliar territory. </p><p>It was the unfamiliarity of the pleasure that made her gush wetter and wetter, her body moving smoothly as her reflexes took control, swallowing more and more of my shaft. I decided to help, my hands climbing up until they were on her shoulders, timing my push just as she started to go down, impaling my shaft even deeper. Her mouth opened, and a gasp escaped her mouth, making me worry about a potential eavesdropper. Even at this late hour, it wasn’t certain that this wing of the building would be completely empty.  </p><p>When my hands moved down to her breasts, testing their delicious elasticity, it only increased the expression of ecstasy on her face, reacting extremely well to my soft touch. I increased the pressure a bit, enough to turn my caress into a squeeze, and her lips parted open once again. This time, when she opened her mouth for another moan, I was ready, and smashed my lips to cut off her moan. </p><p>The unexpected intimacy made her stiffen for a moment, but that mattered little when my tongue slipped inside her mouth, exploring gently until hers twirled around, starting a heated battle. All the while, she continued to jump on my lap, each repeat pushing me closer to a climax. And her as well, if her ever-increasing tightness was any indicator. </p><p>Her climax arrived earlier than mine, accompanied by yet another cry which I had to suppress, though that wasn’t exactly a chore. She tried to continue her treatment, but the sudden loss of power in her trembling legs prevented the continuation of it. I wrapped my arm around her waist to pin her in place before suddenly standing up, bringing her along as I walked across the room, each step pushing my shaft even deeper into her folds. </p><p>I kept my lips affixed to hers even as I pressed her against the wall, because her cries had turned into an unbroken string, making them the only thing between us and a double-expulsion. </p><p>But that didn’t mean that I was going to have any mercy on her. Pinned against the wall, it was the perfect opportunity to explore her hidden depths. My hands on her hips to keep her stable, I started pumping her in long, hard strokes, each bringing her even closer to a climax. She tried to wrap her legs around my waist at first, showing her enjoyment of the moment, uncaring of the submissive position she had found herself in. </p><p>Not one to miss such an opportunity, I just sped up until she was crying with pleasure. Even my resistance had limits, edging an explosion. I chose not to warn her until the last second, until it was too late to actually do something, but her legs wrapping around my waist was an unexpected, yet welcome, surprise. </p><p>She shuddered under the effects of yet another climax while I was busy filling her up. When I pulled out, she stumbled forward, my arm only thing preventing her from falling. But it wasn’t the end. “On all fours,” I commanded while I picked her discarded panties from the floor, and before she could answer, stuffed them in her mouth. She obeyed without a complain, and I made sure that the position she took was just in front of the camera, her face, filled with ecstasy, was completely visible on the camera. </p><p>Then I pushed inside her once again, this time, her makeshift gag barely enough to suppress her voice. Happy with that, I started to rain spanks on her bottom, my other hand sliding through her fiery hair, keeping her upright painfully, something she enjoyed immensely, evidenced by her ever-increasing wetness. </p><p>Several minutes passed like that, and I didn’t bother to change position, enjoying the sexy monotony of the situation until it was time to fill her once again. Filling up a sexy girl who previously thought as my superior was a unique taste, that was for sure. </p><p>The last one proved too much for her, and she collapsed. I didn’t bother to lift her from the floor, just fixed my pants and sat on my desk, working on my paperwork, another small dose of power-play. </p><p>It took her a couple of minutes to gather enough energy to lift herself from the floor, pulling her panties out with a sheepish expression. Though, the lack of anger was a surprising detail. I had expected her to explode in anger, not silently pull some wet wipes to erase the worst of the mess from her legs before pulling her panties on, leaving her bloated with my seed. </p><p>With everything done, I watched her dress silently. It wasn’t the silence of anger, or disappointment. It was yet another mark of the pleasure she had just experienced, leaving her muscles tired and her mind jumbled. But her actions were quickened as the realization invaded her face, making her realize just how out of control the day’s event had developed. </p><p>“See you around, professor,” she murmured as she put her phone on her bag without bothering to check the video, and left the room. I pulled my burner phone to delete the said video from her phone after sending a copy to myself, therefore destroying the whole point of her presence, then dashed out, following her from a distance, aware that she wouldn’t notice my presence in her exhausted state. </p><p>I wanted to see her face when she noticed the absence of the video, just in case she decided to check it before she arrived back in her room, where I could use the webcam to observe her. </p><p>But as they say, the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry. She actually decided to take a less-used, and slightly longer, the route to her sorority house, likely to avoid people before she could gather herself to a degree. However, in her exhaustion, she never noticed a black car slowly following her, in a manner that made alarm bells rang in my head. I had a bad feeling about that. </p><p>The smart thing would have been to act like I hadn’t noticed it, and silently disappear, maybe while sending an anonymous tip to the police. I didn’t even actually liked her as a person. But from my lawless days, I knew just how ineffective it would be, and while she might be an annoying entitled girl, but it didn’t mean that I could actually leave her to such a fate. I dashed forward, as silent as I could manage. The later they noticed me, the better.  </p><p>And it was just in time, because I was just behind her when the car stopped next to her, and the door opened, and a bulky man stepped out of the car. Someone I recognized, much to my chagrin. Someone that I had worked together a few times before, back in my days as an enforcer, before I managed to move onto better things. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised to see Archie still working as an enforcer, as the guy lacked the imagination to do anything better, though unfortunately, he was very good at his job. Which was why when he wrapped his arm around Megan, I directly punched his kidney rather than trying to pull her away. And while he was distracted, I pulled his gun from its holster. </p><p>I wished that killing him was an option, but I knew enough that doing so would bring too much heat, both from the side of the law, and the lawless. Instead, I raised my newly-acquired weapon to his face, but stalled enough to allow him to slip into the car, and the driver to press off. It made sense, as they clearly aimed a surgical strike, and even if the driver came out, they wouldn’t have taken me down before I could take a shot, alerting the campus of their presence. </p><p>The car sped off while I felt Megan’s arm around my torso, tight with shock. But all I could think of was why my old mafia buddies were here, and how hard it was going to screw my new life… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was feeling cheerful as I returned to the library the next morning. Why wouldn’t I, after an amazing experience in Marianne’s room, I returned to my room for a long and relaxing sleep. My mood only improved when I saw that the Head Librarian was still away. With my improved subterfuge skill, I no longer feared to be outed. If my disguise was good enough to fake being a woman while attending another in the bath, faking the act of my idiot past wouldn’t be a problem, no matter the observer. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same couldn’t be said for the various shenanigans that were going on. I couldn’t imagine Cornelia taking the risk of using the library as her forbidden-love den. I definitely wouldn’t dare to walk around in a ranger disguise in the library while she was here, meaning not only I would lose my voyeurism opportunities, but also I would lose my excuse to talk with Helga. </p><p>Then, I saw her walking towards the depths of the library, and I was familiar with her mannerisms enough to catch a certain excitement in her steps. Today, I decided to join her early, because I had a lot of gaps in my arcana skill to fill. I wanted to see the speed of improvement with a dedicated teacher. And, spending time with her as much as possible before the Head Librarian returned was a prudent idea. </p><p>I walked around several minutes, being ‘accidentally’ visible until one of the assistants ordered me to dust all the books on the back of the library. A clear attempt to make me keep away from the crowd, as all library books, including the relatively unimportant ones in the main section, were enchanted against basic challenges like dust and moisture. It fit my disguise not to question that order. Luckily, I had no intention of doing so in any case. </p><p>The Mule disappeared in the depths of the library, and a minute later, Orlin the Ranger walked out… </p><p>Since I already knew the general direction she went, it took only a few minutes for me to find Helga. Once again, she was dressed in her thick robes, making me curse the dressing habits of the students of magic, preferring thick, shapeless robes over anything else, just because it was the tradition. </p><p>Luckily, I remembered how her body looked, so there was nothing preventing me to imagine the way her body stretched as she tried to reach for the top shelf, trying to get a book. Distracted by her task, she didn’t notice my presence. With the help of my agility, sneaking to her was quite easy. </p><p>I kept my silence until I was close enough to hug her, leaned to her ear, and whispered. “Do you need any help, beautiful.” </p><p>The result was spectacular. Startled by my presence, she turned in her adrenaline boosted speed, a fist-sized ball of lighting already gathered in her palm, ready to be released. Impressive conjuration speed, I noted, though the same couldn’t be said for her speed in aiming.   Before she could release the spell, I wrapped my hand around her forearm, and changed her aim. “Orlin?” she whispered in surprise as her lightning hit the ceiling, and discharged harmlessly against the ward. </p><p>“Hello, beautiful,” I said even as I placed one of my hands on the small of her back, the other, which was around her forearm, moving up until our fingers were gently intertwined. </p><p>For a moment, she was frozen, dumbfounded. The reason was hard to pinpoint, as it might be because of the passionate kiss that marked the end of our last encounter, it might be my enhanced charisma affecting her, or it might be our closeness, enough to restart our kiss by just leaning forward.</p><p>Then, her eyes grew in panic as she realized how close she had been to turn me into a charred mess. “I’m sorry Orlin!” she exclaimed, loud enough to make me pull back for a moment. “I almost attacked you! Please forgive me.” </p><p>“There is nothing to forgive,” I answered as I reestablished our closeness. “But if you’re feeling bad, I have a rather good idea for an apology.” </p><p>Her mouth opened reflexively before her brain could engage to catch the insinuation in my voice. But for me, the shiny pinkness of her lips was much more interesting than anything else she might say at the moment. So, I leaned forward, cutting her words short in a rather enjoyable manner for both of us. </p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>I wasn’t surprised when she froze as our lips touched. Regardless, I continued to treat her lips with a soft, lingering kiss, my arm around her waist tightening enough to make our bodies touch, just enough to feel the rapid rise of her heartbeat. I didn’t want to scare her off, so I tried to act in a measured manner while my lips danced over hers, trying to coax a reaction. </p><p>I hadn’t had to wait for long for the said reaction. First, her lips started to move in an attempt to match the rhythm of the mine. I let her succeed for a moment before picking up speed. She followed my lead without a delay, soon, our lips were following the invisible music of a heated dance. </p><p>[+100 Experience] </p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Advanced Speech, Basic Biomancy, Basic Lovemaking] </p><p>Leveling up couldn’t come in a better moment, considering the situations I gained experience. At least, right now, I was in a situation where I could continue in autopilot while trying to decide which skill to pick next. I couldn’t say the same for the skill selection. Speech was an obvious option which helped me a lot, but under the circumstances, it was sufficient, and biomancy was something I hadn’t given the slightest thought. The only thing I knew was it was an inferior version of healing magic, allowing the users to affect the other lifeforms in return.   </p><p>At that moment, lovemaking seemed like an obvious choice, but funnily enough, it was the way Helga wrapped her arms around my neck to pull me deeper into the kiss that discouraged me from it. Reactions of both Marianne and Helga showed that my advanced stats already gave a sufficient edge to me on the topic, and considering the incredible jump with the other skills, I feared that sex would lose its excitement. </p><p>With an impulsive decision, I skipped speech as well, roughly for the same reasons, and picked biomancy, despite knowing very little about it. What was life without a little risk, after all? </p><p>Then, I felt Helga’s tongue pushing against my lips, bringing me fully back to the moment. I parted my lips, allowing her tongue to slip inside my mouth, rewarding her for the initiative. While her tongue ravaged my mouth, I decided to shelve the considerations for my new skills for a later moment. The present called for my undivided attention. </p><p>I tightened my grip around her waist, smashing her chest against mine, enjoying the firmness of her chest against my muscles. Simultaneously, I finally counter-attacked her presence in my mouth. The battle stayed balanced for a moment before she retreated, which turned into a total rout. I followed, restarting the skirmish, but this time in her mouth. </p><p>When she pulled back to take a breath, I chose to bring my lips down, sucking her neck in a way that turned her attempts to take a breath into a sharp gasp. When her arms around my body tightened further, I decided to take it as an invitation to push further. My lips stayed on her skin as I moved down on the length of her neck, leaving lingering kisses, each earning its own moan. </p><p>[+300 Experience] </p><p>Unfortunately, I felt her stiffen when I slid my hands downward. It was a small, unconscious move, but I decided to take it as a sign to pull back. It was better to leave her wanting rather than forcing her to draw a line. “Long time no see, beautiful,” I said with a satisfied smirk after pulling back. </p><p>“We just talked yesterday,” she managed to whisper, blushing, though I didn’t think that it was about the question itself. More likely, it was about our continued closeness, our bodies pressing tight, her back against the shelf, and my arm still firmly around to prevent her escape. </p><p>“It was a long night,” I said with a crooked smile, which increased her blush even further. I leaned forward slightly, but thanks to the distance between us, it brought me to a prime location to restart our kiss. Her lips parted open reflexively, but instead of continuing the kiss, I reached up and pulled the book she was trying to get when I arrived. When I passed it, a confused expression popped on her face before she remembered her objective when it was broken by my surprise appearance. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured. </p><p>“Always a pleasure,” I said as finally let her go, but our fingers were still intertwined as we walked to the large table, already loaded by the books. I only let her hand go to pull a chair for her, earning a shy smile as a reward. For myself, I chose to sit next to her rather than sitting across her, opening the book on arcana that I picked up on the way. “You don’t mind if I study next to you, or ask some questions when I get stuck, right?” </p><p>The answer came in an instant, with noticeable urgency. “Of course not. You can ask whatever you want!”</p><p>“You’re as kind as you’re pretty,” I answered, squeezing her hand just for emphasis. She stammered a response impossible to decipher. Thankfully, the underlying sentiment was easier to decipher. </p><p>It was an excellent opportunity to employ the tricks I learned from my latest adventure with Marianne, though in a much-reduced dosage. I started reading my book while letting my hand fall on her leg in an accidental manner. I didn’t expect her to believe that of course, but from the way her smile competed with her blush to catch up, it was clear that she had no intention of calling me off on that, which was enough. </p><p>I let a few minutes to pass, through which I kept my hand intentionally immobile, letting her get used to our casual contact. It was sufficiently effective, as she was able to turn her attention on the book she was reading, but she had to backtrack several times, suggesting that she had trouble staying focused on what she was reading. </p><p>Several minutes later, I squeezed her leg the moment I started speaking. “I don’t understand how to balance the structure on three runes. Wouldn’t it cause a continuous conflict that ultimately breaks the effect?” I asked, despite knowing its answer. I had three reasons for it. </p><p>The first was to maintain the impression that I just had a few points on arcana. The second was her habits of teaching. Starved to contact due to the discrimination she experienced, she was more than happy to launch deep discussions on the topic, which came with some great insights. It would be much more effective if I had the option to actually hold a debate on the more complicated parts, but still, it was much better than anything else than I could do alone. </p><p>The third reason was even simpler, making her get more and more used to having extended contact. In the second minute of her explanation, I started squeezing her leg softly. On fourth, my hand started moving up and down, but sticking around her knee. Around the ten-minute mark, when she finally finished her explanation, my ‘absentminded’ caresses ended up in her thigh. But the results of that moment was spectacular. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>[+3 Arcana] </p><p>I was about to return to my book when I was stuck with a sudden inspiration. “By the way, what do you know about biomancy,” I asked her, hoping to get a couple more questions in advance. </p><p>“It’s an amazing skill, totally underrated by the research community!” she said with sudden jubilation. “They are willing to dismiss all the possibilities it represents just because it’s less effective on healing.” </p><p>I wasn’t expecting such an enthusiastic reaction from her. “Do you have any focus on that?” I asked. </p><p>“I wish,” she answered with a sigh. “Unfortunately, I’m having trouble leveling up enough to get the necessary steps for my status,” she mentioned absentmindedly. It took quite a bit of willpower to keep myself from asking her exact situation on her levels, which was a rather dangerous social blunder. Even the amount she admitted was a bit much. Even though she looked too excited to notice, I wasn’t willing to push her more on the subject. </p><p>“Why is that?” I asked, which triggered another very long explanation on the various potential applications of biomancy on the transformation of non-human material, for a range of purposes from healing to combat support. It was hard for me to keep up even with my skill points, which was rapidly increasing as her explanation continued, and my rather impressive stats. I even kept my hand in place during her explanation not to distract her, because her explanations were working wonders. </p><p>As she went through her explanation, I couldn’t help but theorize about her skill configuration. For a moment, I entertained the probability that she lied to me about not using any biomancy, but I discarded that quickly. She wasn’t good at lying enough to slip that past me. She probably had a generic skill relating to the theory, assisting her to generate a more accurate understanding. </p><p>In the end, she talked another thirty minutes on biomancy, occasionally slipping back to wider issues on magic, but the results were worth the loss of time. Towards the end, after making sure that nothing would distract her from her academic zeal, my hand continued its journey on her leg. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>[+2 Arcana]</p><p>[+7 Biomancy]</p><p>“How it is possible,” I said after she finished her explanation, which left her blushed and short of breath. </p><p>“What?” she asked. </p><p>“For a girl to be this beautiful and smart,” I answered, watching in amusement as the blush spread to her face once more. She opened her mouth, but unlike the academic explanation, her words were not spilling out in a great hurry. Instead, they were shuffling inside her mouth, fighting not to be the first one to leave the confines of her lips, still puffy from our earlier kiss. </p><p>“You’re just adorable,” I said as I slipped my fingers through her hair, moving through a smooth caress, then transitioning to her shoulder from the tips. While I was doing that, she was leaning forward, so all it took was a gentle pull to restart our kiss. </p><p>This time, she didn’t hesitate even for a moment, the vigor of her lips overcoming even mine. If that wasn’t a sign to push further, I didn’t know what it was. Since my hand was already on her shoulder, it only took a quick journey to slip down to her chest, gently cupping her breasts, fighting the temptation to fully sink into the soft flesh of her breasts. </p><p>But then, her arms found my neck once more, her hold tight enough to hurt. As far as signals went, I couldn’t imagine a more direct one without moving into a more vulgar territory. I would have hated to disappoint such a beautiful woman. A moan escaped her mouth as my fingers sank deeper into her breasts, loud enough to alert passerby’s, but luckily, my lips were in a prime position to suppress that moan, turning it into a delicious vibration instead. </p><p>Meanwhile, my other hand had nothing to do. Idleness was a shameful quality, so I put it on her hips, sinking softly to her skin. I half-expected her to flinch, remembering the painful state of her bottom after Cornelia’s treatment, but she either healed up quickly enough, or she managed to get the help of one of the healers, because she didn’t react my hand adversely. I squeezed her ass even harder, forcing another moan off her lips, which I suppressed just as quick. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>Trying to push further was an attractive idea, but also quite risky. Yes, we were in an unfrequented area of the library, but unfrequented didn’t guarantee complete seclusion. I trusted my abilities to give me an advance warning enough to erase the signs of a kiss, I couldn’t guarantee the same if we were in a deeper state of undress. With great reluctance I pulled away from her sweet lips, leaving her panting. </p><p>She kept our gaze connected for a moment before the situation sank into her mind. Her eyes slid away as the redness of her face intensified even further, to a point that made me worried that she might faint. The difference between the girl that subjected herself to not-so-tender mercies of Cornelia without a hint of shame, and the one that was about to faint just because a sweet kiss was unbelievable. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel bad a bit, but not too much, because unlike the others, I didn’t lie to her too badly. I just acted like a stranger, albeit a dark and mysterious one from a far-off land that would disappear in a few days. It might not be much, but it was enough to relax my conscience. </p><p>“I don’t understand how the energy transference affects the construction of a dual-superstructure for a ward,” I added, raising one of the points that were bugging me from the last part of our discussion. It was far more complicated for a ranger restricted to basic arcana and one digit wisdom to even understand its implications, but I bet on the fact she would welcome a distraction to focus anything other than our most-recent kiss. </p><p>She didn’t surprise me, and launched another detailed explanation that I felt trouble following even with my current state. But the rapid increase in my skills were worth it, but I couldn’t help but think it was unnatural. Her insights were incredible, but not enough to level me up that quickly. </p><p>Then it struck me. Technically, I was still in danger. Not only I was acting like a different person, but also I was misrepresenting the danger I was in. The System must be able to detect it somehow, which raised more questions about its origins. Maybe the temples were right, and each Melius had a divine messenger on their shoulder, rewarding them for the challenges they met. Though if that was true, mine seemed to be an especially perverted one. </p><p>With a sexy blonde in front of me, metaphysical questions weren’t the best target to spend my time on, I realized when she asked me a question. Thankfully, I was good enough in multitasking to catch the question, and promptly answered in a level of detail sufficient for my supposed knowledge. The discussion continued in the same vein for a couple more hours, with her showing off the depths of her knowledge, and with me rewarding her with lingering kisses, and enthusiastic gropes which occasionally slipped under her robe. The rewards of the session was amazing. </p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>[+14 Arcana]</p><p>[+9 Biomancy]</p><p>[Speech +2]</p><p>[Subterfuge +1]</p><p>While I wanted to continue the session for more, I couldn’t risk one of the kinder assistants to start worrying about my disappearance and start searching. “Getting the attention of such a beautiful teacher has been an amazing experience, but I need to go before the rest of the group starts wondering where I disappeared.” </p><p>“So soon,” she answered. </p><p>“It has been more than three hours,” I answered. </p><p>“But there is no clock around,” she asked. “And you don’t have a window large enough to see the sun.” </p><p>I had a feeling that it was just a convenient excuse to distract herself from disappointment rather than a genuine question, but I still answered. I pointed at the small ray of light, spreading from a small window at the top. “The change of the angle from rays of light is enough,” I answered. “On the wild, you learn how to pay attention to a lot of things.” </p><p>Without a warning, I leaned forward and captured her lips in another lingering kiss, with my hands joining the fray soon after. Her reaction was even more heated than the last time, signaling that I might even get lucky if I played my cards right. Unfortunately, I was out of time, so I pulled back soon after, leaving her panting with arousal. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>I walked away without saying anything, then, just before disappearing amongst the shelves, I turned back, and whispered. “See you tomorrow, beautiful.” Then, I disappeared, trying to suppress the disappointment from leaving such a beautiful girl behind to go and arrange books… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 7        Experience: 24240 / 28000</p><p>Strength: 6    Charisma: 12</p><p>Precision: 10    Perception: 10</p><p>Agility: 10     Manipulation: 12</p><p>Speed: 7       Intelligence: 8</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 287 / 287    Mana: 360 / 413             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (48/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [45/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech 24/25</p><p>Basic Biomancy 16/25        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Walking behind Marianne was a pleasure, especially when she was dressed only in a short towel, a tempting sway on her hips, enhanced further by her unmet desire. Of course, it wasn’t comparable to the view that followed once she stood next to her bed, and let the towel fell on the floor. The amazing view of her behind filled my vision, supported by a glimpse of her glistening nether lips as she crawled on the bed, lying prone. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>Her lack of concern for a maid’s presence was definitely useful, enough to make her take a revealing and vulnerable position without the slightest concern. As much as I would have liked to keep her beautiful breasts in my field of vision constantly, I wasn’t ready to be on her sight without the comfortable steam cover. </p><p>My eyes devoured the contours of her body as I closed the distance, enthusiastically noting the details of her body now that she was bereft of the protection provided by the cloud of steam. When I stood above her, just inches away, I was tempted to examine her curves for hours, but her tenseness was obvious even for the naked eye. It wasn’t the best time to take a risk, I decided and started working. </p><p>And it wasn’t like my work was a chore, I noted as my hands landed on her back, going back and forth along her spine, repeating the earlier trick from the bath, this time without a restriction. Her reaction was instant, in the form of a small moan, one that she suffocated halfway, but enough to confirm her intention. </p><p>[+200 Experience]  </p><p>I watched as her eyes flickered open. Her neck turned, allowing her gaze to meet my face, but it didn’t take long for them to close once more as I continued my obvious act, trusting my disguise to hold despite the unfavorable visibility, betting on the fact that her distraction shone brighter than the lights of the room.  </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>I continued my task of slowly caressing her back, but I couldn’t help but feel self-conscious about the possibility of an accidental discovery, which was a real possibility under the bright lights of the room. I had managed to slip successfully once, but it wasn’t a reason to retake that risk, especially when I was going to push the situation much further. “Milady, would you like me to dim the lights a bit, a darker room would be more relaxing,” I suggested, making sure that my voice trembled with a sufficient dose of fear, as it was appropriate for a commoner maid to feel insecure when daring to notify their betters about their opinion without prompting, no matter how simple or sensible. </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>I relaxed even more when she waved her hand without even opening her eyes, and the lights in the room dimmed considerably. Only a candle left in the room, flickering just a few feet away, filling the room with moving shadows to give a mystic feeling, allowing me to cut loose. </p><p>Though, it was also annoying a bit, because her careless display of magic in an area that wasn’t her primary focus drove my deficiencies to the surface. I knew that I shouldn’t feel impatient. It had been just a few days since I had unlocked the secrets of my power, and feeling disappointed just because I was yet to overcome the people with years of opportunity to improve theirs was misguided at best. I needed at least another week to do that!</p><p>And it wasn’t like I was restricted to direct confrontation to hit back, evidenced by the fact that I was in her most private room, caressing her naked body. Of course, it would have been if I didn’t have to hide behind the identity of a female maid, but one couldn’t have everything. Not yet, at least.  </p><p>The darkness served more than just assisting my disguise, as her moans were considerably more frequent when my hands started dancing over her body once more. The darkness helped to enhance her sensations, yet another useful detail about her body which would allow me to play her like a string instrument. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>With the unexpected assistance of the darkness, it didn’t take long for her pleasure to rise to the earlier point, just a notch before the climax. I was watching that particular way she was biting her lips, so I chose that moment to slow my treatment once more. My hands danced up and down on her back for minutes, each second making her tenseness tighter and tighter, to a point that if I wasn’t disguised as a servant, she would be begging for my mercy. </p><p>I chose that moment to move down on her body, caressing her plump cheeks with a fleeting touch. In another circumstance, I could imagine her exploding in anger for my daring to touch such a private location, but the extensions in her long-awaited meetings were enough to sway her on that point. I kept the pacing, betting on that her shyness overcoming her impatience. </p><p>But I could see that it was a losing battle from the ways her hips rose, her legs parting slightly to give an unrestricted view of her most intimate place, which was dripping arousal. Adding to her almost constant moans, I could see that her resistance was about to collapse soon, one way or another… </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>The easiest thing to do would be to increase the pressure on the small of her back slightly, triggering her arousal. It should be enough, both the pleasure I had received, and the increase in my experience. Not only I gained another level, but I had also made significant headway for the next one. It should be enough. </p><p>But it wasn’t. I opened my mouth, with the sudden realization that I would probably die because of my this newfound greed, if not today, quite soon. I also knew that I might not find another opportunity to ask that particular question if I missed this amazing opportunity, because she wouldn’t be caught in surprise by her own reaction. </p><p>“Milady,” I murmured, making my voice trembling even more than the previous time. “I would like to ask a question, but I’m afraid if it might be a bit too presumptuous.” She grunted in reply, too far gone in the pleasure to answer, and I continued. “My previous lady was from the Northern Plains, and she had educated me in the various massage techniques to help her cope with stress…” </p><p>“What kind of stress?” she said, the possibility I was implying enough to make her raise her head. </p><p>I continued, acting like I hadn’t already noticed her understanding. “I didn’t mention it to other servants, afraid that they would find it shameful. They don’t exactly fit with the Empire’s traditions.” </p><p>“I see,” Marianne murmured. “Did your mistress felt stressed a lot when her husband was away,” she asked as she put her head back on the bed. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” I answered. “On the contrary, she needed it more whenever the master was back home. For some reason, she never needed it when the master was away. She was usually busy leading the defense of the area, discussing with the commander of the guard for hours in her private chambers,” I added, acting as clueless as I could do while implying that my supposed mistress was cheating her husband while he was away. When Marianne said nothing, I was afraid that I had pushed my idiot act too far. </p><p>[+1 Speech] </p><p>The system warned me just as Marianne opened her mouth, informing me of my success. “I see, you may try,” she murmured, with a hint of excitement coloring her tone. Then, her tone shifted to threatening. “But if you tell it to a living soul about it, I’ll make sure no one finds your body.” </p><p>“Of course, mistress,” I said, displaying a good mixture of fear and obedience. Even with everything, I doubted that I could have convinced her if it wasn’t for her unmet desire. </p><p>[+1 Speech] </p><p>“Excellent, you may start. But no word to anyone else,” she said. Luckily, her face was buried in her pillow, so she missed the sudden hunger in my face. </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I said as I dragged my hands to her inner thighs, parting her legs wide, enough to give me the full view of her nether lips, ready for my attention. I gently rested my thumbs on the edge, where her lips began, and dragged down, making her shiver helplessly. Just a bit closer to the inside, and she would have exploded rather spectacularly, an ending I carefully avoided. Now that I had unrestricted access to her body, I wanted her tenser than a catapult about to go off before she reached the ending she deeply desired in an explosive manner. </p><p>I repeated my last movement, caressing the edge of her lips, taking the exact same route the remove any doubt that it was just accidental. And now that she had a clear idea what the massage included, I pulled back, and focused on her inner thighs, rubbing back and forth, some of them bringing me closer, while others dragged my fingers away from her wetness. </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>It was a beautiful experience to watch her ass starting to rise in anticipation whenever my hands dragged closer to her bottom. She started trembling with each repeat, tempting me to push forward as a desire to watch her trembles from a point-blank range coiled around my heart. </p><p>But watching her squirm was even more enjoyable as I focused on her inner thighs, listening to her gasp in arousal whenever my hand closed enough to dance on the edges of her wetness, each louder than the other. </p><p>Ultimately, I decided to reward her, just because I pitied her, of course. It absolutely had no relation to the way the towel around my waist started to get too tight, the desire swelling high enough to drown my patience mercilessly. I waited until her hips rose, which gave me good access to her nether lips. I brought my thumbs over them, but not on the lateral edges. No, one of them landed on the edge of her clit, ready to draw circles around, while the other took a position at her entrance. </p><p>She stiffened just a moment before my thumbs started their dance, anticipating the rush of pleasure she would receive. But the severity of her action was nothing compared to when I drew several circles in rapid succession, finally pushing her to the other end of the arousal. A moan left her mouth, stronger than any other that had left her mouth, and she started trembling beautifully, dimness of the room giving an otherworldly feeling to it. </p><p>[+600 Experience]</p><p>It was too tempting to resist. I took a step back and broke my legs a bit, enough to reveal my shaft, beating it as quick as I could without making noise while enjoying the beautiful view in front of me. </p><p>While it looked like she would continue laying without moving for a while, I needed an excuse in case she decided to surprise me. Just standing on her foot was not enough. With that in mind, I put my right hand on the sole of her feet, caressing gently. </p><p>It was an amusing twist of fate when she turned to face me a minute later, I was at the edge of my own climax. “It was a decent massage,” she murmured, her voice decidedly mellow. </p><p>I didn’t want to get away without reaching my own climax, so once again, my wits dominated any sense of self-preservation. “Do you want to stop it early, mistress,” I said with a clueless voice while wrapped the towel around my waist once more, a decidedly painful experience considering the erect state of my manhood. </p><p>“It wasn’t all of it?” she asked, astonished. </p><p>“Of course not, mistress,” I answered. It might not be the smartest thing to do, but I already started it, so there was no point in cutting it short. “The full course takes more than an hour, but in the end, the mistress usually ended up really relaxed.” </p><p>“An hour, you say,” Marianne murmured, intrigued. “And you say your mistress looked even more relaxed than I am?” </p><p>“Usually, she was too exhausted to even lift an arm, mistress,” I explained. “Sometimes too exhausted even to dress before sleeping.” When I noticed the shine in her eyes, I knew that I was successful. The notification that appeared in my field of vision was a nice confirmation nevertheless. </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>“We still have time,” Marianne murmured, in a disinterested tone so fake that I wouldn’t have believed even back in my idiot days. “Why don’t you show me the full range of your massage technique.” </p><p>“It’s a bit harder than the previous portion, though, mistress. I just want to warn you about that.” </p><p>Marianne chuckled. “Don’t worry about it, I’m no slouch in endurance. I can take your strength.” It would have been a rather accurate brag if I were an Abnormal like she assumed rather than a Melius with a strength of six, which, combined with my leveraged position, would mean that I could to whatever I could do, and she was helpless unless she relied on her magic. </p><p>But it wasn’t the right time to educate her on that fact. “Could you please move to the side a bit, milady?” I asked. “I need to climb on the bed for the next part.” </p><p>Another questioning glare found my way, but as usual, only to meet with the mask of a stupid but well-meaning maid. A satisfied expression was on her face when she buried in the pillow once more, suggesting her belief of total control over the situation. An amusing illusion that I, unfortunately, had to sustain. </p><p>For now, at least. </p><p>Still, as I climbed over her bed, my knees pressing on the soft surface at both sides of her naked body, that sacrifice hurt considerably less than any other situation. Wordlessly, I pressed my elbows to her back and started rubbing her back, optimizing the pressure based on her reaction while leveraging everything I had read about the human anatomy. </p><p>Already riding the pleasure of her previous climax, it didn’t take long for her to fall under the sway of my follow-up treatment. I waited until she starred purring like a lost kitten that found its way next to a roaring fireplace. Then, I lowered my arms until my forearms were resting on her back, increasing the treatment area. And if, during that, my fingers caressed the edges of her rather generously-sized breasts, it must have been a total accident, no matter how many times it repeated.  </p><p>[+400 Experience] </p><p>When her hips started to rise once more, it was time to push further. After a brief yet effective treatment of her neck and shoulders, I moved down, until her plumb bottom lay underneath my grasp. It was either now, or never, I decided as I pulled the towel away from my waist, and quickly constructed an illusion of towel instead. It wouldn’t have past the simplest muster under the normal circumstances, but a combination of the darkness and her distracted state should allow it to slip unnoticed even if she turned. </p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>With that completed, one of my hands busied itself treating my shaft, while the other focused on the plumpness, leveraging the excuse of the massage to acquaintance myself with the elasticity of her skin, occasionally traveling down to visit her nether lips, enjoying her ever-intensifying wetness. Soon, I started spending more time between her sopping wetness than her plump bottom, increasing her moans as a result. </p><p>[+400 Experience]</p><p>Treating myself to pleasure while a sexy blonde moaned with pleasure underneath was sufficient, until one point when it wasn’t. The longer she lay with her face buried in the pillow, determine to focus on the pleasure, the more I felt invincible, like I could get away with anything. And of course, like every rational human would, I decided to put that feeling to test. </p><p>And the test case was obvious. I lowered my shaft lower until it was snugly squeezed between her cheeks. I watched her carefully while continuing to deliver the same treatment, trying to see if she would react in an explosive manner. She failed to notice any difference. </p><p>The next step was starting to move, but I knew that it was a rather dangerous push in the current situation. So, I brought my index and middle finger to her entrance, probing it in the excuse of a massage, slowly at first, but picking up speed every second she failed to show an adverse reaction. Soon, the first digits of my fingers disappeared inside, much to her jubilation, followed by a string of gasps. </p><p>When I was sure that she was sufficiently distracted, I started moving my hips, her shapely bottom providing enough friction to make it pleasurable. It didn’t take long for her moans to increase even further, enjoying the presence of my shaft squeezed between her asscheeks, even if she was on the black about the exact source of the pleasure. </p><p>When her moans quickened, so did my treatment, both my fingers and my shaft, increasing her pleasure even further. I was on the edge just as she was, too far gone to gather the patience to keep her just a step behind her climax. She started trembling as another orgasm hit her, even stronger than the previous one. </p><p>The rocking of her body proved to be the last thing I needed. A climax of my own hit me with full force, and I started spraying my seed on her back, too distracted to take note of the risks. Luckily, she was even further gone, and didn’t let a whimper of protest as her back covered with a very generous amount of my seed. With eight points of endurance, my body was capable of releasing a surprising amount. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Mischievous Massage. Sneakily leave a generous gift at the end of the treatment +500 Experience, +1 Speed, +1 Agility]</p><p>I didn’t have enough time to clean her body before she noticed, I realized, unless I somehow increased the time it took to recover her from. I quickly started spreading it on her back, hoping that when she asked, I could claim it to be a  With that, for the first time, I let my fingers cut free on her nether lips, bringing the extent of the capability that was possible with ten points of manipulation and eight points of precision, while using the full extent of my wisdom to read her reaction. </p><p>The results were even more explosive than I hoped in my wildest dreams. Already sensitive from her last climax, her moans picked up instantly, and she started showing signs of an impending orgasm. I pushed my fingers as deep as her barrier allowed, even drunk in pleasure, not willing to take that particular step. </p><p>But luckily, I had an alternative to test. The moment I finished spreading my cum on her back and her ass, I used my cum-covered fingers to probe her puckered hole. Unfortunately, there, I first my first snag. “Not there,” she managed to murmur. “Stop.” </p><p>“As you wish, milady,” I said, and reluctantly pulled my finger out of her puckered hole. But in her slit, I stayed for several more beats, until she started rocking under the influence of another climax. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>As much as I wanted to turn her over and continue the same treatment on her sensitive breasts, I was not in a position to ignore a direct order without a consequence, especially when I had already pushed the boundaries that much. Instead, I looked for something to cover the sharp smell of cum, and saw several bottles of fragrance on her table. I levitated one of them and used a few drops to suppress the smell before she could lift her head. </p><p>When she gathered enough energy to turn, I was already on the side of her bed, my head lowered, stretching my acting capabilities to the limit to give the impression of a dutiful servant. “Do you want me to attend you for a quick shower, milady,” I said, keeping my voice perfectly even, like what had just happened was completely ordinary. And a small miracle happened, and she bought my act of cluelessness. </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>“No, just help me to dress. I want to rest,” she murmured before burying her head on the pillow. When I came with her nightie, she barely had the strength to lift herself from the bed, and slipped her nightie on, uncaring of the nakedness she presented, which wasn’t that unreasonable considering everything that happened. The sight of her bountiful breasts still gave me some experience, though, which was always welcome. </p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>“You can leave now,” she said as she threw herself on the bed once more. This time, I followed her command, as even though she looked like she was about to fall asleep before I could leave the room, actually dallying around until she could was too risky. I had done enough for the night, though it was unfortunate that I wasn’t able to gain another level. </p><p>It wasn’t like I lacked the assistance to help me level up. </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 6        Experience: 20890 / 21000</p><p>Strength: 6    Charisma: 12</p><p>Precision: 10    Perception: 10</p><p>Agility: 10     Manipulation: 12</p><p>Speed: 7       Intelligence: 8</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 246 / 246    Mana: 280 / 354             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (47/50)     </p><p>Advanced Arcana [26/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech 22/25        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>After leaving Cornelia’s room, I used the first opportunity I had to change into my other, more permanent, maid identity. I would have preferred to change back into my own identity, as walking around in a dress wasn’t something I particularly enjoyed, but it would be hard to explain why the ‘Mule’ was walking around in the section for the elite portion of the female students. </p><p>It turned out to be a prudent choice, as I was distracted by a familiar voice. “Selina,” she called, though I would be able to recognize her even if I hadn’t been able to recognize her voice. Only one person knew the name of this fake identity. </p><p>“Madame Griselda,” I said as I turned, curtsying respectfully, a motion which she waved off. </p><p>“So lucky,” she murmured. “I was just trying to find you, but neither you nor your employer was around.” </p><p>“He’s probably lost,” I answered. With the contempt she had in her voice while mentioning my real identity, I didn’t think she would have any trouble believing that particular lie. I wasn’t really angry at her though, how could I be, when she gave me such an amazing gift the last time. “So, why were you looking for me?”</p><p>“Mistress has arrived from the library early, and asking for a bath, and sent me to find you” she explained. “I know that it’s a bit sudden, but if you don’t have any other task-” she continued until I cut her off. </p><p>“I will be delighted,” I answered, giving the first true answer of the night to her. I didn’t think that I would have been able to contain my excitement if it wasn’t for my well-developed subterfuge skill. I had a feeling that Marianne’s sudden arrival had been linked to Cornelia’s disappearance, cutting their private time short. “I have already completed all my other tasks.”</p><p>“Excellent. Let’s go and prepare the bath.” </p><p>I didn’t exactly welcome her presence in that phase, not with the additional preparations I needed to complete. “I already know everything other than how to prepare that herbal water. Let’s go prepare that, and I can handle everything else.” </p><p>“Such a reliable youngster,” she said happily. “The bath water is already boiling in the same room.” </p><p>“Then there is nothing preventing you from getting a couple of hours of rest, is there? Actually, why don’t you just take the night off? I can attend her for the rest of the night.” </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>“You would do that for me?” she said happily. “Still…” </p><p>The fight between her desire for an early night and her sense of responsibility was obvious. I had a feeling that, without any external involvement, the latter would come out victorious. Luckily, nothing was preventing me from being that external force. “Don’t you trust me?” I added, doing my best to sound fragile, even managing to push a tear from the side of my eyes. Her suddenly growing eyes implied success before she managed to speak.</p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>“Of course I trust you,” she answered in hurry. I softened my expression. “Mistress is very satisfied with your service as well,” she continued in a more leisure pace, unaware of the type of satisfaction her mistress had experienced.</p><p>“Excellent,” I answered. “Why don’t you go and rest, so that you’ll be able to attend her, fresh as a daisy.” </p><p>She had left, but only after giving me a detailed breakdown of Marianne’s nightly ritual, which I memorized in just one repeat, making her relax even more about relying on me about her charge. When she left, I went to the preparation room, where a huge cauldron was filled with hot, simmering water. I filled two buckets, carrying them with a near-dashing pace, wanting to finish the preparations before Marianne lost her patience and decided to resolve her need in a solitary manner.</p><p>Several minutes and three rounds of buckets later, I was in Marianne’s bathroom, once again dressed in my towels, the room filled with steam for good measure. After one last check to make sure everything in place, I stepped out, and knocked on the door of her bedroom. “The bath is ready, my lady,” I called, doing my best to sound tricky. </p><p>She said nothing, just let out a dissatisfied grunt to notify she had heard me. I dashed back to the bathroom, just in case she decided to call me in her bedroom. An interesting proposition for sure, but I wasn’t ready to be seen by her without the protective curtain of the steam to blunt the edges. My disguise was good, but not that good. </p><p>When Marianne walked into the room, wearing a loose dressing-gown, barely held together by a sash, I could read a few emotions on her lovely face. The first was the annoyance. The reason didn’t take long to confirm. “The next time, I expect you to wait in front of my door,” she said with a sharp tone, with all the entitlement of a noblewoman used to get everything she demanded from the lower classes. </p><p>“Of course, mistress,” I answered, raising my voice to hide my desire to laugh out loud, because it wasn’t only anger I could hear in her tone. There was a strain hidden underneath, one that reminded me of the early stages of her encounter with Cornelia, before the redhead cut loose and satisfied her needs. A task that fell under my purview after my ‘accidental’ success during her last bath. </p><p>And the strain of her voice wasn’t the only indicator. With a pull, she got rid of her loosely tied sash, giving me a glimpse of her voluptuous body. Even better, the limited view thanks to the steam cloud hung between us, the view had gained an exotic quality, the resulting beauty enough to strain the capabilities of the towel wrapped around my waist that secured my secret. </p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>When she started walking, her gown flowed behind her, adding to the mystique, but after a shrug of her shoulders, the gown fell on the ground, leaving her in her birthday suit as she covered the rest of the distance with the bath. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>Showing off my amazing maid skills, I was already at the edge of the bath before her arrival, my arm raised to help her. She grabbed my hand as her feet touched the bubbles that covered the surface of the water, and helped her to lower herself, no matter how much it hurt to hide that spectacular body in the concealing embrace of the water. </p><p>I wore the bathing glove on my right hand with some soap while she soaked in the water. She reached for her wine glass, already filled with a generous amount, and took a sip that noticeably changed the amount inside. </p><p>I planned to let her wait a few minutes as she sipped some more wine, mellowing her further in collaboration with the gentle caress of the hot water, but she changed my mind when she sent a glance to my way, biting her lips at the last second to prevent herself from saying something. Likely asking me to start quicker, I presumed. As a humble servant, who I was to disappoint?</p><p>I gently grabbed her right arm, the one that wasn’t currently occupied with the wine glass, and started rubbing with my gloved hand, while the naked one supported from below. At first, the delivery was restricted to the glove, but soon, the fingers of my naked hand joined the dance, slowly going back and forth in a rhythmic pattern to support the massage. </p><p>Even more, when I reached higher parts of her arm, I positioned my left hand carefully, resulting in the back of my hand, resting ‘accidentally’ on her breast. She flinched a bit on my touch and turned to me, but I kept my eyes on her arm, not giving the slightest indication that I had noticed her gaze. A while later, she took another sip and returned her position, her eyes closed to enjoy the massage, implicitly accepting my touch. </p><p>[+100 Experience] </p><p>Satisfied with the result, I continued to dally on the upper part of her arm, while continuing to rub her breasts gently, not just for pleasure but also to make her get used to my touch. However, only after shifting into her other arm, I had realized that, in the excitement of the moment, I failed to attend a rather important task, sneakily refilling her wine glass. When I turned towards her, the wine glass was already empty, resting on the side. </p><p>“Another glass, mistress,” I asked, hoping to fix the issue, but I just received a shook of her head in return. A pity, as her tipsiness would have increased the ease of my task. But a moment later, I shrugged, as the challenge would make the eventual result only tastier. </p><p>With that decision in mind, I have subjected her other arm the same stretched out treatment while she enjoyed the gentle embrace of the water, ignoring the signs of her impatience. There was a certain pleasure in watching her as she struggled not to order me to hurry up, not wanting to risk what she thought as successful concealment of her intentions. It was interesting just how easy for her to convince her to the obviousness of the servant class… </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>Still, internalized class discrimination in the society wasn’t the topic I needed to focus right now, not when I had a unique access to such a voluptuous beauty, especially when she occasionally bristled in the water, which raised her breasts above the protective cloud the bubbles, tempting me to dismiss the caution and sink my fingers into their beautiful expanse. But I held back, focusing on slowly eroding her resistance through pleasure. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>After another extended treatment of her shoulders, I moved onto her back. On there, I decided to mix things up a bit by applying some of the knowledge I had gained from medical books. After a cursory pass with the glove, I have removed the bath glove from my hand, and pressed my thumbs on both sides of her neck, on the first knot of her spine, and started dragging them down, my other fingers caressing her back to enhance the sensation. </p><p>Thanks to my stats, it wasn’t exactly difficult to read her body language to fine-tune the pressure and the pattern of the caress I was applying on her back. I dragged my fingers down in a glacial pace, enjoying the softness of her skin while earning a moan of her. With the confirmation that I was on the right track, I focused on her back for a while, until she was straining to keep her moans inside. </p><p>I put back the bath glove before moving back to her shoulders, but this time, focusing on the front side while my hands dipped dangerously close to the curves of her breasts. No reaction from her. In the second pass, I made sure the caress the edge, the exact move that had alerted her the previous time despite her tipsiness, but this time, it went without a reaction as well. She had been mellowed enough. </p><p>It was the time to give her a full-frontal treatment, I decided as my gloved hand sank into the water, and made a pass over her breast. It was a neutral, clinical pass, easy to defend in case it angered her, but once again, it went unmentioned, with no reaction from her side, her eyes closed. When I made another pass, this time with more pressure, she reacted by a subtle pressing of her lips, but contrary to the last time, it only invigorated to go further, recognizing the sign of a held-back moan. </p><p>I continued caressing her breasts exclusively with my gloved hand, just in case of an adverse reaction, couldn’t help but feel amazed at the benefits of a well-constructed identity. </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>[+300 Experience] </p><p>As the seconds stacked tall enough to create a pile of minutes, I decided it was the time to push further. Perhaps it was ill-advised, but the glove I was wearing was limiting the sensations, giving me just a taste, making me long for more. My left hand started listening to the orders of my brain as it slowly sunk into the water, and sank into her breast. </p><p>[+250 Experience]</p><p>The feeling I was getting was heavenly, but there was still one important issue, namely, why a maid was holding her breast for such a long time. I decided to go with a simple explanation, and used my grip to raise her breast, my gloved hand washing the underside of it. Her breasts, despite their largeness, was firm and shapely enough to not to need such a treatment, but she must have been more lost in the pleasures of the flesh, because a moan, a rather throaty one, was the only reaction from her. </p><p>I let out a relaxed breath at her reaction. It was one thing to know the implicit reason for my presence, and another to get implicit permission to push even further. My naked fingers started dancing on her breasts, paying lip-service to the excuse of creating the reach, while the gloved hand hungrily danced on the bottom of her breasts. </p><p>I decided to leave another layer of caution behind and positioned my hand directly above my hand. Her nipple, hardened with arousal, started to press on my palm, tempting me to twist it toyingly. Unfortunately, that was out of the question, so I limited myself to gently increase the pressure of my palm, adding a touch of friction to the balance. Something she enjoyed, if the sudden arching of her back was any indicator. </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>But even as she started showing increased signs of arousals, her eyes stayed firmly closed, probably not wanting to be distracted from the heated daydream that was playing in her mind. Why not spice things up more, I thought as a sudden inspiration struck me. Yes, both of my hands were currently busy, not to mention using my other appendage was completely out of question, but luckily, magic was always ready to provide an answer. </p><p>It was difficult, trying to use magic this close to another accomplished student, but her rather distracted state helped me a lot, and the lessons I learned from Helga was enough to bridge the gap. I took a deep breath before slowly shaping up my mana into telekinetic force, creating an almost unnoticeable disturbance on the depths of water, just an inch away from where her legs met each other. The water started twirling as an orb, which delivered an invisible message to her most sensitive spots. </p><p>Almost, but not quite, evidenced by the increased frequency of moans, not to mention they were a touch louder as well. It was a moan that begged for a final climax. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>She was on the edge of an orgasm, and it would take a hard push into the soft flesh of her breasts, or a quickening of the small water trick I was using. And since she was already on the edge, plagued with an unmet orgasm, giving her the release she was seeking would be the nice thing to do. </p><p>Naturally, I slowed down. </p><p>It was amusing to watch her expression after I dispelled the water trick. A moment’s confusion found itself between layers of pleasure as she tried to understand the reason for the sudden loss of pleasure. And I chose that exact moment to move down even further to her stomach. Even with her eyes closed, I could read her internal argument from her expression, considering ordering me to go back to my previous post. </p><p>I could easily imagine that order leaving Cornelia’s lips, but Marianne was not as forward, even to a servant that was supposed to follow her orders. But it was convenient for me, because it gave me the excuse to dally around her stomach, my arm occasionally rubbing against her nipple under the guise of an accident, keeping her arousal up, but not to a point where she would find the climax she was seeking. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Advanced Arcana, Basic Fire Magic, Basic Politics] </p><p>While another level was always welcome, I couldn’t help but feel intrigued by the skill selection. The magical ones were quite clear, but politics was an interesting one. I hadn't seen anything remotely close in all the books I had read in the library. On the other hand, it didn’t mean much, as I was still limited to the public parts of the library, which meant that anything remotely controversial wouldn’t have a place there. And I could imagine a skill like politics hidden in the depths of the library, accessible only for the most influential noble families. Considering the interesting ways I had managed to use subterfuge, I could only begin to guess the potential for the political one. </p><p>I was tempted to choose it as my new skill, but at this point, I could ill-afford to take the risk of it turning out useless. In my circumstances, there was little application for it. I chose to improve my Arcana skill instead, wanting to maximize the benefit from my sessions with Helga. And frankly, arcana magic had too many applications for me to actually ignore. </p><p>With that resolved, I barely held back a laugh when I pulled back, only to create a panicked expression on her face. “It’s time for your legs, milady,” I said preemptively, reminding her that we were still halfway in. </p><p>[+3 Speech]  </p><p>It was nice for the system to acknowledge the trick I pulled with a double-increase of my speech skill. I walked with deliberate slowness, and when I took my new spot, her leg was already up, waiting for my attention. </p><p>Since her eyes closed, there was nothing preventing me from smirking darkly as I put my thumbs on the soles of her feet, and started rubbing both of them at the same time. Her reaction was divine. Her back arched once more, in an angle sharp enough to raise her body outside the confines of the pool, enough to give me a glimpse of her most sacred place, making me thankful that I had used a second towel to prevent a view that would have exposed the ruse. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>The amazing view she presented tempted me to give her the release she had been looking for, but not enough to break my commitment to the drawn-out route. The minutes passed as I massaged her feet first, then slowly climbing up to her calves, followed by her thighs. I enjoyed the experience, but it was a tense enjoyment, as the situation forced me to stretch my newly expanded abilities to its limits to keep her in that sweet spot, grabbed the tight embrace of pleasure, making it hard for her to think, but never enough to allow her to reach the climax, keeping her on the edge. </p><p>The shape of her face as I pulled back was simply masterful, an interesting mixture of shock and disappointment trying to worm itself to her pleasure-addled expression. </p><p>[Achievement: Measured Massage.

My voice was laced with the best-implied command I could manage, stretching my speech and manipulation to the limit. It worked for a while, as she stood up, and with my help, stepped out of the bath. I grabbed her hand, and led her towards the showering area to rinse her off. </p><p>She started to recover after the shower, though she was still tense with her unmet orgasm. She opened her mouth as I closed in once more, holding a fluffy towel in my hands. “You still look tense, mistress,” I said, keeping my eyes away from her face as appropriate. Of course, that had nothing to do with the amazing view I had as I slowly dried her body. “Maybe a massage would be helpful,” I added as I wrapped the towel around her torso. </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>“A good idea,” she answered calmly and started walking, but her blush betrayed her nervousness.

    "content": "<p>My undercover interrogation session with the young maid had worked even better than I had expected to. Not only I had managed to learn a lot about the way the servants operated, which would make my disguises even more convincing, but also I had managed to gather quite a few interesting nuggets of information about the students. Some casual, like the fact that Cornelia having two maids serving her, one younger one that handled the menial tasks, and an old matron that mostly sat around, raining orders to other servants. </p><p>Some were more interesting. Like the fact that she had, during a midnight walk -which she had been dallying with another servant or a guard if her sudden blush was any indicator- had seen Cornelia and the old maid fighting, or more accurately Cornelia shouting aggressively while the old matron ignoring her in an obvious dismissive attitude. A weird balance of power, but the implications I wasn’t able to guess without more information. </p><p>Luckily, my undercover interrogation also gave me the tools to investigate the reasons for it. The maid was more than happy to inform me that the younger maid was having some friendly walks with one of the guards, and she even saw her disappear with him a few minutes ago. </p><p>So, after leaving my unwitting informant behind, I searched for a corner, and after a few more illusions, I was dressed in the colors of House Antony, with my general looks and hair colors the same with the younger maid. Unfortunately, I hadn’t seen her, neither I had enough finesse to copy a face without fault even if I did, but I kept my head down as I walked towards Cornelia’s rooms, willing to bet that no one would pay too much attention to me. </p><p>A minute later, I was at the door. A magical probe revealed that it was warded, but it wasn’t a particularly strong one, relying on the fact that no one would dare to enter the room of such an important house without an invitation. Even better, it had an intentionally weak part, to allow someone carrying a keystone to enter without triggering the alarm. </p><p>A bad assumption, as I quietly expanded my magical reach, and copied the necessary pattern, which staggered the ward just enough for me to open the door and sneak inside. When I pulled my energy back, the protective veil was back on, a touch weaker than it was supposed to be, but I was willing to bet that Cornelia wouldn’t take notice of such a small change. </p><p>I threw a glance around the room. Cornelia’s room was better than Marianne’s in both size and furnishing, which only highlighted the relative difference of power between them. House Louis was just a minor one, while House Antony was a major one, and seemingly with a corresponding enjoyment of unnecessary opulence. And it was just the first room, with a few seats, just to greet visitors. </p><p>While I would have liked to enjoy the comforts it provided, I didn’t know when someone, either Cornelia or one of the maids, would return, so I initiated my search. Predictably, the first room, open for all visitors, didn’t have anything interesting, so I moved onto the next room, which was another sitting room, but in a more private setting. I didn’t spend too much time there either. I was tempted to swipe one of the candlesticks, made from pure silver, expensive enough to address a lot of my monetary needs, but that would be too suspicious. They were all stamped with the house crest. </p><p>But the real treasure was the bedroom, which laid behind another ward, this time stronger, more intricate. And unlike the previous one, it didn’t have an intentional weak point to allow the keystone-bearers to pass without raising an alarm. As a result, it was much more difficult to bypass without triggering. Conveniently, there was no one around, which gave me enough time to slip through it before raising an alarm, only because it was a simple design, not constructed to resist against another magic user, lacking any kind of trap that might create a backlash in case of a careless touch. </p><p>After a deep breath, I mentally reached for the strings of magic that held the ward together, carefully unfolding them, occasionally building temporary arcane holds to maintain its structural integrity, my palms sweaty with stress. It took twenty minutes, and more than two-thirds of my mana pool, to create a safe passage that would allow me to pass. </p><p>Another difficult choice awaited me. I either turned back and left, wasting the effort I had put in there, or slip inside, hoping that I would be able to unravel the same thing easier while leaving. And I had just a few seconds to decide it. </p><p>In the end, I took the step forward. I needed to have a better grasp of Cornelia, lest she upended everything I worked for without even knowing. I dismissed my temporary magical scaffolding bit by bit, letting the ward fall back its previous state, providing full coverage for the room. </p><p>“Finally,” I murmured as I looked around Cornelia’s bedroom. I would have liked to be surprised by the richness of the furnishings -rare wood, gold platings, and paintings I didn’t recognize but looked very expensive-, but after seeing the rest of her rooms, I couldn’t say that I was impressed. </p><p>I tried to apply one of the tricks I had learned from Helga, gathered my magic and then let it spread like a bubble, trying to find something worthwhile. Unfortunately, it failed spectacularly, not because it wasn’t able to find anything, but because there were too many magical items in the room. And I was afraid to put anything more than the absolute minimum behind it in fear of triggering the ward, making things even more difficult. </p><p>In the end, I decided to write it off as a loss, and observed the room, relying on the more primitive approach of using my own eyes. The first thing I noticed was her desk, with several books, and expensive-looking parchments furled open, all covered with several active runes, denoting their high value. It wasn’t exactly cheap to produce parchments strong enough to hold active runes, and they were used for valuable things.  </p><p>Moreover, I recognized some of the books, as they belonged to the private wing of the library, where it held the ones with actual precious knowledge, but the access to it was highly regulated. I was surprised that she had been allowed to remove them from the library. Apparently, being a part of an important family had even bigger benefits than I first assumed.</p><p>The other books, I failed to recognize, but since their spines with marked with the crest of House Antony, it wasn’t a huge deductive leap to accurately guess their sources. I wondered whether this information was what Helga was looking for, remembering the scroll exchange that went between them. I was tempted to steal one of them, but that would alert Cornelia about the uninvited guest in her room, and I didn’t want to jeopardize my access. And while copying would be a nice compromise, there were too many targets, especially since I didn’t know what Helga was looking for. </p><p>With that path shelved, I started going around the room, carefully opening her drawers, hoping to find a secret that would give me some kind of advantage on her. Maybe a letter, or if I’m incredibly lucky, a personal diary. Unfortunately, with each drawer I pulled open, my hopes dwindled. Maybe sneaking into her room wasn’t as well thought out as I had first envisioned. It certainly didn’t bring the treasures I had been hoping for. </p><p>The next drawer I had opened turned out to be holding her underwear, some of them in a particularly spicy variety. I snorted as I pocketed one of the particularly interesting ones, black, more lace than fabric, and see-through. Not that I had any plans of actively using them, but having them was enough. At least, I could console myself by claiming it wasn’t completely worthless!</p><p>[Achievement: Thief of Treasures. Risk your life to acquire a treasure worthy of everything. +500 Experience. +2 Agility]</p><p>I couldn’t help but let out a snort. Who would have guessed that the system had a sense of humor, which threw a lot of questions about its source, especially curious since none of the books that I had read had mentioned something like that. So, it was either a secret, or something unique to my case. Still, the resulting boost was no means unwelcome, as I could feel my body starting to move with an unfamiliar lightness, my balance significantly better. </p><p>And funny enough, I couldn’t even say the reward was excessive, as a mistake would bring the wrath of Cornelia to my head, a woman that almost killed me because I stumbled on her in a compromising position while she was in public. There was no telling what she would do if she caught me in her room, sneaking around, looking for her secrets… </p><p>I tested the system by trying to steal a few more things, but it turned out to be a one-off thing. I would still try it in a different room, but that was for a different time. </p><p>I was reaching for another drawer, indistinguishable from the rest, when I felt a flicker of magic. I instantly pulled back, and probed it with magical senses instead. “Pits of hell,” I murmured as I examined the results. I had finally found the drawer I had been looking for, which would have been good news if it wasn’t for the wards around it. At least three interlocking ones, managing to erase almost all magical presence while conveniently making the trick I had pulled on the door impossible. The wards had keyholes, for the lack of a better term, but different from the main entrance, the locks were designed with magic in mind. It wasn’t enough to have the correct keystone, they also required the correct pattern to be known. Even if it was possible to unravel them without the stones, which I wasn’t sure, it would require a much higher skill than I currently had. </p><p>But I didn’t have enough time to lament that fact, because the ward around the room suddenly started fluctuating. Simultaneously, I felt the door opening. I did the only thing I could, opened the door of the nearest wardrobe, and sneaked inside, closing the door the moment the other one started to open. </p><p>The sheer magnitude of my luckiness hit me with the full weight of a rabid dragon. It was a close call, and without the burst of agility I had experienced, I doubted that I would have been successfully sneaking my way into the wardrobe and close it behind me without making a discernible sound. </p><p>The safe thing was to close the door and ensure my concealment. Still, there was the question of the identity of the intruder, so I kept the door ajar, once again ignoring the requirements of common sense. </p><p>The intruder turned out to be an old woman, dressed in as the other servants, stepped into the room, marked with the colors of House Antony. A curious development, a maid breaking into the privacy of her mistress. Combined with the gossips about their fights, it created an even more interesting picture. </p><p>But I was more interested in the way she was moving. For once, she had a straight, confident gait as she walked, something that would fit better to a minor noble rather than a servant, especially one that was currently invading the privacy of her mistress. Even if she didn’t know about Cornelia’s impending arrival, the way she systemically went through the same drawers I had gone through, but she went through its contents with impudence, uncaring of the mess she left in her wake. </p><p>I felt excited as she neared the warded drawer that had stymied me quite a bit. She wouldn’t have been able to open it, of course, but the reaction to her attempt might have given me some clues. </p><p>Before that could happen, the sound of door slamming reached my ear, followed by a set of hurried steps. When the bedroom opened in the same aggressive manner, I wasn’t surprised when it revealed Cornelia, her face contorted with anger. </p><p>I couldn’t help but admire the maid when she turned towards Cornelia, in a shocking display of calmness. I doubted that I would be able to stay as calm, especially when facing Cornelia, even angrier than the night that almost ended with my death. “Can I help you, mistress Cornelia,” she said calmly, but even more interestingly, I managed to catch a hint of amusement on her tone, which made me even more curious. </p><p>“What are you doing in my room,” Cornelia said, the words leaving her mouth in a slow, methodical rhythm, one might trick a passerby to think that she was calmer, but I could sense the oppressive waves of magic that was rolling off her with each word. It also had the added benefit of showing me the gulf of power between us. </p><p>“I’m going through the periodical cleaning of your room as I’m ordered, milady,” she said, still calm. </p><p>“Fuck your orders,” Cornelia said, slamming her hand on the door. When she pulled back, there was a scorch mark on the door. “Didn’t I tell you that you will stay away from my room, you old shrew.” </p><p>“Be careful, milady. Such displays are not befitting the presumptive heiress of your esteemed house,” she told haughtily. </p><p>“Don’t patronize me, you old crone, I ordered you to get out of my room,” Cornelia said, but still unmoved. </p><p>“And should I remind you that the orders from the Lord of the House always take the precedence, and he ordered me to keep your rooms in good order.” </p><p>“Not the lord, but the regent,” Cornelia said as she took a step forward, her hand covered in flames. “Don’t dare to call that bastard the lord of the house in front of me again, you pathetic bat!”</p><p>The last thing I expected was for the maid to look even smugger, tinged with satisfaction. She said nothing as Cornelia closed in, and stood in front of her. I didn’t know exactly why the maid was goading Cornelia, but it was clear that it was somehow linked to inheritance, otherwise, there wouldn’t be that much needling on the correct form of the titles. </p><p>Cornelia managed to suppress her anger before physically harming the maid, which weirdly enough, made her look disappointed. “I would leave if you desire so, milady,” the maid said as she walked out. “But you need to be more careful to keep your room in order if you are determined to reject my help. We wouldn’t want to be known that the heiress of our glorious House is a slob, would be?” With that, she left the room, leaving the door open. </p><p>Cornelia closed with a wave of her hand, magically slamming it shut. The silencing ward came up just a moment later, and then a shimmering shield appeared in the middle of the room, absorbing the bolts of fire she started to throw, each accompanied by a furious cry. </p><p>I would have liked to say that I watched her display of anger calmly, but that would be a lie. All it would take for her to check her wardrobe, and I would be dead… A fear that stayed close to the surface during the several long minutes that Cornelia rained flames on the surface, proving that her nickname, Queen of Flames, was not just an empty boast. </p><p>Luckily, neither anger nor mana was boundless, even for Cornelia. After a while, she dispelled the shield, and sat on her bed, breathing heavily, occasionally muttering, too quiet for me to hear, but from her expression, I guessed that they were curses. But even that didn’t last long. She moved to open the warded drawer, the one that I wasn’t even able to start trying. </p><p>She pressed her ring on the center, then flared her magic in a weird, unbalanced way, which was likely a pattern to complete the physical part of the key. It seemed that she took the security of that particular drawer very seriously. After the drawer was open, she carefully pulled a stack of paper, either letters or legal documents, and quickly counted them. All must be there, as she was considerably calmer as she put them back on and reengaged the defensive wards. </p><p>She returned to her bed, and her back was turned as she reached for the strings that held her robe together. I lamented the fact that I was missing an amazing view. When she finished unfastening it, she pushed it off her shoulders, and it fell on the ground, and my annoyance evaporated with it as I examined her beautiful figure, drabbed in a sexy corset and equally sexy panties. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>Still, the burst of experience I received wasn’t the only interesting about it. Even from my restricted angle, it was obvious that her corset wasn’t correctly placed, with half of its strings untied. Apparently, Cornelia’s annoyance wasn’t just at the presumption of her maid, but also for her timing, cutting her fun-time prematurely. With Marianne, I guessed, based on the fact that she was wearing something softly sexy rather than danger-and-domination themed one she had been wearing while her extended encounter with Helga. </p><p>I had been expecting her to fix her underwear before wearing her robe once more, which was why I was pleasantly surprised when, after a brief struggle with its thin straps, her corset followed the same path with her robe, and ended up on the floor, giving me the full view of her naked back. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>It was the first time I had the pleasure of examining her body without distraction. Tall, lithe, yet curvy where it counted, under the shimmering light of her room, she looked like a masterpiece, like a sword wrapped with a scabbard inlaid with rubies, sharp, beautiful, but with a potential to turn deadly in any moment. Though, the threat only made my boner harder as I watched her to remove her panties. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>I had been cautiously hoping that the next thing she had in mind was to have a nice shower, though a part of me treating that cautious part like a traitor. While missing out on the show would leave me with blue balls, it would also make things significantly easier. </p><p>But it turned out that my twisted yet beautiful luck was working overtime, as she chose to throw herself on her bed, with a perfect angle to give me an excellent view of the treasure between her legs, a rather tantalizing view even before her fingers joined the battle, and started caressing her folds in a surprising urgency, like she was using the rush of pleasure to counter her stress. A good strategy, and it was certainly working out for me.</p><p>[+200 Experience] </p><p>And what kind of man I would be if I didn’t use such a beautiful opportunity to its full extent. I pulled my shaft out while trying to make no sound, and started caressing it. Gently, as I was afraid of the possibility of alerting her if I used a more frantic pace, but luckily, the beautiful sight in front of me left no need for such assistance. The adrenaline from the fear of getting caught was just the sprinkles on top. </p><p>Under these factors, it wasn’t a surprise when I arrived at the finish line before Cornelia despite her head-start, leaving my mark on the interior of her wardrobe. Soon, Cornelia shuddered for a moment, marking the completion of her objective, but it was a short one, consisting just a shudder or two before she stood up, and walked out of her room after picking a towel, probably for a relaxing bath.   </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>And she didn’t bother reestablishing the complicated ward on the door, putting an extremely simple one in place instead, just enough to prevent her maid from going around. After listening for a minute, making sure that there was no one in the living room to notice my retreat, I escaped from the room, letting out a relaxed breath only after I managed to find a corner, and transform into a generic servant with no house colors. </p><p>Still, all included, I couldn’t say that I was dissatisfied with the results. Even with the exhaustion from my almost depleted mana and the stress from several close calls, my expedition resulted in a generous bundle of information, with a few secrets included. </p><p>Now, I just needed to find a way to use them… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 5        Experience: 13040 / 15000</p><p>Strength: 6    Charisma: 12</p><p>Precision: 9    Perception: 9</p><p>Agility: 9     Manipulation: 11</p><p>Speed: 6       Intelligence: 8</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 190 / 190    Mana: 45 / 285             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (43/50)     </p><p>Basic Arcana [25/25]        </p><p>Basic Speech 12/25        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>When Jenny returned from the kitchen, she was prepared to drown her annoyance with liquid refreshment, carrying a generously-filled wine glass for herself, and another scotch for me. “Thanks, Jenny, you’re an angel,” I said, and she blushed. It wasn’t the first compliment she had received from me during the dinner, but it was the first one that I delivered correctly, both in tone and in timing, letting my eyes on her face just enough to convey attraction without being pushy. With Natalie away, I could finally start my efforts of seduction. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured. “So, how is working with Natalie, is it enjoyable?” she asked, a bit quicker than normal, signaling that my compliment worked just as intended. </p><p>“It’s a delight,” I said, and launched a few stories from the work, all of which factually correct at the core, but details slightly transformed to create a portrait of strong alliance, where I was working with Natalie to save the business from the brink of destruction, while experiencing quite a few humorous situations on the way. </p><p>I already knew from her earlier treatment that Natalie hadn’t told her anything about the exact balance of our relationship, but the genuine reactions she showed to my stories confirmed it. Another mistake on Natalie’s part, letting her allies ride to the battle with misinformation. Well, she would learn her mistake when her ally ended up being ridden all night long.</p><p>The tales continued until Jenny was focused on my words rather than the annoyance she felt towards Natalie. At one point, I stood up to tell a particularly lively part of the story, and when it finished, I sat next to her rather than across, reinforcing my message with a few innocent touches, which made her breath quicken for some reason! </p><p>“Actually, there is something I wanted to tell you,” I said after a brief lull in the conversation. “We were talking with Natalie before she left, and she admitted to me that it wasn’t just for a social gathering that she called me here.” She looked at me questioningly. “She mentioned something about returning the favor for her birthday.” </p><p>“Right…” Jenny murmured absentmindedly before her eyes grew in shock. “Birthday!” she exclaimed. “As in…” she tried to continue, but the embarrassment didn’t allow her to finish. Her eyes darted to the stairs, which led to her bedroom. </p><p>“Exactly,” I said. “I know it’s a bit awkward to open, but I wanted to see if you’re on board with the idea. I didn’t want you to be ambushed with it.” </p><p>“I - yes - maybe - I don’t know,” she said with rapid succession, confusion overwhelming her. She jumped up to her feet, going back and forth, trying to sort her thoughts. She pulled her phone, ready to call. “Maybe you should text,” I reminded her innocently. “It’s better if Elena doesn’t hear, is it?” I added. </p><p>“Good idea,” she acknowledged before turning her attention back to her phone, her fingers dancing rapidly on the keyboard. Messaging took a few minutes, but I could see her relaxing more with each message, her gaze lingering on me longer and longer. </p><p>I pointedly didn’t say anything as she closed her phone and put it back in her pocket. She was equally silent, but she chose to sit next to me once again, which I took as a positive sign. “So,” she murmured, trying to keep her eyes on the floor, but occasionally darting towards me.  </p><p>I said nothing at first, just stood up and walked behind her, putting my hands on her shoulders, gently rubbing while waiting for her to process the enormity of the situation. Her stiffness melted under my touch, and soon, she started to purr under my touch like a cat. </p><p>A few minutes later, I stopped massaging, and walked in front of her. She avoided my gaze, feeling shy, so I grabbed her chin, gently raising until I was looking directly into her eyes. “It’s your choice,” I said. “But maybe a trial would help you to make a decision.</p><p>“How-” she asked, but that was the only word she was able to utter, cut short by the presence of my lips. She stiffened at the sudden intrusion, but that stiffness lived even shorter, her lips following the rhythm of mine. Soon, her speed started to pick up, like her excitement broke through the dam of her control. </p><p>Soon, I felt her hands on my body, particularly on the lower half of my body, where my legs merged with my torso. “Naughty,” I said when I pulled back for a breather. </p><p>“You can’t expect me to decide before inspecting the merchandise,” she answered, trying to be glib and confident, an attitude that would have been more convincing if it wasn’t for her face, a shade lighter than her auburn hair. </p><p>“Go ahead, then,” I said even as I stood upright, which, since she was still sitting, gave her the perfect angle to play around with her object of interest. Her eyes darted up, only to slid away when met with my amused gaze, but her shyness didn’t prevent her hands from continuing their exploration. Apparently, Brenda was even more right than I had given her credit for about Jenny’s desire for her type of threesome. </p><p>At first, she restricted herself to caress over my pants, making me worry about her patience. Things would get really complicated if she decided to wait until Natalie’s arrival. But luckily, her self-control turned out to be more frayed than my worst-case assumptions, evidenced by the number of the times her fingers moved around the zipper of my pants. </p><p>“Waiting for Natalie to unwrap the gift,” I asked. </p><p>“Umm, yes,” she murmured. “That’s what I should do, right?” she asked, but her tone was begging to be convinced otherwise. </p><p>“That’s for you to decide, but you should consider the fact that she was the one that decided to leave us alone, using the airport trip as an excuse. Maybe she had a reason for that.” </p><p>“Maybe,” she said, but in her tone, there was a resistance I failed to break. She stilled as she considered my words, but she made me relax when she reached for her phone for another quick text, her smile brightening with the reply. </p><p>“Should I assume a positive response,” I said, but she had more important things to worry about than my rhetorical questions. An intense concentration was on her face as she pulled my zipper down and reached inside. She was happy with the proportions of the gift she had found under the wraps if her suddenly-brightening expression was any indicator. She had to pull her hand out for a brief struggle with my belt when she had trouble pulling it out of the confines. </p><p>“So big,” she whispered in fascination as she wrapped her hand around gently, her fingers failing to meet around the thickness of my endowment. Her hand moved up and down on its length like she was trying to assess whether she could take its entirety together, her lips parted, her tongue darting out, tempting me to push forward in a reckless abandon. </p><p>That, unfortunately, was not on the menu yet, not until Natalie’s arrival, where I could use the consequences of our bet to change the balance of the evening even further. I didn’t say anything, and I hadn’t needed to, not when Jenny was examining my length with her full attention, coming closer and closer like a butterfly fascinated by the flame. </p><p>“Do you mind if I sit down,” I said suddenly, making her flinch just before her lips touched my shaft. I wanted her to start, of course, but continuously standing up while she tried to gather her courage to push for more would get tiring quick. And I needed the energy for the rest of the night. </p><p>She nodded after flinching, realizing what she was about to do. I sat down next to her before she could process that, and put my hand on her knee, not high enough to scare her, but enough to keep her from standing up. Not forcefully of course, but for a woman with her personality, a subtle touch was stronger than chains. </p><p>“Feel free to continue,” I said to her, which made her ears burn red, but she nevertheless took the offer and wrapped her fingers around my shaft once more. I waited until the beats of her movement quickened, then put my hand on her shoulder in a gentle caress that went unnoticed in her concentration. </p><p>I matched my intensity with hers, increasing it further as her grip tightened around my girth. She gave me complete access to her back as she leaned further, which was already uncovered by the backless dress she was wearing. But the tightness of her dress was preventing her from reaching her real reward. </p><p>Like any selfless person would do, I decided to help her. My fingers found the complicated knot around her neck, the one that was holding her dress in place, and started to pull it, slowly to not to alarm her. Distracted by the circumstances, she only realized it when her dress started to slide down, her hands too late to prevent its descent, meeting around her chest instead, managing to hide her spectacular breasts before I could get more than a fleeting glimpse. </p><p>She sent an accusing glare at me, but I just nodded towards my lap to remind her of the situation, a slight smile on my face to convey just how ridiculous her reaction was from my perspective. After all, we were about to start a threesome the moment her girlfriend entered the room, not to mention she was getting a preview of the main selling point. “It’s a bit silly, isn’t it,” she said as she let her arms go, revealing her breasts for me to enjoy, adorned by her pointy nipples. </p><p>“I hadn’t said anything,” I answered, and she snorted. But more importantly, when she wrapped her hand around my girth once more, she chose the lower half, reserving the topside for more interesting activities. </p><p>“Do you think Natalie would be angry if I sampled the goods a bit,” she asked once again, her tone begging for a positive response. </p><p>“Of course not,” I answered. “Why would she, after going all the trouble to give you the present you deserve.” </p><p>That small push was enough to help her make the decision she wanted to make all along. She leaned forward in a torturous slowness, so I started to caress her back, hoping the pleasure would make her go faster. She shivered, but picked up speed, until she captured the head of my shaft, celebrated by an enthusiastic moan. </p><p>She stayed like that for a moment before her lips started to dance over my length, accompanied by moans. It wasn’t really pleasurable at first, with her movements choppy and mechanical, making me fear that she was inexperienced in dealing with males, but the skill she was showing started to increase soon after, suggesting that she was just a bit rusty due to her almost-exclusive relationship with Natalie. </p><p>Ignoring the ever-present temptation of pushing her head down for a surprise deepthroat, I let my fingers dance over her back, and she followed the rhythm by increasing the speed she was caressing the lower-half. When her other hand joined the fray, playing with my balls, the pleasure I had been feeling compounded even further. </p><p>I let my fingers to slide even lower, helped by the fact that her dress was already down. After a brief dance around the edge of her breasts, where I distracted myself by feeling her heartbeat on my fingertips, I started to move towards the center, leaving a spiral track behind. Her only response was to increase her speed further.  </p><p>But it wasn’t true for my next action. Continuing their path, my fingers ended around her nipples, which were nice and stiff, begging for my attention. I squeezed it softly, which made her pull back for a moment to let out a moan, only to return her task immediately after. </p><p>I was expecting her to react by pulling back shyly, but it was a fortunate miscalculation. As she returned the task on hand, or more accurately, in her mouth, I used the opportunity to introduce my other hand to the game. </p><p>I put my hand on her knee once more, but this time, climbing upward at a determined pace until I had the total control of her inner thigh. That made her stiffen in alarm, but it wasn’t an alarm that was intense enough to make her pull back from the delicious activity she had been conducting. </p><p>It was a good thing that Jenny was distracted, because it allowed her to miss the fact that her phone had been ringing for the last few minutes, something I noticed when I glanced at her side, where she had put her phone. It was Natalie calling. Luckily, it was in silent mode, so Jenny hadn’t noticed it. </p><p>I checked my own to see a message from Elena, from five minutes ago, informing that Natalie had dropped her at the airport after a long, but ultimately fruitless -for Natalie- flirting session. I pulled away from Jenny’s toned legs for a moment and pushed her phone between couch cushions with a subtle push. I didn’t want Jenny to talk with Natalie until I could seal the deal. I wanted Natalie to come home suspicious but without certainty, only to see the scene of her total defeat with her own eyes. </p><p>But for that, I needed to make her stop the blowjob she was delivering in a torturous slowness, turning more and more intentional as her skills awakened through practice. I decided to use the most enjoyable strategy available, using her pleasure as the weapon of my will. My fingers started to dance on her breasts, compensating their smallness with their sensitivity, while my other hand started to invade higher territories on her leg. Her intensifying moans suggested that I was on the right track. </p><p>I could have pushed her more, of course, but under the circumstances, it was for the best if she took the next step herself. That didn’t mean I would let her stay in the same position for a long time, of course, but thankfully, the removed that need by pulling herself back, her face flushed with pleasure and desire, a dazed look dancing in her eyes. </p><p>Her distracted state was useful for my next step. When I grabbed the skirt of her dress and pulled up, she rose in her seat absentmindedly, allowing me to roll her dress up, revealing the fact that she had chosen a dainty g-string as underwear, which had failed miserably to hide anything after being subjected to her wetness. She raised her arms equally absentmindedly when I pulled the dress off her body. </p><p>That distraction didn’t survive the next step, when I grabbed her arm and pulled her to my lap, letting out a panicked yelp. “Don’t worry, nothing extreme will happen, you still have your panties,” I said, neatly avoiding their unlikely chance of survival. </p><p>“Maybe it’s too much,” she answered worriedly, but her body apparently didn’t share her apprehension, evident by the way she straddled on my lap, directly above my presence, and started grinding. Once again, it wasn’t the most amazing I received, but her clumsy enthusiasm went a long way to compensate for it. </p><p>I didn’t give an answer to her assertion, and she didn’t repeat it, too busy gasping under my attention when I leaned forward and put a lingering kiss on her neck. Her hands wrapped around my neck, pulling me closer, suggesting that her sensitivity wasn’t limited to her nipples. </p><p>Meanwhile, her hips started to pick up the pace, with a speed even greater than I had been expecting. She must have missed the touch of a male even more than I had first assumed. To help her forward, I brought my lips against her nipple, assaulting it with a wet kiss, her moans loud enough to fill the room. </p><p>Deciding to test my luck, I brought my hands to her g-string, carefully holding from both sides before pulling, ripping them off a simple but sharp action. Somehow, she didn’t even notice their disappearance, or too overwhelmed by our naked touch to actually comment on it. </p><p>Without the protection -however limited- of her panties, it was only a matter of time before she caused an accident. It came when I brought my hand on the small of her back, caressing softly. That managed to distract her enough to pull back a bit more than necessary, and a sudden warmth enveloped my length when she moved forward. </p><p>“Oh, no!” she cried, but none of the protest her words implied could be found in her tone. She tried to pull back, but it a weak, listless move, easily prevented by my strategically-placed hand. </p><p>“There is no harm in starting a few minutes early, right?” I asked reassuringly. “And, isn’t it her fault for being this late. She should have hurried back home faster.” </p><p>“I- you think so?” she replied, grabbing my weak excuse with both hands, not even waiting a moment before starting to move back and forth, each repeat pushing me deeper into her tight grasp. </p><p>Since she didn’t need an answer, I hadn’t bothered to give her one, instead, choosing to slide my hand through red strands of her hair, and pulled her head back, making her reveal her eyes, with a hungry excitement dancing in their green depths. I considered capturing her lips with a searing kiss, but decided against, just in case it would make her pull back. I had already won the bet, but I wanted Natalie to see the evidence in her own eyes, which was the reason I was using the living room for it. </p><p>Jenny was jumping on my lap with a reckless abandon, her arms wrapped tight around me when the door opened and Natalie stepped inside, a pose I had arranged to make sure she would miss the initial shock on the face of her girlfriend. </p><p>And what a delicious expression of shock she had. It was the same expression I had seen on her face in the casino, where she had managed to lose all of her personal investments and a significant chunk of company expense accounts due to a miscalculation. Like that night, she stumbled forward silently, trying to process the moment. </p><p>Victory, I mouthed silently, not bothering to hide the sense of superiority I was feeling. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t repeat the plan as we walked towards the entrance of Natalie’s house, something Elena wouldn’t enjoy. She didn’t appreciate being treated as a stereotypical blonde, even in the context of her job. She might not lash out immediately to a client, but she would somehow get revenge, which might be quite radical depending on the severity of the insult. So, I just nodded towards her at the door and received a nod in return. Only then, I rang the bell. </p><p>The door opened a moment later, revealing Natalie, who was dressed in a loose blue dress, one that would be casual if it wasn’t for the rather deep cut in the front, displaying her assets as much as possible without coming across as gauche and tasteless. But the more impressive reveal of the night was her girlfriend, who chose a tight white dress, most of it back absent, showing off her lithe figure, her red hair spilling on her shoulders in a complicated pattern. It was good to have a variance between the redheads. Tiffany was curvy enough to fill my hands, and now Jenny, thin, shapely, and if I was reading correctly, flexible enough to handle an interesting range of positions. </p><p>It was fortunate that I was experienced in hiding my emotions, allowing me to suppress my desire to burst out laughing as a stark realization spread across Natalie’s face as she took note that not only I had brought an unannounced guest along, but that guest was someone she was familiar with. “It was Jennifer, right?” I said as I presented my hand for a semi-formal handshake, ignoring Natalie’s plight in favor of focusing on her girlfriend. </p><p>“Call me Jenny,” she corrected as she shook my hand cheerfully. From her mannerism, it was clear that she would be more comfortable with a hug, but I rather not spook Natalie this early. The presence of Elena was surprise enough. </p><p>“May I present to you Elena, an old friend that was in the town for the day,” I said. </p><p>“A pleasure, dear,” Elena said as she enveloped Jenny in a tight hug, signaling that she didn’t share the same complications with me. I acted like I didn’t notice the sudden storm that started to brew on Natalie’s face. But it wasn’t the only bomb that Elena was willing to drop. She turned to Natalie after pulling back. “Hi Nat, a pleasure to see you again,” she added, giving an even tighter hug, which made a fresh layer of suspicion appear on Jenny’s face. </p><p>“I didn’t know that you knew his date as well,” Jenny said in a sharpness I hadn’t expected from such a sweet girl. But jealousy had a way of transforming people. I wondered about the reason for the sudden spike. She might be one of the people that were naturally jealous, though considering the things I had learned about -and had done to- Natalie, it wasn’t inconceivable that she had legitimate reasons for her response. </p><p>“We met at the airport, on the way back from the last business trip,” Natalie explained quickly. “Right, Elena?” </p><p>Elena chose that moment to display her acting skills. “Of course,” she said, but let her eyes grow wide just for a moment, perfectly copying the stress of a secret almost discovered, not to mention her voice was just high enough to fan Jenny’s fears without confirming them, all without giving Natalie something she could focus on. “Last Wednesday, right?” she added, dropping another bomb to the fire. </p><p>“Saturday,” Natalie corrected sharply, which was a hopeless action, as I could see that it already solidified on Jenny’s mind that there was a secret that she was unaware, and she would dig for it. And considering the things that happened on that visit, I would be surprised if Natalie could take any question about that time calmly.  </p><p>“Your home looks amazing, Natalie,” I said, deflecting the discussion in a display of tone-deafness, using the stereotypes about the male population to my benefit. And just like that, the discussion was cut short, but leaving as a question-mark in Jenny’s mind. To make things better, Natalie couldn’t just open the discussion once more without making Jenny even more suspicious. </p><p>The game between me and Natalie started with an unexpected early score. </p><p>“Thanks,” Natalie said, her voice sharp despite her struggle to keep her sudden sourness away from her voice. “Let me give you a small tour,” she said. </p><p>“Would you mind showing me the location of the ladies room, as well,” said Elena, interjecting herself to the situation. </p><p>“Let me help,” Jenny jumped before Natalie could answer, clearly not willing to leave her girlfriend with Elena. Her jealousy was stroked easily, I realized. Jenny led Elena away while Natalie led me in a short tour of the first floor, intent on keeping the discussion casual. </p><p>I didn’t want that, of course. “Trouble in paradise,” I said with a grin the moment the others disappeared at the stairs. </p><p>“Just a momentary flare,” Natalie said dismissively, her desire to keep me away from her personal issues obvious. Unfortunately, she made the biggest mistake by following Brenda’s suggestion and inviting me to her home. </p><p>“I see. I should have told her not to worry. It’s not like there is a chance that you can steal her from me,” I added in an equally dismissive manner before asking another casual question about the house. She didn’t reply to my offhand comment, but I could see that my dismissal annoyed her badly. Excellent, I thought. Now, all I needed was for her to bite the bait, and I would have an amusing night. There was a chance that my dear boss would ignore the opportunity to get back at me, staying focused on her original plan instead, but it wasn’t very likely. </p><p>We moved back to the living room after the short discussion ended, talking casually when Jenny returned from her short trip without Elena, who decided to give me space to work the targets a bit. “Hello, beautiful,” I said with a goofy manner while facing Jenny, in a slightly exaggerated manner that made her chuckle, but otherwise shook her head dismissively. It wasn’t the best way of seducing someone, but that was intentional. I needed to make Natalie feel confident on that front. </p><p>As I hoped, Natalie ignored the significance of my lighthearted flirting, and started talking about something inconsequential about politics, the perfect material for a casual dinner between colleagues. Jenny left the room to bring some refreshments, and Elena walked in before a minute passed, clearly waiting for her chance. </p><p>“Sorry to keep you waiting,” Elena said as she walked closer to me. I patted the seat next to me, inviting her close, but after a slight stiffening, she chose to sit a seat much closer to Natalie. Natalie sent me a smug glare, which passed in a moment later. </p><p>Keeping my laughter suppressed at that moment was one of the biggest challenges I had ever experienced in my life. Natalie’s unwarranted confidence was showing itself once more, making her forget the results of the previous times she pitted her will against mine. </p><p>Or maybe she was remembering them, which might be a problem to itself. In every situation, from her perspective, I only won because of pure luck. She thought that it was mostly her own mistake that made her end up in that casino, or my ‘accidental’ stumbling onto the files that held the fake expenses that made her threw herself to my lap in an attempt to distract me from sending them to audit in the office, and it was my luck that I knew the executive in the company that suddenly decided to cancel our orders. Altogether, it created an interesting picture of negligence. </p><p>I made a few poor attempts to interject into the discussion between Natalie and Elena, but Elena kept her attention on Natalie, acting fascinated by her boring anecdotes. I stayed there, doing my best impression of a kicked puppy, which made Natalie smile victoriously. </p><p>A few minutes later, Elena managed to rub her face the wrong way, disrupting her lipstick, which gave her the excuse for another quick bathroom visit without raising any question about her heath. The moment she disappeared, Natalie turned to me with a vicious expression, one that tempted me to impale her until that was replaced with grudging obedience, but I held myself back. </p><p>Patience was a virtue. </p><p>“Trouble in paradise?” Natalie asked in glee, happy to stab me with the same conversational dagger I had wielded just moments ago. </p><p>“Nothing important, just a momentary phase,” I answered, trying to sound affronted. </p><p>“It didn’t seem like it.” </p><p>“Just a phase,” I repeated, underlining my position. </p><p>“If you say so,” Natalie said, her grin threatening to spill out of her face. “But if I were you, I wouldn’t be too confident about your earlier assertion?” </p><p>“What assertion?” I asked, despite being well-aware of what she was talking about. </p><p>“The one declaring that there was no way I could take her away from you.” </p><p>I took a breath before answering, trying to get into the correct mood. At that moment, I needed to reflect a layer of bravado, but cracked enough to reveal a core of wounded male pride, trying to use deflection as a defense mechanism. “If I were you, I wouldn’t propose any bets, not like you have a great track record.” </p><p>From the way her smile stiffened, accompanied by a flash of anger in her eyes, I could deduce that my ploy was successful. “A bet, you say,” she murmured. “Under which conditions?” </p><p>“You’re serious,” I said, fake-flinching to further sell the ruse. </p><p>“Like a heart attack,” she pounced. “Unless you’re cowardly enough to take back your word, of course.” </p><p>“But-” I started, which put a mocking edge to her smile. “Why not, if you think you can handle the consequences,” I added, but once again keeping my voice fragile. After all, why should I warn her about the trap she just stepped in? </p><p>“If I were you, I wouldn’t worry about that,” she answered. </p><p>I waited for a moment, then jumped like a fresh lawyer who just realized the existence of a winning argument. “I need to drop her to the airport just an hour or two, do you think you can handle that in such a short period.” </p><p>“It will be when I drop her in the airport instead,” she answered, happy to come up with such a genius statement, ignoring the fact that it would leave me alone with her girlfriend, or too confident in relationship to worry. I would be glad to teach her the mistake of it. “Unless you’re a cowardly chicken, of course.” </p><p>“And what’s the bet?” I said. </p><p>“My debt to you is no more,” she said. </p><p>“Really?” I said, this time not bothering to hide my smirk. I wasn’t expecting her to be this greedy, not that I had a problem with it. “Honey, that’s not pocket change that we’re talking about,” I said. “Are you willing to put something worthwhile on the table.” </p><p>“Whatever you want,” Natalie said, excited by the possibility of paying back for her humiliation and saving herself from a huge financial burden at the same time.</p><p>“For the next year, you will come to my office whenever I want, and follow my commands exactly in there,” I said, smirking at the way her face transformed. </p><p>“That’s too much-” she tried to say, but I cut her off.</p><p>“Scared?” I said, mocking her. </p><p>“I accept, but only under the condition that I will see your resignation letter on my table first thing Monday,” she said. </p><p>I acted stunned for a moment. After all, we were talking about a multi-million non-compete agreement. “Only if we remove the restriction of the office from the bet,” I said. “For the next year, you’ll be my toy, whenever I want, however I want, no matter the audience? Deal?” </p><p>Even then, Natalie didn’t think before giving a confident nod, sure of her victory, not having a clue that she was being manipulated. “And how we’re going to be sure about what happened.” </p><p>“Video evidence,” I said. “And of course, the victory condition is the full penetration, from you to her. No high school bullshit about kisses or second bases. Full conquest, or nothing.” </p><p>“Deal,” Natalie said, presenting her hand for a shake, unaware that she was signing away her freedom. </p><p>“Your funeral,” I said, this time with no problem to let my confidence show. “But let me give you a fair warning, Elena is a real tease.” I gave her the warning only because I could see that the time for warnings had already passed. The confidence had solidified on her face, enjoying the thrill of a definite victory early. </p><p>Before she could answer, we were distracted by a familiar voice. “You guys look chipper,” said Jenny, who just walked into the living room, carrying a tray of wine, and a stout glass filled with a bright amber liquid. </p><p>“We managed to solve a particularly tricky thing about the marketing plan,” Natalie said in the rapid confidence of a serial liar, not even pausing to think. It wasn’t perfect, her words were more forceful than what was necessary, and the eye contact was unnecessary. It was one of the things that separated a skilled amateur from a professional. </p><p>“Good, because I don’t want work-talk at the table, it’s going to be a strictly social evening.” </p><p>“That works well for me,” I answered even as I reached for the tray. “The scotch is for me, right?” </p><p>Jenny nodded, and I took the glass, draining it quickly, giving the excuse Natalie needed to drop Elena to the airport instead. I took a generous sip. “An excellent choice.” </p><p>“Thanks, but Natalie was the one that chose it,” Jenny said, and I raised my glass to Natalie in appreciation before draining the rest. </p><p>“Weren’t you going to drop your friend back to the airport,” Natalie asked, acting like she just realized it. </p><p>“Damn it, I forgot. She is going to kill me.” I stopped for a second. “Natalie, could you do me a favor and drop her to the airport instead.” </p><p>She was quick to hide her satisfied smile, making it disappear before Jenny could turn to face her. “I don’t know, maybe we could call a taxi?” she said, playing it off to sound reluctant. </p><p>“Please, boss,” I pushed forward, somehow managing not to put a mocking edge to the word. Then, I turned to Jenny and asked. “It’s not a bother for you, is it,” I asked. </p><p>“Of course not,” came Jenny’s rapid answer, the obligations of being a hostess forcing her hand, even though it was clear that she wanted to do the opposite of it. A flare of jealousy passed through her field of vision, but Natalie missed it, too busy enjoying my supposed mistake. </p><p>“Excellent, you’re a doll,” I said, a diminutive statement that Jenny didn’t enjoy if her scrunched face, and Natalie’s widening smile, was any indicator. </p><p>Then, Elena arrived, and marking the start of one of the most unwieldy social situations I had experienced. On the one hand, I needed to flirt with Natalie’s girlfriend without actually succeeding, but also without turning her off completely. On the other hand, I needed to screen the flow between Jenny and Natalie so that Natalie could focus on Elena without Jenny noticing. And like it wasn’t difficult enough, I needed to make the latter seem accidental not to make Natalie suspicious. </p><p>That much was manageable but difficult. But of course, there was also Elena, who wasn’t really happy with my improvisation, because it suddenly reduced her role quite a bit. Her revenge came in a way that fit her personality, in the form of her hand, discreetly caressing my length, just enough to make sitting extremely uncomfortable, all while subtly flirting with Natalie. </p><p>It was a difficult hour, but finally, Elena made a show of checking her phone. “It’s the time for my plane,” Elena said as she stood up. Natalie nodded, trying not to be seen too enthusiastic, but she let enough to slip, and Jenny sent a suspicious glare to her. </p><p>“You won’t be late, do you, honey,” Jenny said possessively, who, despite our best efforts, was starting to get suspicious. “We still have the dessert, of course.” </p><p>“Actually, honey, it might be for the best if you served the dessert to Nathan. You never know just how long the traffic might take,” Natalie said, ignoring Jenny’s pointed glare. Natalie noticed Jenny’s annoyance, but playing obvious worked better for her. After all, if she won tonight, not only she would get a huge financial windfall, but also she would get rid of me. </p><p>Too bad that she didn’t realize that, once again, she was playing a rigged game…</p><p>They left, leaving me alone with Jenny. “Another scotch?” she said as she stood up, and I nodded. While she was in the kitchen, I received a message from Elena, informing me that she had managed to swipe Natalie’s phone, which would allow her to answer instead of Natalie. </p><p>Now, everything was ready to start the plan… </p>",

    "title": "A Gamer Adventure 7",
    "content": "<p>I was back in the library, doing my mind-numbingly boring menial tasks. I couldn’t say I disliked the opportunity though, as it gave me the excuse to think about more important things, such as the close calls I had experienced the previous day. During those events, I had stretched my abilities to the limit, both magical and mundane, risking everything, though the reward I received was above my expectations as well, giving me a job with an amazing perk, continuous access to Marianne’s naked curves…</p><p> For that reason, I had picked a few books on anatomy and medicine, trying to get some hints on how to improve my massage technique. While it was tempting to get a few skills on the topic. My performance was satisfactory, but there was no harm in enhancing it further.</p><p>But the situation with Marianne wasn’t my only noteworthy achievement, I thought as I glanced towards the table where Helga was sitting, her eyes turning towards the corridor with an unexpected frequency. Apparently, I had managed to impress her quite a bit, or more accurately, our mysterious ranger did. She was even sitting on a table close to the corridor rather than skulking in a hidden one to avoid any student that might be struck with the idea of bullying her. </p><p>It was interesting just how much a crush affected her usual behavior. I would have expected her to act more jaded, but it seemed that the continuous isolation left her hungry for positive interactions, however fleeting. It would be a pity if she missed meeting with the one that she had been waiting for didn’t appear, I decided. And I had walked around enough that I could disappear for a couple of hours without raising suspicion. </p><p>So, the Mule disappeared behind the shelves, and after careful layering of several soft illusions, Ranger Orlin stepped in his place, with his reddish hair, strikingly-wounded face, and easygoing charm. </p><p>I started walking around the shelves, looking like I was looking for a book, while drove closer and closer to Helga’s position. I wanted her to think that she noticed me first. It was a small leverage, but that kind of small things had a tendency to compound if managed carefully.  </p><p>I had been expecting her to notice me after a couple of minutes, after I had came closer to her, but I saw her standing up in seconds after my appearance, showing that she was paying even more attention to her surroundings than I had been expecting, or maybe she had a better observation skill. “Orlin,” she called, barely able to hide the enthusiasm in her tone. </p><p>“Helga,” I said in response, letting a smile bloom, which widened hers even further. I closed in, and then, bent my knees slightly, and opened my hands in expectation, though I was careful to angle my body correctly, so it followed the traditions of Northern Lands which she belonged rather than the Empire. </p><p>Her blush was positively cute as she put her hand on my palm, which only intensified when I brought it to my face and pressed my lips on her second knuckle, rather than fourth, a subtle indication of interest according to tradition. My research on Northern traditions turned out to be quite useful. </p><p>“So, what are you doing in the library this early,” I said. “Weren’t you supposed to be in a class?” </p><p>“I don’t have any today,” she said, with a slight bitterness. She either had one, but dropped because of the constant bullying, or failed to take a class she wanted to because of the professor not giving her a seat if her tone was any indicator. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, I needed to pull her away from the negativity. “It’s my fortune, then,” I said, accompanied by the most attractive smirk I could manage, bringing all my charisma to the forefront. “Because it gave me the opportunity to spend some more time with a radiant beauty like you, and a genius too.” </p><p>I had a feeling that without my charisma to boost my stats, the only thing that cheesy line would earn was a hasty escape, or a slap if she was in a particularly bad mood. Instead, she sputtered a struck answer as her breathing quickened. “Thanks,” she barely managed to bring out. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “You wouldn’t mind helping me look some books on Arcane Magic, do you?” I said, and before she could say anything, held her hand and started walking, dragging her with me. Funny enough, she was about to resist it until she realized I was moving deeper into the library, towards the areas that lacked any student. Usually, a girl would resist being pulled into such an area, but her desire to avoid her bullies were stronger than her common sense. </p><p>For the next few minutes, we have walked between the shelves, or more accurately, I dragged her with me while she tried to process casual yet intimate contact we were sharing. As we walked, I started to ask her questions about the various books, which slowly evolved into a discussion about the fundamentals of magical theory. </p><p>With the discussion back on the areas where she shows a stronger aptitude, she was quick to shed her crippling shyness. Her blush still remained, so did occasional stammer, but she was actively contributing to the discussion, explaining the fundamentals of magic. She kept the discussion at the absolute basics, not knowing I had Arcana skill, but even then, there were occasional comments and interpretations that was novel for me. </p><p>As we talked, I realized the ruse that could benefit me in more ways than one. After picking a few books, I led her towards a desk, and deliberately sit on the corner of the desk, leading her to do same to create a more casual and intimate environment than the distant chairs would create. </p><p>Then, slowly, I started to make seemingly unintentional slips in the discussion, not enough to reveal the full extent of my wisdom, but enough to suggest that I had already taken Arcana skill and achieved quite a bit progress without maximizing the basic version. </p><p>But even then, I had to push the envelope quite a bit for her to notice that fact. “You’re not trying to decide whether to take the Arcana skill,” she said with a shocked manner. “You already have it.” </p><p>“Guilty as charged,” I said with a smirk. “You’re even smarter than I had assumed, catching me this quickly,” I added, as flattery never hurt, especially when backed with a healthy dose of manipulation and some speech. </p><p>“I guess so,” she murmured before her gaze sharpening. “But why did you lie?”</p><p>“It was supposed to be a secret, as my people have rather strict ideas on daring to learn magical skills when you’re not from one of the noble bloodlines, claiming to be cursed otherwise. It will cost me a lot if they realize that I had dared to take one.” </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>Her expression softened as she was caught by the similarity between her struggle and my fake one. “I understand,” she said. “But you owe me one for that omission,” she added in a way that was supposed to be whimsical excitement but came across choppy and shaky. She was really bad at flirting. </p><p>Luckily for her, I wasn’t. “Of course,” I said before leaning forward, and continuing with a whisper as the distance between my lips and her ear dwindled dangerously. “Whatever you wish for, milady.” When I pulled back, her face was bright red. “Are you okay?” I asked cluelessly, putting my hand gently on her cheek. “You look like you have a fever.” </p><p>“Just a little cold,” she answered, jumping at the provided opening with both feet. “Anyway, since you already have some background, I can help you study magic.” </p><p>“Really?” I said with enthusiasm I didn’t need to fake. “You would do that for me? Smart, beautiful, and kind! You’re godsend!” I said as I hugged her. </p><p>“It’s nothing,” she tried to stammer, overwhelmed by my response. </p><p>“Believe me, it’s not,” I said, squeezing her harder, which had the added benefit of familiarizing her with my muscles while I enjoyed the pressure of her breasts on my chest. She really had a spectacular body. </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>[+20 Experience]</p><p> But after letting her go, I pushed a serious expression on my face. “But we need to keep it secret. It would hurt me a lot if got away that I had been studying magic. I managed to disappear today only by claiming I was going for a hunt.” </p><p>“That’s okay,” she said. “We can meet here and I will help you.” </p><p>“Thank you,” I said, caressing her cheek gently. Another rather forward action, even by the relatively lax standards of the Northern lands, but she only smiled at the closeness. </p><p>“So, what can you do,” she asked. </p><p>“Only this two,” I said, and quickly showed my telekinesis and my shield, but I made sure to cast them in a lower capability, much noisier than I could manage, though I didn’t skimp on the general finesse and strength. </p><p>“Not bad,” she said. “But you need to be more careful while balancing the energy matrix of the spell…” she added, launching a lengthy explanation, impressively detailed, and actually effective enough to bring my understanding of the subject to a higher level. </p><p>“Really, tell me more,” I said after she finished, and meanwhile, put my hand on her knee in an absentminded manner. She blushed, but didn’t ask me to pull it away, instead started another lesson on fundamentals of magic. </p><p>The next hour passed in a serious academic mood, broken occasionally by my casual touches, exploring the safer spots of her body, her knees, shoulders, back, and very rarely, lower parts of her thighs. She started to react with less panic after each touch, but her quickening breath was enough to assuage my fears about the effectiveness of my strategy. And while I had some close-calls, my newly enhanced speech capabilities managed to bridge the gap. </p><p>[+2 Subterfuge]</p><p>[+3 Speech]</p><p>But like everything beautiful, it also had some limits. While it was fun to spend time with her, some distance would only intensify her feelings. “Thank you very much,” I said as once again I placed my hand on her thigh. “But I need to return. I still need to visit the forest and hunt something. It would be suspicious if I return from the hunt empty-handed.” </p><p>“You’re right,” she answered, though reluctant. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said with a chuckle. “We can meet tomorrow in here as well. The same place, and at the same time?” </p><p>“That would be wonderful,” she murmured. </p><p>“See you then,” I said and leaned to kiss her cheek, though, at the last second, I felt a bit more mischievous. I feinted like I was going left while reaching her right, and she turned to her left panickedly, presenting her lips to my reach for the perfect accidental kiss while trying to avoid the same. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Plotted Peck. Carefully engineer an accidental romantic kiss, fit for ballads. +300 Experience, +1 Precision. +1 Manipulation]</p><p>I kept the kiss lingering for a moment, then pulled back, leaving Helga in dazed confusion, though a smile was pushing on her face. “I’m so sorry,” I said with an exaggerated panic. “I would have never done something like that with you if it wasn’t a complete accident,” I added, stressing the word never. </p><p>“Why?” she said with a sudden sharpness. “Is there something wrong with me?” she added, her good mood instantly evaporating at my sudden vehemence, so much that she didn’t pay any attention to the fact that she had just let a near-stranger kiss her. </p><p>“Of course not,” I said, suddenly abandoning my exaggerated denial in favor of a husky tone while I took a step forward, closing the distance once more. “You are a beautiful woman, and you deserve a kiss better than the ridiculous touch that we just shared…” I leaned forward while she failed to keep in line with the sudden reversal. “Like this,” I whispered before my hand slid into her hair, and our lips touched. </p><p>This time, it wasn’t a passive, fleeting kiss. No, I brought my full range of the capabilities out while my hands landed on her back, trying to read her reaction. Luckily, she was too shocked to hide her reaction, allowing me to quickly correct the various aspects of my reaction. </p><p>And my lips weren’t the only source of pleasure for her. My hands on her back, dancing in the patterns, using the pressure points and sensitive spots taught by my research on massage points. I could feel her body trembling as she struggled not to melt, a losing battle she nevertheless tried to fight. </p><p>Soon, her lips joined the dance, but in a small, fleeting manner. They opened and closed, trying to follow my rhythm, but always at least one step behind, failing to bring the appropriate result. I was tempted to push her down, sprawled on the desk, to test how much it would take to overwhelm her crush. </p><p>Unfortunately, that had a big risk of exploding to my face, so I pulled back, a smirk on my face. “It was much better, right?” I said as I gently caressed her chin while leaning forward like I was about to kiss her for the third time. </p><p>“Yes,” she murmured, her lips parting slightly in preparation for our kiss, but this time, I changed direction at the last second, and in a twisted reflection of the kiss, placed a soft, lingering one on her cheek. “See you tomorrow,” I said before I left, leaving a confused girl in my wake. </p><p>[+400 Experience]</p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>Orion’s job was over after I left Helga behind, so I shelved him in a trip to the depths of the library, the Mule coming out once more. </p><p>I picked my cart, piled with books, and started walking around. During my passage, I realized that Helga was absent, probably too overwhelmed with what had happened, choosing to disappear back to her room instead of trying to study. </p><p>With my favorite target absent, I started walking around the library, occasionally using telekinesis or another spell to mess with the students or the other workers, enthusiastic about experimenting with my newfound talents. It was incredible just how much I improved in during an hour of training. </p><p>Nothing short of a small miracle considering my arcana skill was currently maxed out. It made me understand how Helga managed to get a spot in the magical section of the school despite her foreigner and commoner status. Another sign that just how wasteful that kind of approaches could be. </p><p>More importantly, it made me change my intentions towards her. Initially, she was just a convenient target to enhance my power, but the fact that she could help me that much in less than an hour meant that she was an untapped treasure. I needed to find a way to acquire her long term, and not just as Orion the Ranger, but with my real identity. </p><p>It was a long term objective, as I had no intention to reveal anything to someone else before I was strong enough to defend myself, or sleek enough to avoid any adverse attention. I needed to keep a low profile as long as I could manage. </p><p>Unfortunately, as much as I wished it to be, I hadn’t had the option of concealing myself passively while scavenging for opportunities. While the future opportunities of Marianne and Helga were more than enough for my prospects, there was something I needed to address to maintain my tenuous hold on them. Or more accurately, someone. </p><p>Cornelia. </p><p>She had a strong hold over both Marianne and Helga, which meant that no matter how elaborate my plan, how strong my hold, I couldn’t predict when she would interject and break my plans. I had no information on her, not even why she was risking to have her dalliances in the library rather than in her room. Was it just a fetishistic preference, or did it have a more important reason? </p><p>But luckily, I had recently come up with a way to learn it. </p><p>When I saw Cornelia entering the library, I took it as a sign to get away. Following her to see whether she would bring me another opportunity to earn some experience, but the lack of information was too dangerous in my case. I needed to learn what makes Cornelia tick.</p><p>I sneaked out of the library an hour before the supposed end of my shift, and after a brief stop at my room, I was once again wearing my maid costume, and started walking in the wing where it held the rooms for the female students. Though, this time, I made sure to apply a different face. With a few extra lines on the face, graying hair, and a slouched walk, I was replicating the sight of a forty years old maid perfectly. </p><p>This time, I had more confidence in my walk, not only I had a better command of the layout, but also my skills in speech and subterfuge were sufficiently high, enough to dismiss the suspicion of any maid. Most of them were Abnormals, and the rest, I doubted that any of them had enough in their stats to penetrate my improved disguise. </p><p>I started looking around to find someone to help me. A minute later, I succeed, in the form of a young maid skulking in the shadows, trying to avoid work. I had a feeling that she wasn’t very bright, trying to hide in such an obvious location, though it worked well for my intentions. “Greetings, youngster,” I called her, who flinched when she realized that her scheme had failed. “Do you have a minute or two to answer my questions?” </p><p>“Of course,” she said with relaxation when she realized I wasn’t planning to order her to do some kind of menial work. “How can I help you, honored elder,” she said. </p><p>“My lady is about to join the halls of this esteemed institution, and they asked me to come early to pick her room and everything. So, I wanted to learn about how everything operates. Would it be a bother for a smart young girl to guide her elder.” </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>Excited to find flattery rather than admonishment she had been expecting, she was quick to launch a detailed explanation about how everything worked. Funny enough, half of the information she provided was inaccurate, conflicting with itself, forcing me to keep a mental tally of everything and crosscheck the results. Still, after fifteen minutes, I had managed to learn quite a bit about how they operated, including a lot of casual secrets about the maids. </p><p>“And how about the students,” I gently prodded. “After all, I need to pick a nice room for my ward, and neighbors are important.” </p><p>“I don’t know, we’re not supposed to talk about the nobles…” she murmured, but when I twirled my fingers and a silver coin appeared between them, her tune changed. “But on the other hand, your mission is also important. It’s hard to decide.” The amount of silver in my hand doubled. Her hand moved in an eerie quickness, her greed overcoming her limits. </p><p>[+2 Speech]</p><p>“Now, the first thing to know…” she started, and I listened… </p><p>----------------------------</p><p>[Level: 5        Experience: 11740 / 15000</p><p>Strength: 6    Charisma: 12</p><p>Precision: 9    Perception: 9</p><p>Agility: 7     Manipulation: 11</p><p>Speed: 6       Intelligence: 8</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 180 / 180    Mana: 240 / 285             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (43/50)     </p><p>Basic Arcana [25/25]        </p><p>Basic Speech 12/25        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The extent of the situation I had committed myself in occurred to me as the servant left the room. Walking around in disguise was one thing, and even working in tandem with other servants was not a huge challenge, but helping a girl in the bath was an incomparable risk, especially since I couldn’t just beat a hasty retreat if I got discovered. Marianne was predominantly a healer, but still, she was strong enough to defeat me easily. </p><p>“Concentrate,” I murmured to myself, slapping myself on the cheek for the good measure. I could have escaped by dashing out while muttering some kind of excuse, but that would mean missing out on the experience, which had the potential to be even more than watching Cornelia and Helga together. I needed power, and I needed it as quick as possible. </p><p>The decision made, I dashed towards the corner that held the towels. I needed to change into an appropriate attire before Marianne’s arrival, it would be a disaster if she caught me naked. I dressed faster than I ever did in my life, and soon I was wrapped with two layers of towels, with some scraps strategically pushed to my chest, and another towel even tighter around my waist to prevent an accident. Then, just for a good measure, I applied another layer of magical disguise on my face. </p><p>But a look at the mirror told me that my disguise wasn’t convincing enough without a long, flowing skirt to hide my features. I needed something to obscure the view. </p><p>A glance around the room gave me the answer. A set of heated stones, with a bucket of water next to it. I quickly dashed there, and poured a cup of water on the stones, turning them into a hot cloud of steam. But I hit another snag when I poured the second cup, barely wisps coming out of the stones. They weren’t hot enough! </p><p>I didn’t have enough time to heat them through the traditional manner, so I reached for my magical abilities. I drew as much as mana I could handle, and tried to shove it into the stone while trying to keep the concept of hotness in mind. Another flicker of steam left the stone, but that was it. The second and the third repeats ended up the same, leaving me gasping in a sudden sense of exhaustion, with more than a third of my mana spent, the curse of lacking the appropriate skill. </p><p>[-70 Mana]</p><p>Luckily, slowly heating up a stone was the simplest task that could be done through fire magic, and I had already read to have a conceptual understanding of it. After spending another third of my mana, the room was filled with a thick layer of steam. </p><p>And not a moment too early, as I just finished dumping the last cup of water and moved to the location I was supposed to wait for Marianne, the door opened, and a figure that was starting to get more and more familiar with each passing day stepped in the room. She said nothing, didn’t even look at me other than a passing glance, and walked towards the seat. She was wearing a simple dress that left her arms naked, again blue. </p><p>I smiled at another lucky turn. In the traditional noble approach, Marianne paid no attention to a servant, just moved in her usual manner, and expected to be served. And as long as I continue to serve her, there would be no issue. </p><p>She stood next to the wardrobe that held her stuff, and waited. Following my instructions, I walked behind her, and started untying the strings behind her clothes. The strings were tied in a complicated knot, but following the earlier directions, I managed to untie them without an issue. She raised her arms, and I pulled the dress off. </p><p>Only for my eyes to meet with her naked back, supported by a glimpse of her beautiful breasts due to my superior position. She turned enough to send a glance at me, and I turned immediately to properly fold and hang her dress, therefore avoiding her taking an extended glare to my face.</p><p>[+2 Subterfuge]</p><p>My mistake didn’t merit more than a second of interest. When I turned back, she was already walking towards the bath, her naked ass swaying attractively with each step, the thick layer of mist making the situation even more attractive. I moved forward to fulfill the next set of instructions, so that I was already next to the bath when she arrived. I presented my hand, and she grabbed it as she slowly lowered herself in the bath, bubbly water hiding her spectacular body from the view. </p><p>[+100 Experience] </p><p>I was doing my best to act natural while following the instructions, trying to avoid her attention as much as possible. I pulled the wine bottle from the icy bucket that was resting, and filled her glass with it, then filled a second glass with the cold water from the pitcher. </p><p>Then, I chose to deviate from the instruction. The old maid had expressly underlined that the water glass should be placed closer to her lady than the wine glass, as she had a tendency to reach the nearest glass while distracted by the warmth of the bath, which was why I placed the wine glass in the spot instead. Drunker she got, less attentive she would become. </p><p>Still, I kept my breath in as she reached for it. Luckily, she neither commented nor tried to look at me as she sipped the glass. When she placed the glass back in its place, she rose in the tub, enough to give another glimpse of her breasts. She sank back into the water after putting it in place, but as a side effect, my towel was starting to get really uncomfortable. </p><p>Next few minutes passed in silence, where she rested under the embrace of the water, her eyes shut, occasionally reaching for the glass for another sip. And since she was keeping her eyes wide shut, I saw no risk in tweaking the situation a bit, topping up her glass whenever she placed it back on, making her think that she was still in the first glass. </p><p>[Achievement: Intentional Impairment. Engineer a situation sneakily with alcohol to reduce the risk of a situation. +400 Experience, +1 Intelligence. +1 Agility]</p><p>“Wash me,” she after several minutes of silence, a moment after the achievement appeared in my field of vision, the slight slurring on her voice aligned with the conclusion of the system. </p><p>I was ready, a soft bath glove on my right hand when she raised her right arm, and gently started to caress her skin. My attention was fully on her body, but for a change, for business purposes rather than trying to enjoy her nakedness. My enhanced capabilities were helpful in reading her micro-expressions, ensuring that, when I finished rubbing her arm, I had a solid idea about the optimal pressure and strength I need to put behind my touches. </p><p>And it worked even better than I had been hoping for, when I finished her second arm and moved to her shoulders, her moans had a suspiciously lively quality that reminded me the unique moment I had the pleasure of watching in the library. The fact that I had been constantly refilling her glass wasn’t a surprise as well, though with my both hands occupied, I started using my telekinesis to do that. It was difficult to do without using my hands to guide the spell, but I managed to do it successfully. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>“Are you feeling alright, milady,” I whispered, intentionally breaking another direction the old maid had given me. Never address her without being addressed first. She just hummed in satisfaction, and I smirked, happy with the level of mellowness she achieved. I could move onto the next stage of my plan. </p><p>My hand started to follow a wider route as it went back and forth on her shoulder, first covering her collarbone with the soft texture of the bubbles from high-quality soap. With each repeat, the range widened, until I was caressing the edges of her breasts, but that caused her to stiffen slightly. It was an unconscious reaction, as her eyes were still closed, and she was still moaning calmly, but I chose to take it as a warning. </p><p>“Do you want me to rub your feet, milady,” I asked as my hands returned to the safer territories. “I am educated in various techniques to increase your relaxation.” No words left her mouth, but her murmur was a clear indication of her approval. </p><p>“Do you want me to place a hot towel on your face, milady,” I added. “It’s treated with the herbs, and it will increase the effectiveness of the massage.” </p><p>I realized that I started to tread in dangerous waters when she opened one eye and looked at me. I brought the full extent of the capabilities of my subterfuge skill to give the impression of a young and demure maid, trying to make her mistress happy. It must have been successful, because she nodded instead of blasting me with a combat spell, which would be the inevitable end if she had suspected of my disguise. She might be the calmer and merciful one of the pair, but I would be the first to admit that the situation had warranted it. </p><p>I grabbed a towel, and gently pushed a sliver of energy to make it warmer, being extremely careful, both not to alert her, and not to burn the towel with my amateurish fire magic. Once I made sure that it was warm enough, I sprinkled it with some of the perfumed water that was placed next to the bath, and placed it over her eyes. </p><p>I moved on the other end of the bath and pushed my hands into the water, and gently pulled her foot out of the water. I sat on the floor with my feet gathered under me, preventing any possibility of an accidental reveal, and pulled her foot on my lap before pressing both thumbs on her soles, and started…</p><p>But the moan that escaped her mouth surprised me, though, from her expression, I wasn’t the only one that was surprised. Her hand twitched towards the towel as she blushed, but she chose to reach for the wine instead of pulling off the towel, obscuring her expression. </p><p>It was interesting that she tried to hide her reaction from a ‘maid’, though it was likely because there was no hiding the source of her moan. But if she wanted to act like it never happened, I was happy to comply. I restarted the massage, and she just lay on her back, enjoying the massage, but this time, she kept her grip around the glass of wine. </p><p>That provided an interesting challenge, continuously delivering the massage while using my telekinetic ability smooth enough to slowly refill the glass without making her notice the unbalance. I actually had to create a magical platform, allowing the wine to slide silently without causing a splash, and she continued drinking. </p><p>The pleasure combined with the alcohol-induced haze had some more interesting effects on her. A moan escaped her mouth as I continued to rub her foot, barely loud enough to be heard. Her hand rose once more, but this time with a more purposeful manner. I felt alarmed when I felt the sudden rush of magic, but relaxed when it took the now-familiar form of silencing field. Though, without an anchor, the ward displayed limited effectiveness, something I had noticed when I heard her next moan, only partially muffled. </p><p>Moreover, it was amusing that she thought it would be effective, because even if her voice had been masked completely, there was no hiding her facial expression, shouting her enjoyment as effectively as her moans. I turned my attention from her body, my hands continuing their jobs in autopilot. </p><p>It didn’t take long for her body to add another dimension to her displays of arousal. Her back arched nicely, which made her breasts peek through the bubbles, the view spectacular. Her enjoyment was a reward in itself, though I couldn’t say that I didn’t appreciate the bonus that came as a result. </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>I chose that moment to finally switch from one foot to another. The moment I noticed Marianne reaching for her towel, I lowered my eyes, but continued to watch her from the corner of my eye, noticing that she was examining my face before sighing. She clearly thought that I hadn’t noticed her rather enthusiastic enjoyment of my massage. I was willing to bet that the only reason she thought that was my supposed identity as a servant, which, in her mind, was stupid enough to miss the implications. Or at least, she was willing to believe that in her confused state. </p><p>I restarted the massage, and she put the towel over her eyes once again, and her back arching immediately after, once again treating me with the amazing view of her breasts. Her moans came soon after, each louder than the previous one. But the fact that she started trembling with a manner that cannot be mistaken for anything else, I was truly surprised. I certainly wasn’t expecting her to be that sensitive in her feet. </p><p>From her total loss of control as the orgasm danced on her body, I was willing to believe that she wasn’t aware of that particular nugget as well. Which made sense if her experience came from Cornelia. She was too meek to instigate such a thing in her own, and Cornelia distinctly lacked the personality to do something as subservient as paying attention to her feet. </p><p>It was convenient that Marianne was busy trying to catch her breath, because I had another thing that deserved my attention. </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Magnificent Massage.

It was a pity that I couldn’t talk to anyone about it, as I probably broke the school record by gaining four levels in less than four days. </p><p>While patting my own back was enjoyable, I had more important concerns to address, such as which skill to choose. Common sense recommended Fire Magic, the most destructive school of magic, always in favor in combat applications -which was a lot considering the monster-filled state of the world- but direct assault didn’t have any value in my current situation. No, I needed something to reinforce my approach, which was already paying amazing dividends, like Speech. </p><p>And luckily, I was in a perfect position to test my newly acquired skill, with a target most receptive, her mind addled with pleasure. “Milady, could you raise your leg a bit more, so I can move onto your calves,” I said. </p><p>She didn’t even pause before raising her leg. Unfortunately, it didn’t give me a sudden burst of improvement. Probably because she was far too gone to actually consider the implications of something like that. Still, while the loss of opportunity to enhance my skills was a letdown, her explicit permission to her body was more than enough as compensation. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>I slowly started to massage her calves, stretching the moment to enjoy the sight of her breasts, but that proved to be a mistake. Her sensitivity there turned out to be much less than her feet, and even worse, drunk with my own achievement, I was late to notice that detail. “That’s enough,” she called as she pulled off the towel from her face. </p><p>“But, mistress-” I started, another mistake as she instantly cut me off. </p><p>“Don’t talk back to me, peasant,” she said sharply, her anger flaring in an instant, excessive even for a noble. She was trying to compensate for her earlier loss of control, though even discounting her situation, her anger was as threatening as a mouse. She stood up, uncaring of her nakedness, her whole body glistening with droplets, begging me to push her down and teach her about the subtleties of disrespect. Soon… </p><p>She stepped out of the bath, stopping only lean down and pick the water glass, and since her back was turned at me while she did that, giving me an amazing view of her most intimate spots. I crossed my legs, because, at that moment, even the emergency towel I had used started to fail. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>Then she walked towards the small pit with a drain to remove excess water, with several buckets already filled with warm water waiting for her. I dashed faster than her, and when she arrived, I was already there, doing my best to give the impression of a meek servant, scared due to her display of anger. </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>It seemed to have worked, as her expression turned her usual dismissive one, though she wasn’t good enough to hide the expression of relief from my eyes, clearly happy that her enjoyment from a servant’s hands went unremarked. </p><p>With her crisis of anger resolved, the rest of the activities flowed without another notable event. She opened her arms, and I wrapped a fluffy towel around her body, which, unfortunately, cut the amazing view I had been enjoying, then I accompanied her to her bedroom, where the old maid was waiting for us, jumping up her feet the moment she heard the door opening. I let her take from there, not wanting to get away from the concealing presence of the steam, afraid to reveal a certain very important detail about my anatomy. </p><p>The moment the door was closed, I dashed towards the dressing area, and put the disguise around as quick as I could manage. Which proved to be a good decision, as before I could disappear, the door opened once more, and the old maid entered the room, walking towards me with purposeful steps. </p><p>“Didn’t I tell you that she was to have only a glass of wine,” she said sharply, though I could see that her anger lacked passion, almost monotone. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” I said, putting a slight hitch to my voice, indicating distress. “But the mistress asked me to, and I couldn’t…” I said, letting my words to trail out. </p><p>[+1 Speech]</p><p>“It’s okay,” she said exasperatedly after examining me for a while, mercy clear on her eyes. “But be more careful the next time,” she added. </p><p>“The next time?” I said, this time, my surprise completely honest. </p><p>“Yes, the next time,” the old maid said with a slight nod. “My mistress indicated that your service was adequate, and she wants you as her bath attendant,” she said. </p><p>I froze. Luckily, it was a natural reaction for my current personality as well, which gave me a couple of seconds to examine the opportunity. The safest thing to do was to inform her that it was my last day at the university, and I was being transferred back to the family estates of the family I had been serving. </p><p>But what was safety against the continuous access to Marianne’s sweet nakedness…</p><p>“That would do,” I said, quickly come up with a lie. “I’m usually free in the evenings, so as long as I got an early warning, I should be arranged. Though that’s the only thing I can do, as I have my charge to attend.” </p><p>“You already have a mistress,” she said, suspicious. “But you are not wearing house colors.” </p><p>“There’s a reason for that,” I quickly explained. “I’m a servant of house Gaius.” </p><p>“Gaius?” she repeated in confusion. “There is no current student from House Gaius,” she murmured in confusion before her face lighted with realization. “Unless you’re serving the Mule,” she said, her pity towards me mixing with a clear dismissal. </p><p>That dismissal towards my real identity might have made me angry if she wasn’t the enabler for the amazing time I had just spent. “Yes, though mostly I work undercover to do the things he supposed to.” </p><p>“Why?” she asked. </p><p>“It’s the only way the school would allow him to keep employ,” I said. “The house is far enough to be isolated from the casual rumors, and the fact that their heir is working in the Silver Tower despite his Abnormal status allowing them a modicum of pride.” </p><p>[+2 Speech] </p><p>“It’s a pity,” she said, but not caring about the intricacies of my situation. “But it’s your lucky turn, because if you keep the mistress happy, I’m sure that she would eventually make you a part of her household. You certainly kept her satisfied tonight.” </p><p>I barely kept myself from cackling against her eerily accurate statement about what happened behind the closed doors. “Whatever the mistress pleases,” I said, playing the part of the dutiful servant. </p><p>“Good, then where I could find you,” she asked. </p><p>“I usually bustle all around the place during the day, and I have a small room outside of the walls,” I quickly explained, trying to find a reason for my indiscoverable state during the day. “But you can pass a note to young master when he was in the library, and he would pass it to me. He is a sweetheart on things like that.” </p><p>[+2 Speech]</p><p>“Okay,” she murmured after a moment of confusion, making me glad that I had picked the speech as my new area of expertise. I doubted that the web of bullshit I weaved would have stuck otherwise. “But always make sure to check with him at sunset. The mistress prefers to have her baths in the evening, you can’t miss any of them.” </p><p>[Achievement. Unintended Uniform.

I didn’t complain, because it gave me an excuse to train the flexibility of my telekinesis, not to mention </p><p>I was going to have so much fun at my new job…</p><p>-------------</p><p>[Level: 5        Experience: 10920 / 15000</p><p>Strength: 6    Charisma: 12</p><p>Precision: 8    Perception: 9</p><p>Agility: 7     Manipulation: 10</p><p>Speed: 6       Intelligence: 8</p><p>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 17</p><p>HP: 175 / 175    Mana: 130 / 280             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Advanced Subterfuge (40/50)     </p><p>Basic Arcana [25/25]        </p><p>Basic Speech 5/25        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The day after I managed to finally take Nancy to the bed and managed to complete the set, I was woken up by the insistent ringing of my phone. Quite unwelcome. Yesterday, I had achieved the impossible by completing the seduction of Nancy, acquiring the whole set. I had gone three-for-three, having a bite from all three forbidden apples. </p><p>My journey was not over, of course. It was just the beginning, from a certain point of view. I had some very interesting ideas for them, but those required some serious preparation, not to mention a serious moral degradation on the ladies’ part. </p><p>I had hoped that, while I was busy with my musings, the caller was going to get the idea and stop calling. Unfortunately, that hadn’t worked as I hoped. With great reluctance, I reached, fully intending to curse the caller before slamming the phone back to their face, but stopped the moment I saw the identity of the caller. </p><p>It was Penny, Madison’s sexy cousin who moved to the city with the dreams of becoming an actress.</p><p>My annoyance had evaporated as I pressed the green symbol, and brought the phone to my ear. “Penny,” I said, doing my best not to sound sleepy, but also, I didn’t want to sound too enthusiastic. There was a simple reason for it. Penny was the quintessential farm girl who came to the city to prove her talents, but failing to achieve decent progress. The way her face lighted the moment she had learned I was a professional photographer during our previous meeting was clue enough for that, making her forget the extremely revealing situation I had been caught in moments before. </p><p>“Hi, Stephen,” said a trembling voice from the other side of the phone, a familiar mixture of hope and fear. A nicer man would have felt bad, but then again, a nicer man wouldn’t have done most of the things I had done. She said nothing, clearly expecting me to continue, so naturally, I stayed silent as well. It was a simple trick, but worked wonders in people with low self-confidence. As I expected, Penny started talking a few seconds later. “I’m calling about the thing we had talked about.” Again, I said nothing. “The small job that you mentioned that might fit for me,” she added, desperation dripping from her tone. </p><p>“Oh, right?” I answered, once again falling into silence.</p><p>“Yes,” she said, her voice trembling in desperation. </p><p>“Sorry, sweetie, that job had fallen through,” I answered mercilessly. “It happens sometimes.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured, her earlier hope evaporating while her fear turned into sadness, unshed tears carried in her tone. “I’m sorry to disturb you.” Again, I said nothing, and she closed the phone a few seconds later. </p><p>I had no intention of leaving it like that, of course. I was just trying to create a sense of scarcity, which would only make her more pliable for my requests later on. I called her back about a minute later. “Penny,” I said, this time using a warmer tone. “Actually, I just remembered, but I have an upcoming task that might fit you. Maybe you’ll be interested in that.” </p><p>“I would love to,” she answered without even bothering to ask for the details, which was a huge mistake. Nine out of ten times, an open-ended request like I just did turned out to be nudes. And for the easily-impressionable girls like Penny, that was a short step away from doing porn. Of course, there was a chance that I was mistaken for her assessment, and her cheerful demeanor hid an iron will, but even a gambling addict wouldn’t be willing to take that particular bet. </p><p>“Excellent, are you available in a couple of hours?” I asked. </p><p>“Of course,” she answered, her earlier sadness replaced with excitement. “I can’t wait to-” she tried to continue, but I cut her off. </p><p>“It’s not for the actual job, but a trial job,” I explained. “The actual job is for a very important client, so I can’t actually give it to you without making sure you can deliver. I have a reputation to consider,” I continued, once again, trying to unbalance her as much as possible.  </p><p>“I understand,” she said, no less enthusiastic. “I won’t let you down. When do you want me to be in your studio.” </p><p>I would have liked to invite her there, as my studio was the best place to break her resistance, but unfortunately, I didn’t know whether Nicole was going to be in the living room, and I didn’t want her to start getting suspicious. “Actually, I was going for a couple of chores. I can swing by, and we can take the test photos in your house.” From the way she breathed, I could tell that she wasn’t happy with that, so I quickly explained. “It would be better for you if we hold the first session somewhere you’re familiar with,” I explained. “But if you want to take the risk…” I added, deliberately stretching the last part. </p><p>“You’re the expert,” she exclaimed, quick to reassure. “You know the best.” </p><p>“Perfect, then I’ll see you in two hours.” With that, I closed the phone, took a quick shower, and started preparation for a small shopping trip. I actually needed to go downtown to pick a few supplies, the only part of the discussion that was factually accurate. With the money from the jobs coming in, I finally had the opportunity to upgrade some of my supplies. New reflectors without cigarette burns, and maybe even a decent 85mm, specialized for studio work. It was expensive, with a price tag in low five-figures, but a worthwhile investment with the way things were going on. </p><p>Twenty minutes later, I left the house, passing through an empty living room. I placed several bulky pieces of equipment in my car, more than what was necessary for a simple test shot, but there was a reason for that. The more equipment I showed to Penny, the more professional it would seem for her, so she would be more inclined to follow my commands of more extreme strain.</p><p>The shopping didn’t take long since I had long identified the models I was planning to buy, but it still lightened my wallet to a significant degree. Luckily, there were only a couple of costumes left in the Halloween set, which would bring a significant windfall. </p><p>A whistle was on my lips as I pulled on the driveway of Madison’s house. Since I was trying to impress, I picked up my equipment, both the old ones and the new ones, and stumbled towards the door under their weight. The instant I knocked on the door, I heard footsteps rapidly approaching. Somebody was enthusiastic. </p><p>Then, the door opened, revealing a sight that put a smile on my face. Penny was standing in front of me with her impressive figure. Tall, but not too tall to detract from her sexiness, not to mention her curves that suggested excellent genetics and a careful exercise routine. But that much, I remembered from seeing her the night she crushed at our game. But at that time, she was wearing unflattering pajamas with no makeup, with messy bed hair. And now, she was wearing a bright blouse that hugged her body as tight as it could without coming across as gauche, complemented by a nice skirt that ended a couple of inches above her knees, enough to hint the beauty of her legs without showing anything. </p><p>“Stephen, you’re here,” she said, her breath still quick with excitement. I shrugged in response, lifting my equipment once more to walk inside. I didn’t answer, because I didn’t want to look too friendly. I wanted her anxious, desperate to impress me. I didn’t have enough clout with her to push her for anything extreme, and I doubted that I had another submissive in denial like Nicole. Finding another like her was less likely than lightning striking twice to the same spot. </p><p>I grunted as I carried the stuff towards the living room, a louder sound than what the weight of my equipment deserved, trying to make it look like I was doing a big chore just by coming to her house. I placed the bags in the middle of the living room, let out an exaggerated sigh that communicated exhaustion, then opened the first case that held an overhead flashlight. </p><p>“Is there anything I can help you with,” she asked, her earlier eagerness replaced by a deep anxiousness. I lowered my head to hide the gleam that doubtlessly twinkled in my eyes. No need to warn the cute rabbit about the trap that was slowly closing around her. </p><p>“You can help by setting up the reflector,” I said, deliberately passing her the case that held the oldest of the reflectors I had. I chose that one, because it had quite a few problems, and required a very careful assembling order to keep in place. In short, it was barely above garbage. I didn’t need that since I bought the new ones, and I would barely get twenty dollars if I tried to sell it, making it an easy sacrifice. </p><p>I deliberately turned away from her as I prepared the rest of my equipment, waiting for the inevitable result, one that came a minute later, in the form of a loud ripping. “I’m so sorry,” Penny exclaimed. I turned, only to see the reflector on the ground, its fabric ripped in several pieces, making it useless. </p><p>I let out a drawn-out sigh to show disappointment that lacked a hint of anger, like a teacher getting fed up with his well-meaning but clumsy student. It worked much better than anger. “It’s okay,” I said in a tone that suggested the opposite, and did it obviously. From what I saw, Penny wasn’t the sharpest knife in the drawer, and overacting would be more rewarding than subtle clues and other stuff. “Maybe it was a mistake,” I murmured quietly, just loud enough for her to hear. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she repeated desperately as she took a step closer, and doing so, she accidentally kicked down one of the cases I was yet to open, this time, all in her own. I raised my gaze at her, and she took a panicked step forward, her expression losing its luster, preparing herself for rejection. </p><p>“Well, I drove all the way to here,” I said, trying to sound like I was speaking to myself. “Just sit down,” I said, this time louder. “I will handle everything, and then we can start.” She just nodded, like she was afraid that saying something out loud might change my mind. It took a few minutes for me to set up everything, though I was careful to shook my head disapprovingly a few times, subtle enough to seem like I was trying to suppress my anger, only to fail. </p><p>“Can I bring you anything to drink? Juice, or maybe a beer?” she asked, unable to meet my gaze. </p><p>I would have spit out angrily about professionalism to push her even more, but the sight of her quivering chin kept me from it. I wanted her unbalanced, not bawling her eyes out, completely broken. “A beer would be nice,” I said. She jumped up her feet, excited to have something to do. But in her excitement, she collided with one of the reflectors, making it dangle dangerously. I dashed to grab it before it fell, and this time, I hadn’t needed to fake my anger. It was one of the brand-new ones, and I didn’t appreciate the risk for them. Still, I wasn’t angry enough to miss the opportunity it presented. “Maybe you should pick a beer for yourself as well. You’re too tense to work,” I suggested. </p><p>“I don’t usually-” she tried to say, but failed to finish it under my gaze. “Maybe a beer would help calm my nerves,” she followed in a resigned tone, and dashed towards the kitchen. I watched in appreciation as her impressively-sized breasts tumbled with each hurried step. I shook my head after she disappeared behind the doorway. She was so easy to manipulate that it would have been boring if the reward that was waiting for me at the end of the road was nothing short of amazing. </p><p>When Penny returned, two bottles of beer on her hand, I had completed setting up the equipment. Not a professional-grade, of course. Flashes were angled wrong for that, reflectors failed to compensate for the natural light coming from the window. It would have taken half an hour to fix, a time that I had no intention to spend. The aim was to impress Penny with the weight of the equipment, not to have useful trial shots. I already had the freedom to use whoever I wanted, after all. </p><p>I picked the bottle from her hands dismissively, without saying anything, and she lowered her head, still feeling guilty about her clumsiness. I raised my bottle, about to take a sip, but then I realized she was holding the bottle in her hand, with no intention to drink on display. That would not do. “Cheers,” I said, presenting the bottle for her. </p><p>“Cheers,” she answered as the bottles connected with a soft clink. </p><p>I took a sip from my bottle, and she followed a second later. However, there was a certain dullness in her motion, like she was slowly getting sure that “To a successful working relationship,” I called, trying to inject a bit of positivity to the situation. She smiled as she took another sip from her drink, a semi-positive comment enough to bring her mood back to positive. “We can start if you’re feeling ready,” I said. </p><p>Indecision passed over her face, but she dispelled it with a stiff nod. “We can,” she said, trying to sound as convincing as possible. </p><p>“Good,” I approved as I raised my camera to eye-level. “Why don’t you stand in front of the couch, and give me a pose.” </p><p>“Umm…” she murmured indecisively. “What should I do?” </p><p>“Whichever feels most comfortable,” I answered to her without bothering to lower the camera, watching her through it. “We don’t have a particular concept, so just try to give me a few interesting poses.” </p><p>In response, she put her hands on her waist, her chest out a bit, reminding me the power pose of a superheroine, drawn by a bad artist that was trying to make sure to accentuate his character’s breasts. It was a terrible pose, but I didn’t comment on it as I took several stills in quick succession before asking her to switch. She moved into another exaggerated pose. It was a struggle not to let out a biting comment out, though it took me a few minutes to realize I had been spoiled by Nicole. Not everyone was a natural model waiting for a camera to transform… </p><p>“Now, lower your arms, turn your side to me, and try to look mysterious,” I asked, and she followed my direction. To be fair, she quickly started to show a passable talent. Nothing like Nicole’s natural flair, or even Nancy’s impetuous charm, but as long as I described what I was expecting from her in detail, she managed to give it to me. She wasn’t without her flaws either. Her emotions were too intense to be used for anything commercial, and she particularly showed between switching expressions, but both traits were likely about her ambition to act. </p><p>“Quite good,” I said with a much warmer tone as I lowered my camera. I grabbed my beer and walked to her, raising it expectantly. She dashed to pick her bottle, and thankfully not touching any of my equipment this time. Our bottles clicked, and I took another sip. I carefully watched the amount she was consuming, planning how to entice her to drink more than a sip. It turned out that I was worrying for nothing, as she drank quite a bit of beer with enthusiastic gulps. </p><p>“So, why do you want to be an actress,” I asked after another sip. </p><p>“I always wanted to be one,” she answered wistfully. “All the cameras, lights, handsome lead actors… And I want it,” she said after taking another large sip of her beer. “No, I deserve it…” she said, then continued to give me a detailed rendition of her dream, the same one she followed since she was a teenager. It turned out that, not only she was naive, but also she had a childish way of looking at the world, expecting it to somehow give her all she deserved… </p><p>Perfect prey for a carnivore like me, I thought, raising my camera high to hide the cruel smirk that forced itself to my face. “Finish your drink and then we can continue,” I said, directing her to consume the other half of her beer. And in a way that I was slowly coming to realize as her characteristic trait, she followed my direction naively and finished the rest of her beer in one extended sip. “Excellent, now, take a seat, and give me a look like you’re the princess of this castle.” </p><p>She followed my directions enthusiastically, getting slowly better with each repeat, progress that slowly disappeared after a few minutes, replaced by blushes and occasional giggles. Damn, I thought, impressed by her weakness to alcohol. I didn’t know whether it was her natural lack of resistance, or her excitement was tipping things to my favor rather sharply, but whatever it was, I was happy with the advantage it provided. </p><p>I hastily modified my plans, changing my mind about convincing her for a second drink. I wanted her with slightly impaired decision making, not actually drunk. I have given her several more orders, each more detailed, testing her ability to pull the desired pose. She was slowly getting more and more adept in following my directions, turning her into a workable model, even if barely. It would take significantly longer than working with Nicole, but it was a reasonable sacrifice to make. </p><p>Then my alarm started buzzing, breaking the shoot as I had planned. “Sorry, I have to take this call,” I said even as I lowered my camera, and walked towards the kitchen. “What do you mean you have changed your mind?” I suddenly shouted to the imaginary caller on the other side of the call. “We had a deal, and I’m already interviewing models.” I paused for a moment, before spitting out angrily. “Okay, you idiot. But don’t call me the next time when you need a photographer.” </p><p>Then, I walked back to Penny, trying to look annoyed. “What was that?” she asked hesitantly, tendrils of fear trying to find a purchase on her face as she read the clues I had fed her. </p><p>“That’s the client that we were going to work together for,” I answered, trying to sound bummed. “Unfortunately, he just called to inform me about the change of plans. He decided to go with a different photographer.” I shrugged dismissively. “Pity, you were shaping up to be a good model as well.” </p><p>“But…” she murmured dejectedly. “Maybe we can work on something else. I’m sure that’s not the only thing you have.” </p><p>“Unfortunately, all of my other work is already in progress, and their models are already arranged. I’ll call you if there is a job that fits you, but even for that, I can’t promise. Each job has its own requirements for both style and size. And unfortunately for you, your traditional beauty doesn’t fit the general market trend. Most brands are now preferring women with less curves for their ads,”</p><p>“Don’t you have anything for me?” she asked desperately as she jumped on her feet, her face more pitiful than a puppy who was just kicked by an evil billionaire. “Maybe something small…” she added. </p><p>“Well… There is one thing…” I murmured like I was thinking-out-loud, her expression brightening. But then, I shook my head, and her blossoming joy died just as quick. “No, that won’t work,” I added, louder. “You won’t be able to handle that one.” </p><p>Her reply came in an instant, her excitement back with revenge. “I can handle it, I promise!” </p><p>Keeping back a smirk was a difficult task, but it needed to be done. Yes, she swallowed the bait, but I still needed to reel my prey to the land, there she would be helpless for my predations. “You didn’t even hear the details,” I said, trying to sound reproachful, but without being too determined. It was a fine line to walk, trying to sound like I was trying to convince her without actually succeeding. </p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” she answered. “I want to prove myself, and I can definitely-” </p><p>“It’s for an underwear catalog,” I said, cutting her off. She fell silent in an instant, blinking in shock. I took a deep breath, as the next part was the most difficult. “See, I told you so,” I said, trying to inject just the right amount of derision in my tone. “Handling such a task-” </p><p>“I’ll do it,” she cut me off. I hid my joy with an overblown expression of shock. Not the best acting, but she was too surprised by her own words to pay attention to my half-assed fake emotions. </p><p>“You’re sure?” I asked, doing my best to sound like a teacher who just heard that a failing student promising to get an A, in good humor, but disbelieving. She avoided my gaze, preferring to examine her vastly more interesting shoes instead. “It’s okay if you can’t.” </p><p>Her silence stretched for several seconds, making me wonder whether I pushed too fast too soon. “I’ll do it,” she repeated her earlier statement, conveying more determination than her earlier yelp despite her voice, barely above a whisper. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “Then, why don’t you go upstairs and change into sleepwear, so we can take a few photos in that.” </p><p>“Is that really necessary,” she asked. </p><p>“That’s definitely necessary,” I answered. “I need to be sure that you’ll be able to perform under the camera while wearing something intimate.” This time, it didn’t take long for her to nod. “Excellent, now, why don’t you run to the upstairs and change. I don’t have much time left.” </p><p>She nodded once again after another hesitant pause, then walked away in hurried steps, no doubt happy to take the opportunity to get away from me. I walked to the fridge to get another beer, curious about what she was going to pick for our first session…</p>",

    "content": "<p>The sun was just starting to shine when I left Mike’s house, leaving the redheaded bombshell naked in her bed, collapsed in exhaustion. Honestly, I wasn’t too far away from collapsing himself. Mike’s wife turned out to be even more of a nympho than my wildest hopes, based on the way she dressed, requiring hours of dedicated attention from me to satisfy her arousal, a desire that was enhanced greatly by her marital anger. </p><p>I wish that making Mike watch the video while slowly explaining why angering his young wife with such disregard was a mistake, but it would mean foregoing any chance of a repeat, and I wasn’t that willing to miss the opportunity to repeat the night with such a beautiful example of young passion. Maybe a year later, after their inevitable divorce. I wouldn’t give more than another six months to their marriage unless Mike had the foresight of signing an iron-clad prenup. </p><p>I was driving lazily, my mind on a particularly impressive moment of remembrance where I took Tiffany in her marriage bed while she was trying to milk yet another dose of pregnancy-helper from me, and to add insult to injury, wearing the same lingerie she had been wearing on her wedding night.</p><p>A blare from my phone distracted me from my musings. Curious who was calling me in this god-forsaken hour, I raised my phone. It was Brenda, which meant I needed to answer. There was a lot of reason why she might call me in this hour, but few of them were good. I prepared to speed up in case it was a dangerous emergency. “Yes, toy,” I said. Just because I needed to answer it didn’t mean that I needed to be kind about it. </p><p>“Boss,” she said with a chirping voice. “I have excellent news.” </p><p>Admittedly, I would have been very angry if she had woken me up to inform me about her supposed good news, but I was already awake, not to mention quite relaxed after several enjoyable hours, so I just chuckled. “Shoot it away, toy.” </p><p>“As you know, I was with Natalie tonight,” she explained, and I nodded. She had done the prudent thing and informed me about Natalie’s request for a late-night ‘work’ event beforehand. I hummed, signaling her to continue. “During that, she started to complain about your presence, and I gave her an idea to get rid of you.” </p><p>It couldn’t be a good plan -from Natalie’s perspective, of course- if she was feeling enthusiastic about telling me. “You don’t say?” I murmured. </p><p>“She was complaining about you gaining too much power in the company in such a short duration, so I suggested that maybe she should try to get you in a relaxed environment where you would spill a few personal secrets.” </p><p>I sighed. “Good idea, but it wouldn’t work. From our last time, she must have realized that I don’t relinquish control during it, no matter how lighthearted the situation is. And if that failed, our encounter in the office or on the plane did. Nevertheless, I don’t think it will work.” </p><p>An excited snicker suggested that I might not be on a completely accurate path. “That wasn’t the kind of relaxed night I had in mind, boss,” she said. “I convinced her that a small barbecue in a family setting, with a couple of beers and some relaxed conversation, would work wonders in relaxing you.” </p><p>“You can’t mean that she is going to invite me to her house,” I said, couldn’t help but think what had happened to the last workmate who had the amazing idea to invite me to his home, just hours ago. “I would have thought that she was smart enough to do her best to keep me away from that sexy girlfriend of hers, not bring me in the same location on purpose.” </p><p>“Come on, boss. You must have realized that how badly her decision-making suffers when things start to move to the bedroom,” Brenda explained, her amusement suggesting that it wasn’t the first time that she had used that particular personality flaw.  </p><p>“I assumed that it was because of her inexperience with submissiveness. Is it the same while trying to be dominant?” </p><p>“Probably worse,” she answered. “After a while, the feeling of invincibility sets in, and if she gets an idea at that moment, it’s almost impossible to dislodge it. All it took was a few veiled comments from me before she came up with that genius idea. I didn’t even have to spell it out.” </p><p>“You definitely earned a reward for it, sweetie,” I answered. “Do you know when she is going to launch this amazing plan of hers.” </p><p>“Most likely this Saturday. She was feeling the pressure of the situation. I think she’ll act to change it before you could entrench yourself further.” </p><p>“Do you have anything important you can tell me about her girlfriend,” I asked. The answer turned out to be a resounding yes, as Brenda started spilling out a dossier of secrets, arranged by topic, in escalating importance that would manage to keep the attention of even the most disinterested listener primed. She had a real talent for gossiping. Though, one of the details managed to catch my attention rather sharply. “They are having fights about having a threesome?” </p><p>“Yes,” Brenda answered, her smirk audible in her voice. “Jenny enjoys penetration more than Natalie does,” she said before a giggle interrupted her. “Or if your account of the business trip was even half-accurate, she enjoys it more than Natalie’s claimed lack of enjoyment. Natalie is quite against the type of threesome Jenna wants, but Jenna is insistent, because I had joined their bed for a night during Natalie’s birthday, for a threesome of Natalie’s presence.” </p><p>“I’m assuming that Natalie claimed that it was a one-off event.” </p><p>“She was rather clever about it as well. After convincing Jenna to have a threesome, she had suggested the name of one of her past girlfriends, and then allowed Jenna to convince her to have me in their bed instead, only after making me promise that it will be just for a night.” </p><p>“Clever,” I said, impressed by the way Natalie managed to have her girlfriend and her side-chick at the same time, all the while managing to act like it was a great sacrifice on her part. “But I’m assuming that it was a one-time event. She doesn’t seem to be enthusiastic about sharing Jenna.” </p><p>“You have no idea how many spanks I had suffered that night just because I dared to drift towards Jenna even a bit. She was not happy about even the slightest caress,” Brenda answered. “She is really jealous when it comes to defending her from the others.”  </p><p>“You have given me a lot to think about,” I said. “Why don’t you get a bit of sleep while I arrange a date for the night.” After Brenda closed the phone, I sent a quick message to Elena, asking whether she had any prior engagement for tomorrow evening, and how she would feel helping me to teach a lesson to that arrogant brunette she met at the airport lounge…</p><p> <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong>  <strong>     *****</strong> </p><p>‘The dinner will be ready in about ninety minutes, are you sure you’ll be here on time,’ read the message from Natalie. This morning, just like Brenda had predicted yesterday, Natalie had called me to invite a private gathering to her house, giving the excuse of improving work relationships. I found it curious that she had intentionally tried to cut short my preparation time. It seemed that she was finally recognizing the risk I represented. A pity that it was already too late. </p><p>‘Don’t worry, I’m just picking up my date,’ I answered, even as I leaned back on the comfortable chair I was occupying at the airport, which was in a special lounge dedicated for first-class passengers, sipping a rare selection of single malt, its smokiness balanced against its sharpness perfectly. Drinking early wasn’t the most prudent choice, I knew, but the selection in the lounge was hard to deny. </p><p>Her response didn’t even take a second. ‘A date?’ she asked. </p><p>‘Yes, a date. I have a friend staying with me that I need to drop at the airport in a few hours. It’s not a problem, right?’ I answered. Her sudden panic was easy to understand. She was obviously hoping that I was going to arrive alone, which would allow her to manipulate me without much of a challenge. A part of me wished that I actually accoladed to her wishes, as pulling the rug under her feet in a position where she had the absolute confidence would doubtless be more enjoyable, but putting her face to face with Elena in her own fortress was too tempting to pass. ‘I need to go, see you at the dinner,’ I wrote before she could write an answer, because I saw the sexy blonde I was waiting for appearing around the corner. </p><p>“Elena,” I said with a cheerful tone as I waved as I slid my phone back to my pocket. I knew how sensitive she could be when not getting the full attention of anyone in direct interaction. It was half of the reason she was willing to join me in our little scheme, as she had been rather insulted by Natalie’s presumption of trying to steal attention from her. Now, with the opportunity to take revenge there, she was more than happy to bring that to completion. The first-class ticket that I paid for and the promise of a pleasure-filled night was the other half of the reason. </p><p>She walked towards me in her signature walk, a slow, sensual saunter that managed to make every single man, and not an insignificant portion of the women, to watch her with rapt attention, more than one jealous wife or girlfriend slapping the arm of their partner in a jealous inadequacy. I didn’t blame them. Even wearing a pair of jeans and a crop top, focusing on comfort rather than style, Elena was sexy enough to be the center of the attention. </p><p>Comfortable in her standards, of course. Her jeans were still tight enough to enhance the sexiness of her long legs, and the crop top rode high enough to give a beautiful glance of her smooth stomach. She wasn’t the kind of woman that would wear sweatpants to the public no matter the discomfort. </p><p>I stood up to greet her, but I made sure to not to hurry too much, just to remind her that I wasn’t one of the simpering fools that would give everything she wanted just to turn her frown into a smile. Which was why we were close, I think, a sense of alignment and that she rarely found in other men. A twisted kind of friendship with a significant portion of our time dedicated to manipulate others for our enjoyment, or hidden behind the closed doors, naked, again for our pleasure. </p><p>I said nothing as I brought her fingers to my lips before gently brushing. “Always a gentleman,” she said with a charming chuckle that broke a great number of hearts every year. It was completely artificial, of course, practiced many times in front of the mirror until it was just another weapon in her arsenal, supporting her in her mission to liberate rich and lonely men, and occasionally women, from a significant portion of their wealth. </p><p> “Nothing less than you deserve, my dear,” I answered in a tone that suggested a rugged charm and confidence, mixed with a hint of devotion. Again, completely artificial, though nowhere near polished at hers. After all, she was a master, and I was just an amateur, albeit a successful one. </p><p>“Seven out of ten,” she whispered. “Good posture, the tone is nice, but you maintained the eye contact for too long. It needs to slip away, leaving the lady questioning about the devotion they held rather than giving her confidence. That way, she would work hard to earn that devotion. We have a way of devaluing men if we’re sure of their devotion.” </p><p>“As you say, mistress,” I said as I gave her an exaggerated bow that wouldn’t go askew in an 18th-century royal palace, which made her giggle. A genuine one, even. “Shall we go,” I said as I presented my arm for her, and hers hooked to mine, much to the disappointment of our audience, destroying their dreams of asking her out. The fact that most wouldn’t have dared to do even if I wasn’t there didn’t matter much, dreams running eternal. </p><p>We walked in relative silence, broken by occasional idle chatter, until we arrived at the car. I opened her door, and she slipped inside. “Do we have time to stop in a shop. I would like to get rid of these horrible clothes and wear something more decent.” </p><p>“Unfortunately we don’t,” I answered, remembering some of the shopping expeditions she had, pushing the limits of human endurance. Not boring in any way of course, as watching her dress in a plethora of clothes could never stop being fun, but we were in a tight clock. </p><p>“But you promised to bring me to shopping,” she said with a playful pout, too exaggerated to be a real attempt. </p><p>“For tomorrow,” I corrected her even as I sent her a glare equally playful. I liked Elena, but she wasn’t a woman to relax around, even for a moment. Her pout intensified, which earned a chuckle from me. “And believe me, you don’t need anything else for tonight.” I smiled, then let my gaze dance over her body with obvious hunger. “Admittedly, you never do. You could wear a burlap, and still be the sexiest woman in the room.” </p><p>She chuckled as well. “Shut it, you flatterer. Since you’re determined to be a boring date, why don’t you explain to me why you’re locked in this small town,” Elena asked as I started to drive. “You told me bits and pieces during our previous encounter, but I need to have a better picture of what’s going on if I need to take initiative.” </p><p>“I don’t know, it’s already a boring story,” I said with an exaggerated mannerism. “I don’t want to disappoint you further.” </p><p>Elena tried to sigh exasperatedly, but she failed to fight off the smile that appeared on her lips. “I might have a way to make it more fun, but you need to promise me to be a good boy for the night,” she said. </p><p>“Not too good, I hope,” I countered, and she let out a crystal laugh. I started to give a more detailed explanation of the background of my unexpected transfer and demotion. </p><p>Meanwhile, she reached for my zipper, and dragged it down by a torturous slowness, my erection getting harder with every click of the slider. “Someone is eager,” she murmured halfway in. </p><p>“It missed your touch,” I answered before moving back to my explanation, and her fingers continued their task. Soon, my shaft was standing free, ready for her attention. Her delicate fingers wrapped gently around it, and started a soft dance that implied everything, but promising nothing. </p><p>“It’s good to be missed,” she answered. “Why don’t you tell me the details of your plan,” she said, her expression alone pushing me dangerously close to the climax, a fake innocence, but it just added to the sexiness of the moment. </p><p>“I don’t have a plan, exactly,” I explained, which earned a quirked eyebrow from her. “Sorry, but it was a last-minute reveal. But still, we have some interesting nuggets of information, such as a threesome conducted, and a promise for a different threesome that is being delayed for jealousy reasons…” I said, starting to explain the key points of the relationship dynamic between Natalie and her long-term girlfriend while receiving her skillful handjob. </p><p>The treatment didn’t stay restricted to her hand. Soon, she leaned forward, capturing my girth in the hot grasp of her mouth. </p><p>“It seems promising,” she said, pulling back for a moment, once again letting her hand take over the task. “But, how can be sure that Natalie would make a move on me? It seems like the weak part of the plan.” </p><p>“Well, on that I don’t think that would be too hard. She is too prideful-” I said, which earned a laugh from Elena even as her grip tightened around my shaft, increasing the pleasure I was feeling even further. </p><p>“It sounds like someone else I know.” </p><p>“Can’t argue with that. But at least, I make sure to take the measure of the people before trying to mess with them.” Her eyebrows quirked in amusement. “Most of the times,” I admitted with a sigh, not wanting to remember some of my more memorable mistakes “Anyway, Natalie is too prideful to miss a challenge, especially if she thinks she is going to win. I’ll distract her girlfriend for a while while you act like you can’t handle your liqueur.” </p><p>“And the bet comes after that, I presume,” she said. </p><p>“Yes, and the fun starts after that. You have the silk ties with you, right?” </p><p>“How rude, Nathan. A gentleman never asks a lady about the contents of her bag,” she said even as she leaned forward. </p><p>“My apologies, milady. Could you find enough mercy in your forgiving heart to forgive this horrible transgression.” She didn’t say a word, choosing to use her lips in a different way to convey her forgiveness. Her blonde hair covered my lap even as I felt a familiar warmth on my shaft, the whole distance of it as my passenger showed off with the capability of her throat. </p><p>It would be smarter to pull to the side until the pleasured haze that covered my mind abated. But there was one problem with that. I knew Elena well-enough that doing so would make that beautiful treatment disappear. Instead, I pressed the gas pedal harder, eating the remaining distance faster, luckily, the roads were mostly empty. </p><p>It was surprisingly easy to come close to climax when one had been driving into the darkness with a dangerous speed while a blonde bombshell tried her best to receive an internal throat massage. At that point, I felt Elena pulling back. I pulled one of my hands from the wheel in a great hurry and grabbed her head instead, pushing her back into her place rapidly. </p><p>A slight gasp escaped her mouth and she tried to pull back, but my grip was firm. The pressure didn’t abate even as she started to pat my leg in a display of helplessness while I pulled and pushed roughly. I had no intention of letting her go unless she used our safe word, or considering her mouth was occupied, our safe pattern, something she rarely used, and under much more extreme conditions. </p><p>Which was why I was surprised to receive it the moment before I was about to release. I let her go, more in surprise than panic, an emotion that was intensified on seeing her lips, curled amusedly despite her messed up lipstick. “I didn’t want to spoil your appetite before the main event,” she said with a smirk even as her hands, which previously had given me an amazing treatment, stuffed my erection back into my pants, into a very uncomfortable position. </p><p>I could have begged her to continue, but I didn’t want to give her another funny anecdote. She already had enough of them. And, moreover, she was right. I shouldn’t spoil my appetite before the main event. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was a pity that I didn’t know any healing spell, as it would be the simplest way to enhance Helga’s resistance. Unfortunately, that wasn’t an option, and considering the disastrous results when I first attempted telekinesis, using her as a target for my first spell didn’t make much sense. I needed an alternative.</p><p>While I was busy trying to come up with a better way, Cornelia’s crop landed on Helga’s skin once more, this time directly on her nipple, and Helga let out a cry, even louder and needier than the previous times. I even saw her lips opening like she was about to say something, and considering the situation didn’t exactly lean for casual discussion, I feared that it was a sign of her crumbling resistance. </p><p>Cornelia must have reached the same conclusion, because the next time her crop touched Helga’s body, it was a soft caress rather than another blow. “Pity,” she murmured in excitement as she drew a small circle around Helga’s breast. “Today, you seem to be even weaker than the usual. Even your failing family would be ashamed of you, a pathetic mage, an outcast, and now, even failing at whoring.” </p><p>A hiss escaped Helga’s mouth against the insult, her dazed glare sharpening. For a moment, I steeled myself, expecting Helga to use a spell to blast Cornelia back. And I wasn’t the only one that thought it, as Cornelia took a hurried step backward, and a shimmering disk appeared in front of her. </p><p>“Scared much, princess,” Helga whispered with abject amusement, stretching each word like they were covered with honey and berries. </p><p>For a moment, Cornelia said nothing, the way her fingers tightened around the whip to turn them white the only indicator of her anger. She stood motionless as the shield slowly dissolved. </p><p>Helga’s pride and satisfaction dissolved with the shield , realizing the enormity of the mistake she had just committed, but the determination was back on her face soon after. I was impressed. Her lips stayed shit, preventing herself from muttering not only the safety phrase, but even a word of mercy that would blunt Cornelia’s anger. It was a mistake in my view, as Cornelia didn’t look like she was in complete control, and it had taken much less provocation for her to try burning me to a crisp. And for Helga, there was no Marianne to blunt her anger. </p><p>My sudden pity towards Helga mixed into my desire to extend the situation as much as possible. So much that I instinctively reached for my nascent arcana abilities while Cornelia’s whip sheared the air, the loudest to date. A shimmering barrier appeared over Helga’s skin, both less intense and smaller than the one Cornelia conjured. But its feebleness only worked for my benefit, as it was quietly destroyed the moment Cornelia’s whip connected with it, allowing it to contact with Helga’s skin. </p><p>[+3 Arcana]</p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>Both the increase of my arcana skill and figuring out a new spell was welcome changes, but the benefits of my reflexive action weren’t limited to enhancing my magical capabilities. Destroying the shield bled a significant part of Cornelia’s hit, and added to the fact that I hadn’t been enhancing her blows anymore, Helga just let out a pained gasp rather than an unrestrained cry. Helga looked surprised, but only for a moment, quietly shifting back to determination once more as Cornelia raised her whip for a repeat. </p><p>Ten times Cornelia’s whip sheared through the air unrestrained, tinged with anger, sometimes on her back, sometimes on her chest, and ten times I managed to conjure a barrier to reduce the damage. But despite that, Helga’s lips parted like she was about to say something. Cornelia stopped, and Helga whispered. “Time’s up,” she said, followed by the last piece of sand in Cornelia’s hourglass.  </p><p><em>[Achievement: Cloaked Conjurer. Help a lady to resist enmity via magic without revealing yourself. +400 Experience, +2 Intelligence]</em></p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>Cornelia stopped, but her nakedness allowed me to see her arm trembling badly, like she was conflicted whether to just continue, ignoring her loss of control. Anger scoured her mind. She took a deep breath. I could see that it intensified her anger, but it wasn’t the only impact it had. It also transformed her anger from a boiling hot rage to a simmering desire. “That’s enough for tonight,” she tersely spat, and turned her back, her glee and enjoyment suddenly absent. “I’m not in the mood anymore.” </p><p>With a flash of wisdom, I understood that she did that, not because she enjoyed delivering pain -at least, not only that- but the sense of control it gave her. And her out of control reaction to Helga’s little taunt destroyed the impression she had just built up. To make things worse, Helga successfully resisted Cornelia's out-of-control response, removing the only factor of enjoyment she might have taken from the situation. </p><p>Helga slackened in the grasp of the ribbons that kept her upright, relaxing as she realized that she had managed to survive the consequences of arrogance. Cornelia said nothing as she pulled her robe on, then silently put everything in her bag other than the ribbons that kept Helga immobile. She looked at Helga, then her robe, obviously considering whether it would be too petty to take it, tasking Helga to find a way to return to her room naked. </p><p>In the end, Cornelia placed a parchment on the table, and put a piece of gold over it to pin it in place. A wave of her hand, and the ribbons flew towards her bag, depriving Helga of her support, who just collapsed on the floor. Another wave dispelled the wards, and Cornelia started to walk away. </p><p>“Same time next week?” Helga asked, but the glee on her face was too obvious for it to be just a question. She was clearly gloating her victory, however small. I approved the sentiment, even though it was a shortsighted move in terms of the long view. </p><p>Cornelia gave no indication that she heard of it, and disappeared amongst the shelves. Helga just lay on the floor, ignoring the possibility of a surprise guest. </p><p>I was struck with a sudden inclination. Would I let Helga go, or somehow push the situation for my benefit? What would be the risk of the situation? </p><p>But as she continued to lay on the ground, breathing, her marred but beautiful body in a complete display, her curves covered with an attractive sheen, there was only one decision I could take. </p><p>I needed a strategy to approach. There was a lot of things I could do. The simplest thing to do was to stumble at her while she was still naked, but there was little benefit for that. I would see her naked, which didn’t add anything to the situation, and while watching her trying to fix her clothes in panic would have been amusing, she might also react violently to my presence, and despite my level and high skills, I had no illusion where my combat capabilities lie. It would take only a moment for her to eviscerate me. </p><p>I tried to come up with an alternative approach as I sneaked towards the other side of the library. Regardless of the context, I couldn’t have let her think that I had a chance to peek on her in her vulnerable state. But it still left the context of approach. Stumbling at her location after she finished dressing, and using her distress to help her would be the most logical choice. Unfortunately, my idiot persona worked against me on this context. A week ago, I wouldn’t have noticed it no matter how obvious, doing otherwise would cause her to pay attention to me, which was a recipe to disaster. </p><p>Then again, being myself wasn’t the only option, right? </p><p>I smirked at my sudden flash of insight. After all, I was still wearing the same pants and shirt I had in the morning, while I convinced the kitchen staff that I was a student at the ranger section. And while it was rare to see the students that didn’t focus on magical disciplines in the library, it wasn’t impossible. In a hidden corner, I quickly removed my robe, and a couple spells later, I had reddish hair, green eyes, and a distinctive scar on my chin. </p><p>But the real change came from the way I positioned my body. Gone was the slouched shoulders, replaced by the subtle grace of a ranger driven by unnatural grace of their unique balance. My physical stats weren’t high enough for that, but luckily, subterfuge was enough to cover the rest. </p><p>When I walked back towards Helga’s location, I made sure to create enough commotion by slamming the books close. Not only it alerted her, but also it gave me an excuse for why I was in this section. I hoped that the sudden fire she had against Cornelia wasn’t a temporary reaction, because my whole approach relied on her engaging my presence with a similar fire.</p><p>Even with the forewarning, when I saw Helga, she was barely closing the last button of her robe. She looked at me with fearful eyes, understandable considering her vulnerable state, and her lack of friendly acquaintance. “Hello,” I said, doing my best to put a moment’s tremble in my voice to betray nervousness, while a nervous smile flickered on my lips, both completely artificial. By showing vulnerability, I hoped to reduce her fear. I didn’t want her to retreat instantly. </p><p>“Can I help you?” she said, but her tone wasn’t the same terse one that she used against other magic students. </p><p>“Actually, yes,” I said, trying to sound genuine. “I was looking for a book on the basics of the arcana magic, but I’m a bit lost.” </p><p>“Magic?” she said, surprised. “You’re a student of magical arts?” </p><p>“Ranger, actually” I answered. “But I was trying to find some stuff on arcana magic. I’m considering relative merits of having a more diverse skill set, if I get lucky enough to unlock a magical skill,” I followed, giving her a reason for my presence. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured. </p><p>“You could just call me an idiot,” I said as I took a step towards her, small enough to not to be threatening. “You don’t have to mince your words.”</p><p>“No,” she said with a blush. “I didn’t mean it like that. It’s an unconventional idea, though. Most people prefer to focus on one side of the skill tree to maximize the impact.” </p><p>“Really?” I said, trying to sound earnest. “I would have thought the advantages from the extended utility will be beneficial enough that at least some people are willing to focus on a more balanced approach.” While I listened to her, I pulled a chair while keeping my eyes on her.  </p><p>She threw a hesitant glance towards the chair, clearly wanting to dash away, but also caught flatfooted by the fact that someone was interacting with her without clear antagonism and insults. But then, her exhaustion won, and she pulled a chair for herself as well. “Partially,” she said, starting her explanation. “But it has more drawbacks. Not only it would prevent you from mastering the critical skills for your main job, therefore reducing effectiveness, but you would also have to focus on the stats that don’t benefit your usual tasks.” </p><p>“But stats are acquired more or less randomly.” </p><p>“That’s true, unless you’re one of the noble houses with hundreds of years of recorded achievements list to speed up your growth,” she said, a trace of bitterness slipping through her voice. A deserved one, considering she had been humiliating herself to get just a glimpse of that information. “But more time you spent on your activities, more chance you would have gaining another stat point. You really don’t want to have invested in magic unless you have at least seven in intelligence or wisdom, for example.” </p><p>“So, I wasn’t wrong, you’re calling me an idiot,” I snapped. </p><p>“No-” she said, shocked, but I cut her off. </p><p>“Relax,” I said, with a sudden snicker while erasing any hint of anger from my face. “I’m just joking around. You mages should be even more repressed than the gossip suggests if you missed that.” I said. </p><p>“Something like that,” she said dismissively, which was understandable. The constant bullying campaign stemming from institutionalized classist behavior wasn’t the best conversation grease. “I’m sorry, but I need to run. But it was nice meeting you,” she said, standing up. </p><p>“Did we meet? I don’t even know your name,” I said, and she blushed. </p><p>“Helga,” she said curtly. </p><p>“Orlin,” I answered, and her face alighted in shock. </p><p>“You’re not from the Empire as well,” she said, surprised. </p><p>“Technically, I’m, but not in any practical purpose,” I said, quickly creating a background for myself. “I’m from one of the migrating tribes that are tasked to destroy the monster buildups in the northern plains to prevent another incursion like Seven Month Carnage.” </p><p>“Then, why are you here?” she asked. </p><p>“I was a part of the envoy that had been sent, and since the old geezers would take a few weeks to finish, I managed to get permission to join a few classes in the meanwhile, as a gesture of goodwill.” </p><p>“You’re not a student,” she asked, trying to hide her obvious disappointment. I barely held back a smirk. It was clear that she managed to develop a small crush in a matter of minutes, which wasn’t a surprise. Not only I had a decently muscular body thanks to my high and well-rounded physical stats, but my charisma and manipulation was nothing to scoff at either, and their impact was further impacted by my advanced subterfuge skill. My positive approach, something she lacked due to her outcast status, managed to put the final nail in her coffin. </p><p>“Unfortunately,” I explained. “My family could never afford the cost of the Silver Halls, and it’s practically impossible to get the scholarship as a ranger, especially if you’re not one of the cronies of these so-called noble houses.” She looked downcast, and I chose that moment to sink the dagger. “I know it’s a bit forward, but would you mind hanging together in the library while I’m here,” I said. After a pause, I added with an exaggerated panic. “To have more discussions about the magic, of course,” I quickly added, like I was trying to cover for a slip of tongue.  </p><p>“That would be nice,” she said, a genuine smile appearing on her face for the first time. I felt like an asshole, kicking a wounded kitten, but in the end, I didn’t have the option to hold back. And considering the sacrifices she was willing to make for more power, I had a feeling that she would have understood even if I spoke her openly. “I need to go,” she murmured as she stood up. </p><p>“Are you okay,” I said. “You seem to be having pain while trying to stand up.” </p><p>“It’s nothing,” she spat out in a way that would have alerted me that she had a secret if I hadn’t already known. “Just a little accident while trying to reach for a book.” </p><p>“That’s what happens when you ignore your physical stats,” I countered, which put a smile on her face once more. “Do you need any assistance. I could help you to walk back to your room,” I offered. </p><p>“You better not,” she said. “It’s better if we avoid attention. The students here have a group mentality, and wouldn’t appreciate me talking with a ranger, especially in the library.” </p><p>“I understand,” I said with a wink. “That would be our little secret.” I stood up as well, and before she could start moving, grabbed her hand and placed a soft kiss on her knuckles. “It was a pleasure to meet you, milady. I can’t wait for our next meeting.” </p><p>She said nothing as she dashed away, but the sudden blush on her face suggested that she enjoyed the attention. I smiled, not only I had managed to make a hot girl develop a crush, but I had also earned a nifty reward in the process. </p><p>[+5 Subterfuge]</p><p>[+ 300 Experience]</p><p><em>[Achievement: Charmed Cutie. Impress a girl with your charming words until she develops a crush. +200 Experience, +2 Charisma]</em></p><p><em>[Achievement: False Flag. Seduce a girl under a fake identity. +400 Experience, +1 Charisma, +2 Manipulation]</em></p><p>I continued to sit on my seat after Helga’s departure, enjoying the sudden burst of warmth on my body as my stats earned a significant jump. I couldn’t help but smile at the state of my stats, half of them already ten or above, and the rest not far behind. From all I had read, it seemed to be a spectacular achievement. Gods were really rewarding me for all my suffering. </p><p>I let myself let out a relaxed sigh. Even if the worst happened and I got capped at level five, I would have enough power to go back to my family and earn my post. Five levels were not much, pretty much disgrace level for a noble, but with those stats, I would be able to perform well above my level would suggest. I wouldn’t be a powerhouse by any stretch, and I certainly wouldn’t be able to take my post as the head of the family, but I would be able to live a decent life. </p><p>But for some reason, that thought filled me with disgust. No, after everything I had suffered behind the closed doors, I didn’t want to return there for a mediocre life. I either returned to take everything under my control, or I didn’t return at all. Finally tasting the power and freedom, I had no intention of restricting myself. And leaving the Silver Tower behind would mean sacrificing the only chance I had to discover the reason for my situation secretly. </p><p>With a renewed enthusiasm, I changed back to my robe, once again disguising myself as the useless assistant. After tasting the ease I could interact with someone without the weight of my history, the robe felt heavier. With a sigh, I pulled my cart from its hidden location, and returned to the main area, spending the next half hour working, trying to be seen around, while looking for another opportunity. This time, I tried to interact with the people as much as possible without being too obvious, trying to raise my subterfuge skill further, unfortunately, that didn’t work. Apparently, it was already high enough that passive observation was no longer an effective tool. </p><p>I was halfway to my room when I saw my next inspiration. Two maids, carrying a bunch of stuff towards the ladies’ room. “Could I dare to do that,” I murmured, shocked by the insanity of my own plan. It was supposed to be a difficult thing, but with my basic magic skill maxed, combined with my high manipulation and subterfuge skill, it might be just possible, especially since the maid uniforms were loose enough to hide the features of my body. </p><p>The first task was to acquire a uniform. In my room, I donned my worst clothes, and with a few illusion spells later, I was indistinguishable from one of the manual helpers. In effect, I was invisible as I walked towards the laundry room with a basket in hand, filled with scraps. From there, I carefully swiped a maid uniform without being seen, and ten minutes later, I was back in my room, trying to illusion long hair that still looked realistic when I shook my head.</p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>It took me another hour to fix my clothing enough to look convincing as a woman, a task that I would have failed miserably without the constant insights provided by my skill, on how to stand, how to move, how to avoid the glares of men, and another hundred small topics. </p><p>And with my disguise in place, there was only one destination to maximize the benefits… </p><p>The luck still seemed to follow me, as I saw an older woman, either in her fifties or sixties, struggling to carry a bucket of steaming hot water. More importantly, she had a specially-colored collar on her neck, denoting that she was a private servant belonging to a house. I counted myself lucky, because those colors belonged to House Louis, the house of my dear savior Marianne.</p><p>“Do you need any help,” I asked, but only after walking closer to her, using the tone as another tool to conceal my tone. </p><p>“Yes,” she said, as she placed the bucket of water on the floor. She looked at me in appreciation as she breathed hard. “One of the other maids was supposed to help me, but I have no idea where that airhead is. Probably frolicking with that servant that was sending her looks all day long. Youngsters, no respects or sense these days…” she said. I just nodded, ignoring her burst, and lifted the bucket. </p><p>She started walking, and I followed, until I was in front of a door that was marked with a huge Coat of Arms, a shield with a huge kraken, marking the House Louis’ seafaring past. “Why are you carrying water, I thought that the student rooms had hot water from the taps.” </p><p>“Yes, but this is boiled with special herbs and oils to create a relaxing effect, and it is supposed to increase the speed of healing. Perfect after a difficult day. But it smells horrible while boiling, so it needs to be done in a storage room.”</p><p>“Sounds a bit wasteful,” I said as I poured the water on the bath, which was still only half-filled. </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge] </p><p> “Nobles,” the maid whispered resolutely before returning to normal volume. When she started walking back, I just followed her. I was disappointed to see that Marianne wasn’t already in the bath, but still, the interaction while I faked being a woman was enough to increase my subterfuge, which was better than nothing. So, I listened to her chatter, occasionally nodding, allowing me to learn more about the various noble houses and their relationship. She was under the impression that she was sharing idle gossip, I was able to make some interesting conclusions. </p><p>“Thank you, youngster. You deserved a copper for your help,” she said as she patted my shoulder as I dumped the last bucket into the bath, filling the room with a thick cloud of steam. “I can handle the rest, though the moisture is going to kill my knees.” </p><p>“I can help if you want,” I said before I could fully consider the risks, tempted with the possibilities.  </p><p>“Really,” she gasped in appreciation. “And here I was thinking that all youngsters cared was avoiding work and flirting with lowlife boys. It’s amazing to see that there are still some that respect the older people like they supposed to.” She smiled happily. “What’s your name?” </p><p>“Selina,” I answered, giving the first name that came into my mind. </p><p>“Mine is Griselda,” she answered. “Have you served a noble lady in the bath before?” </p><p>“I did, but if you quickly explain your lady’s preferences, just to make sure I follow them.” </p><p>“Will you be able to remember them all?” she asked, suspicious. </p><p>“I have a good memory,” I said. She looked disbelieving, but went through a long list of things to do and things to avoid, which took a better part of ten minutes, which I recounted back without error, courtesy of my enhanced mental stats.  </p><p>“Impressive,” she said with a nod. “You can find a towel to change behind that screen. Change quickly. I will bring Lady Marianne in a few minutes, and you can help her undress.” She took a step forward before suddenly turning back. “And, don’t forget. Only one glass of wine for Lady Marianne. She doesn’t handle her alcohol well.” With that, she left, leaving me behind with a mixture of fear and anticipation… </p><p>[Subterfuge +3]</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>[Level: 4        Experience: 8620 / 10000</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Strength: 6    Charisma: 11</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Precision: 7    Perception: 8</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Agility: 6     Manipulation: 10</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Speed: 6       Intelligence: 8</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 17</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>HP: 132 / 132    Mana: 180 / 216             ]</strong></em></p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>SKILLS</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>[Advanced Subterfuge (34/50)     </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Basic Arcana [25/25]        ]</strong></em></p>",

    "content": "<p>I woke up with the first rays of sunrise, feeling a ravenous hunger, which constituted a big problem. Not only there was still a couple hour until the dining hall started to serve, but also I would still run the risk of being noticed by one of the students with a well-developed observation if I waited for the dinner. </p><p>The simplest way to counter that was to visit the kitchen, hoping that one of the servants would take pity and feed me, but that carried its own complications. It wasn’t just the students just bullied me. Servants were happy to join when they realized there would be no consequence as long as they kept it non-physical, giving them a metaphorical way to hit back to the aristocracy that oppressed them for all their life. So, going to the kitchen meant that there would be a lot of leers and insults, and I didn’t want to suffer them more than necessary. I had suffered a fair share of them until now, and didn’t want more when I was finally strong enough to not to take their shit anymore. </p><p>Then a sudden realization hit me. Why not put my subterfuge skills into the job? It shouldn’t be too hard to act like a different student, especially since it had been rare for someone to look at my face beforehand. With my expanded capabilities, tricking a bunch of servants them shouldn’t be too hard. I turned to my wardrobe -a pitiful collection of damaged and dirty clothing, as servants long stopped helping me with my chores unless forced otherwise. Luckily, there was a group of students that dressed like that due to their daily activities, combined with their relatively lower status. </p><p>I wasn’t limited to the clothes in my wardrobe, of course. Arcane spells allowed a wide range of tricks, some of which I managed to decipher already. Which meant that not only could magically-repair my clothes to create a decent approximation of a ranger uniform, but also I could have a different hair and eye color, with a distinctive illusion of a wound on my chin.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, I was walking towards the kitchen in a completely new identity, dressed as a poor approximation of ranger, with a forged note in my hand with a copied signature from one of the other documents. It wasn’t a perfect disguise, and I wouldn’t dare to use it under the sunshine even against the servants, but I was hoping that relative darkness of the corridors would assist me in my plot. </p><p>I arrived at the kitchen, only to find it bustling with a great cacophony of activity as the servants prepared for the breakfast. I glanced around, trying to identify the best target to reach. And then I noticed a man that was barking orders to the others around him, but dressed in the same way. I was betting for a small-time servant trying to prove himself to be management quality. </p><p>I walked towards him with determined steps, once in my life, not hunched forward like I was trying to disappear. “Master Ranger asks for some additional supplies for today's expedition,” I said as I pushed the list towards him. He looked at it, his expression panicking slightly. </p><p>After a moment’s silence, he stood straighter, and started spitting orders to the people around him. “You, bring me two packs of dried meat, and someone brings me three packs of dried fruits.” Then, he pointed at another man, who looked less than enthusiastic about being ordered. “You bring me four dozen travel bread…” </p><p>He must have been more successful in his ambitions than I had first thought, because it took just two minutes for them to prepare me a burlap filled with everything I asked for. “Excellent,” I said, trying to copy gruff but to the point voice of a ranger. </p><p>“No problem, milord, is there anything else I could do for you,” he asked, his voice smarmy enough to raise my hackles. I shrugged, then started walking towards the door with rapid steps. The reason, I could see the head chef walking towards us with a stormy expression, clearly unhappy with the intrusion to his domain, compounded by the fact that I talked one of his subordinates rather than him. I made no motion of noticing him, but quickened my steps enough that when he arrived my previous position, I was about to leave the kitchens. From the corner of my eyes, I could see he started talking with the man, clearly admonishing him for giving supplies without asking him, then I turned, leaving the kitchen behind. </p><p>After a hurried dash, I was back in my room, letting out a relaxed sigh as the door closed behind me. That was close, and the fact that the head chef noticed me was a good sign that my Subterfuge skills were not high enough to avoid detection. I needed to improve it further in the earliest chance. Luckily, I was about to gain another level, and hopefully, it would allow me to do so. </p><p>And on the plus side, I had enough food to last me for at least a week. Even two, if I eat conservatively. Dried meat and hard bread wasn’t exactly a feast, but it sustained me while allowing me to stay away from the view. I nibbled some food while dispelling the spells over me, my hair color turning back to its natural brown. </p><p>I focused on reading a book on basic arcana spells that I had swiped from the library for the next hour, but soon, it was time to work once more. I was quick to prepare and leave my room, wanting to go there as early as possible. I didn’t know whether the Head Librarian was back, but if she was, I want to be in the library earlier than her. The less reason she had to watch me, the better… </p><p>I was one of the earliest workers in the library. I just grabbed a cart without talking with anyone and drove it towards the less-visited part of the library. After a few minutes, then the assistant of the Head Librarian took the main desk, cluing me on the fact that the Head Librarian was still away. </p><p> My morning passed in a predictable routine, occasionally walk around like I was working while spending most of my time hidden between two shelves, reading as much as I could. I had a lot to learn…</p><p>Of course, I kept my eyes open for any opportunities that would net me some experience. I needed barely less than two hundred experience points, and then I would unlock a new level. Unfortunately, the night arrived without an opportunity. There was no Marianne following me, giving me easy opportunities to sneak a grope, nor I could see Helga with her busty beauty, hidden in the depths of the library, allowing me to use magic without being noticed by the others. </p><p>I was preparing to leave when my luck had turned. I saw Cornelia stepping through the entrance, her efforts to make herself look inconspicuous making her even more noticeable, at least to me. Thanks to my earlier observations, I knew exactly how to read her signs of arousal. She looked around for a while, carefully watching her surroundings, making me afraid that I would be noticed if I continued to examine her. Another late-night encounter, I thought with a smirk, excited with the prospect of another level-up.  </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t have to watch her, not when I knew where she would be in a few minutes. I disappeared behind the shelves before alerting her to my position. And since I was there early, I had enough time to move the stuff around, creating a superior observation point where I could actually sit while enjoying the show. </p><p>Several minutes later, Cornelia had walked into the exact same spot she had been the last night, murmuring a careful spell while she drew several quick symbols on the table with her finger, and leaving a shiny aftermath. I was impressed. It wasn’t exactly trivial to create a ward, even a simple one like hers, without a specially-prepared anchor. </p><p>But it seemed that the preparations for the night were just the beginning. Cornelia reached to her bag, and pulled out a ribbon from her bag. I looked at it curiously, as it looked like silk, not the cheapest material to find after most of the production areas had been destroyed by monster attacks, especially one that painted bright red. Then she pulled a small riding crop, curiously, in bright red as well. Fitting to her flame queen theme, but I was starting to get a suspicion for their purpose, which got stronger and stronger as she pulled more items from her bag. I couldn’t help but feel curious, however, as Marianne didn’t give me the impression that she would be enjoying stuff like that.   </p><p>Though it didn’t take long for my curiosity to turn into total shock. The reason, who had just walked into the opening. Like yesterday, a familiar blonde figure stepped to my field of vision. But it wasn’t the same blonde that I had seen with Cornelia. </p><p>It was Helga. </p><p>It was a miracle that I managed to keep myself from gasping. Not seeing Marianne here had been quite a shock, as from what I had been gathering from their talks, I was willing to bet that those two loved each other enough to risk total disgrace. But despite that, Cornelia had been clearly waiting for Helga, if her lack of surprise was any indicator. </p><p>Cornelia didn’t say anything, just reached for her robe, and pulled it off with a smooth motion, revealing a leather corset underneath, stylized like leather armor with, but with a lot of strategic absences to highlight her sexiness. Of course, again in bright red. She was really playing to her moniker as the Crimson Queen. </p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p><em>[Achievement: Prepared Peeper. Observe a tantalizing view from a prepared position. +200 Experience, +1 Wisdom]</em></p><p><em><strong>Level UP!</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>[Select one of the following skills: Advanced Subterfuge, Basic Speech, Basic Concealment] </strong></em></p><p>I was tempted to choose speech or concealment, as both of them had the potential to be really useful for my needs, but in the end, I had to go with the subterfuge. I didn’t trust myself to avoid the Head Librarian’s attention otherwise. And as the morning showed, subterfuge unlocked some interesting options, by acting like the others. I chose the subterfuge, and then turned my attention back to the action, curious about the exact details of the surprising situation in front of me. </p><p>“Good evening,” Helga said, which just increased my curiosity about the situation. Not because of her words, but the tone she used, sharp and cold, suggesting that she wasn’t really happy about her situation. The situation was getting more and more curious. Though hearing what she had said had been a welcome surprise. Apparently, I was close enough to stay inside the silencing field Cornelia had set up.</p><p>“Take care of your tone,” Cornelia countered sharply, followed by a dark smirk. “Unless you want a session to remember.” A moment later, she raised her hand, and a tendril of electricity flickered between her fingers. </p><p>Helga looked like she wanted to answer, but chose to do the smart thing, and ducked her head, avoiding Cornelia’s gaze. I approved, as I knew from firsthand that how quick was Cornelia to escalate into uncontrolled violence. At least, in the current condition, it seemed to be limited to controlled violence. </p><p>“We’re going to go with the usual rules tonight,” Cornelia said with a smirk. She took a step towards Helga, and caressed her cheek with the riding crop with a contrasting gentleness. “Last for ten minutes, and you earn a whole gold piece,” she said. A gold piece was nothing for a noble, but for a peasant, it represented more money than they could imagine. For a merchant family like Helga's, it wasn’t an amount to ignore, but certainly, it wasn’t enough to justify her indignity, unless her family business was in truly dire straits.  </p><p>Helga just nodded, and reached for the buttons of her robe, her fingers moving in a familiar rapidness. A moment later, she pushed her robe on the ground, revealing that, underneath, she was garbed in her birthday suit. </p><p>[+100 Experience] </p><p>I licked my lips as I drank the sight of her body, even more spectacular than what I could glimpse after my magical malfunction. Her breasts were large enough that my palms would fail to cover them, but firm despite their weight. Her stomach was smooth, but I could glimpse muscles underneath that suggested a fitness surprising for a mage. There was an unkempt bush between her legs that hid quite a bit of the detail, but her legs, toned and firm, was enough reward to ignore that fact for now. </p><p>“Where were we,” Cornelia said as she gently dragged her crop on her breasts after a small break where she enjoyed the sight in front of her. “Yes, we were talking about the rules. Last twenty minutes, and you earn another scroll,” she added. From the way Helga’s eyes shined, I could understand that it was an important one, probably a hidden source from Cornelia’s family library. “And if you can last for a full thirty minutes without admitting defeat, I’ll teach you a spell. Clear?”</p><p>Helga nodded, trying and failing to hide her fear. Cornelia giggled amusedly. “It’s amusing to think that you will be able to last that long. Good luck. Today, you just need to say, Mistress, this pathetic slave is at her limit, please have mercy, to make me stop.” Helga’s chin stiffened in a way that suggested she was squeezing her teeth painfully, but she still nodded. “Repeat it, just to make sure you can remember it,” she added. </p><p>“Mistress,” Helga managed to spat out from her thinned lips, her hands squeezed enough to become completely white. “This pathetic slave is at her limit, please have mercy.” </p><p>“Good work,” Cornelia said, patting her head in a completely patronizing manner. “Now, stand here, eagle pose.” </p><p>Helga just followed her directions, seemingly understanding her fate. When she was in her position, Cornelia waved her hands, and a few whispers later, the ribbons she had prepared wrapped themselves around Helga’s arms and legs, immobilizing her like a particularly delicious doe fallen into a huntress’ trap. Meanwhile, Cornelia reached for her bag and pulled an hourglass, and placed it on the table to measure the time. </p><p>“Let’s start with something easy,” Cornelia said, and her naked hand landed on Helga’s hip, the sharp voice echoing in the opening, showing the confidence Cornelia had on her silencing spell. Helga just stayed silent, looking at Cornelia. From the angle I had, I wasn’t able to see her expression, but from the way Helga blanched, it didn’t seem to be particularly friendly. </p><p>[+50 Experience] </p><p>With that done, Cornelia took a step forward, her ass danced beautifully, covered only by a thong, once again, crimson. I pulled my shaft free, slowly playing with myself as I watched. For the next few minutes, I have done nothing but watch while Cornelia’s hands landed on Helga’s body, again and again, marking her pale body with several pink patches, though it only made her sexier. Occasional insults also accompanied her slaps, mainly insulting Helga’s lowborn status, mixed in with occasional financial insult. Helga’s expression was just as delicious, a mixture of defiance and fear. Though it was a pity that I wasn’t the source of that expression. </p><p>“Ten minutes,” Cornelia said with an amused stretch, marking the end of the first section, of which I have earned another five hundred experience points. Not bad, but watching without contribution didn’t seem to net that much. “You have earned one huge gold coin for your success.” </p><p>While Helga took a series to deep breaths to control herself, Cornelia walked back to the table, and restarted the flow of sand by turning the hourglass. But when Cornelia grabbed her riding crop instead of raising her naked hand. When that landed on her skin harshly, a pained gasp escaped Helga’s mouth for the first time. I suddenly had a suspicion whether she would be able to last another ten minutes. It would be a pity if I earned just a thousand from such an amazing opportunity. But that meant I needed to take action. But how to do it without being noticed.</p><p>Then, it clicked to me. It didn’t have to stay unnoticed. Helga was already suffering under Cornelia’s assault, and from what I had understood from their interaction, Helga didn’t have right to ask about what Cornelia was doing, nor she seemed to have any intention of doing so. </p><p>So, I conjured another magical appendage, this time formed similar to Cornelia’s crop, and waited until Cornelia’s whip started to soar through the air. I timed it perfectly, and it landed on Helga’s skin the moment after Cornelia’s did, triggering a loud cry off her. </p><p>[+100 Experience] </p><p>Despite the approval of the system, I had neglected to repeat the action the next time, checking them to see whether it created any alarm. Cornelia slammed the whip on her skin once more with her usual joy, though this time, Helga managed to keep her mouth closed. And since I managed to avoid the detection of both parties, there was nothing to prevent from repeating the same action. </p><p>[+ 10 Experience]</p><p>While the lackluster gain was a bit annoying, it seemed to fit the pattern. Repeating the same action had a much lower impact, which probably linked to risk factor. But small wasn’t the same with unimportant, as since I gained it with each repeat, it amounted to quite a bit of experience, especially when combined with the bonuses I received whenever Cornelia decided to do something different, such as biting Helga’s breast without a warning, enough to leave a mark that would last for a few days, which netted me another nifty hundred experience points. </p><p>Helga’s proud expression as she tried to hide the effect of pain to a limited effect had a unique sexiness to it. I could easily see why Cornelia was enjoying the treatment, which could be easily read on her face as she stepped back, enjoying her achievement, unaware that she owed some of her success to my intervention. </p><p>I decided to spice things up a bit, so when her crop landed on Helga’s breast, I created a mirror image of it, landing on the other one, for the first time, extracting a loud cry from Helga. I should have tried to pace myself, but the moment caught me in its grip as well, and I started to escalate my involvement. </p><p>With my new approach, I had another seven hundred experience halfway the second part, and the achievement was enough to make Cornelia start dripping. However, there was one rather big problem. Helga’s expression was getting more and more worn out. I needed to find a way to enhance her resistance if I wanted to get the full benefit of this amazing opportunity. </p><p>It would be a pity to cut short such an amazing moment… </p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>[Level: 4        Experience: 7520 / 10000</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Strength: 6    Charisma: 8</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Precision: 7    Perception: 8</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Agility: 6     Manipulation: 8</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Speed: 6       Intelligence: 6</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 17</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>HP: 132 / 132    Mana: 150 / 188             ]</strong></em></p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>SKILLS</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>[Advanced Subterfuge (25/50)     </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Basic Arcana [22/25]        ]</strong></em></p>",

    "content": "<p>After my encounter with Helga, I decided to sneak out of the library and go directly to my room. The close-call I had with Helga spooked me, so I decided walking away was a more prudent choice for the moment. Though, I made sure to sneak one of the beginner books on the arcane magic with me. My near discovery with Helga showed me that wisdom stat wasn’t an all-around cure for all kind of information, and I actually needed more information to prevent another half-assed plan exploding on me. </p><p>While my existence as I grew up had been a horrible, lonely existence, it also came with certain advantages, such as the absolute absence of any kind of friendship, meaning no one bothered to look for my presence when I decided to skip the dining hall. Going to the library was a risk, but I only took it because people were too used to my presence to really pay attention. I wasn’t willing to risk my acting skills against the sharp eyes of all kind of soldiers, especially if someone decided to bully me in the dining hall, which happened far more than I would have liked to admit. </p><p>Walking around carelessly was one thing, but trying to trick everyone in a crowded hall was a different thing while they watched my reaction.</p><p>The danger was compounded by the fact that the room was not filled with the students with the magical focus like it was in the library. According to what I had read, the students with a magic specialty rarely bothered to pick sensory skills, relying on spells to enhance them under the combat situations. I wasn’t willing to take the same risk for the students on leadership or ranger track, not before I could enhance my Subterfuge skill to a reliable degree. </p><p>The next few hours were split between reading on magic and trying to enhance my arcana skill, only to increase it by a measly one point. The culprit was easy to discover, the lack of risk. Unfortunately, without some arcana ability, improving my spells was a slow-yielding chore, destroying my plans. I sighed, and decided to focus on the theoretical side while leaving the skill enhancement for tomorrow. </p><p>At least, that was my initial decision. But when I found myself twisting and turning in my uncomfortable bed, unable to catch a wink of sleep, I decided to revise that plan. I wasn’t able to sleep, because I couldn’t prevent myself from mentally calling my status screen, a part of it burning in an annoying light. </p><p> Basic Arcana [2/25]</p><p>It shouldn’t be a real problem, as after spending years without gaining a level, or even thinking it was possible, I had gained two levels in rapid succession, a speed that was unheard of, even for the first few levels. That should have been satisfactory enough to let me sleep. </p><p>But it wasn’t, not when a part of my heart shouted me to leverage the situation before it got lost just as quick, ignoring the pleadings of my brain. I yearned to maximize my arcana skill with the same speed I had improved my subterfuge skill. </p><p>In the end, I failed to resist the temptation, like a man lost in a desert, gorging himself with water despite knowing the dangers of his greedy approach. Sometimes, the temptation was impossible to resist. </p><p>A sigh escaped my mouth as I stood up, my mind already on how to explain if I get caught during the process. The library was open at night, but it rarely had any students, therefore only a couple assistants worked each night, in rotation. Mine was last night, so I needed an excuse. </p><p>A brief search around the clutter gave me the perfect excuse, a parchment, written by the Head Librarian, ordering me to sort out the history section. It must be from the first few weeks, when they were still hopeful that I would be able to learn about being a librarian. For anyone else, it wouldn’t have worked, but for once, my reputation worked to my benefit. It would be very believable for old me to find an expired order, only to follow it without realizing it. </p><p>With my problem solved, I quickly donned my librarian robe, and stepped on the corridor with purpose. </p><p>The first observer I had was a servant, carrying a tray filled with food. The smell tickled my nose, and my stomach chose me to remind that I had yet to eat anything with a loud gurgle. “Perfect, the mule is starving,” the servant murmured sarcastically as he tried to pass me. </p><p>After my stat boosts, giving me a new perspective about everything that had been happening in my life, I found myself with a short temper against my bullies. And finally, I had a chance to push back. Not explicitly, which admittedly removed some fun of the situation, but a telekinetic push, delivered with a negligent wave of my hand, was sufficient revenge for now. </p><p>It wasn’t a particularly strong push, nor it was well-controlled, but the second part worked for my benefit, unbalancing his tray, making it tumble off his hands. A string of angry curses left his mouth, quite a few targeting my supposed curse spreading around, but he was too busy trying to salvage to late-night dinner he had been carrying to stop me, and I continued my journey; a smile on my face because suddenly, I had another skill point in my skill. </p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>When I arrived at the library, he wasn’t the only servant that was cursing the supposed bad luck I had brought. Some of them tripped, while the others lost the hold on the items they were carrying. Any student would have been reported to Headmaster, who had little patience for the pranks on the staff, but one benefit of my reputation was I was suspicion-proof. It was an asshole move, I would admit, but the resulting increase in my arcane skill was well-worth it. And after all the mocking and humiliation that came from the staff during my tenure, I wasn’t feeling particularly merciful. </p><p>For me, the next hour I spent in the library turned out to be very useful. I have started testing my abilities on two boys from rival houses, working tables that was not exactly close to each other. I started it with a subtle telekinetic prob while making sure I was standing just in front of the other boy, so when my target turned towards me, he was quick to dismiss me in favor of blaming his rival. </p><p>It was even easier when he retaliated, his magical signature conveniently hiding my own small prod. It didn’t take long for the boys to start a prank war, unaware that both of their assaults had some additions from a third party, and in the end, they broke into a fistfight in the middle of the library, each loudly blaming the other for starting it. I retreated, a smirk on my lips, and seven more points on my arcana skills. Targeting people with actual magical capabilities was making my magical skill increase even faster, I realized. </p><p>At that point, I was planning to call it an early night. I walked towards the depths of the library, searching for some interesting books that I could borrow that wouldn’t raise any alarm. To do that, I moved much deeper into the library, until an unfamiliar sensation stopped me. </p><p>I stopped, trying to expand my magical senses until I could grasp the reason for that sudden sensation. A minute of focus later, a shimmering barrier appeared in front of me as I attuned my senses, giving me an impression of a tripwire. A simple alarm ward, I reasoned, combining my readings with the impressions generated by my skill, all filtered through my wisdom and intelligence. The question was, who was responsible. </p><p>Destroying the ward was not an option without alerting its owner, and I didn’t even know where to start to for partial dismantling. The smart thing would be to turn back, not risk angering whomever that had put the barrier. </p><p>And I would have done that, if it wasn’t for a moan that was strangely familiar, one that made remember a very special moment in my life, one I managed to place it rather easily. Cornelia. </p><p>“That naughty minx,” I murmured in surprise, though this time, I had enough presence of mind to keep my voice low. The last thing I needed was to be burned once again. But the lure of gaining more experience, as well as feasting on her beauty, was too tempting to miss, and I wouldn’t say no to seeing Marianne’s amazing body as well, hopefully accompanying Cornelia once again. </p><p>First, I moved back and forth, looking for an easy vantage point, but it turned out to be fruitless. Then, I turned my attention to the translucent ward that barred my way, taking note of its spherical shape, and comparing it with the size and the shape of the library. Thanks to the endless days I had traversed the library, doing backbreaking physical work, I had managed to memorize the library with great accuracy, and my wisdom allowed me to recall that map without an error. </p><p>Combining those two facts, I realized that I could bypass the ward from this side as long as I kept close to the wall on the other side. I walked, keeping my attention on the ward to avoid an accidental trigger. And as a happy note, it increased my arcana skill by two, probably factoring in the fact that I would be risking death if I got noticed by Cornelia. </p><p>[Basic Arcana 10/25] </p><p>After a short search, I managed to find a nice and snug vantage point that gave me a direct view of Cornelia and Marianne, proving that they hadn’t paid the same attention to the rear of their position. After a brief search, I managed to find a gap between the books that gave me an almost unrestricted view of her bodies. </p><p>And what a view it was. Trusting the effectiveness of their ward, the girls didn’t see a problem partially undressing, their robes bunched around their waist, their breasts only concealed by each other’s hands, and occasionally, their lips. It wasn’t a surprise that I quickly built up a raging erection, and this time, I had enough time and opportunity to address it. </p><p>[+100 Experience] </p><p>I pulled my shaft from my pants rather urgently, the desire burning inside me as it did never before. Maybe it was an effect of my level-up system, or maybe it was because of my increased stats, allowing me to feel my emotions in an intensity that I never felt before, or maybe even it was my physical stats, finally enhancing my body to a point that I would feel such needs. Whatever it was, it was less important than the amazing view as Cornelia’s face disappeared in the embrace of Marianne’s bountiful bosom, triggering her silent cries. </p><p>Too silent, I absentmindedly noted as my fingers started dancing on my shaft. Apparently, they remembered to put a silencing charm after Cornelia’s errant moan. More power me, as safer they felt in their position, less attention they would pay to their environment. I pumped my shaft mercilessly, the unfamiliar sensation filling my body with a rapid speed… </p><p>Beset with an unfamiliar sensation, it took less than a minute for me to reach a climax, a sensation of pleasure filling my body. I managed to keep myself from moaning in pleasure, if only because of the memory of Cornelia’s burning hand, digging into my skin.   </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p><em>[Achievement: Obscured Ogler. Stay hidden and unnoticed while triggering a situation of self-inflicted ecstasy. +300 Experience, +1 Perception]</em></p><p><em>[Achievement: Speedy Shooter. Take less than a minute to reach a climax under self-care. +100 Experience, +1 Endurance]</em></p><p>I took a few deep breaths, enjoying not only the pleasure of the aftermath, but also the power spreading through my body, sharpening my perception and toughening my body. If that was the way everyone felt when they increased in power, I could easily see why they thought the Abnormals were cursed, or why they pitied the people with low-level cap. </p><p>But sociological impacts of the leveling was easy to ignore when I watched as Cornelia pushed Marianne against a desk, hiking up her robe with a great hurry. A pull later, Marianne’s panties fell down, giving me a glimpse of the treasure between her legs before Cornelia dived down there. </p><p>[+200 Experience] </p><p>I was happy with receiving another experience burst, clearly linked to their change of position. So, the safest strategy would be to wait until they finished, and maybe polish another one if my manhood managed to recover before they finished. But once again, the temptation for more skills and the increased experience was impossible to resist. </p><p>I took a deep breath, bringing my whole focus to create a small telekinetic point, and I extended it as far as I could. The power I put on it was the smallest I could manage, and I was betting everything on the fact that both girls were too distracted to notice what I was doing. That was what had happened with Helga, after all, failing to notice my manipulations until I lost control of the spell and ripped off her clothes. </p><p>And my favorite gals were lost in pleasure, which was what I was banking on. With that in mind, I pushed my small probe on Marianne’s naked breasts, gently squeezing her nipple, which made her to open her mouth to let out another silent cry, but her eyes stayed closed, meaning she wasn’t suspicious. Maybe she didn’t realize it wasn’t Cornelia’s hand but a spell, or maybe she just assumed Cornelia was responsible for it. They definitely seemed kinky enough to use magic for things like that.  </p><p>[+100 Experience] </p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>The approval of my internal system was definitely appreciated, as well as the sudden burst of magical knowledge, slightly increasing the finesse I could wield my magic. I squeezed once more, but this time, without a corresponding experience burst. Maybe variety was needed, I thought as I slowly transformed the shape of my mental construct to something similar to a hand, cupping her breast in a way that was more attention-grabbing than a simple, fleeting squeeze. </p><p>[+100 Experience] </p><p>I saw Marianne’s mouth opening, and while I couldn’t hear what she said, the way her mouth moved was suspiciously close to the word more. Happy that my little addition was appreciated, I let my magical probe to explore her body more freely, the expression of ecstasy on Marianne’s face intensifying with each passing moment. </p><p>Meanwhile, my body had managed to recover, my shaft back to full mast. My hand was back to pumping, though without the utter novelty of the sensation, it took longer for me to reach the climax. Not that it was a bit problematic, as not only there was an amazing view that I enjoyed in front of me, but also I was gaining quite a bit of experience and skill points from the experience. Seeing Marianne shuddering with a climax triggered me for a second time, but also I managed to earn more than five hundred experience and several points of arcana skill. </p><p><em>[Achievement: Hidden Helper. Be a gentleman and help a lady reach ecstasy without taking the credit! +500 Experience, +1 Manipulation]</em></p><p>It seemed that the system had a sense of humor. Still, that was unimportant compared to the fact that I was near another level up. I prayed all the gods that Cornelia wasn’t selfless enough to leave after bringing her partner to climax. </p><p>My prayers were answered when Cornelia stood up and dropped her robe on the ground, revealing that she hadn’t been wearing anything underneath. Apparently, she came prepared for her midnight tryst. Once again, I prepared my telekinetic hand, ready to subject Cornelia the same treatment Marianne had been subject to, but something changed my mind. </p><p>In particular, the position Marianne had taken. </p><p>Instead of crouching like Cornelia did, Marianne chose to bend from her waist as she brought her lips to Cornelia’s nether lips. But the thing that took my attention was the way her robe stayed bunched around her waist, leaving her bottom bare, and facing towards me. </p><p>I wasn’t sure I would dare to take the opportunity if it was Cornelia in the position, but Marianne had shown that she was both slower to react, and more merciful. Still, I was really careful as I brought my probe to her glistening slit, and gently twisting her clit. </p><p>[+200 Experience]</p><p>The result was spectacular. Marianne’s body rocked with pleasure, and Cornelia’s body followed it a moment later. Apparently, the joy of the moment made Marianne more active, something Cornelia was clearly enjoyed. </p><p>I kept the pressure the same until I watched Cornelia’s hands to grab Marianne’s hair, pulling her tighter into her embrace. At that point, I was reasonably sure that Marianne had other problems than the exact shape of her pleasure, and added a small buzzing to my probe, still teasing her clit. </p><p>The result was spectacular, as Marianne raised her head for a moment, her silent cries creating a unique erotic view. Luckily, before Cornelia started to get suspicious, Marianne lowered her head and resumed her task, leaving me free to magically explore her most magical spot. </p><p>I was tempted to transform my probe into a cylindrical shape before exploring her insides, but one thing held me back. As a noble lady, she was probably virgin, meaning that would create a huge web to untangle, and I didn’t want to give her a reason to rip my head of if I get caught. </p><p>But it was a restriction that allowed me a lot of range. Once again I brought my probe on Marianne’s breasts, this time in a more spread-out tingling sensation, leveraging the expanded capabilities of my skill boost. I thought I saw Marianne trembling a bit, but it was a subtle thing, and it might also be about Cornelia’s hands meeting with her hair in a sharp tug. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>With the system’s approval of my achievement, I continued my activities, letting the probe to spread over her body while wishing that it was my hands that danced freely on her soft skin. But at least, I had remote access to her body, which was a good substitute until I could have access to the real one. </p><p>A few minutes later, without a warning, Marianne collapsed onto her knees, trembling with obvious pleasure. </p><p>[+500 Experience] </p><p>I would have liked to hang around more, to push even more, but when I saw a questioning expression on Cornelia’s face, I decided that retreat was a part of the valor. I didn’t know whether her questions would allow her to discover my outside assistance, but I wasn’t willing to stay around to discover that. Cornelia’s first reaction had left a memorable impression.</p><p>I called my status window as I walked back to the more crowded areas of the library. I had earned more than enough from my endeavor. Not only I had completely developed my arcana abilities, but also gained enough experience for an almost full level. </p><p>All was well…</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>[Level: 3        Experience: 5810 / 6000</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Strength: 6    Charisma: 8</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Precision: 7    Perception: 8</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Agility: 6     Manipulation: 8</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Speed: 6       Intelligence: 6</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Endurance: 8      Wisdom: 16</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>HP: 99 / 99    Mana: 110 / 141             ]</strong></em></p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>SKILLS</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>[Basic Subterfuge (25/25)     </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Basic Arcana [22/25]        ]</strong></em></p>",

    "content": "<p>“Oh, yes. To business,” Mike said as he pulled a piece of paper in front of him, failing to hide the depth of his enthusiasm in his tipsy state. “I was thinking that maybe we could restructure product categorization, then…” he added, giving a detailed breakdown for a new structure which would incidentally cause the size of his check to nearly double. I leaned back, watching him calmly as he explained his plans with great fervor. He seemed intent to bore me senseless. </p><p>Thankfully, the distinct sound of heels hitting the floor reached my ears, and I turned towards the corridor, only to see Tiffany as she stepped into the room, her swaying walk even more attractive when seen from the front, her breasts swaying with each step thanks to her lack of bra, her dress failing its task to brace her breasts. I deliberately kept my gaze on her as she closed in, ignoring yet another annoyed huff from Mike. It was his genius idea to soften me up through the attractiveness of his wife, and he had no ground to stand on when the strategy started to work through enthusiastic compliance of his wife. </p><p>“Another double,” she asked as she looked at me, with a tone far too gaspy to be natural. </p><p>I made of show of dipping my eyes down to examine her cleavage unashamedly for a couple of seconds, then raised back to look into the depths of her green eyes. Her eyes slid to her husband for a moment, her expression alight with vindication. I wondered just how angry Mike was. “Yes, a double sounds like an excellent idea,” I answered. I pushed the glasses towards her before Mike could countermand it, and then, watched with admiration as she filled them generously, the angle affording a great angle for me. “Back to work,” I said as I raised the glass up once more, inviting them to drink. </p><p>Mike looked less than pleased by the fact that he required drinking, but he still raised his glass to take a large sip. Of course, it was also likely that I was misreading his source of anger. His anger could easily be about me treating her wife like a piece of meat on display, or his wife doing her best to act like it. Whatever it was, it didn’t prevent him from drinking whenever I prompted him to drink as we continued to discuss the zoning assignments, and Tiffany just sat there in a way that alluded many sweet promises, looking sexy. The discussions took another fifteen minutes, and I managed to fill Mike’s glass twice more on that period, while I just sipped my drink. </p><p>“How about like this,” Mike slurred as he scribbled the map in front of him with his trembling hand, creating a circle that covered more than half of the available area, and approximately three-fourths of the revenue. It was such an outrageous distribution that had I actually tried to push it, the rest of the sales team would have quit instantly. Thankfully, I had no intention of humoring him at the end of the day. </p><p>“A bit too ambitious, isn’t it?” I countered as I draw a much-smaller circle that had a few large accounts we were struggling to maintain. It would have looked lucrative at first, but it was a death sentence. “This might be a better idea to leverage your skills, pitting you against a more challenging crop of clients. It’s a difficult group, but with equally impressive rewards. A salesman as impressive as you should have no problems handling it, right?” </p><p>The conflict on his face was amusing. On the one hand, not wanting to admit his inability to maintain unsatisfied clients, on the other hand, he didn’t want to get stuck with something like that. Luckily for him, his wife came to his aid. “Stephen,” she said as she stood up. In silence, she walked towards my side without saying anything, each step measured for maximum impact. I couldn’t help but breathe harder as she stood next to my side, closer than appropriate, her perfume tickling my nose. I knew it was intentional, but that fact didn’t blunt the impact of the moment. </p><p>She leaned on the table, which made her dress rode up in a way that revealed more of her delicious white flesh, begging for a bite. It also treated me with a glimpse of the red g-string she was wearing, flimsy enough to fall in its own accord. She pointed out the map, but no one in the room thought that where she pointing was the most important detail. “Maybe you should assign something less time consuming to my husband. I don’t want him always working too hard.” She turned to me, and winked suggestively. “I have needs, you know.” </p><p>“An excellent point,” I said as I pulled a chair closer. “I think it’s only fair if we also address your concerns. Why don’t you take a seat.” </p><p>Her expression flickered as she noted that the chair I suggested for her was practically connected to my own, but she was too deep in her ploy to pay that fact the attention it needed. And Mike must have started feeling the bite of alcohol, as he was busy looking at the map with a silly smirk rather than paying attention to the proximity of his wife with all its implied dangers. A rather important lack of foresight, I noted with a smirk. I used the opportunity to fill his glass once more, and returned discussion. </p><p>It didn’t take long for Tiffany to lose her stiffness. Soon, she returned her game to tease me, doing her best to ‘accidentally’ rub against me whenever she leaned forward to make a point on the map. It was enough, I decided after the fourth time she managed to smash my arm with her breasts, trying to abuse her perceived power over me and a lack of attention from her drunk husband. </p><p>I put one of my hands under the table, not bothering to hide what I was trying to do. Mike was too drunk to notice, and Tiffany was going to learn in a couple seconds nevertheless. I put my hand on her thigh, enjoying the way she flinched at the contact. There was a certain satisfaction in turning the tables on a woman while she was under the impression of holding all the cards. </p><p>Her wrist wrapped around mine in an instant, trying to push it away without making it obvious, but I kept my arm solid, in place. Moreover, I waited until Mike’s attention was fixed on creating another draft on the map, then leaned into her ear. “You pushed your luck too much, miss tease,” I murmured, enjoying the way she shivered as my breath fell on her earlobe. I slid my hand upward. “Now, it’s my time.” </p><p>“No,” she managed to whisper in shock despite her shock. </p><p>Mike spoke before I could answer. “Did you say something, honey,” he said without raising his head from the map. </p><p>“You must have misheard, honey,” she said under my warning glare. Mike returned to his task. </p><p>“Good girl,” I whispered into her ear once more. “Now, we’re going to play a little game, or tomorrow your husband might not have a job. It would be a pity to lose such a beautiful house just because you can’t afford the mortgage payment.” </p><p>It was a delight to watch her self-confidence evaporate, leaving its place to disbelief. But even that wasn’t long-lived as my hand slowly climbed upward on her leg, draining away, leaving its place to a trembling surrender. “Excellent,” I said loudly as my fingers passed the border that her dress created. Mike raised his head, a proud smile adorning his drunken face, thinking that my comment had something to do with his latest map. I just filled his glass once more before turning my full attention back to his young wife, leaving him with his distracted doodling. </p><p>And what a deserving target she was, I noted as I slid my hands upward, finding the edge of the small triangle which her g-string relied on to cover her sexiest place. And to my surprise, I discovered the sopping wetness of that small triangle piece. It seemed that I wasn’t the only one that was feeling the excitement of the situation. And from the shocked expression on her face, I guessed that she was surprised by the arousal she was feeling from being molested in front of her husband, </p><p>Her shock was barely a reason for me to change anything in the way I act, of course. I softly dragged my fingers over the silky fabric, which might as well be invisible, barely containing her warmth in its soaked stage. Her eyes widened, but she managed to maintain her silence under the assault, and I managed to maintain things despite the challenge she was feeling. </p><p>But her silence meant little. We were just at the opening stages of the game. I answered another inane question from Mike even as my fingers twisted, pushing her panties out of the way, leaving her gentle folds without protection. They danced in the new field they discovered, drenching themselves with her juices. As they danced, her face started to shift to a tone closer to her hair. </p><p>It was enough playing, I decided, and slid two of my fingers inside her. Her walls barely resisted in their soaked state, allowing me to start a journey to discover her weak spots. But of course, it was just a beginning. First, I reached my belt, and a brief struggle later, my shaft was free. A glance was enough to convey my request. Her hand hovered in indecision as she looked at the weapon I just revealed, intimidated by its size. </p><p>Normally, I would have pushed her to start working as soon as possible, but I had other plans on the work. I leveraged her distraction to reach to my phone, and started to record a video with the camera facing us, for two reasons. First, it was always good to immortalize such a moment. Second, it would be handy to have a recording in case she tried to create problems by trying to misrepresent the situation. </p><p>The camera was recording when her delicate fingers wrapped around my shaft, gently dancing up and down. The angle was horrible, no doubt missing a great amount of action, but it was good enough for documenting the intent of the situation. It would be interesting to show that particular recording to Mike in a later date, when he managed to annoy me even more than he had managed to do. </p><p>I would have liked to have a chance to further adjust the camera, to make sure the recording was also enjoyable in its artistic merits, but each second increased my risk of getting caught. And I doubted that even her current mixture of trying to annoy her husband while also trying to protect his work would be enough to accept being recorded. So, I dropped the phone from my hand, and turned my attention back to the one that most deserved it. </p><p>Tiffany was trying to open her eyes when another twist of my fingers managed to steal her breath explosively, her sweet voice echoing in my ears, its intensity making me question the last time she had experienced a man’s touch. At least, a competent one, as I was willing to bet that Mike was one of the guys who classified a sloppy kiss followed by a minute of frantic pushing as satisfactory performance. Something his wife no doubt disagreed, if her shocked cry for to my skilled touch was any indicator. Her eyes opened wide when she realized that she had been loud enough to rouse her husband from his drunken stupor. </p><p>I could feel her stiffen under my touch in panic, her hand steel around my wrist as she tried to push my hand away. But I kept it there, because I could see that Mike was too deep into the domination of the alcohol to notice the nature of her enthusiastic cry. “Is something wrong,” he asked a second later as his eyes drooped down in his alcohol-laden exhaustion, validating my assumption. </p><p>“Nothing!” she managed to say, the way her cry turned into another heated moan not exactly helpful for her case, but her husband missed another clue of his humiliation. She sent a warning glare to my way, but I greeted it with a mocking smile. </p><p>“Really,” Mike slurred in exhaustion. He paused a second, making Tiffany even more alert, which I could read from the way she clamped around my fingers. But it was an empty worry, as Mike’s struggle to find the right words was enough to distract him from noticing more important details; like the way her nipples tried to cut free of her dress and the way she pressed her lips together to hide her moans. </p><p>“It’s a bit uncomfortable,” she explained in a hurried gasp, unable to separate her arousal from invading her voice. </p><p>I decided to cut in. “It must be the chair,” I explained. “It’s not exactly comfortable. Here, let me help.” And just like that, I pulled my hand from its snug resting place, and wrapped it around her waist. Her eyes popped up in shock, but it was just a beginning. I tugged her hard, in perfect alignment with my shaft. She tried to turn towards me, but it was already too late. With my arms around her waist, there was no escape for her. I pulled her down, lodging my shaft deep inside her. It was a good thing that I had already warmed her up with my fingers, otherwise, it would be impossible for her to keep her voice down. Even then, it was a small miracle for her to keep it contained. </p><p>“What the hell!” Mike slurred, his anger at my sudden closeness with his wife managing to break his passive stupor. Thankfully, he kept sitting, as there would have been no hiding if he actually bothered to stand up. I doubted that, even in his half-blind state, he would miss the fact that I was impaling his wife in front of him. </p><p>“Come on Mike,” I said conversationally. “It’s just joking around between work friends, right? Not really a big deal.” I let my eyes fall on the papers he had been painstakingly working on for the last several minutes, long enough that even in his drunken state he had caught the insinuation. Though how he missed what was going on with his wife while catching my gaze told a lot about his priorities. “But if you are willing to be a party pooper…”</p><p>But, while he might be unaware of what was going on underneath the table, that still left the problem of his ‘boss’ openly molesting his wife in front of him. He was frozen in indecision, something that hadn’t slipped from Tiffany’s attention. I decided to act, not wanting to waste even a second of the amazing experience I was having. I steeled my grip around her waist, and started pumping. </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I could see that her expression, which could be described as freaked out, but it somehow passed Mike’s muster during his introspection. Maybe he missed it completely, or maybe he assumed that it was her response to suddenly finding herself on the lap of a stranger. Regardless, he continued his silent assessment of for the response he was about to give, and I continued fucking his wife in front of him… And longer the silence stretched, harder it became for him to give an actual answer. </p><p>He reached for his glass to give a reason for his silence. A glass that had been filled to a brim. And with his tastebuds deadened with the excessive amount he already consumed, he carelessly gulped it down, treating his high-proof drink like water. “It’s a bit inappropriate,” he murmured pathetically in the end. “It feels like crossing a boundary,” he answered after he placed his glass down, but he said that in a weak, trembling voice. </p><p>“Whatever you wish, man,” I answered as I loosened my grip around Tiffany’s waist, allowing her to stand up. Tiffany started raising herself, but instead of pulling away completely, But, to my surprise, instead of pulling away completely, she slammed herself back across my length, swallowing the full length. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one that was surprised by Mike’s slow response. And unlike my reaction, she was decidedly unhappy about it, reflected by her preferred method of revenge. </p><p>“Come on, dear,” Tiffany answered with a thin layer of sweetness that failed to hide the venom below even as her hips started to grind my lap, pushing my shaft even deeper, but like most of the subtext, Mike had managed to miss that as well. “Like we have talked in the kitchen, there isn’t any harm in a bit of playful teasing, is there?” </p><p>Mike had fallen silent once again, caught flatfooted by the source of the resistance. And my unlikely ally’s statement worked wonders. “It wasn’t exactly what I had in mind,” Mike spat back, but his gaze had fallen on the table document, avoiding her gaze. The last glass that he had consumed was starting to take its toll. </p><p>“And what did you have in mind?” Tiffany countered even as she raised herself up in her seat, her walls caressing my shaft gently, her face painted with vindication. It was Mike’s mistake, angering his redheaded wife to a point where she delighted the opportunity to cheat him just a couple of feet away. </p><p>“I don’t know…” Mike murmured, his words lingering into nothing, misreading her outrage completely, but still cowed by it. He closed his eyes. At first, I had thought that he was trying to compile an answer, but then he put his hands on his temples, suggesting that it was the effects of all the drinks he had consumed, slowly squeezing consciousness out of him. </p><p>And a few seconds later, he finally decided to put his head on the table, surrendering in his rigged battle against booze, removing the last restriction I had been under. I leaned to Tiffany’s ear, who was watching her husband’s last gem of action with shocked eyes, and whispered. “About time, now we can really cut loose.” </p><p>My hands were already traveling as I whispered those words, so it wasn’t a surprise when one of my hands found her breasts before she could say anything, treating myself with the first grasp of her supple flesh. She opened her mouth in shock to react, finally realizing that we were well-past a dangerous point, but she had one mistake. She had lost track of where my other hand was. A mistake that she had realized quite harshly when I grabbed the knot that was holding her together. All it took was one insistent tug for her dress to slide down, revealing her chest bare. </p><p>I was ready for her panicked cry, so I pressed my hand on her lips the moment she opened her mouth, muffling her cry. Moreover, I used the opportunity to push even deeper inside her, her breasts tangling attractively in front of me. “You should be careful,” I commented, in a tone a shade above a whisper. “You don’t want your dear husband to wake up, do you?”</p><p>“No,” she answered softly when I pulled off her hand as well. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I shifted my hand from her lips to her hair, roughly grabbing her red strands, slamming into her repeatedly. And from the way her body was responding, I was willing to bet that her objections had fallen onto wayside under the pleasure of the moment.</p><p>As minutes passed, I could feel my need for a  climax growing. I was struck with a desire to fill her up. But, even with my current success in controlling her, I doubted that I could just risk impregnating her without earning her explosive ire. Then, my eyes fell on Mike, his head pressed on his arms as he tried to combat his drunken vertigo, unaware of what was happening. I remembered the small discussion I had with the neighborhood gossip about their attempts to have a child. </p><p>Until now, Mike had been the perfect idiot to push my agenda. And in his drunken state, there was no reason for him not to generate even more impressive pearls of failure. “By the way, Mike,” I asked, ignoring the way Tiffany stiffened with fear on my lap. It was a rightful fear considering her state of dress. Or more accurately, the lack of it.  </p><p>“Yesss,” Mike murmured from his mental place between consciousness and unconsciousness. But he kept his head on the table, therefore missing the fact that his wife was jumping up and down on my lap. </p><p>“Are you guys planning to have children,” I asked, smirking at Tiffany when she twisted her neck to face me, but still continuing her treatment on my shaft. </p><p>“We’re trying,” he mumbled. </p><p>“No result yet?” I asked mockingly. “Is there anything wrong with you?” </p><p>“Of course not,” he answered sharply, and tried to raise his head, but his drunken vertigo was too strong. “My swimmers are strong. But I suspect that bitch is taking birth control pills.” </p><p>Jackpot, I thought as I saw Tiffany’s face alight with anger. Rejecting to go to the doctor for fertility issues was bad enough, but blaming his wife for it, even in his drunken state, was a touch too far. “Perfect timing,” I whispered into her ear. “I’m just about to release. Do you want to prove him wrong?” </p><p>It was a horrible decision, but the cacophony of emotions she was under was designed perfectly to encourage horrible decision making. After a second’s pause, her lips parted open ominously, and whispered two words. “Go ahead.” </p><p>I didn’t need a second prompting. My grip around her waist tightened, locking her in place, and I started spraying her insides with my seed, which, combined with the significance of the moment, managed to trigger a rather explosive orgasm in her as well, and we shuddered in harmony. </p><p>I only pulled out after spraying all of my seed inside her, earning a catlike purr of her. “Is there a taxi I can call,” I said. “It’s going to be late.” </p><p>She looked at me angrily, but mollified after seeing my smirk and my implied teasing. “You don’t expect me to sleep alone after this, do you?” she asked. </p><p>“You want me to help you carry Mike upstairs?” I asked. </p><p>“Funny,” she snarked before standing up on her tiptoes, and put a heated kiss on my lips. “Come on,” she said as she grabbed my hand. “I realized, as a hostess, I’m in remiss, not giving you a tour of the house. Come on…” </p><p>I followed her, enjoying the amazing view, rather compounded by the fact that her sexy dress had bunched up in the middle, acting like a thick belt while leaving her body naked. I had a feeling that the next stop was going to be a ride to remember...</p>",
