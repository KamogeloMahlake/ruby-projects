    "content": "<p>With my surroundings covered with an indescribable flux of energy that defied every rule of nature, I didn’t have a hope of finding my way back — and even if I did, I wasn’t confident in breaching the dimensional barrier. </p><p>Another long round of experimentation awaited me. But before I could start that, I had two things to achieve.</p><p>First, I ignored the constant pain dancing on my skin. While my Divine Spark was successful in pushing back the Primordial Energy for a short while, it was a close call to permanent death, and left its mark, leaving my skin burned horribly. </p><p>And, without system-provided HP to automatically cure it, it stayed without being healed, painful. I wanted to cure it, but not at the cost of my shield suddenly shattering. </p><p>I focused on my shield first, creating a three-layered shield, the first layer soft and porous enough to allow some Primordial Aether to pass, while the second and third ones had access points that worked like taps, but they didn’t overlap to make sure a sudden flare directly broke them down. </p><p>It was a simple yet effective layout, only made frustrating by the fact that it took almost an hour to set up successfully, with several spectacular failures that would have turned into a deadly disaster without the backup mana I  was keeping in the storage. </p><p>Without the boost of my stats and skills, my ability to come up with genius structures was simply gone. What a horrible loss, and particularly frustrating that, all along the crafting, I had to force myself trying to ignore the constant pain filling my body. </p><p>“Now, to healing,” I murmured even as I pulled some mana from the storage, trying to cast a healing spell.</p><p>Trying, and failing horribly. </p><p>“Fuck,” I gasped in shock at the extent of my failure. I didn’t fail to shape the spell,  or cast the spell appropriately. No, I had failed at the simplest stage, transforming the mana into life energy, the raw state that was required to cast that spell. </p><p>It seemed that, even while blocking the assistance of the system, I had misunderstood the amount of assistance that the system had been providing. I closed my eyes, using my Tantric to look inward. </p><p>Luckily, with Tantric still working, I didn’t lose the ability to look inward, but the clarity of vision I had been enjoying was gone. I could see the skill and stat nodes sitting in my soul space, immobile, but with no reaction.</p><p>Even Tantric was immobile, without any improvement, but unlike the other skills, I could still use the abilities granted by it.</p><p>Other than Tantric, however, everything was immobile. The same applied to achievements, perks, everything… There was not even a spark in my soul space, just like the fake soul space I had maintained to trick the headmistress.</p><p>Fake soul space,  including the fake companion node that hid a small Light Divine Spark, yet to be absorbed. “Let’s see if you work,” I murmured as I channeled just a couple points of mana, the purest I could manage, and watched it transform. </p><p>I nodded in satisfaction, even though despite transformation was far from being usable. The light spells were always unyielding and harsh, but with the assistance of the system, they were easily formed into various shapes, even integrated into wards, making it an excellent offensive option.</p><p>Without the elemental control to assist, it was like trying a red-hot sword as a weapon. Damaging, certainly, but more damaging to the wielder than the opponent.</p><p>“Still, better than nothing,” I murmured. Arcana magic had its limitations when it came to dealing damage, a factor that was compounded by my limitations of shaping mana, and having the ability to add some Light Elemental would give me the edge.</p><p>And, luckily, light elements didn’t just summon true elementals as basic elements did. Remembering the carnage the elementals were dealing with during my disappearance, I didn’t dare experiment even with the weakest pure element spell. </p><p>“Maybe I need to try something else,” I murmured even as I transformed another point of mana into Light energy, but this time, I immediately used Tantric on it, softening its structure. </p><p>The first attempt was a failure. Under the effect of the Tantric, the mana lost all of its quality, turning back to pure mana, which was hardly the greatest effect. The second and third attempts weren’t any better, one not affecting it at all, the other once again completely purifying it. </p><p>“It’s hard,” I murmured as I continued repeating. Technically, it would have been easier to find the correct ratio if I was willing to convert more than a single point of mana with each repeat, but that would mean risking self-damage in case of an accident.</p><p>And, without HP, I was not willing to suffer any Light damage. It would have been humorously tragic if I died to my own spell after managing to find a way to survive in Primordial Aether. </p><p>Patience was the key, which only got truer the more challenging the situation got. And, my own situation was as challenging as it could get. </p><p>It took a long while for me to get even elementary control over light magic. Something between half a day and a day, but that was my best guess — I had no idea how the time worked in Primordial Aether, it might as easily have been a few hours or a couple days as well. </p><p>It was hard to keep track when the only thing I saw was a swirling mess of colors that were not colored. </p><p>“Still, it’s time to go back to healing spells,” I murmured, hoping the discoveries I had made while playing with the Light mana would still benefit me. Another half a day had passed, mostly fruitless as I tried to force mana to transform, just like how I once transformed the ordinary mana into heat, before I gained my first Elemental Magic skill. </p><p>Unfortunately, life energy was something much more complicated than the simplicity of heat, cold, or other fundamental elements. In comparison, healthy energy required a much more careful balance. Miss, and only pain awaited... </p><p>“It’s not working,” I groaned as I looked outside, catching a sudden solid presence outside, at the distance, but it was gone before I could react.</p><p>Still, it was a sign that I wasn’t destined to float in emptiness hopelessly. I just needed the luck that the next one had drifted nearer.</p><p>Meanwhile, I continued experimenting, trying to create healing energy, but I failed to achieve what I had been searching for despite the endless repeats, leaving me hopeless. Still, I wasn’t bored because…</p><p>“Shit, not again,” I murmured as I suddenly found myself in a chaotic tribulation of energy as the outer layer of my shield shattered, and the second layer cracked threateningly, forcing me to reinforce, even then the weak patch I was using as a tap shattered.</p><p>I recreated the shield in a hurry while I considered the merits of creating a fourth layer. The more I stayed in the Primordial Aether, the more I understood why it was treated as such a life-threatening environment. </p><p>I lost count of how much mana I had spent, but by the measurements of the system, I wouldn’t be surprised if it eclipsed a hundred thousand. It was still not as impressive as the reckless rain of spells I had experienced while under siege, but it was close. </p><p>“Maybe I could approach it in a different manner,” I thought with a sudden stroke of inspiration. I pulled some of my Divine Spark from my body — and immediately felt my body weakening despite the relatively little I had pulled — and channeled some of the mana through it. </p><p>The mana lost its pure state, transforming into something that was hard to describe. Soft as clay, and equally as useful. But, it allowed me to play around with it, and after sufficient enough attempts, it turned into something approximately close to HP.</p><p>“Let’s try,” I murmured as I let some of it touch my body, watching anxiously as my body slowly absorbed it.</p><p>“Success!” I gasped in excitement. Well, in a way, I corrected myself as I let my body absorb it, my burn wounds slowly fading away. My technique simply had a horrible conversion rate, almost requiring a thousand mana points to gain enough energy that could function as one point of HP. </p><p>It took hours to gather about a hundred HP equivalent that was required to cure my wounds, and it forced me to spend another hundred thousand mana points. </p><p>Luckily, neither time nor mana was things I was in short supply. Having some kind of method of recovery was more important than anything else, with the sole exception of a method to find my way, but even that was less urgent. </p><p>But, with my protection and recovery handled, that was my next objective…</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The sudden change of environment was difficult, difficult enough that I didn’t pay anything more than the slightest attention to the Material Plane in front of me even as the protective energy around itself closed to push away the elementals. </p><p>That was all I was able to do as the chaotic energies of the Primordial Aether invaded my body. And, with the System still unreachable, I didn’t have HP to counteract the impact, giving me very little time to respond. </p><p>It didn’t even take a second for every single item I had been carrying to turn to dust, and for the Primordial Aether to invade my body. </p><p>I didn’t even have any mana to resist with the System still gone. </p><p>For a moment, I expected immediate death, before I could even try to come up with a solution. After all, both Mariel and Janelor explained the destructiveness of the Primordial Aether in great detail. </p><p>Yet, for some reason, that turned out not to be the case, I realized as a second passed, and I found myself still alive. The Material Plane was gone, of course, as the concept of distance meant very little in the great disaster I found myself in. </p><p>It went against every single instinct in my body to actually close my eyes, ignoring the great threat represented by the environment, but I forced myself to do so. The pain was intense enough to tell me that, unless I discovered the reason for my immediate survival in the next few seconds, I would end up dead. </p><p>However, closing my eyes was only the beginning of my focus. With the Primordial Aether filling my body, I first needed to ignore the downpour of the heavy burning energy that pressed against me like mercury. </p><p>The space around me distorted as I turned my attention inward, glad that, unlike my other skills, Tantric was a part of my body, allowing me to check my own body. </p><p>Only to see the Divine Spark fighting against the invasion of Primordial Aether. I bit my lips in shock. </p><p>I wasn’t shocked to see that it was the Divine Spark that allowed me to survive. My shock came from a different angle. Particularly, the way my Divine Spark was battling against Primordial Aether, breaking down with each touch. </p><p>Soon, some of it had been reduced into a similar state to the Aether I had dealt with while teleporting. And, more importantly, some of it turned into mana. </p><p>Giving me a chance to survive. </p><p>At least, some kind of mana, I corrected myself even as I did my best to use my fledging Arcana abilities to create a shield, glad for all the times I had tried to cast spells while blocking the System’s assistance. </p><p>My attempt was even harder than I expected. Some reasons were predictable. For example, I didn’t just lack the boost of the skill but my great stats as well, which reduced my mana control capabilities greatly. And, the environment that I was casting was hardly optimal, resisting the spell I was trying to cast. </p><p>Yet, the biggest difference was the mana itself. The mana provided by the System was pure and smooth, just like fresh spring water, glistening under the sun. The mana that my body managed to break down from my environment, however, had many impurities in it, like I had filled my glass from a muddy stream. </p><p>Still, it was not the worst, I thought as I was forced to maintain the energy around myself, glad that the impurities in it didn’t prevent me from channeling it — even at a greatly reduced effectiveness. </p><p>Such greatly reduced effectiveness that, creating a simple round shield around me to block the Primordial Aether even for a moment took all I could achieve. A pathetic shield that could easily be cast by a first-level mage. </p><p>In its pathetic state, it didn’t take a second for it to shatter, the mana was immediately lost in the chaotic waves of the Primordial Aether, but it gave me enough time to get some more to my body. </p><p>As the shield shattered, I turned my attention back to my surroundings as well, getting a glimpse of the show. The magical space in front of me danced and shattered, tempting me to cast a more substantial protection. </p><p>An elemental shield, supported by some mana might have worked better, but I didn’t dare to rely on elemental magic — not with the memories of real elementals possessing those spells. Even experimenting was out, as not only I was dealing with the constant erosion of the Primordial Aether — which was, thankfully, still blunted by the Divine Spark in me — but also impurities in mana, which was clearly dealing a significant amount of damage. </p><p>Maybe purer mana would help, I thought even as I tried to grab some of the mana inside my body, channeling against the only skill I could currently access.</p><p>Tantric.</p><p>Shockingly, it worked even better than I had expected, easily grinding down the impurities and giving me some pure mana for me to control. </p><p>It wasn’t much, barely a couple hundred points by the count of the System, but luckily it was enough to be channeled into a spell, creating a much better shield around my body. </p><p>Well, better as in it had hoped to resist the intense flow around me for a time that could justifiably be referred to as several seconds, giving me a chance to observe. </p><p>I was surrounded by nothing but Primordial Aether, dancing around me recklessly as if even the concept of the space was shattered, the turbulence threatening to shatter my shield and turn me into shreds even with the unforeseen advantage of the Divine Spark. </p><p>Still, there was no sense of distance or direction. I lost the ability to even feel the presence of my companions, making me feel extremely lonely. Though, considering I stopped all of their presence at the same time, I was confident that it was about my lost connection with the System rather than something happening to them. </p><p>At least, I hoped so, but even if it was worse than I expected, I could do nothing before solving the predicament I was facing first. </p><p>First, I needed more mana to prevent my shield from shattering. </p><p>I turned my attention to the pieces of Primordial Aether pushing against my mana, focusing on their shattered remains with the scraps I could still control with my Tantric. The process of transformation wasn’t particularly fast, but I still managed to gain enough mana to feed the shield and keep intact as I steadily worked to destroy the Primordial Aether that was inside my shield. </p><p>I was glad for the teleportation mishaps I had encountered, because, without them, I would have had no reason to develop such a shield in the first place. And while its performance was significantly worse against the Primordial Aether, it was not a problem. </p><p>After all, I had all the mana I could use.</p><p>Yet, that didn’t mean I didn’t understand why the others treated Primordial Aether with such fear. Without Tantric’s ability to break down the Primordial Aether into mana, there was no option but to die. With the exception of Janelor, the headmistress, and that mysterious enemy, every single person I met would have died in seconds. </p><p>And, even amongst those three, I suspected only Janelor could replicate my achievement — as evidenced by her ability to travel. But even she lacked my newly-discovered ability to breakdown Primordial Aether into mana if her words were accurate. </p><p>I might have been surprised by the performance of the Tantric, but after seeing it efficiently break down many types of divine sparks, it was much easier to register. </p><p>With my internal check-up complete, I turned my attention to my next challenge, to get some Primordial Aether without breaching my shield. I still had almost a thousand mana in storage, but repairing the shield constantly was devouring that storage rather steadily. </p><p>If there was an accident, I preferred it to happen when I had the means to fix it. I reached for the shield, identifying one of the more stable points in the matrix, waiting for a crack to appear — which didn’t take long under the constant bombardment of Primordial Aether. </p><p>When that happened, rather than repairing it, I widened the entrance, letting some Primordial Aether inside before plugging the gap with a second shield — allowing me to repeat the process much easier by creating a functional tap. </p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured as I processed the Primordial Aether as quickly as I could manage. As I did so, I could feel my Tantric abilities actively increasing, but there was no notification, which just confirmed the current unreachable status of the System while I drifted in Primordial Aether. </p><p>I thought about reinforcing the shield even more, but after some consideration, I decided against it. The stronger the shield, the more attention-grabbing it would be. I had no idea if any being actually treated Primordial Aether as their home. </p><p>But I was reluctant to find the answer to that question. I doubted I would be happy with my discovery. </p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>While Cinder froze at the sole option of involvement in the way Isolde was being punished, I was busy deciding what to do if she chose not to join. </p><p>But, after some consideration, I decided to write off ordering directly if she decided against it. Not because I was afraid of the way she would react against me. With our intimate magical connection, I didn’t fear any kind of rebellion or betrayal, even if I forced her to do something she found distasteful. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same protection didn’t apply to Isolde, and there was no doubt that Cinder was vindictive enough to target Isolde, even when in a situation I was to blame — a decision that was made particularly easy with Isolde’s attitude toward anything magical. She would just respond in kind.  </p><p>I would prefer two of my newest loyal followers not to try to kill each other the moment I turned my back. </p><p>Luckily, ordering her directly was not the only option I had to galvanize the flaming beauty in her knees, frozen in indecision. </p><p>I twisted Isolde’s nipple, making her let out a moan charged with arousal, magically-enforced edge play fulfilling its role as a torture tool excellently. </p><p>“Of course, you don’t have to help. It’s only fair not wanting to force her too much,” I said as I looked down. “Mercy is a perfectly admirable emotion.” </p><p>“What mercy!” Cinder gasped in protest, her scandalous expression amazingly intense, the implication that she was feeling a hint of mercy treated the same as the greatest insults I could even imagine. </p><p>“Such an interesting personality, right?” I whispered in Isolde’s ear, soft enough to be missed by Cinder in her distracted state as she leaned forward, her head disappearing between Isolde’s legs. </p><p>Isolde tried to answer, but I would never know what she would have said, as a moan was all she was able to create, once again showing that pleasure could be even more effective than pain as torture. </p><p>Her moans rose loudly, filling the little meadow we occupied, beautiful yet pitiful. But, unfortunately for her, Cinder wasn’t the only one who was deficient in softer emotions, leaving me to mercilessly enjoy the beauty of her moans. </p><p>I squeezed her breasts hard, treating her in a rough manner she clearly enjoyed, adding another flood of arousal to her dammed pleasure, growing to a disastrous level, making her moans even sharper. </p><p>But, as I glanced forward, I noticed Cinder wasn’t being particularly aggressive as her tongue lapped around Isolde’s wetness. It was time for some indirect encouragement, I decided. “I admire your willpower, even managing to resist our double assault without collapsing. Maybe I should let you decide your own reward if you can resist it for five minutes,” I said, a simple magical hourglass appearing in front of us the moment I uttered those words. </p><p>Isolde moaned at that, but the delirious quality in her tone showed she didn’t register the promised reward properly, too busy resisting the invasion of pleasure. Which was well, as she was not the target of my words. </p><p>Cinder was. </p><p>She was vindictive enough to take any chance of Isolde winning a challenge she was involved in as a personal affront. Though, as she pulled back for a moment to take a deep breath, I caught a glint of panic in her gaze, probably with the realization that Isolde might target her with the reward. </p><p>Admittedly, it was very likely. Isolde was no less vindictive than Cinder, and would gladly waste an opportunity to request something important from me to immediately make Cinder back. </p><p>Such amusing personalities, I thought as I watched Cinder lean down, her lips pressing against Isolde’s core with a renewed determination.  </p><p>Isolde reacted to the sudden increase of intensity predictably, with her moans exploding loudly, and her body trembling. </p><p>I cast another spell, this time loosening the chains around Isolde’s legs, enough to give her some mobility. Lost in pleasure, she didn’t notice it, needing my order to make her act. “Put your legs on her shoulders,” I whispered. </p><p>She followed that automatically, though it was an indicator of the depths of her pleasure when she just put her legs on her shoulder loosely rather than tightening around her neck — a little opportunity of physical revenge Isolde would have never ignored if the pleasure hadn’t already reached to an overwhelming level. </p><p>Her blush burned with a shocking intensity while Cinder pressed her head tightly, showing that her tongue was dancing there with surprising intensity, even with the encouragement of her ‘revenge’.</p><p>Interesting, but something that needed to be examined in the future, I decided as I turned my attention back on Isolde. After all, it would be rude if I didn’t properly handle my own role while she was dealing with hers. </p><p>One of my hands stayed on her breasts, mauling and caressing with irregular intervals, the confusing nature pushing the situation even more intensely. </p><p>Her nipples hardened even further, showing that the unpredictable assault I was mounting on her was working excellently. There was no need for me to do anything else. It wouldn’t take long until her punishment reached its completion. </p><p>Well, no need if I discounted my raging boner, begging to be released. Keeping the pace the same would mean I was torturing myself as well, which was rather silly, especially when my naked shaft already pressing against her bottom. </p><p>I pulled my hips back, and before Isolde could react to the change, pushed forward again, sliding inside her core with a merciless invasion, though, with her phenomenal wetness, it slid inside without the slightest resistance. </p><p>Cinder pulled back in shock at the sudden change of pace, but I caught her gaze. “Come on, sweetie, we’re almost about to win, no need to stop,” I said, my chuckle making her blush. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she stammered before leaning back, her tongue once again teasing her knob, the circular dance of her tongue contrasting with my reckless drilling, the lack of coordination intensifying Isolde’s beautiful torture even more. </p><p>I abandoned my determined focus on Isolde’s punishment, focusing on my own pleasure, reinforced further by Isolde’s subtle hip movements — the most she could do in her dazed state, showing that, even at the edge of being overwhelmed by pleasure, she didn’t lose her desire to serve. </p><p>What a beautiful servant, I decided, decided to have mercy on her. I cast another spell, dispelling the spell that was holding her back, but not instantly. Instead, I cast a spell to weaken that relatively slowly, constantly weakening, to be dispersed completely the moment the hourglass emptied. </p><p>Which was just enough for me to attain my own completion. </p><p>But not without some help. “Faster,” I ordered even as I spanked her ass hard, the jolt of pain enough for her to disperse the haze of the pleasure for a fleeting moment, reminding her enough to follow my order.</p><p>The movement of her hips got more pronounced, swinging back and forth easily as she used Cinder’s shoulders and her own chains for leverage — which was a more difficult movement to do than it sounded, but she had the physical capabilities to do so. </p><p>Our hips started to clap loudly, creating a backdrop to her constant moans, the delirium in her voice getting stronger and stronger with each second, the pleasure battling against unconsciousness. </p><p>And losing badly. </p><p>Yet, despite the inevitable direction, she stayed focused on her task, her hips grinding against me as intensely as she could manage under the circumstances, which definitely counted as a successful resistance. </p><p>It seemed that, despite all the adversity, she would win the little reward I had promised. </p><p>But, I wasn’t the only one that noticed it. Cinder raised her gaze and took a glimpse of the hourglass, already two-thirds empty. “It seems that she will earn her reward,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Don’t be so sure,” Cinder answered, her face determined as she leaned down once again, but this time, targeting a different location. Her tongue moved lower, directly teasing her entrance, but paying great attention to my rapidly disappearing shaft as well. </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed with her clever solution. I could have slowed down to reduce the impact of her addition, of course, but that would have been rude after the great initiative she displayed.</p><p>After all, it was something to be encouraged. </p><p>I reached my limit before the hourglass, and exploded inside her, the sudden invasion enough to trigger Isolde’s climax a second later despite the spell that was supposed to prevent it — though weakening after my timed display. </p><p>It seemed that, with my explosion, her pleasure reached a point to overwhelm the tethered spell. </p><p>I pulled back even as I waved my hand, dispelling the hourglass, leaving Isolde hanging with the chains, the climax enough to make her faint. </p><p>Cinder pulled back, still on her knees, her beautiful lips curled in a smirk, stained with Isolde’s juices.</p><p>Altogether, a very successful session of punishment…</p>",

    "content": "<p>The gasp Stacy let out as she found herself filled with my presence was beautiful. Almost as beautiful as the way her expression twisted into a dance of beauty and desire as her wetness wrapped halfway around me. </p><p>Her friend chuckled from the side. “Come on, sweetie, no need to exaggerate, it’s just a lap dance. Continue,” Nancy commented, acting like she was unaware of what was going on. Her naughty smirk was enough to reveal her duplicity, but Stacy had bigger things to do than gaze at that. </p><p>I said nothing, just letting my fingers continue to dance inside her aggressively, not letting her get bored while her friend tried to come to a decision. Nancy shuffled in pleasure, which pushed the jersey even higher to display more of her toned legs. My fingers were still not visible under her, but it was a close call. </p><p>While she wiggled on my fingers, Stacy was busy coming to a decision, which didn’t take too long. “You’re right,” she murmured a while later even as her hips started to move. “It’s just a simple lap dance. Where’s the harm.” With that, her hips started to move, sliding even deeper, her eyes still closed to enjoy the sensation. </p><p>It was a beautiful, erotic dance that was made even more alluring by her amazing curves, intense enough to earn a surprised glance from her friend, along with a blush — though that blush might also be about the quickening of my fingers. </p><p>The desperate way she bit her lips certainly suggested the second.  </p><p>“I think she deserves the title of number one fan, don’t you think?” I said as I looked at Nancy. </p><p>“O-of course I do,” Stacy commented, very much aware of the lengths she was going to for that title. </p><p>Nancy didn’t seem to agree with her comment. “Not necessarily, sweetie. You have the lead, but it’s a marathon, it doesn’t matter who starts first, but who finishes first,” she said as she looked at me. “In a sense of the word,” she added with a chuckle. </p><p>“N-nonsense, I’m obviously winning,” Stacy said as she glanced at her friend with a frown, one that she was only able to maintain for a second before the pleasure erased it. </p><p>“Why, isn’t it just a lap dance,” Nancy countered with a big smirk. Stacy froze, not knowing how to react to those words. I tightened my hand on her hips, leading her to move, and preventing her from stopping even as she tried to answer her friend while trying to conceal her situation. </p><p>Her efforts to conceal it were unnecessary, but she didn’t know that. </p><p>“R-right, just a lap dance,” Stacy found herself stammering after a long delay, showing that, while she had the courage to have sex in front of her friend, she didn’t have the courage to reveal that fact. </p><p>I chuckled, not bothering to say anything, enjoying their little scuffle too much to intervene. </p><p>“Good, then I could easily top it,” Nancy said as she looked to her friend, followed by a crystal laugh, making a point of putting her hand on Stacy’s naked thigh as she chuckled. </p><p>The extra contact was enough to prevent Stacy from answering. She busied herself with tugging down the jersey instead, doing her best to prevent an accident that would reveal what was going on. </p><p>“Oh, such shyness in front of strangers. It’s not like anything I hadn’t seen before back in college, or in the locker room,” Nancy chuckled as her fingers danced on her friend’s thighs. </p><p>I turned my gaze back to Stacy as she blushed, enjoying the way she squirmed under our combined gaze. “I’m guessing there’s a story there? Would you mind telling that?” </p><p>“I rather not,” Stacy murmured, but her determination folded quickly under her friend’s mocking giggle. She turned to Nancy, only to receive an encouraging squeeze — which allowed her to climb higher — to tell her the story. “Well, college is not always fun, and during busy final weeks, we didn’t have much time for dating.” </p><p>“Interesting, go on,” I said, already having an inkling about where the story was going, but watching as Stacy tried to handle her emotions was more entertaining than the predictable end of her story.</p><p>“Yes, Stacy, go on,” Nancy said as she leaned forward, which was handy to hide her own squirming. “Or maybe I should have told how one night you ambushed me in the shower —“ she continued, only to be interrupted by Stacy’s hand desperately silencing her. </p><p>In her hurry, she had also pulled the jersey up, giving a flash of what was going underneath, but she didn’t notice that little aspect. </p><p>She was busy looking frustrated even as she tried to come up with an answer, which didn’t get any easier as I pushed her hips back and forth, adding pleasure to her confusion as she tried to come up with the best way to talk about what was doubtlessly a fun lesbian adventure. </p><p>“S-since we didn’t have too much time for dating…” Stacy murmured, then took a deep breath which pushed her beautiful tits amazingly. </p><p>“You decided to handle those yourselves,” I commented, helping her. </p><p>“Yes,” Stacy whispered in defeat, though despite the defeat in her tone, her hips suddenly quickened, showing that she wasn’t as against telling the story despite her best efforts to look reluctant. “W-we have decided that it was more time efficient than trying to deal with college boys, especially during the finals week where only the worst of them had time for dating.” </p><p>“Oh, really, we … decided,” Nancy said with a chuckle. Stacy tried to cover her lips once more, but this time she was prepared, and leaned back. Which was enough considering Stacy was pinned in place with our anatomic connection. “Try wearing me down with a month of suggestions and subtle insinuations before finally ambushing me in the shower with your monster vibrator.” </p><p>Stacy’s blush was simply beautiful, and her hips quickened even more. “You didn’t exactly complain, did you,” she murmured as she looked down to avoid her amused gaze, and my interested one. </p><p>Nancy chuckled. “No, sweetie, I didn’t,” she said as she stood up, giving me a glimpse of her beautiful body before she fixed her jersey. Stacy was distracted by the movement to notice my glistening fingers, not that it would matter much at this point. “Though I certainly didn’t enjoy it as much as you.” </p><p>“T-that’s not true,” Nancy stammered while Stacy moved behind her, and I listened to a small scuffle between them about who was the true lesbian out of the two, and who was just experimenting. </p><p>“Nonsense, that’s completely inaccurate,” Stacy cut in after Nancy alluded to another story to support her point. Amusingly, as their argument continued, her shyness disappeared slowly, replaced by playful anger as she tried to counter her friend. </p><p>“I guess he has to trust one of us,” Nancy said as she looked at me with a smirk. </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I said, matching her smirk. “After all, talk is cheap, but there’s nothing preventing you from putting on an actual show, does it,” I suggested, giving Nancy the opportunity she was searching for, already positioned behind Stacy. </p><p>And she didn’t waste even a second as she hugged her friend from behind, making her tense. Stacy tried to lift herself, realizing that she was about to get caught, but it was impossible as she was being pushed down. “Let’s do it,” she said as she let her hands trail upward, brushing against the underside of her breast. “Unless you are scared, of course.” </p><p>“M-me, scared! Never,” Stacy answered. Her tone wasn’t exactly convincing, or filled with determination, but Nancy only care about the official permission as her hands moved up, sliding up, caressing her breasts and teasing her erect nipples. </p><p>Which seemed to be the correct choice that was born from experience. Nancy started leaving out a trail of kisses along her neck, showing a great familiarity with her body — enough to suggest that their sessions of fun might not be just limited to finals week as they suggested initially. </p><p> Stacy moaned as one of her hands slipped inside her jersey, caressing her breasts aggressively. The pleasure made her close her eyes, which was the thing that prevented her from noticing Nancy’s other hand sneaking down. </p><p>“Oh, what’s going on here,” Nancy said gleefully even as her fingers landed directly on her core, brushing against my shaft which was going in and out of her. </p><p>“I — I can —“ Stacy managed to say, which was all she was able to say before Nancy pressed her other hand against her lips, replicating their earlier position. </p><p>“No need,” she said with a chuckle. “But I can now understand why you are confident that you are winning, you sneaky slut,” she whispered. Her calling her friend might have been insulting in other circumstances, but it was significantly less effective when her fingers were right at her entrance, teasing her. </p><p>“I —“ she tried to say after Nancy pulled her hand away from her mouth, but this time she was interrupted by her own body, her moans getting louder as her arousal reached an earthshaking point, her moans warning about the earthquake that was about to hit. </p><p>And it hit spectacularly soon after, making her collapse against my chest even as Stacy pulled back, her legs wide as she teased herself with her fingers, enjoying the show immensely.</p><p>It was a beautiful moment, one that promised a  lot about what was about to follow. </p><p>Too bad it was interrupted by a knock. “Why’s that door locked, Nurse Lawson,” said a sharp, serious voice. </p><p>Someone important, if their matching gazes of shock were to be trusted.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“H-how do we look?” stammered Stacy, who was the shyer — and bustier — of the two. </p><p>“It’s hard to make a judgment before you give me a full glimpse,” I said even as I made a circling gesture, though my smile was more than enough to convey my gesture. </p><p>The other, whose name was yet to be uttered, giggled cutely as she turned elegantly, managing to complete her turn without disrupting the uniform she was wearing — a critical requirement considering her absence of underwear.</p><p>Which was good, as, despite my expression, my focus was not on her. Instead, I was focused inwardly, channeling the Intent that was flowing to the system. The earlier intensity disappeared as the news lost their explosiveness, but it was still considerable enough to make it worthwhile. </p><p>Especially with my guide taking all of the Intent while she was out, to the point of getting some from the system. </p><p>I tried to reinforce the system, to somehow block the flow from it, but as Stacy copied her friend inaccurately, I abandoned that path. One reason was that I had no idea what I was doing, making it most likely a useless effort. </p><p>More importantly, Stacy lacked her friend’s confidence. Which, ironically, made her turn more choppily, rustling the loose jersey and confirming my earlier assumption about the lack of panties. </p><p>Stacy gasped as she realized that, but her friend grabbed her arm and started dragging her toward the bed before she could retreat, and pushed her to my right side, while she took my left — and I placed my hand under her before she could sit, slipping directly inside her wetness.</p><p>Her eyes widened, but that was the limit of her reaction, while Stacy reacted more hesitantly even as I just wrapped her waist. “So, my beautiful nurses, where exactly do you want me to sign?” I asked even as I let my hands move, glad for the privacy I was enjoying as I enjoyed their curves. </p><p>“Well, why don’t we start with the jersey, and see how things go,” she said, and passed me a pen, which I grabbed with my right, my left still inside her, teasing her wetness. </p><p>“Excellent, what do you want me to say?” </p><p>“To Nancy, my number one fan would work,” she said with a smirk. “Then, you can sign Stacy as your second favorite,” she said with a chuckle. </p><p>“W-wait a moment,” Stacy intervened as she grabbed my wrist. “Why do you get to be the first one, I’m the better fan. I noticed him the first, I even won the bet,” she said, her stammer disappearing as she started talking more and more heatedly.</p><p>“Obviously because I’m willing to prove it,” Nancy said with a wink, her smile getting salacious — an emotion that was easy to put on thanks to my fingers. She would have quickly turned into a moaning mess if I had cut loose, of course, but I limited myself to soft caresses, not wanting to escalate it fast enough to scare Stacy. </p><p>After all, if there was a better way to spend my time with a beautiful nurse, was to have a threesome with two beautiful nurses. </p><p>I said nothing as they had a short yet intense playful argument, one that Stacy finished with a declaration of, “I’ll show you,” under the impression that she had won their little talk when she changed her seat, and sat on my legs.</p><p>Yet, the blush that covered her face quickly was enough to show that she had forgotten some critical facts while doing so. Facts like I was wearing just a flimsy hospital outfit that hid practically nothing, or the fact that her jersey was even flimsier with her absence of underwear. </p><p>Especially with her legs on both sides of me. </p><p>“Wow,” I said, acting impressed as I turned to Nancy. “She is determined to take the number one position. Do you want to just concede?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she said as she dipped her head down, though that was more about her trying to deal with the sudden rush of pleasure she was dealing with as my fingers danced. She was biting her lips as she raised her head back a moment later. “Maybe not,” she said as she started leaving a trail of kisses over the side of my neck. </p><p>“N-Nancy,” her friend gasped in shock as she looked, which I thought was unfair, as kisses along the neck were certainly as not daring as our naked skin touching as she sat on my legs, our bodies dangerously close.  </p><p>“What, we’re competing, aren’t we?” she answered. “Feel free to pull back if you don’t want to fight.” </p><p>“I’m sure she’s willing to fight for that exalted position, don’t you, honey?” I asked as I put my free hand on her hips, the jersey doing little to isolate the warmth of her skin. She nodded. “Maybe even a lap dance,” I suggested as I pulled her slightly forward. </p><p>“T-that might be a bit much,” she stammered. </p><p>“Come on, honey, it shouldn’t be much for my number one fan,” I said. “And, don’t worry,  I’m still wearing my gown, and you’re clothed as well.” </p><p>She said nothing against my argument, but she didn’t resist my pull as well, which meant she had accepted my bogus argument. Bogus because, the hospital gown I was wearing was thin enough that it might as well not exist. </p><p>And her lack of panties didn’t make the situation any less scandalous, Stacy realized as she found herself on my lap, directly on top of my raging boner. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I pinned her under my gaze. “Now, the dance part.” </p><p>“Good point,” Nancy said as she grabbed the remote, and turned on the TV, directly to a music channel that was showing upbeat music. “Show him why you’re known as the tease queen, sweetie,” said Nancy. </p><p>“S-shut up,” Stacy answered with a blush. </p><p>“There’s clearly a story there,” I interrupted with a chuckle. </p><p>Stacy looked at Nancy in warning, but she just ignored it. “That’s from high school. She was a late bloomer, and for a long while after that bloom hit, she didn’t buy new outfits, getting more and more salacious, taking revenge from the boys for previously ignoring her.” </p><p>“I …” she started before her words faded, but her hips started moving faster. “They deserved it for ruining my freshman year,” she admitted a second later. </p><p>“Good for you, honey,” I said even as I sneaked my fingers under her jersey, touching her naked ass. </p><p>“I —  no touching during a lap dance,” she managed to stammer. </p><p>“Ah, no exception for your favorite player,” I answered. She said nothing, but her blush and her quickening hips showed that it was an argument she was willing to accept.  She mumbled something a moment later, but it was so low that I was unable to hear even with all the Traits supporting me. </p><p>“Louder, sweetie,” I said. “The music is a bit loud, after all.” Nancy chuckled from the side as I delivered my words —  which she used to hide her own moan, as I used Stacy’s distraction to the limit as I let my fingers go free, invading her core aggressively. </p><p>Stacy stayed silent, unaware of what was going on next to her as she avoided us, not unlike a lazy student who got challenged by the teacher. I might have challenged her under different circumstances, but considering her hips quickened their dance, I was willing to cut her some slack. </p><p>She looked disappointed when I pulled my hand away from her, but that didn’t last long. I grabbed the neck of the jersey, and pulled down, creating a beautiful cleavage that gave me a perfect glimpse of what lay underneath. “Beautiful,” I murmured. </p><p>“I’m sure she can give you a better view,” Nancy said as she grabbed her arm and pulled her forward. Not expecting such an intervention, Stacy toppled forward, and I found myself buried in her cleavage. </p><p>I deliberately moaned a muffled answer even as I put my hand on her waist preventing her from pulling back. “I’m sure she doesn’t mind, do you, sweetie?” Nancy said. </p><p>“Umm… I guess not,” Stacy answered, her hesitancy unable to suppress her arousal even as I shook my head, motorboating her impressive bosom. </p><p>However, while Stacy submissively enjoyed the treatment, Nancy proved that she was the more mischievous of the two once again. She tugged my gown so as to let my shaft completely free, her fingers wrapping around, dancing up and down to tease me even better than her friend had been doing earlier. </p><p>Stacy stayed in place, doing her best to suffocate me under her beautiful weight, unaware of the tricks her friends had been pulling — or busy receiving — still under the impression that she was the most daring person in the room. </p><p>An assumption that was greatly challenged once she lowered herself, only for her to realize the obstruction between our bodies was gone. Her face twisted in shock as she realized that not only it was gone, but my shaft was aligned perfectly to slip inside her. </p><p>She might be under the impression that it was a great accident, but that was only because she lacked to angle to see her friend aligning it to make a perfect trap. </p><p>She froze in indecision, until her friend intervened and pushed her down. </p><p>With some amazing results.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Half an hour passed in silence before the speaker crackled once more. “And, it’s finally over, and you have been an exemplary patient,” finally said the voice from the speaker even as the deafening noise stopped. “We’re going to help you to your room, and the doctor will be with you after examining the results.” </p><p>I said nothing as the bottom part of the MR machine slid out, and soon, I found myself facing two nurses. </p><p>Two shockingly beautiful brunette nurses — who were very much aware of the fact if the unbuttoned tops were any indicator. “Let’s help you to your chair,” said one of them said as she grabbed my arm, her body unnecessarily close. </p><p>Their actions surprised me for a moment before the realization hit. After the match on Sunday, I was a bonafide local celebrity, and the earlier battle I had put in the stadium to get the quarterback position only pushed the situation further. </p><p>“W-what are they doing?” my guide gasped. “And why are they dressed like … this?” she added, an argument that turned even more amusing due to the way she was dressed. </p><p>I caught her gaze and mouthed my answer. “They are just helping me.” </p><p>Luckily, with the hospital gown I was wearing, nurses had other things to focus on than my face — especially since I had a respectable bulge thanks to the earlier angelic show, and my hospital gown failed miserably in its task to hide it.</p><p>They started pushing, one behind me, the other walking forward, the way her hips shook giving me an enjoyable show, their dance too excessive to be accidental. The way her uniform was bunched around her waist showed that her uniform was not that short. </p><p>Though, I didn’t need to notice that to guess that fact, the occasional flashes of her underwear were enough to confirm that. </p><p>Interestingly, there was no one in the corridor to catch the spectacle. </p><p> “Huh, I would have expected the hospital to be more crowded,” I murmured, which was far cleaner and wider than I expected. </p><p>The one walking in front of me turned — not neglecting to lean down to give me a glimpse of her cleavage in the process — before opening her beautiful lips. “It’s because this is the VIP corridor,” she said with a chuckle. “We don’t want our patients to be stalked. </p><p>I smiled. Their actions were firmly in stalking territory as well, but there were many things in life that were acceptable when done by attractive people, and stalking was one of them. </p><p>Was that fair, certainly not, but life wasn’t fair. </p><p>The travel didn’t take long, and my guide said nothing, observing her surroundings. Unlike the first time she appeared, however, her gaze was not filled with a silly fascination, but a cold calculation. </p><p>Suggesting it wouldn’t be as easy to trick her the next time she asked me something. </p><p>“Wow, better than a hotel,” I said as I looked around, which was not an exaggeration. A large, comfortable bed, beautiful furniture, and a huge screen on the wall. If it wasn’t for the medical devices filling half of the room, I would have thought we actually arrived at a five-star resort. </p><p>“Anything for our great hero,” they said together, which was clearly rehearsed. </p><p>I chuckled. Their attempt was transparent, but that didn’t mean I would bother stopping them. Why would I, when they did their best to make the shift between the chair and the bed very enjoyable? </p><p>There was no harm in walking while suffering a concussion, but since they were enthusiastic to help me, it would be rude to reject, I thought, amused by the blush my guide was sporting as she avoided looking our direction. </p><p>“Thanks, my great caretakers,” I said with a roguish smirk, which was already impressive without my Traits helping me. And, the combination of my Seduction and my apparent fame turned into a devastating weapon as they looked at me. </p><p>“W-well, not a bother,” one of them managed to stammer. The other failed even that as she glanced down, their blushes matching. </p><p>Great success. </p><p>“So, girls, what’s next for my treatment?” I asked. </p><p>“N-nothing much,” the other stammered, but the mention of their job helped her to focus. “Concussions are tricky businesses, and there’s not much to do. You just need to stay awake while one of the neurologists goes through the diagnostic and makes sure there is nothing that requires an operation. But from the way you look, it’s clearly not necessary.” </p><p>“Good,” I said. “You girls helped me a lot, is there anything I could do for you.” </p><p>“W-well, we wouldn’t say no to a signature,” one of them said.</p><p>“Sure,” I said, even though I barely held back a chuckle at the request, realizing that I was actually becoming a proper celebrity. </p><p>She clapped her hands, and I didn’t bother hiding my gaze dropping down to watch its impact on her beautiful chest. I expected her to pull a napkin, or maybe even be daring and lean forward so that I could sign her chest. </p><p>This was why I was surprised when she dashed toward the TV, and opened one of the drawers, but it lasted until she pulled out two jerseys, identical. </p><p>Number fifty-two, with my name on the back. </p><p>I looked at her with an amused expression while she blushed. “W-we have always been a supporter of the Pirates, and it was nice to see them finally winning again,” she murmured shyly. </p><p>“Yeah, that, and we were smart enough to go and buy those jerseys during halftime. I heard there had been a few fights after the match for the jerseys,” the other said with a smirk. “My friends will die of jealously once they see them signed.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but curse at the student league regulations. The sales of the jersey and other memorabilia meant absolutely nothing for the players monetarily. As student-athletes, we basically allowed them to use our likeness and name for free. </p><p>At least I received intent from it, which was much better than what other players received. </p><p>A big nothing. </p><p>I suddenly gave them a serious look. “I’m afraid I can’t sign those,” I said, their smiles disappearing. “I’m afraid a real fan would have been wearing the uniform.” </p><p>“But we’re currently working —“ the one that had initially pulled the jerseys started in panic, making her friend poke her on the side. </p><p>“Stacy,” she murmured with a deadpan glare as she looked at her friend, who stopped in confusion at first, then noticed my smirk. </p><p>“Oh,” she murmured even as her still nameless friend turned toward me. </p><p>“Oh, that can be arranged,” she said as she walked to the door and locked it.</p><p>“Wouldn’t locking the door be a trouble?” I asked even as she dragged Stacy, who was clearly shyer — and curvier — of the two to the bathroom. </p><p>“Of course not, there’s a lot of private procedures,” she answered with a wink, then they disappeared into the other room, closing the door behind them. </p><p>Which was, interestingly, not the bathroom, but another room, showing that it wasn’t just a luxury room I was resting, but a luxury suite. </p><p>“What are you doing?” my guide said as she looked at me, finally able to turn and look at me now that the nurses had left the room. </p><p>“I’m doing my best to generate Intent, of course. You told me that the darkness is coming and I needed to get stronger. And, I’m chasing the most viable path.” </p><p>That was enough to make her pause for a second. “S-still,” she stammered cutely. “That doesn’t mean that you need to act like that bastard to do so,” she added. </p><p>“Hey, find a way to give me more without actually being targeted by the cursed flames, and I’ll think about it,” I said, which was enough to silence her. “By the way, I had been attacked by some kind of a shadow assassin while you are away. Is it somewhat related to this Darkness you mentioned,” I added, deciding to ask about it while she was distracted was the best way. </p><p>I would have hidden that information under different circumstances, but considering I needed her to protect me while I was sleeping, that was not a luxury I had. </p><p>I didn’t want to die while trying to act cagey. </p><p>Not that I gave her the full breakdown, of course. I didn’t mention multiple attacks, or multiple assassins. </p><p>“A shadow assassin,” she said with a frown. “How did you handle it.” </p><p>“I don’t know, I was busy panicking and trying to kill it. It seemed that they had a time limit,” I explained, giving her a reasonable explanation that didn’t require my ability to actively channel Intent. </p><p>Maybe I was being excessive not revealing my ability to channel Intent and directly control the system, but she was yet to earn that trust. I needed some advantages of my own. </p><p>Especially since she was actively devouring quite a bit of intent from the System rather than triggering it once more — which, to her knowledge, was necessary to give me more abilities. </p><p>While she thought, I carefully focused on the System, blocking the intent flow from the System to her. Luckily, it was much easier than actually stealing from the initial free Intent flow, giving me a chance to keep most of my gains. </p><p>“Maybe it was miscast,” she murmured after some thinking, then looked at me. “Unfortunately, it’s hard to know. Shadow soldiers is a relatively simple spell, and it can be cast by anyone especially if it collapsed halfway,” she explained. </p><p>Before she could ask anything else, however, the door opened once more, and two nurses entered once more, wearing my jerseys. </p><p>The shocked gasp my guide let out was simply beautiful as she disappeared, and I felt her mental presence settling next to the System once more. </p><p>Though, her shock was understandable, as if the lack of lines around her hips and chest was any indicator…</p><p>They were wearing my jerseys, and nothing else… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Xia’s reaction to my mana was enough to temporarily stop my ponderings over the reason for their strategic decision-making. </p><p>After all, her awakening would resolve a much more significant amount of problems. </p><p>I was lucky that my increased senses allowed me to assess the way her body was reacting to my mana, as with my current control, any attempt to actually cast a healing spell would have been a disaster. </p><p>Killing her directly would have been easier. The end result would have been the same, but at least she wouldn’t suffer. </p><p>And, without my senses, allowing me to carefully trace the path and the impact of my mana, I would have pulled my hand back in fear, afraid that, in its chaotic state, it would have a similar impact to a deliberate spell. </p><p>Yet, it worked much differently. My mana danced along her body with great smoothness. While it was not as smooth as the flow of her own mana, it was still considerably more obedient than any external source. </p><p>Which included the way the mana was provided by Dragon Hearts, which had been one of the best sources in terms of mana adaptability. That, combined with its near-limitless ability to provide mana, ensured Dragon Hearts were one the greatest wonders of the world. </p><p>The kind that not only made people fight, but also made the countries go to war. </p><p>And, currently, I was watching my own mana acting as a superior version of a Dragon Heart, my mana slowly filling her body, far faster and much less destructively than a dragon heart would. </p><p>A great contrast to my own struggles to cast any spell. </p><p>“There goes my plan of cooperation,” I murmured, instantly adjusting my plans in light of my latest unwelcome discovery. </p><p>I thought that cooperating with the Empire was a reasonable strategy, because I didn’t have enough to tempt them for a reckless hunt — though that was a close calculation, and required me to keep the possession of two of the three weapons in my possession hidden. </p><p>A Patrician Weapon was sufficiently tempting. </p><p>… three was madness-inducing. </p><p>Yet, the latest discovery of the way my mana had been reacting was enough for me to shelve my plans of cooperation. Because, after I had displayed a certain level of ability, it was obvious that the Empire would start paying attention to me as well. </p><p>While I had enough dangerous secrets, none of it could be compared to functioning as a better version of Dragon Hearts, not that it represented raising an impressive number of Sorcerers. </p><p>Of course, it was entirely likely that I had been grossly misreading the impact of that mana, and it was something that was special to Xia’s constitution, but I didn’t want to take the risk. </p><p>Especially since others might have similar concerns. </p><p>It was time for experimentation, I thought as I put my finger on Xia’s mouth, gathering the smallest amount of mana I could control to the tip of my finger without forming it into a spell. </p><p>Of course, with my control ruined, the smallest amount of mana I could gather was considerable — more than my peak output before I had the misfortune of facing a sea serpent and made the reckless decision to absorb my first dragon heart. </p><p>The fact that I had to specify which dragon heart I had absorbed was just another sign of just how ridiculous my life had become. </p><p>Amusingly, the only reason I was able to control that ‘little’ amount of mana was that I didn’t try to push it out, but let it dance on my skin, while Xia absorbed it slowly. </p><p>I watched carefully as her body accepted my mana, slowly showing the signs of awakening. She slowly absorbed my mana for several minutes, and luckily, in that time, no one visited the secret deck once more, allowing us to stay undetected by relying on the isolation wards. </p><p>My magical presence was much stronger during the process of transfer. </p><p>Luckily, they were sufficiently busy upstairs as they tried to maintain the ship while it moved with the greatest possible speed while still under the complicated illusion ward. </p><p>Xia’s eyes opened. </p><p>“Where are we?” was her first words as she looked around, the panic in her gaze unmistakable. </p><p>Not entirely unjustified, as her last memory was us trying desperately hide from the gaze of an Archmagus after we had created a level of discord in Rome that hadn’t been seen in centuries.  </p><p>“We managed to arrive at the ship we are aiming for,” I started, and she relaxed in my hold, a process that immediately reversed with my next words. “Unfortunately, it’s not as smooth as I expected.” </p><p>“How-“ she tried to ask, but only for me to put my finger on her mouth to her face, and silence her with it. </p><p>Her eyes widened in shock, and this time, it was not about the complicated situation she found herself in. </p><p>I had pushed my mana to my finger once again, and her body absorbed it.</p><p>“How!” she repeated, almost catatonic with the impossibility of the situation. </p><p>“I don’t know, sweetie, you’re the expert,” I said. “That’s how you managed to wake up this easily. Why don’t you make sure that there’s no side effect before we continue with the more important parts of our discussion.” </p><p>She threw an angry glare at me as she realized the risk I had taken with her life, but ultimately, she said nothing. </p><p>It wasn’t like we had the luxury of playing safe. </p><p>As she cast an impressive range of diagnostic spells on herself — most of them looking similar enough for me to lose any sense of distinction despite my sensitivity giving me a more accurate analysis of the situation. </p><p>To anyone else, I wouldn’t have dared to reveal the way my mana had worked — with the exception of two sexy ladies that had accompanied me for the better part of the year in the lost city — but after everything that we had gone through, our lives had already been intertwined enough to make a betrayal unlikely. </p><p>Moreover, the biggest leverage she had over me was her ability to help me diagnose what the hell happened in the depths of Junia estate. </p><p>Assuming she wouldn’t discover my newest ability — or affliction, depending on the perspective — was not exactly reasonable. </p><p>I listened carefully as she cast her diagnostic spells, ready to stop her if I noticed anyone that wanted to visit the secret hold. </p><p>Only after a chain of spells that lasted five minutes, she calmed down sufficiently to listen to my explanation about our current situation. </p><p>Though an annoyed expression stayed stuck on her beautiful face. </p><p>Not undeserved, I had to admit. </p><p>I gave her a quick breakdown of the status, including the possible allegiance and status of the ship we found ourselves stowed in, the direction we were moving toward, and the other challenges.</p><p>Though I avoided mentioning Theodora’s name or her true identity. It was irrelevant to the situation, and it was not a simple secret to be brandished in any case. </p><p>“What would happen if they come down?” she asked in panic after managing to process my explanation. “Wouldn’t we just got captured?” </p><p>“Remember what we did back at the estate,” I said, then smirked. “Or our little adventure at Rome. A sorcerer and a bunch of mages are not exactly a threat to us.” </p><p>She sighed relaxedly. “Then, we’re safe.” </p><p>“Not entirely,” I answered, responding with a sigh of my own, still shocked by her lack of strategic understanding as far as the combat was concerned. Maybe it was a cultural distinction, but there was no high-ranking Roman, whether a mage, noble, or politician, that didn’t have a rudimentary grasp of martial matters. </p><p>Seeing a sorceress actually unaware of those details to such an impressive degree was certainly shocking. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked. </p><p>“The ship,” I reminded her. “It’s a well-made ship, I admit, but no ship could survive a deathmatch of two sorcerers, at least none I had seen,” I answered. Though, as I explained, I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her closer. </p><p>Distracted by the situation, and the nature of the cramped place we found ourselves in, it took a while for her to realize the excessive nature of our closeness. </p><p>Or the way she was dressed, if a large fabric that they used to keep arrows bundled counted as clothing. Lost in the more important matters, it took a while for her to realize the changes in her clothing.  </p><p>“L-let me go,” she stammered as she pushed. Her sudden movement had an excellent impact on the fabric wrapped around her, slipping it down enough to reveal her beautiful breasts. She fixed hurriedly after creating some distance — which was measured in inches considering the small side of our hiding spot. </p><p>“As you wish,” I chuckled as I watched her desperate attempt to put some distance. </p><p>“W-what happened to my clothes,” she said, and I gestured to the small pile behind me, still wet. </p><p>“I had to change them to prevent you from freezing,” I answered with a smirk.</p><p>“Y-you could have just used a spell to dry me,” she stammered, forgetting my current state of casting ability in her shocked state. </p><p>If I had slightly more control, I would have cast a spell to dry them, which would have burned them completely. </p><p>Pity  I was afraid of sinking the ship as well. And, despite the amusement potential, it was a touch excessive as a prank. </p><p>“R-right,” she stammered as she looked at my raised eyebrow, realizing the absurdity of her request. “P-pass them to me, p-please,” she added, and I passed them to her. </p><p>“I need to change,” she said after casting a spell to dry it, which, unlike me, she could risk without wholesale destruction. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I said with a smirk, and added another thing just as she was about to finish her statement. “Oh, you don’t expect me to leave, right? What if I get discovered,” I said, which was, amusingly, a justified rebuttal. </p><p>Her blush was beautiful. </p><p>I might have just found a way to entertain myself while waiting for an opportunity… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Umi said nothing for a moment despite Brenda’s slow, casual approach, though it was hard to be sure whether it was the shock of Brenda’s surprise appearance, or the intensity of the pleasure that my steady assault was given to her. </p><p>Of course, as with everything in life, a combination of it was the correct answer, but the musings of it were enough to distract me enough until Brenda managed to arrive in front of us, leaning against the lounge. </p><p>Which, like everything she had been doing for the last hour, calculated to perfection. The move was just enough to dislodge the only piece of fabric that was on her body, giving a desperate battle to keep her beautiful body hidden. </p><p>The reaction that awakened Umi was beautiful. “Whore,” she managed to gasp, without stammering, even despite the moans occupying both ends of her lone word. </p><p>Brenda only chuckled at the insult, not that I blamed her. Coming from someone that was bent over the deck of a ship while her fiancee was downstairs, the insult didn’t have a particular sting. </p><p>I said nothing, curious just how the fight would develop — but I didn’t stop my steady assault either, which gave a considerable disadvantage to the side of Umi. </p><p>“Oh, honey, why are you using such dirty words,” Brenda said as she sat next to us, the amused smirk on her face showing just how amused she was at the attempt. </p><p>“W-why?” Umi asked. “After you seduced my fiancee—“ Umi started shouting loudly, only for her words to die halfway as the realization hit, and hit hard. </p><p>Brenda chuckled at her reaction, especially when Umi used both of her hands to keep her voice down, her eyes wide in panic as she seemingly just realized the implication of her cries. She looked back, begging me wordlessly to stop, but I just smirked. </p><p>“Don’t worry, sweetie, Charlie is already collapsed, and he doesn’t seem ready to wake up anytime soon,” Brenda said, removing her worries, but not without a deliberate delay of several seconds, giving her a boost of worry first. </p><p>“Really,” Umi murmured, unable to contain her sudden relaxation. </p><p>“Yes, but I don’t know why you care. He’s just another limp two-pump champ,” Brenda countered, continuing the illusion that she had gone all the way. </p><p>“Well… He’s my fiancee,” Umi murmured before another moan interrupted her, which might or might not be helped by the continuous spanks she had been receiving from me, each creating another burst of pleasure. </p><p>“Right. And you seem to be really concerned about maintaining its sanctity,” Brenda countered. </p><p>“That’s not the point!” Umi answered rapidly, realizing that her position was not exactly conducive to suck questioning. </p><p>To my pleasure, however, rather than trying to make me stop — well, pause more likely, as I wouldn’t stop permanently after things reached such a point — she had allowed me to continue, realizing that, she didn’t exactly have a hand strong enough to discuss Brenda’s shameful activity. </p><p>There was not much to be done after she let things get this far. </p><p>I caught Brenda’s amused gaze, meeting it with a smug grin, and a simple, arrogant wink.</p><p>It was not the first time we had conducted a little mission of seduction together. And, as a target, Umi was both easier to seduce — as she lacked the willpower to resist — and presented much less risk — as she didn’t hold authority over our careers. </p><p>Still, considering both stages of the operation happened simultaneously — the first section the night out together, the second part after breakfast — it was not a bad achievement. </p><p>Especially as it led to the discovery of a hidden treasure like Umi, whose boring fashion sense and hesitant attitude had been hiding the great treasure underneath, the purity of her moans competing with the hypnotizing sway of her beautiful tits. </p><p>Brenda looked down at Umi, trying to catch her gaze, but Umi steadfastly avoided that, deciding not to interact with her. Pity, it was not the correct decision, as while she had a wide submissive streak, our conquest of Natalie had given her a taste of the other side — especially if that was delivered by my assistance. </p><p>“It’s rude to ignore a guest,” Brenda chuckled as she changed her position, leaning slightly to catch Umi’s gaze. Umi tried to avoid her once again, but considering she was pinned to the lounge seat in a doggy-style position, she didn’t have many options to do so. </p><p>She chose the simplest one, and closed her eyes. </p><p>My presence wasn’t exactly necessary to teach her the depths of that strategic mistake. After a soft chuckle, Brenda reacted immediately and grabbed her tits, squeezing hard enough to earn another beautiful cry while forcibly occupying Umi’s attention. </p><p>“They are great, aren’t they?” I asked Brenda, amused by the speed she started turning our little encounter into a threesome. </p><p>“Well, they are okay … for her,” Brenda answered as her fingers clamped around Umi’s nipples, squeezing hard while she pushed her own chest, fishing for a compliment. </p><p>“Don’t worry, yours are certainly not lacking,” I answered, which wasn’t the answer Brenda was hoping to hear if the beautiful frustration on her face was any indicator. </p><p>But, she knew my habits enough that that would be the most I would give as a compliment. </p><p>Well, unless she worked hard for it. </p><p>Her smile showed that she was very much aware of that fact, so she turned her attention to Umi. “Let’s ask her, then?” Brenda said with a chuckle as she grabbed Umi’s head and pulled her into her cleavage. </p><p>“What a lovely view,” I said. </p><p>“Thanks,” Brenda said while Umi’s argument died quickly under the suppression of her amazing breasts. Though, even as Brenda pulled back, Umi failed to say anything, the quickening of my hips enough to steal her words. </p><p>As much as I wanted to extend the joy, I decided to quicken, for multiple reasons. One, we had already spent a lot of time, and the conference was about to begin. And while I wasn’t going to make any presentation — which was always a thankless task — I wanted to be there to make sure to get the pulse of the company. </p><p>I loved the business events, because, the holiday location, combined with the unlimited booze worked wonders to make people forget that they were still in a business environment, their loose tongues spilling all kinds of feelings that were best left hidden. It was an excellent opportunity to get the pulse of the company. </p><p>But, more importantly, Umi was about to be overwhelmed with pleasure already, and while I ultimately wanted to spend much more time with her, I wanted her to recover from her near-catatonic state, and gain back some of her shyness.</p><p>It would make our next time much better.  </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean the beautiful levels of submission she managed to attain as I took her from behind were not fun. I grabbed her hair to change her position, pushing her down to a lounge chair with her knees against the wooden deck, pinned in place before I inserted from behind once more.</p><p>With that, Umi lost the last embers of control, her voice exploding loudly enough to make me worry whether she would actually wake up her fiancee. Well, the worry was a strong term, curiosity was the better definition. </p><p>But as Umi’s voice reached a point that could be classified as a howl, I turned my attention fully to her. The way she tightened around me was simply too spectacular to pay attention to other concerns. </p><p>I moved relentlessly, curious whether she would be able to resist the pleasure until my climax. “Do you think she can last that long?” Brenda asked soon, showing that she was equally curious. </p><p>Though, as she asked that, her legs parted and her back arched. With the light hitting from the side at a perfect angle, I didn’t even wonder whether the beautiful pose she was holding was accidental or intentional. </p><p>I knew her well enough to know that it was fully intentional — not that it did anything to reduce the beautiful allure. </p><p>Her naked body, combined with Umi’s cries, proved to be decisive enough to give me defeat, making me explode before Umi could collapse from pleasure. </p><p>Umi collapsed, moaning as my seed invaded her, barely conscious. “Since you saw fit to help her, why don’t you clean her up,” I said as I pulled out, though only after my shaft stopped twitching. </p><p>Umi was too busy dealing with her climax to realize the implications — as I doubted she was on the pill — while Brenda frowned playfully. </p><p>“Be a doll, and help your future playmate,” I said as I caressed her cheek and started walking toward the control room. </p><p>“Jerk,” Brenda frowned, but that didn’t prevent her from following my order, and taking her position between Umi’s legs, licking obediently, but not neglecting to angle her body perfectly in the process. </p><p>Being the boss was certainly fun, I decided as I steered the ship back to the shore…</p>",

    "content": "<p>The sudden absence of the System was the single most unsettling thing I had felt in my life. </p><p>I had long tried to prepare myself for the possibility, since the day I realized the System wasn’t exactly a benevolent force, but a tool. Not to mention, as I deepened my understanding of Soul Spaces, I could easily give others levels, or take them away. </p><p>It wasn’t unexpected for the Eternals to have a similar method. </p><p>Still, I was glad that it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. Thanks to the Divine Spark I had absorbed, I didn’t find myself in that accursed state of idiocy, maintaining a little power — but even the lack of numerical measurement of my strength was unsettling. </p><p>My best guess was, currently, I could barely rival the state I was at level ten with my relatively overpowered stats, or a more ordinary fifteen level. </p><p>But, there was one great difference. I had no HP, which meant no convenient energy automatically healing my wounds, or mana I could simply use to cast the spell. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the spells I had cast earlier survived, I wouldn’t even have the shield against necrotic energy, and would die to my own spell. </p><p>Or worse, get discovered by him immediately. </p><p>I first turn inward, getting a glimpse of my own soul space, hoping that it would allow me to find a block, but I failed. Everything was perfectly normal and stable, including the connection. However, there was no flow from the connections. They were dry like a river during a drought. </p><p>It took only a second. With the two seconds, I wasted trying to process the shock, I still had twenty-two seconds for my trap to activate completely.</p><p>Unless it was discovered,  of course. </p><p>I first decided to look around, trying to get a better understanding of the trick, as I didn’t have the ability to do anything at the moment in any case.  </p><p>The rest of the situation was different than I expected. Some parts, like the instant death of the warriors, were not surprising. With the system gone, and without Divine Spark to empower them, they didn’t even last a second with the necrotic energy filling the space. </p><p>Some aspects, however, were different than I expected. The ward I had created to radiate necrotic energy was destroyed, and while the elemental still moved toward the ward, it did so with a much slower speed, showing signs of dispersion. </p><p>I realized the reason when I noticed the weapons of the soldiers collapsing into a pile of rust, losing their integrity as the mana embedded went wild. </p><p>It wasn’t hard to notice their commonality. Each of those was empowered by the gems, which stopped as soon as the system was gone. </p><p>Looking back, it wasn’t particularly shocking, whether in terms of infinite mana generation. </p><p>Or the name… </p><p>I just didn’t have time to examine them in my busy schedule, always chasing something else.</p><p>I noticed the corrupted angel starting to fly even as he shouted. “Your fate would be legendary,” he declared, his voice still radiating the same type of energy, but lacking the earlier intensity. </p><p>I tensed as I watched him teleport, ready to burst into action, even though the speed he was teleporting gave me hope. Rather than disappearing in an instant, it took him five seconds to step into the Aether. </p><p>Showing that, unlike my dear headmistress, he actually had access to the System, and was empowered by it considerably. A good thing to learn, but not entirely amazing, as even if he was just as strong as her, it would mean he could easily rival my overpowered state of level thirty. </p><p>Not something I even hope to delay. </p><p>If I had access to my mana, I could try to pull a trick with his Divine Spark, which was clearly not fully absorbed yet, but to do that instantly required a lot of mana. </p><p>Mana that I lacked, and while I had some tricks that I could use, none of it was instant without my own mana as a primer. </p><p>Or the assistance of my skills to multiply my capabilities significantly. </p><p>I just hoped that whatever he wanted to learn was more important than his immediate need for revenge, at least enough to delay him for a quarter of a minute, enough for my last desperate trick to work. </p><p>I had no hope of survival if that trick failed as well. </p><p>I waited anxiously for him to appear. If he appeared next to my ward rather than me, I was dead. If he appeared next to me, I had a slight chance of survival. </p><p>Yet, when he appeared, I met with an unexpected challenge. </p><p>Holding back my laughter. </p><p>He burst into existence, with an aura of destruction that was crackling on the surface of his wings. His appearance was the single scariest thing I had seen in my life, especially in my powerless state, but the location of his appearance was enough to turn that into a ridiculous excess. </p><p>He didn’t appear next to me, nor did he appear next to my ward. He didn’t even appear next to the air elemental, which was halfway into dispersing. </p><p>No, he appeared next to the bones I had conjured in a desperate gambit, radiating necrotic energy as they lay on the floor, motionless since I didn’t even bother adding a movement charm, broken after falling down from the back of the elemental as it halfway dispersed. </p><p>What a ridiculous thing to save my life, I thought mockingly even as he opened his mouth. “You have no idea just how many plans you have ruined, you worthless bag of bones,” he growled as he raised his hand, his anger radiating from the energy he gathered.</p><p>And his unique brand of fiery energy prepared to destroy the bones, I was glad that I wasn’t trying to buy my life with my secrets, certainly not after angering him that much. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised by such an impulsive decision, as I had long realized Divine Spark was inherently linked to mood and mental state. And, his own brand of crimson energy certainly contained a lot of anger and other dark emotions. </p><p>Still, it didn’t make the sudden explosion of dust that filled the area any less chilling. Just one little mistake, and I was dead. </p><p>Not that I was still saved, of course. There were still ten seconds for my trap to activate, which was more than enough for him to discover and kill me. </p><p>Luckily, rather than searching, he stood still, his wings parted. His wings slowly lost their color, turning into a pristine white — but even at a distance, I could see that it was the effect of some kind of disguise spell similar to Mariel using Darkness Spark rather than a genuine transformation. </p><p>Whatever his position was, he was clearly trying to keep that red energy hidden from the rest of the Eternals. </p><p>Still, it didn’t make his transformation from a monstrous corrupt being to a glowing holy angel, radiating trust and kindness, any less shocking. </p><p>Yet, lost in his transformation, he noticed the flare of my ward too late, and an elemental arrow, a dangerous mixture of all four, exploded from my ward, toward the sky, and slammed against the ward. </p><p>Mixing elements was a recipe for chaos. It only worked because of the Tantric spark I mixed, keeping the incredible mixture stable for a moment, the explosion mixing into a ward, corrupting its structure. </p><p>Turning it into the greatest spectacle. </p><p>“No!” he shouted, but I didn’t have time to enjoy his fear and shock, because I noticed the impact was worse than I had planned. All along the border that was initially covered by the ward, the space was rending in a familiar manner. </p><p>I either miscalculated the impact of Tantric on the outer bounds of the system, or it somehow interacted with whatever he had done with the Aether. Or maybe, whatever that goblet had impacted the border already, and my spell only compounded the effect. </p><p>Either way, I had another beautiful problem to face, and do so without the System, as the connection was still cut. </p><p>Busy with my own thoughts, I didn’t even have time to enjoy the sudden horrible position my enemy had found himself in as he got slammed in the back by a true air elemental as he tried to escape. </p><p>To complete the irony, the true elemental was possessing the half-dispersed remains of my elemental mount. </p><p>Yet, I had other problems, like rapidly collapsing space as the elementals started fighting against each other. But before I could do anything, I found myself floating in an indescribable emptiness, even more, chaotic than the Aether Dimension. </p><p>I could still see the border of the material plane, marking the influence area of the System, recovering rapidly despite the elemental invasion. </p><p>There was only one problem. </p><p>I was outside of the dimensional barrier.</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The telltale signs of teleportation were enough to make me glad that I still had one of the nodes filled with enough mana, and even more glad that I was already set up my ward modularly, and all I needed was to flare my magic, and half of the eternal gems joined the ward, while the rest stayed with me. </p><p>I still needed them to breach the main ward that was imprisoning me. </p><p>Even before he appeared in front of me, I triggered the explosion of necrotic energy, afraid of waiting for him. The necrotic energy filled my immediate surroundings, but unlike the previous time, it wasn’t an explosion, but a tornado, one that would stay until it was dispersed. </p><p>The warriors were too quick to stay in there for long, retreating back, but I didn’t care about them. At this point, I only cared about the mysterious enemy. </p><p>Then, before waiting for him to appear, I started gathering my mana once more, ready to breach the ward as I teleported. </p><p>[-1271 Mana]</p><p>Just as the air in front of me breached, and a suffocating presence stepped forward, I triggered my teleportation. Still, the delay was enough that I caught him stepping back into the material plane. The first thing I noticed was wings. </p><p>Angel wings. </p><p>Yet, they were not the same as Mariel. The greatest difference was not the color, but it was a good sign of the difference. They were a dark red, like dried, dirty blood, and the feathers felt dirty and sharp rather than soft and pure. </p><p>But the real difference was the feeling. Rather than radiating light, they were radiating that same suffocating energy that reminded me of killing and slaughter, awakening a fear from the bottom of my whole being. </p><p>Then, I get a glimpse of his face, which was a weird mixture of monstrous and pitiful, like his skin had melted rather than burning, which got only scarier with the intense fury that covered his face. </p><p>Maybe angering him to understand his true objective was not as clever as I first thought. </p><p>But, with my teleportation already half-complete, my surroundings turned Aether, the thin shield of mana enough to protect me. </p><p>Yet, that was not enough, as the ward surrounding me extended into Aether, preventing a quick escape. I prepared to breach through the ward with my full strength, hoping that he wouldn’t be able to come back with a few seconds' delay. </p><p>That hope proved vain, as I felt a sudden flare in Aether, the already chaotic structure turning even crazier as his presence appeared near me. </p><p>The distance was not a simple thing in the Aether dimension, but with our surroundings restricted by the ward, it was less confusing than my other attempts, not that it worked to my benefit. Yet, it wasn’t just Aether who started to get wild, they started to get that chaotic red nature, surging toward me. </p><p>I was too familiar with the concept to fail to identify the impact of a Divine Spark — one of unknown nature, but with the feelings it awakened, I guessed it was certainly not the Spark of Sunshine and Happiness. </p><p>I threw myself back to the material plane before that energy completely suffocated the area, feeling the chill of death. </p><p>Yet, I was still glad that I didn’t try to escape when the ambush first started, as it would have been completely impossible if I had been surprised by his abilities. </p><p>Even now, I had an uphill battle, but it was always better to target an angry enemy. </p><p>I noticed I appeared quite a bit distant away from the warriors, but I was also away from the border of the ward, which was bad. If I was closer, I might have tried to breach it. </p><p>I immediately pulled Eternal gems, using seven of them to instantly create another faux elemental, dumping a great amount of my mana as well. </p><p>[-4122 Mana]</p><p>Mobility was important, especially since I feared teleportation was not an option anymore. Whatever he was doing with Aether didn’t feel easy to shrug. </p><p>The rest of the stones turned into another pattern, ready to provide mana for the deadliest strike I could manage, but he didn’t appear. </p><p>But the oppressive feeling got stronger. And since he already proved that he was much more capable in teleportation, I feared he was strengthening his hold on the ward. </p><p>“I can’t afford to give time,” I murmured. The worst thing I could do was to give him time to set up the situation further, destroying the advantage I managed to collect thanks to his arrogance. </p><p>I couldn’t afford a fair fight. </p><p>I instantly created the scariest ward-breaker I could create in less than a second, and threw it toward the ward. I used the term scariest rather than strongest, because of the magical presence it created, Arcana mixing with necrotic, extremely overbearing. </p><p>At the same time, I created another ward, buried underground, this time using an even more special ingredient. </p><p>Tantric Divine Spark.</p><p>[-1921 Mana]</p><p>Too bad it was completely useless. If it hit the ward, it would crack and splash, roughly as useful as an egg thrown to a wall. </p><p>I was betting that, from another dimension, it was hard to distinguish a bluff and the real thing. </p><p>That proved correct, as he appeared in another fiery burst, casting a huge shield between the fake ward-breaker and his ward. And, his anger, even more intense, proved my assumption correct. He was anxious to keep the ward intact, even more than he was interested in keeping the weapons intact. </p><p>And, since the abilities he displayed were enough to show that he wouldn’t be caring about their true potential, I started to get another feeling. </p><p>He borrowed those items, and he didn’t want to explain their loss. Just like the trap for Janelor, whatever he was doing, he was trying to keep it hidden from the rest. </p><p>Good, II thought. Since I managed to anger him, I needed to find a better way to keep Silver Spires safe. And, the more problems he had, the less time he would have to poke around for me or my secrets. </p><p>I had already prepared the true surprise in form of the buried ward, working with the full principles of Tantric, but since I used only a minuscule amount of Tantric Spark, afraid of getting noticed, required almost half a minute for it to work. </p><p>Not a great time, but almost a lifetime under the circumstances. </p><p>Luckily, I knew exactly how to distract him, even at the risk of giving a clue of my true secret. Using my conjured air elemental, I rushed toward the warriors, almost as fast as one of his light spears, his furious cry making me smile despite the intense circumstances. </p><p>Yet, even then, I knew that I wasn’t fast enough to avoid his attention, and used forty eternal gems I had to create a ward, triggering continuous radiation of necrotic energy. </p><p>An eternal gem was a dangerous treasure, enough to elevate a noble house. A few of them were enough to get the notice of the whole country.</p><p>Forty of them, all tied in a necrotic array that reflected my full abilities, was a local apocalypse. The area under the ward was huge, measured in miles and miles, but it filled with necrotic energy in an instant. If that ward stayed active for a few days, it might destroy the whole empire. </p><p>Yet, even for a moment, I didn’t expect it to hurt him. It was just a bonfire, one that, with every second it stayed active, could gain the notice of the other eternal, one that would force him to teleport there to extinguish it. </p><p>And as an added benefit, that much necrotic energy was a perfect way to hide my spells. </p><p>Twenty-three arrows of Tantric energy, each covered with necrotic energy, camouflaged in the wave, hitting the warriors before they could react, triggering their berserk state. </p><p>All the while, I continued to rush toward the other side of the border. </p><p>Or more accurately, my mount continued to travel, with a simulacrum on top. Normally, creating a copy was hard, but since faked being an undead, I just needed to create a bunch of bones radiating with necrotic energy. </p><p>I threw myself to the ground, another, much subtler ward to hide. </p><p>All of those tricks barely took five seconds, expanding most of my mana, and almost all of my trump cards. </p><p>Yet, he had a dangerous necrotic ward to block the apocalypse, a fake lich riding an empowered elemental toward the wall, and twenty-three berserk warriors to deal with. </p><p>I was confident that it would be enough to delay him, especially since I just needed to delay him for just twenty-five seconds. </p><p>Yet, it turned out, I was wrong. </p><p>He raised the goblet, which evaporated, turning into a weird mist that exploded, filling the area under the ward. </p><p>And, just like that, the System stopped.</p><p>—</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching their amusing competition, it was hard to deny the temptation of loosening their chain and letting them continue, to see just how far they would push,, but I changed my mind after some consideration. </p><p>It was fun to watch them, but who knew what kind of bad habits they would develop if I let them go ahead with such a ridiculous habit. That was enough to swing my determination back to punish them. </p><p>I continued my walk, but my continued approach didn’t get their attention. I coughed pointedly even as I stood next to them, yet they continued to maintain their gaze, ignoring me. I chuckled even as I grabbed their hair, pulling to break their eye contact. “You know that you two are hurting my fragile male ego, ignoring me like that. How shameful.” </p><p>“Sorry,” Cinder stumbled immediately, blushing. </p><p>“Sorry, master,” Isolde said at the same time, her lips twitching in a victorious smile as she scored one over Cinder, declaring her emotions stronger than the bound phoenix.  </p><p>“Sorry, great master,“ Cinder tried to correct her reference, but only received a mocking smile from Isolde, amused by her delayed attempts to copy her. </p><p>“Amazing save,” I said, once again suppressing the temptation to let things continue and see how far those two would push each other as I forced their attention on me. It was an amusingly childish display considering their position in life, one that was interesting to see as the situation slowly evolved.  </p><p>I interrupted it. I raised my hand and cast a spell to direct their chains, tightening their hold to enhance the sense of discomfort. Raising my hand was completely unnecessary under the circumstances, of course, but it was more important to give the appropriate message.</p><p>“Now, let’s see which one of you will fold first,” I added as I walked around them, like a tiger that was circling a pair of appetizing yet trapped antelopes, deciding which to partake.</p><p>Well, partake first. </p><p>Of course, the metaphor not worked perfectly, as the antelopes in this case were competing to be eaten first rather than trying to escape. The increase in discomfort from the chains only increased their anticipation, their earlier competition already pushing them conveniently close to the edge. </p><p>I put my hand on Cinder’s bosom, enjoying the sensation of her flawless skin, a level that was only possible due to her supernatural heritage. I wondered just how many unlucky men had lusted after her, only to fail — a list that included our unlucky blonde friend — as I managed to steal a turn. </p><p>The harder I squeezed, the more satisfied Cinder looked, which made that a punishment. </p><p>Or more accurately, it would have made ineffective if it wasn’t for the beautiful jealousy of Isolde, making it more of her punishment. </p><p>The usefulness of their ridiculous competition was hard to overstate. </p><p>Caressing Cinder was fun, but I didn’t maintain my touch on her skin for long. After all, it was not just a punishment for her, but for them. I let my hand drift over Isolde’s breast, and grabbed her nipple. </p><p>“Tell me how the transformation felt,” I ordered to Cinder even as my touch pulled away, leaving her dangerously close to the edge.</p><p>“R-right now?” she asked. </p><p>“No, tomorrow,” Isolde interrupted immediately, her disobedient interruption earning a spank — though considering her enjoyment, not exactly a punishment.</p><p>“Yes, right now,” I said, deliberately letting Isolde’s interruption slide, as it made Cinder more annoyed than anything I could achieve in a few seconds. </p><p>“O-of course,” she stammered, trying to contain her frustration at Isolde’s daring at her reaction to me simultaneously. The poor girl clearly never had to deal with such complicated feelings at the same time. </p><p>As I put my hand on Isolde’s body, dancing freely to push her closer toward the climax, Cinder started talking. “It felt powerful and … liberating,” she muttered. “Like everything was supposed to feel. I just need to think, and the living fire obeying my requests immediately.” </p><p>I quirked my eyebrow. “Really, is obeying the right word?” I asked, remembering the sensation.</p><p>That looked tough for her to answer. “Yes—“ she started reflexively before she cut herself, a thoughtful expression on her face. “I’m not sure,” she murmured. </p><p>I chuckled at her confusion, which was not helped by Isolde’s excessively loud moans. They were not entirely fake, as, under the steady treatment of my fingers, her steady travel toward a climax continued steadily, but Isolde’s usual response certainly lacked that erotic undertone. She was pushing it just to annoy Cinder more. </p><p>“Maybe you should have a better understanding of what obedience is,” I said, which put a frown on Cinder’s face, and the opposite expression on Isolde's. “For example, what this little disobedient girl is showing here is certainly not obedience.” </p><p>That put a thoughtful spin on Cinder’s feelings as she paused, while Isolde widened her gaze. “Wait —“ she said as she widened her gaze, but that was all she was able to say as my fingers moved down and slipped inside her wetness, pushing her toward the climax. </p><p>With her body pushing toward the climax, Isolde didn’t bother arguing with my comment, more than happy with the direction things were going. Yet, despite her apparent happiness, Cinder had a mocking smirk on her face. Because, unlike Isolde,  she was magically sensitive enough to catch the spell I had cast on her. </p><p>One that Isolde only realized when her pleasure built up enough to trigger a climax…</p><p>Only to continue building.</p><p>“N-no,” she managed to stammer in shock before I cast a silencing spell on her, silencing. Normally, I would have prevented silencing her physically, but considering her distaste, the silencing spell would push the distaste even deeper. </p><p>Her distaste was Cinder’s happiness. </p><p>“Think of it as an example. What this little servant was displaying was not obedience but rebellion, no matter how much she tried to cloak it as obedience. Now, why don’t you try and give me a better definition.” </p><p>Cinder looked at Isolde for a moment, clearly wanting to gloat about her temporary victory, but her arrogance was not enough to ignore how Isolde ended up, silently begging for a climax under my fingers.</p><p>While also providing an excellent example that resistance to pain was based on different attributes than resistance to pleasure. Isolde was strong enough to resist torture for days…</p><p>But under pleasure, it took minutes for her to collapse.</p><p>“I think … the best way to call the attitude of living fire is … indulgence,” Cinder finally mumbled an answer, her pauses showing that she wasn’t entirely confident in her conclusion. </p><p>“Tell me more,” I said even as I twisted Isolde’s nipple, pressing against her back to enjoy her trembles, stretching our little teasing game even more. </p><p>“Ordinarily, living fire is hard to control, willful, and requires respect…”  she murmured. “But after the transformation, it’s different. I just need to think for a second, and the fire is jumping to follow my request with great urgency, without even waiting for a second. Almost like a …” she said, though her explanation faded halfway.</p><p>Almost like a doting relative, I completed it in my mind, but didn’t vocalize it. It was a complicated topic, one that was best not examined while … drilling into other subjects. </p><p>“Interesting, a topic to be examined another time,” I murmured. “I prefer to focus on punishing my obedient servant first,” I said, shifting my focus on Isolde. </p><p>Cinder reacted as I expected. First with entertained satisfaction, but as my treatment stayed focused on Isolde’s naked body, jealousy started to rear its head again. After all, she was still chained, naked, and on the edge, and watching her ‘enemy’ tortured by pleasure was hardly the most helpful view to suppress her arousal. </p><p>“Do you want to help me teach her a lesson?” I offered to help her. </p><p>“Yes, I would,” she answered immediately, which added to Isolde’s despair. Cinder looked at her chains happily as she felt them weaken their hold. </p><p>But her enthusiasm died as quickly as she realized she misunderstood the slackening of the chains. Rather than letting her go free, it pushed her down to her knees, her arms pulled to her back. </p><p>Right in front of Isolde’s wetness.</p><p>She raised her head, shock dancing in her amber eyes as she caught her gaze. Although, the fact that it was the shock and not fury showed just how far we had come in such a little time. “Oh, didn’t you want to punish her?” I asked in amusement. “With her current state, that’s the most excellent way to do so. Imagine the torture she would experience as you help me?”</p><p>“Still…” Cinder murmured as she avoided my gaze, clearly confused. My words were correct, as it was the most excellent way for her to take revenge on Isolde, and pay back for the grudge she had accumulated.</p><p>But to do so, she needed to take a supplicant role, one that was deeply humiliating. </p><p>I showed her a hint of mercy as I continued to work on Isolde. I twisted her nipple once more while considering just how much time I should give my little phoenix to come to a decision.</p>",

    "content": "<p>For a moment, I said nothing, examining the face I hadn’t seen for the last few days.</p><p>Our position was rather squished. MR machine was not exactly small, as it was designed to fit even overweight people in a comfortable manner, at least enough that they didn’t experience a breakdown during the thirty-minute period they needed to stay immobile. </p><p>It was not designed to fit two people, especially since I was not exactly small. My guide, in comparison, was relatively tiny, but her huge wings compensated for it, filling the MR machine even when furled.</p><p>Considering the nurses responsible for taking the measurements weren’t panicking, I confirmed she was still undetectable to others, but she still didn’t just pass through the machine like a ghost, making the machine cramped even as she floated inches above me. </p><p>Still, despite the confined space, relaxation filled me. </p><p>A part of that relaxation was physical — or magical — as a certain drain disappeared, showing that her recovery was not just relying on Intent, but something more — an interesting question, but one that I would handle later. </p><p>However, the bigger source of it was relaxation. While I hadn’t reached the limit of my Endurance, I was not looking to stand awake for days, hoping to avoid another attack from the killer shadows. Hopefully, she would have a solution. </p><p>Pity I was already in the MR machine, and was unable to speak for the moment. </p><p>My guide clearly didn’t share the same restriction. “What’s going on, where are we,” she said even as her gaze turned to me. </p><p>I was about to make an amused expression, but an important detail stopped me. </p><p>Her expression. </p><p>Since the day she had entered my life, she had a silly, almost childish expression on her face, one that disappeared on rare occasions — like the time I tried to get away from the ritual she had detected, or the time I had mentioned Zeus’  name. But even during those rare occasions, it was a fleeting move. </p><p>Yet, this time, it was not a temporary time. Her expression was sharp and tense, ready to lash out. </p><p>I moved my head, knowing that I would receive a warning. The speaker crackled before the technician’s voice was heard. “Please don’t move, or we have to start again. It’s important for your health,” they said.</p><p>“Is this true? Is this some kind of … healing device?” my guide said, and I nodded. </p><p>“So, the attack on the ritual still injured you even after I extinguished it,” she said, but this time, I blinked twice. “It didn’t,” she said, with a frown on her face. </p><p>I blinked once, confirming, and she fell silent, realizing that it was hardly the most appropriate location for interrogation. </p><p>It was good, because it allowed me to focus on her great change of attitude. Gone was the amused, cheerful woman, replaced by a sharp and attentive angel, one that was much more fitting to be named as a guide. </p><p>Clearly, her long sleep while she devoured most of my intent helped her to recover herself even more. Which was good, as it meant I could use all the Intent I collected freely. </p><p>I closed my eyes to check that — subtly, hoping not to alert her — but when I checked my mental space, I barely held back a curse. Now that she was awake, she was taking all the intent for herself with an even stronger intensity. </p><p>And her pull was not limited to the new intent. She was even pulling some from the System. </p><p>I barely held back a curse, and the only reason I was able to keep my curse back was that it was a mere trickle that was flowing from the System to her. </p><p>If it was before, I would have warned her about that, but facing a sharper personality, I was afraid of actually doing so. I was facing an unknown, and it was best not to play around. </p><p>However, soon I noticed the signs that her personality was not transformed, at least not completely. After half an hour, with nothing to do, there was a limit I could control my gaze, especially since she was still wearing the same leather ensemble, revealing an amazing cleavage for my gaze. </p><p>One that was literally perfect. </p><p>Yet, as she noticed my gaze slipping down, her first reaction was not aggression, but a deep blush that reminded me of her first reaction to the football party. </p><p>“Don’t look,” she said as she raised her hand, and her clothing transformed, the leather ensemble melting into a long, white gown that covered her skin, one that gave no hint of sexiness. A pity, I thought, an emotion that didn’t survive for long. </p><p>Because I watched as the gown she had summoned melted at the same speed, leaving her completely naked. “No,” she gasped in shock as she wrapped her wings around herself in a panic, hiding her beautiful breasts from me.</p><p>Too bad it was too late, as the slight delay she experienced was enough for me to commit them to my long-term memory. But since I was not a moron, I closed my eyes to allow her to try to fix whatever problem she had been dealing with. </p><p>I didn’t want to push too much before I got a better sense of her new personality. </p><p>I also left my eyes cracked, as I was still a sneaky opportunist. </p><p>It was good, as I had caught a few more interesting glimpses as she tried to summon several different outfits, only for every single one of them to melt away after a second, adding quite a bit of new memories of her barely-covered body as her wings moved. </p><p>I had to admit, watching a beautiful supernatural being failing to dress was an excellent way to kill time during a medical process where I should not move. Five minutes later, she surrendered to the inevitability, and let the same leather outfit appear. </p><p>Which didn’t melt away. </p><p>“Aphrodite,” she murmured in frustration, which gave interesting implications, but I wisely stayed away from prompting her about that point. “You can open your eyes now,” she said. “How long I had been recuperating?” she asked. </p><p>I blinked the appropriate number of days, which made her eyes widen. “That much, the absence of mana must have been impacting me more than I expected,” she murmured, confirming that, while her excessive silliness had disappeared, she was still not the smoothest of the operators. </p><p>“Did anything happen after the interrupted ceremony?” she asked, and I blinked once again, giving her the positive answer she searched for. “What happened?” she asked tensely, but I just shrugged, slightly enough not to receive another warning from the nursing staff, hoping that she would understand it was hard to describe without speaking. </p><p>She accepted that, and started waiting while I closed my eyes, focusing on the annoying crackling of the MR machine as I tried to make sense of her personality change.</p><p>The difference was easy to point out, but hard to truly measure. She was much more serious compared to her earlier flighty attitude. Cagier, certainly, but it was not an effective one, considering just how much information she managed to spill out. </p><p>Or the way she fell apart once she experienced her wardrobe malfunction in what appeared to be a divine prank from the Greek goddess of love — giving me a beautiful show in the process. </p><p>I decided to think of her change as sobering, her earlier cheer and lack of attention related to some kind of intoxication effect after her waking up. Probably related to the lack of magic in the modern world if her last murmur was any indicator. </p><p>A murmur that showed her personality was not too different even as she tried to act more measured, easily letting important information like that slip. </p><p>Of course, there was a chance that every single action she took was extremely measured, and she was a master manipulator, but I discounted that possibility.</p><p>Not because it was impossible, but because there would be nothing I could do if that was the case. </p><p>My life was difficult enough without going down a spiral of paranoia.  </p><p>I continued to lay, ignoring the presence of the incorporeal angel floating above me, treating the moment as a rare occasion to rest. </p><p>After all, with my guide back, I had a feeling more exciting times awaited me.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“You uncultured swine, I’ll get you kicked this time,” Coach Spencer growled as he walked toward me. </p><p>His explosive anger didn’t calm down the defensive players, but a gesture from me was enough to keep them in place, an obedience that would have been impossible to imagine just a week ago. </p><p>But I turned my attention to Coach Spencer, removed my helmet, and closed in. “How can I help you, coach?” I asked, loud enough to be heard by anyone. Though, I didn’t need to Taunt to underline my ‘helpful’ question with a great dose of sarcasm. </p><p>He raised his hand and started poking my chest aggressively. “I will kill you, boy, do you know what you did?” he asked. </p><p>His closeness was useful. “Oh, if I were to guess, I had just injured the professional player you have brought to ruin my career, leaving you with the responsibility to explain that to your fiancee’s family so that they can clean your ass, while wondering how you managed to fuck up even the easy job they had given to you,” I said, using Taunt to the limit. </p><p>The line about the professional players was a guess, but it was one I was confident of. They were older, and if they were college players, they would be good enough to be stars. </p><p>However, professional players, especially third-string backups were a different issue. Still, while third-string backups were replaceable from a certain perspective, it didn’t mean their getting injured in a college training exercise wouldn’t turn into a  scandal. </p><p>Especially since they didn’t reveal their identity. </p><p>If his color, turning into a lively purple, was any indicator, it worked excellently. “Y-you —“ he shouted before his gasps of anger silenced him efficiently, giving me a second to enjoy his mood. </p><p>Pity I didn’t have to luxury to enjoy it for long. I could already see some of the smarter offensive players dashing forward us, no doubt to calm the coach down as they realized the middle of a field was hardly the greatest location to handle such communication. </p><p>“Me,” I said, letting my smirk widen as I watched him walk toward me. I wanted to walk back, but it would ruin my plan. Instead, I smirked bigger. “Do you think I can get your fiancee to dump you if I go and seduce her? Maybe the dean will finally get rid of a useless coach like you,” I said, once again using Taunt. </p><p>I had no idea who was his fiancee, and technically, it was not a nice thing to say. But it was not something I would care about even ordinarily, and certainly not when I was dealing with some kind of magical shadow assassin.</p><p>To his credit, Coach Spencer managed to hold himself back despite trembling in anger, at least until I opened my mouth again. I made a gesture on my back toward the defensive team, asking them to stop even as I let my smirk widen. “I wonder if I can convince her to fuck me in the middle of the field to complete your humiliation.” </p><p>It was childish, but Coach Spencer was also an irresponsible man-child trying to live his family's glory through his family connections. </p><p>The full-body punch he threw at me didn’t come as a surprise. I flew back even as the punch connected while the spectators suddenly fell silent. </p><p>I let myself fly back rather than resist, of course. After all, why bother resisting after putting all that effort to make it a spectacle right to everyone. A coach punching one of his players in the middle of a field was a beautiful scandal. </p><p>I made a motion to stand up, only to stumble, faking a possible concussion. After all, what was better than a coach punching his player. </p><p>A coach injured one of his players seriously. </p><p>I sat on the floor, my eyes closed as I heard people rushing. A few offensive players arrived and grabbed the Coach, dragging him away, while the defensive players gathered around me. </p><p>Most importantly, a very intense flow of intent hit me, far too intense for it to be just about the spectators watching. Megan was doing her job perfectly, I realized. </p><p>After all, Sunset college was a football college, and regardless of the recent lack of success, it was the most important source of local pride for the surrounding towns; a fact that was only intensified after our most recent victory. </p><p>Naturally, the coach punching the player that was responsible for that victory, in the middle of an overblown challenge, had amazing tabloid quality. </p><p>Even more amazingly, neither college media staff, nor any public relations expert employed by Coach or his fiancee’s family would have time to react, as it came as a surprise, giving Megan several very precious minutes to manipulate the public perception. </p><p>I sat on the turf, my eyes closed as I faked a concussion, stumbling even as two players grabbed my arms and helped me to move. </p><p>I was more interested in the proof of Megan’s success. The great flow of intent I received, was even more intense than the reward I had achieved in the victory. “Are you okay?” Marcus asked, and I winked at him, which earned me a chuckle before he helped me to the stretcher, and the medical staff started examining me. </p><p>“Open your eyes,” the doctor started before asking for a battery of questions and tests. Luckily, concussions, especially minor ones, were extremely hard to diagnose accurately. </p><p>Meaning, faking one was simply trivial, resulting in their decision to put me in an ambulance and go to the hospital. I heard one of Coach Spencer’s bigger lackeys that how an ambulance might not look good for the college. </p><p>The doctor resisted it adamantly. I wasn’t under any impression that it was about his great respect for me, but concussions in the field were a big issue. If he didn’t take the appropriate response and then it was revealed to be the case, it would be his fault. </p><p>So, I was found in the ambulance, with two paramedics assisting me while I faked a slurry daze. Which was good, as it allowed me to focus on the flow of the intent, even more, channeling it to the system. </p><p>Interestingly, while it was intense, it triggered only one trait. </p><p>[Precision V, acquired]</p><p>At least at first, I realized. I didn’t do anything other than channeling some of the Intent to the system — my guide still taking the lion’s share — while faking concussion, no matter how tempting was to tease the female paramedic — who was a blonde, beautiful enough to be extremely desirable even in her boring outfit. </p><p>Especially since she was the one to undress me, quickly removing my pads and putting me into a hospital gown, careful not to jostle me too much in the process. </p><p>She was beautiful, but not as beautiful as ruining such a beautiful little ploy. I needed to be in the hospital so Megan could turn it into a proper scandal. </p><p>At this point, I either got rid of Coach Spencer, or I would just simply change schools. There was no middle ground. </p><p>We arrived at the hospital after twenty minutes of the ride, which had no interesting events, especially since I didn’t even have my phone with me. As we arrived at the hospital and they pushed my stretcher inside, I touched the system once more, though more of a habit than expecting anything to happen. </p><p>Which was why I was surprised by the sudden flood. </p><p>[Mechanic V, acquired]</p><p>[Repair V, acquired]</p><p>[Design V, acquired]</p><p>[Electronics V, acquired]</p><p>It surprised me a bit at first, as none of the events I had completed anything even slightly related to those, but finding the answer didn’t take long. </p><p>People found out about the car repair video I had uploaded. “Nice, I didn’t think it would help me like that,” I murmured, which I didn’t bother suppressing. After all, it was very normal for an unlucky guy suffering a concussion to talk to himself. </p><p>I said nothing else as the nurses took over to prepare me for the MR machine. If I had come as myself, I would have waited for hours, maybe even days, for my turn. But, if there was one thing about being a local celebrity, it was the priority service I would receive. </p><p>Yet, as they slid me inside the noisy machine, I expected another calm half an hour. </p><p>Which was ruined when I blinked, only to realize that, between two moves, I was not alone anymore. </p><p>My guide woke up. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was tense as the sailors burst downstairs, trying to compare the merits of trying to take them down compared to jumping back to sea through the same ballista attack opening I had used for this exact objective. </p><p>But that choice had become temporarily unnecessary as the few sailors that burst down only stopped enough to pick the sails that were hidden in the secret hold — the sails that were made of expensive magical materials and covered with runes, one that would increase the speed of the ship several times. </p><p>At the cost of shouting any ship that drifted close enough to notice its presence that its origin was extraordinary. </p><p>It seemed that they had lost their belief in staying concealed. Barely half a minute after they abandoned the secret hold, however, the aura of the ship changed completely. </p><p>Initially, despite its extraordinary nature, the ship looked like yet another ordinary trade ship, but as they changed the sails, I could feel that nature changing. </p><p>… slowly getting weaker. </p><p>“Impressive construction,” I thought in fascination as I felt a surreptitious field appear around the ship, doing wonders to erase the aura of the ship, while also maintaining a complicated illusion field around. </p><p>Enough to actually hide both the physical presence and magical signature of the ship. </p><p>Far better than anything I could even imagine designing, let alone actually creating, showing the power and the reach of a special squad of the Eastern Empire — I might be good when it came to wards, but ultimately, that was not my true expertise. </p><p>I could easily use a similar field around myself — well, I could have if my magic control hadn’t been once again ruined completely — but the same didn’t apply to doing so on a huge ship. Even with the huge power a sorcerer possessed, maintaining such a field around an actual battleship was difficult, and the speed it moved only made the achievement even more impossible. </p><p>Without the assistance of the wards, it would have easily drained a sorcerer in minutes. </p><p>Even with the wards supplying most of the magic and easing the management challenges, it was hardly something negligible.</p><p>It wasn’t as intense as actively managing a defensive ward — mostly due to the difference in magical intensity, which was similar to the difference between carrying twenty pounds and two hundred pounds — but carrying twenty pounds was not a simple affair if occasionally putting it down was not allowed for hours and hours. </p><p>And, stopping the ward was not an option, not even for a moment considering our proximity to Italy and the intensity of the fleet activity. Even if the new sails increased the speed of the ship several times, we still needed to travel a day to leave the area that was under the direct control of Rome, and entered the contested waters. </p><p>It would have been much easier to do so from the other Eastern side of Italy, as most of Greece was under Empire’s control, and while most of the Adriatic sea was under the control of the Republic, it was not an uncontested control. </p><p>However, the ship sailed from a port on the Western side of Italy, and the Tyrrenian Sea was intensely under Roman control, and that had been the case for centuries. Ionian sea — which was the lower parts of the Adriatic, an area that was much more intensely contested between the Republic and the Eastern Empire — was the only destination they could reach to avoid the fleet's attention. </p><p>To do so, they had three options. One was to go through the thin strait between Sicily and Italy, which was the most preferred route of any ship. But that was not a likely choice considering the traffic density. </p><p>And, considering the state of alarm, it was likely that the strait was fully blocked by the fleet, preventing any passage — even with the invisibility. </p><p>The second option, which was the safest, was to travel northwest and actually escape toward the Iberian Peninsula, expecting the fleet not expect them to pick that direction after destroying a ship of the Roman fleet. </p><p>After all, the Iberian Peninsula was also under Rome’s dominion, making it a weird location to hide. Yet, the ship certainly had such capabilities. There, they could find a hidden cove and wait until the blockade was removed.  </p><p>The third option was to cut down south aggressively, escaping from the west of Sicily before turning and dashing toward the Ionian sea, betting on their speed to move before a proper blockade could be established. </p><p>And, there, I found myself facing a dilemma. I preferred the third option, and for them, the second option was the superior one. </p><p>Well, more accurately, I expected them to be under that impression. In reality, picking the third option was their benefit as well. With the intensity of the chaos, and the significance of the items lost, the sea blockade would run for months, and even for such a superior ship, constantly avoiding the noose of the determined Republic fleet was impossible. </p><p>The Republic might not have the most excellent navy, but quantity had a quality of its own. </p><p>I stayed hidden, feeling slightly relaxed as their attention was focused on maintaining the direction of the ship, while I focused on trying to find a way to trick them into choosing the third direction. </p><p>Ultimately, I decided to slip back into the water and fake the presence of a magical beast at a distance, forcing them to change their direction. Yet, when I reached one of the hatches, a glance at the sky and the position of the sun confirmed that the ship was traveling south. </p><p>“Why?” I murmured with a frown, though my confusion didn’t prevent me from dashing back to my hiding spot. </p><p>No need to enhance an already complicated situation by pushing it even more. </p><p>Yet, even as I settled next to Xia, I was unsettled. Their decision actually worked to my benefit, but from any rational perspective, they were taking a huge risk, one that was supposed to be extremely unnecessary from their perspective. </p><p>My first instinct was that they just had terrible decision-making, but I ignored that soon enough. </p><p>It was a bad idea to assume incompetency, especially considering the level of extreme competence and discipline they had been doing in other aspects. </p><p>Which meant that they had a secret that they could </p><p>I wondered whether I should just climb and have a discussion about some alliance. My presence in their ship was hardly something they would welcome, but one would ally with a fox against a wolf. </p><p>Especially since they had destroyed any chance of cooperating with the wolf after destroying that ship. Without an option for them to sell me back to Republic was not an option for them, we could still have a discussion about an alliance of convenience. </p><p>No one in their right mind would turn the assistance of a sorcerer and a sorceress, I thought as I looked at the sleeping figure of Xia. </p><p>Especially if one of those sorcerers could destroy their ship in the blink of an eye.</p><p>While I was lost in that track, Xia shuffled in her place, her mouth getting open, maybe to let out a cry coming from her dreams. I immediately pressed my hand on her mouth, silencing her, my attention still on the best way to breach such a subject — or whether it was a smart decision in the first place. </p><p>Before doing so, I needed to fulfill two directions. </p><p>First, I needed to help Xia wake up from her coma — as her helplessness would give them excellent leverage over me, and negotiating from a position of weakness was never advisable. </p><p>The second — and the more important — aspect was to understand the mystery of their decision. There were options, like having precious cargo with them — unlikely, as any precious cargo, they would have hidden in the great hold they kept their secret arsenal. </p><p>The likelier option was that they somehow communicated with Rome and knew the true reach of the disaster. If that was the case, I needed to truly understand how they had communicated. </p><p>It was not impossible to use magic to communicate over great distances, but even under the best of conditions, it was not the healthiest strategy. It was prone to interceptions, and blockages, and it was a good way to reveal both sides of the communication. </p><p>Of course, there were many ways to hide and obfuscate most of the drawbacks, but that still meant that it was a risk. </p><p>One that no one in their right mind would take while Rome was going through such chaos, afraid of making them a target at both ends of their communication process. </p><p>Unless they had a secret method I was not privy to, of course. </p><p>Pity that the crew was working with ruthless efficiency without the slightest gossip, not giving me any clue which might be the case. </p><p>Of course, there might be many other reasons for such a decision, including just great strategic awareness of the captain, reading the mobilization level of the fleet much more accurately than I expected, and taking a decision. </p><p>Before I could ponder on that question more, Xia took a deep breath, which stole my attention. </p><p>The reason, as she breathed, a minuscule amount of mana was absorbed by her, making her stir… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Irene trembled as she looked at Ida, pressing her lips together to contain the spectacular moan that was brewing in her heart. It wasn’t very successful as the sudden invasion finally pushed her over the edge, suggesting it was her climax that was responsible for her trembling and not the shock of what had just happened. </p><p>I had moved my empty hand back to her stomach, pressing hard to help her stay upright despite her trembling legs, doing my best not to explode at the sudden hot presence around my shaft.  </p><p>“Smile,” Ida ordered, but she was lucky that Irene was too distracted to pay attention to the deep satisfaction on her face. </p><p>Luckily, despite the surprise intervention of her friend, Irene didn’t react badly to the surprise loss of her virginity — though her earlier actions suggested she was more than willing to take that step, just not when one of her best friends stood a couple feet away from her, taking a truly impressive number of photos. </p><p>“I don’t care if you’re having another cramp. Smile,” Ida repeated as she looked at Irene, who was too busy trying to contain her growing moans. </p><p>“Yeah, cramps,” Irene gasped, her voice marred with a depth of pleasure that was certainly not a part of any kind of cramp, but she chose to believe that her little trickery was still functioning rather than believing the alternative. </p><p>Her attitude was truly a special treat — helped by her clothes that were barely able to contain her body, and our current level of closeness. </p><p>“I don’t care, smile,” Ida said as she continued to take her photos. </p><p>Irene moved forward, and as much as I wanted to pull her back and enjoy the depths of the special prison she prepared for more, I decided to let her go, as we had pushed her sufficiently. Yet, just as she had pulled back forward to the point only the crown was in her beautiful warmth, she changed direction, slowly pushing back in. </p><p>She raised her head as she did so, giving me a glimpse of the mischievous smile she was wearing, instead of the shy glance I expected her to wear. </p><p>Apparently, the idea of hiding such a monumental thing from her friend was enough to make her ignore the shyness of the situation, marking a grand difference from the time she had avoided me for half an hour just because I had managed to get a naked glimpse of her beautiful breasts. </p><p>Ida clearly noticed the undertone I had noticed if her smile was any indicator, because I noticed her expression getting even tighter as she looked at Irene’s face. I smirked, once again more than happy to act as a mute during the warped battle of two friends. </p><p>The nature of the battle between Ida and Irene was developing differently than the direct competition between Sarah and Naomi — one that was a weird mixture of a chain of dares and endurance competition — that certainly didn’t make it any less fun. </p><p>Ida walked around us, taking more and more of our photos while Irene moved back and forth, slow enough to make it reasonable for her to think her little trick was still hidden, her beautiful core stretching more with each repeat, pulling me even deeper. </p><p>It took a great deal of willpower from me not to grab Irene’s top and rip it off. Even though it was not covering a lot of area in the first place, the little it covered was getting more and more frustrating as things continued, but I ignored the temptation, allowing her to maintain the illusion that her sneakiness worked. </p><p>Yet, Irene wasn’t the only one that was messing with my willpower. </p><p>Ida walked around us several times as she photographed us, but not neglecting to stop behind me to caress my shaft at every turn. That little intervention — one that was actually sneaky unlike Irene’s misguided attempts — was enough to tempt me to action in the first place, but Ida didn’t limit herself to that. </p><p>She also used the opportunity to fiddle with her clothing, the direction rather obvious. Every time she arrived in front of us, her skirt was a bit shorter as she folded it around her waist, and her chainmail top was a bit lower, loosened around her neck to deepen her cleavage. </p><p>Irene either missed that detail completely, or she was simply too focused on her own little challenge to take notice of it, writing it off as an inferior seduction attempt compared to her own spectacular actions. </p><p>Though I found the former more believable, as she was certainly distracted enough to miss the fact that Ida didn’t ask us to change the pose for the last several minutes. </p><p>For me, there was one challenge, one of my hands was still occupied by the great ax I had picked, getting heavier by the second. It was not to the point that I couldn’t lift it, but enough for the discomfort to be actually noticeable. </p><p>Enough, I decided as I leaned enough to drop it down without creating a commotion — but still standing straight enough not to interrupt Irene’s beautiful dance. </p><p>“Who told you that you can drop it down,” Ida was quick to interrupt from behind me, her fingers shifting from the base of my shaft and landing on my hips once more, loud enough to explode. </p><p>And loud enough to earn a chuckle from Irene. </p><p>“Sorry, boss,” I answered, trying to sound serious but unable to hide my chuckle, which earned another, even harder, spank from Ida in punishment, though even her best attempt was unable to do anything more than a little stinging. </p><p>At least, that was the impact on me. Irene had a much different reaction — albeit was more about me using it as an excuse to push my hips forward, skewering her tightness much faster than her own slow attempts — moaning loudly as she found herself filled even deeper, her voice beautiful. </p><p>Her body rocked, making her breasts sway beautifully under the effect. </p><p>Ida spoke again. “If you’re not going to grab the ax, let’s use your hands better. Rip off her top and grab her breasts. Let’s give the barbarian and his whore impression more accurately.” </p><p>“Hey—“ Irene gasped in shock, one that was interrupted by her shock as I pulled her top off immediately, leaving her tits bare. “What are you doing?” she gasped in shock, though her scandalous tone would have been more appropriate if she didn’t push her hips back to devour my shaft once more. </p><p>“Hey, orders are orders,” I answered as I grabbed her breasts, my hands covering more of her beautiful skin than that silly excuse of a top. Which meant, technically, she maintained a more modest look without her top. </p><p>Of course, that required discounting the explosion of the sudden moan as my fingers started working on her breasts, ruining her dedication to keeping her voice low. </p><p>“Much better look for a barbarian whore,” Ida commented, still behind me, still teasing my shaft. </p><p>Irene answered, though her complaint came from an unexpected direction. “S-she’s not a whore. She’s a proud barbarian princess, destined to save her people.” </p><p>“Maybe, but if you want people to believe that, maybe you shouldn’t moan like a whore while playing her,” Ida said. </p><p>Irene chuckled. “Oh, like you would react being topless any better,” Irene answered, which might have been a fair comment considering Ida’s usual nature, but with a camera in hand, it was wrong to challenge her — especially since she was clearly feeling the build-up of arousal thanks to our earlier adventures. </p><p>“Oh, really?” Ida answered as she took a step back, but the lack of contact didn’t mean I didn’t guess what she was doing. Her tone was revealing enough, but there was no mistaking of metal hitting the carpeted floor. </p><p>There was only one piece of equipment that could make that noise. </p><p>“No, you didn’t,” Irene gasped in shock, trying to turn back to look, but with my hands on her breasts, keeping her immobile even as I enjoyed their great expanse. </p><p>She failed to turn, and Ida didn’t answer, but that didn’t mean she didn’t satisfy her curiosity. Ida walked in front of us once more, her surprisingly large breasts finally free from their confines as she walked with a confident gait — one that her skirt to rise up occasionally, sufficient to reveal her lack of panties, but Irene’s gaze was locked on her breasts. </p><p>“What are you doing?” Irene gasped in shock as she looked at her friend. </p><p>“Doing what you asked, of course,” she said before she turned to me. “Chad, it’s unfair for you to help her cover her,” she ordered. </p><p>I decided to follow her order once more even though I was getting tempted to make her pay. Her attempts of dominance were certainly amusing, but making her pay later would be even more entertaining. </p><p>Yet, as I watched her close in the distance between her and her half-naked friend, making Irene tremble in fear of being caught, I was willing to belay that punishment temporarily. </p><p>The potential of the moment was too amazing to waste. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I continued to defend against endless rain of spells, blood continuing to stem down my nose as the challenge of containing the mana I stole started to get overwhelming. I had both the mana and the skill necessary to cure myself, but I couldn’t spare the attention. </p><p>Not when the squad was still approaching steadily, close enough for the distance to be measured in feet, the warriors standing in a formation to protect the mages. Ordinarily, the presence of the warriors would mean little in a mage battle — courtesy of area-effect or other indirect spells. </p><p>But things were different with their weapons more than capable of destroying spells, and their incredible HP reserves made it impossible to take down with stray spells and ordinary tricks. </p><p>And then, they arrived at the border, one of them, armed with a long spear — its heft once again studded with enough eternal gems to trigger a world war, supporting the weapon with enough mana to rival my regeneration — probed forward. </p><p>The floating orbs ignored him, still busy trying to block the spells of the mages that were raining without a pause. The tip of the spear hit the ward, but that was the extent of his probing, pulling immediately, trying to protect themselves against a possible trap. </p><p>Yet, even that casual probing was enough to damage the ward that required hundreds of mana to fix. I did so, making it look like it cost me a dangerous portion of my reserves, while I just used some of the mana I stole from their spells, actually reducing the pressure I was feeling. </p><p>But, the mysterious enemy still didn’t act, nor he acted in a way that would kill me. The spells that the mages were throwing around were extremely strong, but at this point, it was clear that they were not working. </p><p>I could come up with a hundred better formations to actually kill me, but the current pattern was perfect for increasing the pressure I was feeling. </p><p>Especially that, rather than attacking directly, the warriors surrounded me in a circle, with the mages behind them, creating incredible pressure…</p><p>The mysterious enemy still stayed hidden, letting me feel the pressure of his deadly tactics, yet to reveal his true objective, content in keeping me in deadly danger.</p><p>Whatever he wanted to see, he was yet to see it, which meant it was not about my magical capabilities. That aspect didn’t surprise me much, as even the ward they used to trap me showed that they had resources and capabilities that could easily eclipse me. </p><p>I decided to lean on it more to anger him, in a way that would pull his attention away from Silver Spires. Luckily, I had an excellent scapegoat for this, one that had already gone through a lot of trouble to avoid the attention of the Eternals. </p><p>Zokras, the unlucky lich. </p><p>“Enough. I can’t believe I have to abandon this identity because of a bunch of rabid dogs,” I shouted as I reached to my own mana, and used my own mana to replicate the undead energy, letting it dance over my skin, even as I cast an illusion.</p><p>[-1306 Mana]</p><p>[-481 HP]</p><p>The pain was bad, but not impossible to resist. The important part was to make the trick look convincing, and I was aware that my mysterious enemy was simple. I let the necrotic energy infuse my body. </p><p>Yet, the enemy stayed silent. </p><p>So be it, I thought even as I reached one of the four nodes, and transformed into necrotic energy, followed by a smirk. </p><p>I finally felt a movement in the Northeast direction. Necrotic energy was truly the bane of living creatures, and HP was not a good barrier. That much necrotic energy was enough to cause a threat. </p><p>And the reaction was intense, coming in the form of a huge spell, one of familiar energy. </p><p>It was a spear of light, with an intensity that Titania couldn’t hope to match even in her wildest dreams. Even Mariel would fail to match that despite the recent help I had given her to assimilate her Divine Spark. </p><p>The spell was enough to give me a good guess of what had triggered the sudden ambush. They were clearly observing her more closely than I had been expecting, enough that her sublimation of Divine Spark was enough to trigger a great trap. </p><p>Yet, I was clearly just a suspect, and they weren’t sure whether I was responsible for it. If they knew for certain, they wouldn’t have worked so hard to bait me. </p><p>The instant spell was enough to show me that the enemy was strong. Far stronger than me, and not just in pure power — as it would hardly be something new, every single enemy I was fighting against had enough raw power to eclipse me — but also in control and application. </p><p>It was time to retreat, I decided, preparing myself to teleport. But, I needed a ward to protect myself first, and my enemy was kind enough to give me the necessary tools to do so. </p><p>His spell was fast, and under normal conditions, it would have arrived to me before I could cast a spell. Transforming the nature of more than ten thousand points of mana was not a quick affair even when that mana was in my reserves, ready to be used. Outside, it was even slower. </p><p>But I had Tantric, which helped me to transform nature much more easily by increasing the malleability of mana, and the mysterious enemy was sufficiently away that even a spear of light was not instantaneous.</p><p>Their attempts to stay hidden were not without their cost. </p><p>The necrotic energy exploded, delivering a dangerous amount of damage to every single one. Since it was not a targeted spell but an intense flood of energy, their ability to block didn’t work as well, especially since the mages didn’t react in time.</p><p>Yet, against them, even that was not enough to kill them, or even wound them seriously. </p><p>But it was enough to give me an opportunity as they pulled back. I focused on the warriors even as I directed the now empty rotating mana toward the spear of light, using it to block it, sacrificing the node in the process, triggering a great explosion.</p><p>I didn’t even try absorbing it, as it was a trick that was only possible because of the ineptitude of the other mages, using extremely simple spells, their structure obvious for my gaze, allowing me to identify the correct point to destabilize it. </p><p>Against the spear, even destabilizing it enough that it self-destructed was a great achievement, though the cost was equally steep. </p><p>An eternal gem.</p><p>Just like the mysterious enemy was mocking my achievement, he cast another spell, this time sending fourteen spears of light at the same time, with the same ease, showing that he was yet to show his true capabilities. </p><p>Luckily, the thirteen eternal gems in my possession were not the only ones I could get. After all, they weren’t the only ones that were hiding their capabilities, and I wasn’t stupid enough to let them surround me without an ulterior motive. </p><p>I reached for the second orb, transforming the mana into necrotic energy as well, but this time targeting the hands of the mages, who were too distracted to resist. </p><p>The mages weren’t weak, but they also didn’t have the endless HP of the warriors. And, with the warriors still distracted by the pain of the necrotic energy. Especially I directed some of it to their soul space, the conflict against the barrier that protected their soul space strong enough to disable them in pain for a second. </p><p>A second without their protection was all I needed to deal with the mages, their HP was nothing against necrotic energy, once again reminding me that it was not without reason necromancers were hunted the moment they were detected. </p><p>The protection of HP was nothing against it. </p><p>“No!” came a monstrous shout, one that reminded me of a monster, though distinctly male, though what scared me was the energy that accompanied it. It was a fiery energy, hard to describe, destroying everything in its path. </p><p>It reminded me of light, and fire, but even at a distance, I could feel that it was only a superficial similarity, not something true. </p><p>Yet, his anger was unmistakable. It was not anger that come from a loss, but came of warning. He wasn’t in despair because I killed ten of his soldiers, but what would follow. </p><p>At this point, I wasn’t interested in his threats. His strength was enough that I had to run away from Silver Spires for a long time, and my show of necrotic energy was hopefully enough to mark me as a spy rather than a member. </p><p>I could only hope that it would be enough to keep him away from targeting the school in revenge — especially since he was hesitant for some reason. </p><p>I ignored the threat in his tone as I tapped into the ball of energy once more, once again using the external energy for my objectives. </p><p>Enough to target ten weapons at the same time, disassembling them in an instant. With hundreds of eternal gems under my control, sacrificing thirteen of them was not a big deal. Especially since I still had exactly twenty-three untouched weapons, each promising me at least ten eternal gems. </p><p>The angry shout of my enemy was beautiful, I thought, but the satisfaction didn’t last long. </p><p>This time, it didn’t come in the form of a distant attack, but a familiar distortion.</p><p>Teleportation.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6982 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [118/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [100/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I had never felt such an intensity of pressure while setting up a ward, not even back in the days I was still weak, saving Titania from a dangerous necromancer ambush, or the time I had to go and reinforce Cornelia and Helga during the sudden undead ambush. </p><p>During the time I saved Titania, I was the hunter, giving me the freedom to strategize however I wished, in a sense, making it even a relaxed affair. </p><p>And, while saving Cornelia and Helga had been a much more tense affair, bringing me closer to death than I had ever thought possible until that time, at least I wasn’t in a position to hide my abilities. </p><p>Here, it was the worst of both worlds. Not only I was in a dangerous situation, facing a threat that was likely enough to overwhelm me, but also I had to pick and choose which ability I could use, afraid of revealing the wrong thing — all without not even knowing what my mysterious enemy was searching for in the first place.</p><p>The difficulty of the ward I was setting up didn’t help anyway. </p><p>From a purely technical perspective, it was not a ward, but a combination of a ward and a weapon. I used my mana to put the destroyed material of the ax to good use, the unknown metal flexing easily under my intense magic flow and creating two intersecting circles around me, and ten of the Eternal gems I had just acquired went there, embedding themselves into the structure. </p><p>Of course, even for that great number of Eternal gems, the amount of mana they could provide had limits, but it was still measured in thousands. More importantly, the interference they generated was enough for me to use my own mana secretly to support the structure without raising questions about my dangerous mana regeneration.</p><p>[-2890 Mana]</p><p>Under the great flood of mana, some external and some internal, the ward started to take shape. The great construction, appearing layer by layer, taxing my mental abilities to the limit as I applied every single trick I collected to optimize its impact. </p><p>Even then, the recent boost in Craft had been terribly critical in ensuring everything worked as it was supposed to. </p><p>It was exhausting, but I couldn’t afford to pull back on that aspect, not when the attackers were already finished dealing with the berserk warrior, taking him down in a few seconds. But, it was still enough to ruin their formation, giving me several precious seconds as they gathered into a formation, and started moving forward. </p><p>More than twenty warriors, supported by half as many mages. Ignoring them took a lot of effort, but watching them approach was less important than finishing the ward. </p><p>As the inner structure solidified, a mana connection with the remaining four stones appeared, each radiating with pure mana, ready to transform into whatever nature I wished. </p><p>Just in time, as the first rain of magical attack hit me, courtesy of the mages hidden behind the formation. Four floating spheres around me danced rapidly to meet the rain of fire and lightning, intense enough to destroy a city. </p><p>Controlling four floating mana spheres independently was not difficult, even for a novice mage. </p><p>Controlling four floating mana spheres tightly packed with rotating mana, acting as a vortex was harder, but it could still be done easily without assistance. I could have done so easily even without the gems to stabilize their structure. </p><p>The real challenge started when the first spell hit, a fireball, the vortex immediately devouring it and taking it to the core, pressuring the foreign mana until it lost its attacking nature, turning it back to its stable state. </p><p>Though it was still elemental mana, which made it very difficult to control and contain. </p><p>Containing that mana was the main reason I had gone through that crazy design. It was not only a defensive tool, but it also empowered my abilities to counter-attack. </p><p>I was still tempted to teleport out, but I didn’t dare to do so without getting a better idea of what my enemy was searching for. Only then, I could accidentally reveal my true secret — one that didn’t require them to chase me at full strength. </p><p>Of course, I doubted that, even if succeeded in that, they would just stop chasing me, but I doubted someone that strong only had me as a concern. I had many ways to escape easily as long as I was treated as a nuisance. </p><p>I wasn’t as confident in hiding if they actually wanted to chase me, especially if the next time, they didn’t come with the dregs of their organization. </p><p>Another spell rushed toward me, this time a huge wave of water threatening to devour me, but before it could reach halfway, another orb rushed forward and cut through the center of the spell, absorbing enough mana to destabilize its structure, but before I could even finish that, other spells rained over me, forcing me to use all four rotating balls of mana at the same time. </p><p>Against another mage, it would have been impossible to succeed. Even as I used the orbs to absorb their attacks, I could come up with dozens of ways to destroy my own arrangements. Hitting one of those orbs with a sharp, armor-piercing would have half of the job by disrupting its movement, making it temporarily useless. </p><p>A few more, and I would deal with an explosion worse than what my enemies throwing forward. </p><p>But my magical attackers were no different than the warriors, showing that their near-berserk state was enough to wipe whatever benefit given to them by their stats. They just rained their spells recklessly while they closed together with the warriors. </p><p>Even more beautifully, they restricted themselves to four elements, which, under the simplest look, was the correct move. They were the most destructive ones, and shockingly effective against wards, in a way that couldn’t be replicated by Arcana spells or other disciplines. </p><p>Yet, it only made it easier for me to handle it. I targeted each type of element with one orb, making sure each orb only contained one type of energy.</p><p>I remember the violent results of mixing different types of energies, and I certainly didn’t try to replicate it. If they had used different types of energies, I would be facing the option of letting them score a hit, pushing another gem from the inner ward matrix to create a fifth external node, or letting out the energies hidden in one of the nodes to keep it empty, using it to deflect multiple types of energies. </p><p>And none of those options was preferable. The first would bring unnecessary damage to the inner structure, and while it was inevitable, I didn’t want to start receiving damage, especially since its main objective was to resist the melee damage represented by the warriors, one that would turn into a trap if everything went well. </p><p>The second option was equally unpleasant. The inner nodes were there to help me to contain the pressure of the external orbs as the mana they contained grew more and more. Trying to balance more orbs with fewer focal nodes to support would make it more difficult.</p><p>Just like juggling, adding another element made it exponentially difficult.  </p><p>Technically, third was the most tenable option, but it would not only make me waste all the mana I stole, but also risked to alert my mysterious enemy about the true nature of the trick. </p><p>I wanted them to believe that my stance was a reckless last stand of a hopeless man, not a dangerous trap. </p><p>They moved forward steadily, seconds turning into minutes with no change in their pattern as they continued to rain spells, their pace slightly faster than walking, though they were barely more than soft silhouettes with all the dust and smoke filling my surroundings as the siege continued, the pressure increasing as the mana hidden in the orbs increased.  </p><p>Yet, even as time passed, there was no change in their pattern as they continued to rain their spells. I felt something warm dripping down. For a moment, I thought it to be sweat, but the iron taste that accompanied it showed that it was not the case. </p><p>It was blood. </p><p>[-47 HP]</p><p>Things had been getting overwhelming.  In each orb, the amount of mana that was hidden was more than ten thousand points, and not by a small margin. </p><p>A number that was significantly greater than my own reserves, and I was trying to contain that without the assistance of the System. Some, I already absorbed back into my reserves to fill, but the amount was still incredible. </p><p>“How much mana do they have?” I found myself murmuring. My own technique of destroying their spells was far from perfect. I would be lucky if I was able to get five percent of the mana they had invested, while the rest was dispersing, consumed by the spell effect after the core of the spell was destroyed by the orb. </p><p>Meaning, they had already wasted more than five hundred thousand mana! It had great implications for their mana capacity and mana regeneration, yet, even as the pressure reached an overwhelming degree, I couldn’t help but focus on one thing. </p><p>What a waste!</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6982 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [118/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [100/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Coming up with a plan didn’t take long as I realized the folly of my thinking. Trying to decide which girl to focus on for the upcoming session was an unnecessary direction. </p><p>Why not both? </p><p>First, informing Isolde on that aspect. I tightened my arm around Isolde’s waist, slowing her hips down once more, cutting her path to completion. She tried to push through that once more, but with my both hands already on her back, this time, she failed. </p><p>“I see that you’re pushing your luck,” I whispered into her ear, which was enough to stop her. Not the words, but the sudden change in my tone, still playful…</p><p>But with a threatening edge. </p><p>“I not —“ she started, but her argument died halfway as I cast a spell, and she found being dragged toward Cinder, bound in an identical chain. The only difference was the material, smooth, glowing magical rather than ice — which was just playful against Cinder, who was a being of fire, but it would be just inviting nasty frostbite for Isolde. </p><p>There was a difference between punishment and torture. </p><p>Isolde had more immediate concerns than noting that difference, trying to maintain her balance. To her credit, she didn’t say anything, accepting the situation quickly, realizing that her reflexive disdain for anything magical overwhelmed her obedience. </p><p>I still had to work a lot to solve her weird obsession. Maybe it would help her once I trained her to be a better assassin, giving her a way to hit back at the mages. </p><p>Isolde was busy reflecting on her mistake, but Cinder certainly didn’t share the same complication. “Just what an uppity servant like you deserve, you insolent —“ Cinder started arrogantly before her words died in a gasp. </p><p>The culprit, another ice I conjured, this time a cube, circling around her nipple to trigger her arousal, her moan of shock beautiful. </p><p>I had to stop her, as it was still her punishment as well, and stopping halfway would have given the wrong message, but that didn’t mean that I wasn’t entertained by her haughty words, or more accurately, the absolute confidence she was able to deliver them. </p><p>It took a special kind of arrogance to sound that confident and self-satisfying while being naked and bound — both physically and magically — and it took even more to make that level of arrogance actually erotic. </p><p>Even Sapphire, who was the Queen, lacked that — though maybe I shouldn’t be surprised by that. After all, she had risen to the power slowly, cutting, tricking, and scraping in a dangerous world that would chew her and spit her out at her slightest mistake, forcing her to dance on the edge of a blade.</p><p>In comparison, Cinder clearly grew up spoiled and confident in her place — albeit with her own challenges that left their mark. It was interesting to see how it reflected on her general attitude and how it implicated our bedroom fun.</p><p>In the future. </p><p>Instead, I turned my attention to where exactly I wanted to drag Isolde, floating magical chains allowing me to position my frustrated beauty wherever I wished, which left me to consider the best location. </p><p>Though, considering her obedience came from her desire to one-up Cinder, it didn’t take long for me to finalize her ultimate location. </p><p>Right in front of Cinder, enough for their bodies to brush against each other, with no chance to avoid her gaze unless one of them closed their eyes — and both were too arrogant to even contemplate such a retreat. </p><p>Isolde growled in anger, though I was curious whether it was the fact that she was positioned directly against Cinder, forcing her to interact with her. </p><p>Or her chains were clearly magical. Any chain I conjured to bind her had to be magical under current circumstances as I didn’t exactly have access to a handy arsenal, but there were several things I could do to undersell the magical nature of her imprisonment, like conjuring chains of stone, polished enough to be mistaken for metal chains. </p><p>Yet, I chose chains of pure magical energy, their intensely glowing nature enough to constantly remind her of the truth of their nature as their light bounced off Cinder’s skin, the bluish tone mixing beautifully with the glow from her flickering flames. </p><p>I walked toward them, each step meandering. There were many aspects to punishment, and sometimes, not doing anything was a part of it, especially when they were in a position not to enjoy the passage of time. </p><p>But it couldn’t be just discomfort, or even mainly discomfort. The chains were not the most comfortable thing, but even then, it was their contrasting nature that annoyed the girls rather than the pain of their presence. Their nudity, together with their aroused state, worked wonders to keep the sexual nature of the event at the forefront. </p><p>Yet, none of those facts made my meandering walk truly an effective punishment. </p><p>It was their proximity that turned into a masterful stroke. With both girls enough for their nipples to brush, there was no chance for them to avoid each other’s attention. They looked at me at the beginning, and once their gaze met, their lips curled into sneers of equal intensity, there was no way for them to pull their gaze away. </p><p>After all, pulling away would mean defeat, and both of them carried too much pride to actually let that happen, especially against someone they despised — and with Cinder treating Isolde as a disposable human, and Isolde seeing Cinder as another arrogant mage, the emotions were long set. </p><p>What happened earlier just ignited it, and did so in a direction I enjoyed, fighting for my favor rather than direct confrontation. </p><p>I continued approaching slowly, watching as they looked at each other, motionless, their gaze locked without even blinking as they tried to intimidate each other, and with Cinder’s magic locked, it was a balanced competition, preventing her from using her flames. </p><p>I appreciated the contrast of their beauty. Isolde was tanned and muscular after the years she had spent in the wilderness, yet still maintaining enough curves to make sure her femininity could never be ignored. While those rough traits might have destroyed a more ordinary woman, they only enhanced Isolde’s wild charm further. </p><p>In contrast, Cinder had a soft, curvy body. With the glow of her skin temporarily abated, she looked as weak as a prized mistress of a noble, belaying the fact that she could destroy the meadow we were in faster than one of those mistresses snap a twig in half. </p><p>I waited, enjoying their beauty as their anger built up, mixing beautifully with her arousal with each passing second,  leftover from what I had stopped halfway. </p><p>Soon, Cinder discovered the first weakness. She noticed Isolde bristling whenever her breast brushed against hers, her face coloring with a sense of inferiority for a fleeting moment. </p><p>I could say that it was a pointless worry, as while her chest was smaller, it didn’t make it any less beautiful. Yet, I didn’t intervene as Cinder started leveraging that. With chains immobilizing both, she couldn’t do much, but she found a way. She started taking deep breaths, which was enough to push her chest forward.  </p><p>Isolde might be gruff and direct, but she wasn’t stupid, quickly realizing the intentional shift, though Cinder’s smirk soon replaced her anger, her beautiful bosom rubbing against Isolde, confident in her victory. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, she had miscalculated the amount of frustration and annoyance Isolde could handle, especially after sharing a party with Emma for years. And while Emma was fun to play with, she was an even bigger annoyance. At least, Cinder was smug because she was confident in her superiority — albeit somehow misguided. </p><p>Emma had the kind of fragile ego that made her lash out against anyone. After dealing with her for years, a momentary annoyance didn’t even register Isolde as a challenge. </p><p>And, it didn’t take long for Cinder to realize the drawback of her plan. With every breath, her hard nipples rubbed against Isolde’s skin, which gave her a great deal of pleasure in her aroused state. </p><p>She could have just stopped, of course, but not without surrendering her smug smile to Isolde. Realizing the trouble she put herself in, she doubled down, pushing herself an inch forward — as much as the chains allowed, despite the discomfort  — to increase the effect of her breaths, even more, betting on the fact that Isolde would be defeated by her annoyance faster than annoyance could defeat her.  </p><p>I just waited, my presence temporarily forgotten as my punishment setup started to get even more useful than I had expected. Cinder, in particular, was dealing with a problem of her own infliction, while Isolde was trying to prevent herself from getting too angry. </p><p>Altogether, a surprisingly interesting twist to my initial punishment plan. All that remained was to decide how to continue…</p>",

    "content": "<p>However, I had more immediate priorities than revenge. I needed to prevent a fight first. “Huddle up,” I said, gesturing to defensive players that were gathering around, mumbling darkly to show they had noticed the dirty trick they were trying to pull. </p><p>I was glad for Leadership, allowing me to notice their simmering anger, ready to explode. I gestured to two of the players that were looking the angriest even as I shouted an order that was reinforced with its full strength. “Huddle up.” </p><p>They gathered up, though I noticed a few reluctant faces among them even as they gathered. “I don’t want any of you starting a fight, that’s what that asshole wants,” I said, which earned a few suspicious glances from the rest of the team, clearly realizing that it was not in my character to stay away from a fight. </p><p>“Are you sure…” asked Marcus. </p><p>I smirked. “Oh, don’t worry, I have a way to handle it myself, just make sure you be careful while engaging with the new players. We can’t afford to lose any more players.” </p><p>“That applies to you as well, be careful,” he said. </p><p>“Don’t worry about me,” I said with a wave. “Let’s focus on the play. We’re going for a QB sneak, it’s just one yard,” I said. They looked suspicious considering it left me open to an attack. “Don’t worry about it, after that, they would expect me to avoid getting hit.” </p><p>“Are you sure, they looked fired up after your threat?” </p><p>I smirked. “They did, but they are not the ones calling the plays, do they,” I said even as I pointed at Coach Spencer, who was making a gesture from the side to signal their movement, calling pass protection. </p><p>“Oh, I forget they were playing with disadvantage,” Marcus said with a chuckle before we started discussing the plan. </p><p>When we lined up against them, I met the center linebacker, who was watching me angrily even as he lined up toward the right side, where three of our receivers were lined up, ready to take the line. </p><p>When the ball snapped, they all moved away from the line, while Marcus reached to me, and I made a fake hand-off, Agility helping to make it convincing enough to give me half a second. </p><p>Which was all I needed to get the current layout of the defense and identify a corridor to run. Of course, ideally, my offensive line would have been the one to create a predetermined running path for me, but with their inexperience, delaying the four-man rush even for a moment was more than I hoped for. </p><p>I dashed forward, right at one of the hired defensive linemen that were unbalanced by his rush. I appeared next to him. He made a move to shed his current opponent and attack me. </p><p>His fluidity of motion and his success suggested he was used to dealing with much better players. If I tried to run through him, he would have taken me down easily. </p><p>I had no intention of avoiding him. Just as he freed himself from his current opponent, I put my hand on his chest, my arm stiff, and pushed. He was already unbalanced by his own hurry, making it a hopeless affair to resist as he collapsed on his back. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured even as I cut to the left, where almost no players stood in my way thanks to Coach Spencer trying to be a genius to intercept my pass. Speed and Agility allowed me to easily leave the linebacker that was tasked to take me down. </p><p>He was fast, but with the distance between us, I didn’t need to push myself to the limit to maintain the distance. </p><p>Of course, the left side was not completely empty, there was still one safety, and one cornerback trying to dash toward me to take me down. </p><p>A hired cornerback that was doing his best to injure me earlier. </p><p>It was time for punishment. He rushed forward, trying to cut my path. I could have used a footwork trick to avoid him, but instead, I trucked forward without slowing down, to a direct collusion course. </p><p>If I had been still working to increase my Precision, I would have avoided and walked out of bounds, happy that I cleared the distance for another first down, and handled the rest while passing.  </p><p>Thanks to the number of viewers, I had already reached a point that would allow me to win any skill challenge easily. </p><p>I used that freedom to truck against the unfortunate cornerback with my full strength, enough to send him flying. Yet, I didn’t even pause as I rushed forward, enjoying the spectators going crazy with excitement at the spectacular play. </p><p>The poor safety froze for a moment as he saw the fate of the other player, and I passed him easily, though his concern was unfounded. I had no intention of actually injuring our players, just the guys that were responsible for actually attacking us. </p><p>Even as I run toward the end zone, I slowed down slightly, enough to let the angry linebacker catch up with me. He did his best to slam against me from behind, using his helmet to directly hit my spine. </p><p>I frowned even as I shifted my weight, realizing the deliberate nature of his move, trying to actually injure me badly enough to turn me into a paraplegic if I didn’t shift my body at the last moment. </p><p>Such a move deserved a dirty response, I decided even as I tapped into the intent that was growing, and pushed some of it to my hand, just like I did against the black shadows that attacked me. </p><p>Then, I smashed it down right onto his shoulder, feeling his shoulder shattering under my hit. Interestingly, despite that, the pads actually survived, showing that Intent didn’t just enhance my strength, and worked as some kind of penetrative force. </p><p>Impressive, I thought even as I watched him collapse on the same shoulder, glad that he was rolling badly, because it created a convenient excuse for the broken bones. I ignored him as I covered the rest of the distance, scoring a touchdown. </p><p>The medical team was the first one to rush the guy, and started checking him, which allowed a break. Three of the players gathered around him, sending me looks that would kill me if they had something like my intent, while the unfortunate cornerback was also stumbling toward the medical tent. </p><p>Good riddance. </p><p>“Let’s practice some passing while they have fun,” I said to my team even as I moved to the center of the field. “I need three targets at the endzone,” I said as I pointed to one of them, then pointed to the other end of the field, which didn’t have a crowd of the medical team. </p><p>After their previous attempt to injure me, the unlucky linebacker didn’t exactly gain too much sympathy from our side — or even from the rest of the practice squad, clearly uncomfortable with things escalating to such a degree.</p><p>Coach Spencer, on the other hand, rushed toward the collapsed man, showing that he was very much concerned with his welfare. </p><p>I ignored them as I ordered my receivers to line up, and gave them simple routes to complete. “What’s the sequence?” Marcus asked. </p><p>“What sequence,” I countered with a smirk. “I want you to move simultaneously, without skipping even a beat,” I said. “Now, you have five seconds. Let’s give the audience something to watch while proving offense has the easier job.” </p><p>It was not a fair statement, but while trying to boost the morale of the defensive squad that lost its coordinator and most critical members, I wasn’t particularly concerned with fairness against them. </p><p>Instead, I raised my hand up, and when I brought it down, they rushed forward. One of the players was passing the ball to me, and my hands flashed, distributing each ball to my target. </p><p>Each landing accurately, right where I wanted, a task that I could never succeed without the most recent boost. It wasn’t as entertaining for the audience as a full-blown match, but it was still sufficiently entertaining enough to catch their attention more than the medical teams on the other side of the field. </p><p>And, with that, more intent. </p><p>[Precision V, acquired]</p><p>Even as I reached the System’s current limit, I didn’t stop. First, more intent was always useful. </p><p>Second, there was a high challenge Coach Spencer would stop the challenge after the injury, and I wanted to drive the skill difference between me and Kevin as much as possible. </p><p>“Do you want to join the fun, Kevin,” I shouted at the rich boy who was watching us with a frown on his face, accompanied by anger and despair in equal amounts. The expression of the starter was not too different, realizing that, with the abilities I was displaying, it wasn’t just Kevin that was at risk.  </p><p>What really amused me was, however, the expression of the rest of the team. There was no doubt about the bad blood between us, and most of them had turned soft under Coach Spencer’s coddling. </p><p>However, soft was a relative term when it came to football players. They still worked hard, and went through the pain. There were two reasons for that. They either wanted to win, or they were in for personal glory. </p><p>In either case, a good Quarterback was essential. Which put them in a complicated situation as they watched me rain passes, the balls flying with a speed that their starter could never match. </p><p>Promising them glory for mutiny. </p><p>I was curious how long it would take for the first one to raise that question. Pity that was not to be learned, as I watched Coach Spencer rush toward us with a stormy expression. </p><p>“It’s an order, don’t retaliate no matter what happens,” I said as I looked at the defense. “Actually disperse, and watch how I solve our coaching problem,” I added, and they dispersed. </p><p>Leaving me with a big smirk. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The crowd was cheering loudly as we walked onto the field, which Coach Spencer didn’t miss. Clearly, the audience was aware of who was responsible for our victory against our rivals, and greeted us. </p><p>Though, admittedly, I owed quite a bit to Megan as well, who was working hard to hype the challenge. I felt Intent flooding into my soul once more. Not as intense as the victory we earned, but intense nonetheless. </p><p>Pity, it wasn’t enough to improve my Precision more. </p><p>I examined the layout in front of me as we took our positions, easily recognizing it as one of our team’s standard zone defenses close range, the ones that were used against a team when a short pass was expected. </p><p>It was a smart decision. After all, it was just the first play, and they expected me to start safely. A mistake I was more than happy to punish even as I signaled my fastest receiver to run a go route, ready to launch. </p><p>However, just as the center snapped the ball to my hand, I noticed an interesting detail. Two of the cornerbacks, both new ones, took a step forward, changing their position. </p><p>It was a move that could be easily written off as a mistake of a newbie, but their movement was simply too well-timed for that to be the case. Combined with my earlier suspicions, I decided to make a last-minute adjustment, and gestured for Marcus to run wide with my hand behind me, while using one hand to grip the ball. </p><p>And, retreated without looking up, which turned out to be a smart decision. Both the new linebacker and the two cornerbacks joined the rush, creating a dangerous zero blitz as they attacked by seven people. </p><p>A dangerous gambit, one that I would have punished greatly if my receivers hadn’t been caught flat-footed by the move as the new players burst into action with a speed that they didn’t reveal. </p><p>Which cost me an opportunity for a spectacular pass. </p><p>The cornerbacks were fast as they attacked from both sides, ready to take me down, their smiles predatory. Marcus turned toward me, clearly trying to take the initiative to block one of them. </p><p>I used one of the defensive signals I used when I was playing the mike, asking him to follow the free receiver since we didn’t have a full range of communication. Luckily, he was smart enough to get the message, and continued running to the left. </p><p>That communication cost me only a fraction of a second, but under the circumstances, it was a precious fraction. </p><p>My offensive line was too inexperienced to handle a rush like that, and both cornerbacks reached me without the slightest impediment, their matching smiles making them think that they were about to deliver their first sack. </p><p>And, they would have been right if they had been fighting against an ordinary quarterback, but I was a linebacker who happened to be holding the ball. I rushed toward my right, and slammed against the one that was attacking from that with my full strength. </p><p>There was a great difference between getting punched, and getting punched while not expecting it. It was similar in tackling. The cornerback attacking from the right was clearly skilled, and he was using a perfect posture, his body lowered and his back tense. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, he was still a cornerback, optimized more for speed than power. Trying to take me down was a difficult affair even before the traits I had received. With those, he was like a child trying to take down an adult. </p><p>Pity I didn’t have the luxury to watch his flying figure, not with my offensive line collapsed in confusion, and the linebacker slipped through the mess, and was just a step away. </p><p>Taking him down was not impossible, but taking him down quickly was harder, especially since all he needed to do was to hang on my body for a second before reinforcements arrived. </p><p>Instead, I caught his gaze, and flicked my wrist. </p><p>The ball flew right above the cornerback, who was too committed to rush to try to bat down the pass, and right at the hands of Marcus. He was not a receiver, but as a cornerback, they practiced catching the ball enough, especially uncontested. </p><p>With the blitz, he had no defender assigned to him. </p><p>Pity I wasn’t able to watch him fly for long, not when the linebacker still hit me with his full speed. I stumbled back even as the stadium cheered, but I didn’t fall. The linebacker looked annoyed. </p><p>“You need to hit harder, little man,” I said with a smirk, once again using the full benefit of the taunt. Yet, as he growled, I had the opportunity to examine his face, and he realized he was a bit older than I expected. </p><p>He growled before he twisted, while I went toward the point they took down Marcus — a beautiful twenty-five-yard gain before safety managed to catch up —  and gestured the team to huddle.</p><p>“Sorry, captain,” started one from the offensive line. “We failed you.” </p><p>“Nonsense, you did your best, and it’s just the first attempt. You’ll get used to it,” I said, not needing the warning of the Leadership trait to know how to respond. “But be careful of the unknown players.” </p><p>“Yeah, those are not normal. Those linemen are almost as strong as Thad,” said one of them.</p><p> “Does anyone recognize them, maybe from a college near us,” said Marcus. </p><p>The rest shook their head. I had a suspicion, especially considering their age, but I kept my mouth shut, not wanting to distract them even further. “Just treat them as star players for now, like you would Carter and Thad,” I recommended them instead. “Now, we don’t have too much time to waste. Gun formation.” </p><p>They spread according to my order, and we snapped. </p><p>Learning from their earlier mistake, the defense only rushed forward with three, and the rest pulled back, crowding the receivers. </p><p>A smart move, especially since even with the three rushings, my offensive line was showing signs of crumbling, too used to being the ones that pushed recklessly. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, I wasn’t just limited to flinging passes from the center. “Excellent,” I murmured even as the left side collapsed, and I rolled toward the right, the ball on my right hand. </p><p>I was tempted to rush through the right, when I noticed one of my receivers cut back. It was not something we had discussed before, but he was not being defended by the hired players. </p><p>One of the linebackers got in the way, and forced me to throw with a speed that justified the name of bullet pass. The linebacker was too late to react to the ball that flew in front of him. </p><p>Pity my receiver was too slow as well, as it bounced off his hands. </p><p>Incomplete.</p><p>The team gathered for another huddle. “Nice cut,” I said even as the rest of the team was looking at him angrily. “That’s the type of initiative I expect from you guys, just take sharp cuts if you need to,” I said. </p><p>“But wouldn’t it make you miss us,” he asked, still looking ashamed of his mistake. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said. With Pattern Recognition, I was confident that I would be able to recognize their movement in time. It was still risky, but it was inevitable from playing a disadvantaged position. </p><p>“I still can’t believe that asshole Spencer is cheating this badly,” another player murmured. </p><p>“Of course they do,” I answered with a shrug. “What do you expect from a craven idiot whose only benefit is to be born rich.” </p><p>“Oh, captain, please tell us how you really feel,” he said while the rest of the team started chuckling. </p><p>“Enough talking, repeat the earlier tactic, and split whenever you see a good route. Let’s confuse them,” I said. </p><p>We took our positions once again, and I gestured for them to attack. This time, I received another blitz, but this time one of the linemen attacked from left — what would have been my blind side if it wasn’t for my supernatural awareness— doubling together with the strong linebacker to easily bypass the line. </p><p>I managed to throw the ball, which landed in the hands of my receiver for a six-yard gain, but in exchange. They were far enough to stop, but didn’t, slamming down on me together. </p><p>In a game, it would have received a penalty at a minimum, maybe even an ejection penalty, but since the referee was from Coach Spencer’s team, the audience booing was my consolation prize. </p><p>Or, it would have been, if it didn’t come together with a great flood of intent, enough to give me a great reward. </p><p>[Precision III, acquired]</p><p>[Precision IV, acquired]</p><p>I pushed myself up to my feet, Recovery helping me to suppress the pain of being hit by two hulking men. Yet, as I managed to push myself to my feet and met with their matching smirks, I realized that they weren’t just trying to hurt me. </p><p>They were trying to injure me. </p><p>It seemed that I had underestimated the fragility of Spencer’s ego even now. The match reached an interesting point. </p><p>I turned to the hired guns, curious about where they had come from. “Do that again, and I break your legs,” I said even as I looked at them with a vicious grin, letting the full brunt of Intimidation lash out. </p><p>After all, it was only fair that I warned before retaliating…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Yeah, let’s discuss strategy,” Coach Juana murmured, her voice even tenser than the rest of the team. I understood the source of her stress. She had been trying to get the opportunity to climb through the ranks, and the sudden depletion of the ranks finally gave her the opportunity. </p><p>She wasn’t fired despite being one of Coach Bill’s hires, but that didn’t surprise me. I had seen the effort Coach Spencer was putting to get into her pants, not dissuaded by her repeated rejections. </p><p>Actually, it was a good idea to keep someone competent like that on the team, making her work extra hard to prove herself. It would have helped him greatly to stabilize the defense, at least preventing it from collapsing. </p><p>And, since Coach Juana was just a conditioning coach, the promotion would be his achievement. </p><p>I didn’t give credit to Coach Spencer, who clearly lacked such awareness, and was more interested in just taking control. </p><p>“We are going to restrict ourselves in simple go routes and slants,” Coach Juana started as she glanced at the cornerbacks and the safeties, the positions normally responsible for defending the backside. “Have any of you played receiver before?” </p><p>Luckily, two of them raised their hands. “At high school,” they said. </p><p>“Good enough,” Coach Juana said as she pulled a paper in front of her, quickly drafting a few routes, and quickly explaining the role of each receiver. </p><p>I caught her eye and nodded subtly, showing my approval of her strategy, but I was careful not to actually declare it in a way that other players would notice. Her position was fragile enough, and it was better for them to think that she had control. </p><p>I would prefer her as the defensive coordinator, because she had the necessary attitude to push the players. Not to mention, she worked hard to help me since the first day. </p><p>And I always paid my debts. </p><p>There were some corrections that could be done, of course. She was smart, but her traits allowed me to process information in a way that was truly shocking. Still, I didn’t speak, because I could easily implement those changes during the game, which was the perk of playing the Quarterback. </p><p>“Now, the offensive line,” she said with a frown as she looked at the defensive linemen, which was a much bigger challenge. Drawing strategies for newbie receivers was not too difficult because the receiver had the initiative. They chose the attack lines, and the defensive players responded. </p><p>It was a gross simplification of the process, of course, as if it was that simple, football teams wouldn’t have more tactical personnel than the number of players on the field. In an actual match, the distribution of the receivers triggered the defense response, which forced the attackers to adjust, which then the defense responded again… </p><p>Our greatest advantage was the physical mismatch between our players and the practice squad, allowing us to use simple strategies. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same didn’t apply to the offensive line. They were tasked to defend the quarterback, and their situation was the exact opposite of the receivers. The defense chose how they would attack, and the offensive line needed to respond. </p><p>Even worse, they needed to make sure they coordinated with the others appropriately to make sure they left no gap, like who would be responsible for defending if a fifth or sixth defender blitzed, and how the rest would compensate. </p><p>“Maybe we should keep a tight end to support the line,” she murmured, showing she was concerned for my safety.</p><p>Considering the objective of the situation, understandable. </p><p>“No need,” I said with a wave of my hand. “I can handle the offensive line myself with last-second adjustments,” I said. “Ultimately, it’s the passing skills that will convince them, and we can’t reduce the number of receivers for extra protection.” </p><p>“How about running back,” she asked, and I turned to Marcus. </p><p>“Marcus would be the best. He’s quick, and he can double as another receiving threat. Would you mind playing it,” I said, earning a nod. I asked him, because I was planning to use him as a predominantly receiving threat, and he was quick enough to do so. </p><p>It was another risky choice, but Coach Juana limited herself to a tight look, not intervening with my decision. It was a risky decision, because running back was, like a tight end, often used for protection in case of a breakdown in the offensive line. </p><p>Since practice squad players would be determined to give up a show to gain Coach Spencer’s attention, giving up that protection would have been a terrible choice if I didn’t have my traits. </p><p>With them, it was another opportunity to farm some intent, especially since we had far more viewers than I had expected. </p><p>We turned our attention to the detailed tactics, quickly giving each player their tasks — which was much slower due to the lack of defensive personnel — when we heard the unwelcome voice. </p><p>“We shouldn’t keep the people waiting, people, let’s act,” said Kevin, the arrogance in his tone not surprising me the slightest. He was already confident in his skills — arrogant was the better term — before Coach Spencer chose to involve himself and skew the scales further. </p><p>Though, when I turned and saw Coach Spencer behind him, I was surprised. Not because of the intent, but of the dedication he was showing to alienate every single defensive player. I wondered whether he didn’t care if we lost, all the remaining players would be looking to transfer. </p><p>But regardless, his presence gave me a good opportunity. I was looking to create a scandal. </p><p>“Oh, let’s do it, I’m enthusiastic to teach Sunset College how a proper quarterback plays,” I said even as I walked closer. Then, I lowered my voice, to make sure no one else than those two could hear. “No matter how much the dumb and the dumber work hard to make everyone forget it, carried by the defense,” I said. </p><p>I could have used Intimidation against them, but I deliberately stayed away from that. Instead, I relied on Taunt, putting a mocking expression on my face.</p><p>It was super effective. </p><p>Their faces contorted in matching expressions of anger, making them look like brothers for a  moment. “What did you say?” growled Coach Spencer. </p><p>“I just wished for luck,” I said, much louder. “But if you are cowardly enough to use this as an excuse to cancel the bet, I can’t stop you. You’re the coach, after all.” Then, I chuckled. “For now, at least.” </p><p>Coach Spencer looked angry, and for a moment, I was sure that he would start swinging. Pity that he received help from Kevin at the last second as he leaned and whispered to his ear. </p><p>But that close call was enough to remind me of my other task, to create a scandal that Megan could push on social media, enough to get Coach Spencer fired. </p><p>Or at least, take an indefinite leave of absence. </p><p>“We’re starting in two minutes. The offense would go first, to kindly show you how it is done,” Coach Spencer growled, unable to suppress his juvenile anger as he turned back and walked away. </p><p>“Fun, right,” I said while the rest of the team exploded into laughter, familiar with my personality enough to guess what I had done, appreciating the shot. </p><p>We continued to discuss tactics as the offense took the field against the practice squad, quickly dismantling them even under Kevin’s control. Not too surprising, as not only they were doing it against the practice squad, but also they were doing it against a defensive squad that was running even weaker than normal. </p><p>Clearly not want to anger Coach Spencer. </p><p>Yet, as I watched them, a frown appeared on my face. There were a few faces that were unfamiliar to me. Two at the defensive line, two as cornerbacks, and one as a linebacker. </p><p>“Do you recognize those?” I asked Marcus as I pointed at them. </p><p>“No, but they must have been the newest recruits. The coach is pushing them to make the defense even weaker. I’m sure they won’t play against us,” Marcus said, but I frowned. </p><p>It was reasonable, but I didn’t believe that for one important reason. Their footwork was much better than I expected from last-minute replacements. Still, I didn’t bother following up with Marcus. </p><p>He was an experienced player, but he lacked the attitude to make him truly good. After all, there was a reason he wasn’t included in the list of players poached by Coach Bill. </p><p>Instead, I pulled out my phone and called Megan. “Make sure you record Coach Spencer continuously,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, why?” she asked. </p><p>“Because he’ll give you the scandal we’re looking for before we disperse,” I said, letting my smirk widen even as I watched the offense score in a long, beautiful pass. </p><p>If Spencer wanted to play dirty, I was more than happy to accommodate. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn’t surprised by the sound of fighting. Considering the huge commotion I had triggered, far bigger than I had expected — or thought to be possible, considering the existence of another stage beyond Sorcerer came to me as a very unpleasant surprise — and it would be a fool’s dream to expect the ship to avoid the attention of the Roman fleet. </p><p>I didn’t make a move, and waited passively instead. </p><p>I was surrounded by the isolation wards, but since they were geared to keep what was inside hidden, my enhanced senses — both hearing and mana-sensing — were enough to give me an accurate assessment of what had been going on. </p><p>The shouts of the attackers were enough to reveal the identity of the attackers. The shouts about daring to fight against Republic were an obvious clue, and I had tangled with the legions enough to recognize their battle commands. </p><p>Compared to their aggressive shouts and threats, the ship crew worked in an eerie silence, even as spell after the spell had been launched. </p><p>And they demolished the attacking legions, which was rather shocking. </p><p>A part of the defeat was certainly about the incompetency of the legions when fighting in the sea. The Republic always treated the navy as an afterthought, which meant that while every legion had years of campaigning experience on land, the same efficiency didn’t apply to the sea — which resulted in the Republic relying on the client states for the bulk of the sea-faring activity. </p><p>However, that didn’t mean that the legions were incompetent at sea, it was just relative incompetency compared to the deadly war machine it represented on land. They were still capable of dealing with most threats. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, the crew of the ship could hardly be counted as the most threat. </p><p>The extraordinary nature of the ship was evident from the secret hold I managed to discover, with an arsenal impressive enough to be treated as a declaration of war after sending that to the sea under the Republic’s control, well above even a smaller country should have been able to access. </p><p>While the content of their secret compartment implied a certain amount of military competence, their display still managed to surprise me. </p><p>A part of that shock was about the amount of magic they had been throwing around. The flare of energy, originating from the captain and marking him as a sorcerer didn’t surprise me much, but the same didn’t apply to the number of mages that were a part of the crew. </p><p>Almost one in every three sailors was casting spells, which meant that, even without relying on the ballistas on the hold, the ship was able to punch well above the expected weight. Though, the density of magic talent wasn’t as shocking as the coordination they had been displaying, every spell they used mixing with each other with a level of skill I could never replicate. </p><p>Though, it was more about the way I trained, designed to act solo rather than as a team. Clearly, the crew of the ship chose to go to the other extreme end. </p><p>It was not a bad idea, provided one was confident enough to raise dozens of mages, only to equip them to work only in teams. Even Roman Legions lacked that level of coordination, as it was accepted that such overspecialization would hurt the flexibility of the legions — not to mention the prohibitively expensive nature of raising replacements, only for them to wait to replenish the specific losses in the formation. </p><p>“Who the hell Theodora managed to arrange this ship,” I murmured as I continued sensing the battle. I had a likely answer in mind, of course, but I needed evidence to confirm that. </p><p>Luckily, I had all the time I needed to do so. </p><p>Meanwhile, the crew managed to demolish the attacking legionaries in barely more than a minute, and killed the last man. </p><p>I didn’t have much experience with seafaring, but even I knew that capturing an enemy ship was, as always, one of the biggest sources of money, as it was easily more expensive than any cargo it carried. And even if the winner didn’t have enough sailors to actually manage the ship, they would spend hours scouring the ship to make sure even the smallest hint of silver or valuable cargo was not missed. </p><p>Yet, the moment they had managed to kill the last enemy, the sailors cast another combined spell, and sank the ship. </p><p>Of course, from a logical perspective, their actions made perfect sense. They had just murdered a great number of Roman legionaries, and Rome had destroyed whole cities for less serious crimes. </p><p>Yet, if there was one thing I learned in my life, that greed was an irrational emotion. Facing the loss of such great riches, I expected at least some of the sailors to argue despite the coordination they had displayed earlier. </p><p>Feeling their magic as they sank the ship without the slightest hesitation and argument was just another piece in their mystery, showing that they served an organization that didn’t particularly care about earning back the great amount of treasure they had invested in its development. </p><p>There were only a few entities in the world that could spend riches in that magnitude without financial expectations — to the point they could just let a military ship sink without even bothering to check its cargo hold — and none of those was the kind a trading company could interact, no matter the money the trading company possessed. </p><p>However, ultimately, Theadora was not a trader, and I could think of one organization that was enthusiastic about discovering her whereabouts after her escape. </p><p>“I wonder if she knows her trusted agents are working for her uncle,” I murmured. I didn’t even bother considering the possibility that she had tried to sell me out, and it was not just about the trust I felt toward her.</p><p>Currently, I might be the most wanted man in Rome, but that was a glorious title I had acquired barely minutes before I had stepped into the ship. At the time of arrangement, I was simply not worthy of mobilizing a force of this quality. </p><p>Which left one obvious direction about the source of this mysterious elite force. </p><p>The Eastern Roman Empire. </p><p>“I need to find a way to inform her about that,” I murmured. I had my own problems, of course, but ultimately, there were very few people I actually cared about in this world, and despite the little time we had spent together, Theodora managed to occupy one of those spots. </p><p>Pity that sending a message back to Rome wasn’t as simple as it had been when we arranged our communication system. I would be surprised if any of the dead-drop locations we agreed upon for discrete communication actually survived the chaos. </p><p>I would have complained about that, but it would have been a tad unfair, considering the source of the chaos… </p><p>“Hopefully they would not target her directly immediately,” I murmured. The chaos was intense enough that any plan they had made to target her would have been inevitably shelved. </p><p>And, I had trusted Theodora’s capabilities enough for her to stay safe, especially since I had factored in her residence as I created the chaos, giving her the necessary time to react. </p><p>Of course, now that it was obvious that her location had been discovered, any reprieve that she would have would only be temporary. I was tempted to try returning, but considering the forces I had managed to anger, I doubted that my return would help her. </p><p>It was much more likely that any such attempt would make her situation even worse. </p><p>Yet, I had to pull myself out of that thoughts, and instead, concealed myself carefully behind the rack I had pulled for that exact purpose, hoping that it would be enough for me to stay concealed. </p><p>Not that I feared their discovery, at least in terms of the direct threat. Despite the interference of the wards, I had got a good sense of their capabilities. They were amazing… </p><p>Just not good enough to actually defeat me while I had the Spear. And the fact that I was on their ship made their situation just worse. I was on their ship, and my core was filled with boundless energy. </p><p> Even after the mediation, I wasn’t confident in my ability to cast anything delicate, but one primal blast of electricity was not out of question, targeting the ship itself. By destroying the ship, their formation would turn useless. </p><p>Unfortunately, defeating them was hardly my biggest problem, not when I had just made a mortal enemy out of the strongest family of the Republic. </p><p>I didn’t have the luxury of alerting them to my presence. </p><p>So, as a few sailors burst downstairs, I lowered my body over Xia’s, hoping that they would miss the decorative changes in the storage room doing their absence…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Ida had an uncharacteristically sharp smile on her face — even for the alter-ego she displayed while she had a camera in hand — as Irene reconnected with the floor and breathed excitedly. </p><p>“Chad, grab the ax and repeat the earlier pose,” she ordered, but she continued to look at Irene as she said so, suggesting that I wouldn’t be the target of her next move. “Irene, drop the cape.” </p><p>“W-wait,” Irene gasped, the exuberant elation she had been feeling moments earlier replaced by a fresh wave of shame as she realized the implications of replicating the earlier trick without a cape. </p><p>Too bad her friend clearly had no intention of letting Irene argue. Ida took a step forward, making Irene stumble back — which was even less successful than Ida’s earlier attempts to avoid me, as I was standing right behind her. Before she could even take a half step forward, her body hit mine. </p><p>She tensed as she felt my presence, especially my shaft, which had already reached the apex after Ida’s sloppy intervention. </p><p>Yet, that same shock cost her the only protection she had. Ida used her distraction to untie the string that was keeping the cape in place, and I leaned back slightly, letting it slide down the ground for a fleeting moment before leaning forward once again, once again making the distance between us to nothing. </p><p>This time, with one great difference. Nothing was preventing the connection between our bodies. Almost a full connection, I realized as felt her presence against my body. The bottom part of her costume was barely more than a  g-string on the back, showing that she had been relying on her cape excessively. </p><p>And, since my own loincloth was still dislodged due to Ida’s intervention — not to mention very difficult to fit properly now that it was fully awakened even if I tried to fix it— it meant the naked contact was significantly more complete than it would have been otherwise. </p><p>“C-Chad—” Irene stammered in shock, only to be interrupted. </p><p>It was Ida who interrupted her. “Smile,” she ordered as she started taking photos, the exploding flash more than enough to stagger Irene’s words for a moment. </p><p>I put my hand on Irene’s smooth belly, pulling her tight against my body as I raised the ax with my other hand, leaning against her ear. “You know what you’re feeling against you is your fault for being so sexy,” I whispered. </p><p>Which wasn’t exactly correct, as her friend had played a greater role than one might otherwise expect, but my particular weight against her body was distracting her from focusing on such little details. </p><p>Especially since Ida continued to move around us, recording every second of our excessive contact. Irene leaned against me even harder when Ida moved enough to get a glimpse of our bodies from the side, using her beautiful ass — just the right degree between tightness and plumpness — to hide my shaft. </p><p>A glance down was enough to confirm that it didn’t succeed, the crown peeking outside, visible thanks to the beautiful curve of her back, but Irene stayed unaware of that even as Ida created several pieces of photographic evidence of the scandalous nature of our pose. </p><p>A minute passed as Ida photographed us, still displaying her unique aggression, and Irene got tenser and tenser — a fact that I was able to observe easily thanks to our full-body contact. </p><p>I had expected that to be the end of that little adventure when Ida once again moved, this time standing behind us as she took photos. I loosened my grip around Irene’s waist, deciding that I had messed with her sufficiently. </p><p>And, that seemed like the correct choice as Irene used that opportunity to move forward immediately. </p><p>Key word being seemed… </p><p>She took a step forward, and I expected her to follow up with another one to increase the distance even further, escaping the room. So, it was surprising when she reached to her back and grabbed my shaft. </p><p>It was even more surprising when she used that reach to adjust my shaft so that when she took a step back, it was firmly locked in her thighs, a certain wetness caressing the topside. </p><p>Daring, I thought even as I felt surprised — though, a voice back on my head mocked me for being surprised. After everything else the rest of her little naughty group had committed, it wasn’t even enough to properly register in the list of top ten. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean she had no hope of not getting a seat on that great list. After all, she was just at her rookie debut as far as that vaunted list was concerned. </p><p>Her hips started to move, rocking back and forth, showing that she was willing to fight for it. I said nothing, enjoying the delicious pressure of her inner thighs even as she moved back and forth, creating a delicious tremble around my shaft. </p><p>She moved slowly, though I didn’t know whether it was about her self-consciousness limiting her movement speed, or an attempt to keep it hidden from Ida. </p><p>Although, if the latter was her objective, it was certainly a misguided one. Avoiding Ida’s attention might have been possible if she didn’t have the camera in hand, as she would have almost certainly failed to look at such a scene in a firm manner, but with the camera, it was much less likely. </p><p>Add in the fact that we were her models, and she was leaning up and down to immortalize our sight from many different angles, and it was impossible. </p><p>Soon, I felt Ida’s presence behind me, her hand sneaking through between my legs to caress the underside of my shaft without touching Irene, confirming my guess about her awareness. </p><p>Irene missed that fact, occupied by the sensations generated by her movements, the little scrap that was supposed to function as a skirt but barely managed to compare to a bikini bottom — while looking much sexier than one in the process — doing scarcely little to limit the sensation of touch against her core as she went back and forth subtly. </p><p>Or, in a way she thought to be subtle, as, along with her pleasure growing, her movements started to get bigger and bigger, the combined warmth of her thighs and her wet core enough to challenge my ability to keep back. </p><p>Especially with Ida’s fingers, assisting Irene’s task underneath. </p><p>It was certainly a special treat, I thought as I held back a moan, but Irene wasn’t as successful, and a soft moan escaped her mouth. “A - a cramp,” she gasped panickedly immediately after the moan left her mouth, doing her best to explain. </p><p>It was not a convincing argument, but in a way, she was lucky as success was hardly a requirement with Ida being aware of everything. </p><p>“Doesn’t matter as long as you don’t move,” Ida answered harshly. “Photos don’t capture the sound.” </p><p>“Right,” Irene answered, the earlier tenseness replaced by enthusiasm after coming to the false realization that she managed to hide her naughty trick from her friend. </p><p>She was such a special treat, I decided even as I let my hand climb upward on her body, caressing the underside of her breasts. That earned a shocked glance from her as she tried to look back, only to be interrupted by Ida. “Don’t move, you’re ruining the pose,” she said even as she pressed the shutter without caring about the target, busy caressing the base of my shaft. </p><p>“Yes, Irene, don’t move, you’re ruining the pose,” I said even as I let my fingers slip under her top — which was easy considering just how loose it was — and finally let my fingers dig into her beautiful tits. </p><p>I leaned into her ear even as I did so, and whispered. “Do you really think I wouldn’t do anything after you —“</p><p>The sentence left unfinished, but it wasn’t Irene that interrupted me, but Ida. And she did so in the form of a slap on my ass, hard enough to echo in the room and leave a soft, stinging pain behind. “Don’t change the pose.” </p><p>“As you wish, mistress,” I answered, more amused than anything at her attempt. Being dominated by such a petite example of beauty was certainly entertaining, and while Irene’s presence prevented me from retaliating immediately… </p><p>Sometimes, waiting for the dessert made a much more pleasurable experience. </p><p>We fell into a routine.</p><p>Though, considering that routine was defined by a redhead doing her best to make me cum with a thigh job while I massaged her generous breasts while an exotic petite beauty did her best to massage the areas that were left untouched by the redhead to complete the sensation, it was certainly not a routine that could be classified as boring. </p><p>A few minutes later, just as I was about to be convinced that it would be the limit of our little adventure, things took an interesting turn. The first move came from Irene, in the form of her hands slipping under her little loincloth. I expected her to tease the head of my shaft or something similar, but she chose to pull the little portion that was between my shaft and her core, preventing direct contact. Although its wetness had compromised its ability significantly, it was still a barrier, and the direct touch was certainly amazing. </p><p>And, with that gone, Irene’s hips got more unbridled, the motion getting large enough that the head of my shaft started rubbing against her entrance at its apex. Of course, that meant that even the illusion of keeping her movement hidden was gone, but she was just too far gone to notice that. </p><p>Yet, that was just the setup. The real surprise came from Ida, who had noticed exactly what was going on, her body getting tenser at Irene’s daring as it challenged her authority — which I could feel very intensely as her body was still pushing against mine. </p><p>I prepared myself against Ida’s intervention, not willing to go with whatever little payback her little devious mind was developing. </p><p>She managed to surprise me, and rather than trying to push me, she reached around me and grabbed Irene’s hips, pulling them before we could react, choosing the perfect moment to do so… </p><p>Irene was too busy moaning at the sudden invasion to say anything about that, finding herself halfway skewered by my shaft — a rather explosive start as her first time, making me glad that we had been going through a very extended foreplay to loosen her. </p><p>Ida’s surprises were yet to be over, and before we could react, she walked around us once more, her camera raised. “I told you not to move too much,” she said, acting like what happened was just an accident. </p><p>“Now, let’s continue with the shoot.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>However, before cutting loose, I first wanted to make sure I had an actual observer. </p><p>Luckily, the increasing number of warriors gave me the excuse to make a ‘mistake’. One of the new warriors charged from behind while I was busy parrying the ax of the first warrior, ‘failing’ to notice his presence until too late. </p><p>I jumped off the air elemental to avoid him, but that only made me lose my mobility while I rolled on the ground, making the six surround  me. </p><p>“No,” I shouted desperately, with a beautiful acting that would have earned me a leading role in a theater troupe even as I pointed toward my fake elemental mount. </p><p>[-182 Mana]</p><p>I didn’t spend much mana, but with all of the elemental mana already in the structure of my mount, the results were still truly spectacular. A storm exploded, dispersing the ones that surrounded me like the leaves in the wind. </p><p>I wasn’t an exception. </p><p>[-72 HP]</p><p>Rolling on the ground  was not a pleasant feeling, though the damage it created was little more than a mosquito bite for me. Of course, the same applied to my enemies as well, showing they received a negligible damage and a temporary mobility effect.</p><p>What a waste of three thousand mana I sank into creating that elemental. </p><p>Luckily, damaging them was not my aim was in the first place. The reckless explosion was just an excuse to disperse my mana, and three thousand mana was enough to create an ever-expanding circle until it reached the barrier. </p><p>Enough to turn it into a detection spell as I maintained my connection. </p><p>Yet, the result was enough to put a frown in my face. I sensed almost another two dozen warriors rushing toward me, and another dozen that felt like mages were already closing in from south. </p><p>They were really prepared to take me down. </p><p>Yet, the presence of that impressive army didn’t alarm me what I felt from Northeast side. Or, more accurately, what I didn’t feel. </p><p>There was absolutely no feedback, like my mana suddenly disappeared. It wasn’t that they were strong, as the other dozen mages had the sufficient strength to accomplish that as well. </p><p>But they didn’t care about that, uncaring of the outcome, while the unknown at the Northeast didn’t share their lack of concern, suggesting something more than a near-berserk warrior. </p><p>I couldn’t help but frown even as I started building the initial nodes of a defensive ward. It was clearly a trap to push myself to my limits, and I needed the time given to me by the  wards. </p><p>I needed to decide which abilities to reveal first, and I needed to see if I could save myself without confronting the others. I hoped that, if I could display a sufficient level of ordinary ability, they might decide that I was harmless. </p><p>Was that likely? Certainly not, but compared to revealing my more dangerous abilities, like teleportation, it was still the better option — at least, as far as I could contemplate while constructing a ward that could temporarily hold back two dozen warriors around level forty. </p><p>Even the speed of thinking boosted by Intelligence and Wisdom had its limits. </p><p>The first warrior had already arrived at the edge when I managed to establish the first layer of the ward, and it was the same warrior that initially charged forward, putting his speed advantage to great use. </p><p>Since the environment was already blanketed with my mana, I decided to take a risk and reach to his soul space, though I kept the mana stab very weak. </p><p>[-9 Mana]</p><p>Only to be rebuffed, finding their soul space protected. Maybe I should have been surprised too much by the result, as I knew for a fact the Eternals were aware of the full potential of Soul Space. It only made sense for them to try and protect it. </p><p>I ignored that, and focused on the dangers of his immediate rush, and its dangerous tactical implications. </p><p>Or, from a strategic view, a terrible use, as it once again left him alone without support, though that didn’t change the fact that every swing of his ax was damaging the ward greatly. </p><p>I was considering the best way to handle him when my gaze fell down to his weapon, its handle filled with Eternal gems. </p><p>Delivering me the perfect excuse to set up a truly impressive ward. </p><p>He swung his ax once more, hitting the ward squarely, breaking through its protection with a single solid attack as I stopped shifting the ward to minimize the damage. Yet, as he toppled forward, he didn’t expect the ward to close on him, immobilizing it.</p><p>Meanwhile, I flared my mana once more, enhancing my sword to the limit with earth mana well past its limit, enough to ruin it completely. </p><p>[-1307 Mana]</p><p>Yet, it gave me one empowered swing, which resulted in a devastating effect with my opponent’s overextended state. </p><p>When he pulled back, he didn’t have any arm. </p><p>I smirked as I kicked his arms away, and grabbed my real target, his ax. I let my mana invade the ax, giving myself a second to examine the weapon, expecting it to be the most exquisite weapon I had ever touched. </p><p>[+5 Craft ]</p><p>It was wondrous, the complicated yet robust at the same time, showing many enhancements that was actually above my current capability to even understand, let alone actually replicate. </p><p>At least not without months and months of effort. </p><p>It was filled with many intricate abilities that made it a legitimate threat against me if it had been used by someone that used it as a club — which was an exaggeration, I admitted, as while my enemy was berserk, he still had enhancement of at least one legendary skilll. </p><p>But without strategic thought behind to leverage some of the situational abilities hidden in its structure, it wasn’t enough to truly threaten me. </p><p>Amusingly, I still felt that it was somehow lesser than Aviada’s sword, which was rather interesting. Unfortunately, since I had been lacking Craft when I last used that sword, I wasn’t sure whether it was the fault of my memories. </p><p>I would have loved to spend days examining intricacies of the weapon, confident that it would bring me to a new height of understanding with craft. </p><p>Which was the reason of my feelings of pity as I destroyed  it with a flare my mana, dislodging all the Eternal gems studded along its structure. Destruction was always easier than creation, especially when it came to such a weapon. </p><p>[+10 Craft]</p><p>The great boost to a master level skill it generated just by dismantling it showed the true intricacy of the weapon, which made its eventual fate an even bigger pity.</p><p>As I destroyed it, I felt a flare of mana at the Northeast, one that carried tinges of anger, which contrasted interestingly with the non-reaction when I managed to cut the arms of his soldier. His sense of priorities was rather interesting. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t a huge reaction, one that I could never feel if it wasn’t for my mana, still dispersed along the field covered by the ward, giving me superior detection. </p><p>I wished that I had the time to focus enjoying my mysterious ambusher’s misfortune, but I had a more important thing to focus on first. </p><p>The ward around me. I was reluctant to push for a more defensive strategy, but I noticed my attackers slowing down after the initial burst of anger I felt from the distance, showing sudden  signs of organization. </p><p>I didn’t need to wonder about the reason, as I could feel the subtle connection extending from the Northeast. </p><p>Breaking the weapon was clearly a bigger deal than I had expected. </p><p>As I started constructing the first ward over the initial protective layer I created, I paid attention to the unlucky warrior with no arms, expecting him to join the rest. Although he had been harmed greatly, he just required the assistance of a healer to join the battle fresh. </p><p>Yet, he didn’t join, as there was no thread of mana toward him. I wondered whether my mysterious enemy just wrote him off. </p><p>Or maybe, I thought as I turned to the distance, and noticing the mana strings didn’t connect directly to the warrior but their weapons instead, he had a different reason for that anger. </p><p>I decided to pull another trick, and took the risk of reaching to the soul space of the unfortunate warrior. </p><p>I didn’t find anything I didn’t expect.

    "content": "<p>Fight or flight, those were my hard-to-choose options, I found myself thinking even as I turned my attention to my closest enemy, a warrior decked in full armor, carrying an ax larger than himself, running toward me with a shocking speed. </p><p>A speed that was impossible for me to replicate even with my admittedly incredible stats. </p><p>Yet, as he got close enough to avoid the overwhelming presence of the wards, enough to get me a sense of his mana. It was still too far away to actually get a glimpse of his soul space, nor I wanted to spend the necessary mana to break through at such great distance — especially since I wasn’t confident in keeping that hidden — but the sensation of his mana left no doubt about the state of his soul space.  </p><p>It was a raging disaster, almost like a beast. He was not berserk, like the other recruits I watched while I was saving Janelor, but he wasn’t too far away from getting that point either. </p><p>At a distance, I could see two other warriors, their status not particularly superior as they rushed forward, marginally slower. </p><p>Their rush was desperate, lacking any kind of coordination, which contrasted greatly with the excellent timing of the initial ward.</p><p>“Fight, it is,” I murmured as I watched their reckless assault. The ambush required a certain amount of planning, which was impossible to be delivered by the three I could see. I didn’t want to try to escape, only to be blocked completely. </p><p>There was always teleportation as the last resort, especially since I was confident enough to punch through the wards blocking it — but that was literally my last card. If they didn’t know I could teleport, I didn’t want to reveal it, and if they actually discovered it — as I used it against the undead — I didn’t want to use it before making sure they didn’t have a strategy against it. </p><p>Either way. I preferred to keep it hidden for now.  </p><p>As soon as the first warrior moved within my effective casting range, I cast a wall of fire to block his path. Not the strongest or most damaging spell, but damaging enough as an opening spell, flashy enough to look impressive, without spending much mana. </p><p>[-181 Mana]</p><p>The warrior swung his ax, the resulting wind destroying the ward easily, resulting from the weapon he was carrying flaring with magic. His chaotic mana wasn’t enough to activate such a trick — as his stats were clearly focused on the physical side — but the handle of the ax was glistening with a shocking number of Eternal Gems, giving a good idea about the power source. </p><p>The Eternals were certainly rich, I noted, remembering how happy I was when I acquired a few, a treasure that I was yet to use. </p><p>I was impressed by their richness, but not enough to let the warrior approach freely. I responded with another elemental spell, this time a rain of icicles, rushing through the air. </p><p>[-130 Mana]</p><p>Another weak spell, but surprisingly damaging against a single target as the icicles were perfectly shaped thanks to my extraordinary control and constant practice — not to mention, replicating a rotating effect to enhance damage. </p><p>The disadvantage, it was easy to dodge, and even easier to block. All my attacker needed was to take a step back to avoid the trajectory. He certainly had the speed to do it. </p><p>Yet, the only thing he did was raise his ax to protect his face, letting the ice rain on his armor without skipping a step. “Maybe he misread the spell,” I wondered even as I waved my hand again, sending another, stronger wave of ice.</p><p>[-310 Mana]</p><p>Yet, he repeated the same move, ignoring the destruction of the armor and his own blood. His berserk status was not limited to his mana state. </p><p>Ironically, that reckless assault, which would have been an amazing development against a weaker candidate, made it harder to fight against them. It would have been easier fighting against a berserk warrior if he was alone, but the other two were about to join, and I could feel more than a dozen following. </p><p>And there were still nearer to the ward, but the interference of the ward prevented me from detecting it. </p><p>If they were perfectly rational, I could have controlled their attack by showing my ability to destroy the initial attackers, forcing the rest to consider it slowly. It would have given me the time I needed to regenerate mana. </p><p>Unfortunately, that strategy was ineffective against a bunch of berserkers. </p><p>Of course, their recklessness and their clear willingness to take damage opened many other ways to deal with them — but it would require me to both spend a lot of mana, and reveal a lot of my magical tricks. </p><p>Tricks that I needed against whoever would follow the first wave. </p><p>“Melee it is,” I murmured as I draw my sword, ready to meet with the attacker physically despite his physical superiority. I rather reveal my physical abilities than my magical abilities this early into what was clearly a siege. </p><p>The moment he arrived in front of me, his ax swung with a shocking speed, one that I would have no chance of reacting to if I tried to react to his speed. </p><p>But that didn’t apply to reading him. Before the ax could cover the distance halfway, my sword was already on its path, covered with earth mana to enhance its endurance. Even then, I didn’t dare to meet his swing halfway, and parried carefully. </p><p>Yet, with his full weight behind the swing, the soft parry was enough to imbalance him, giving me an easy stab through his eye, pushing the blade hard enough to dig into his eye, but before I could push in fully, a kick hit my chest, pushing me away. </p><p>[-13 HP]</p><p>The elemental I had been riding showed its advantage, as a mental order was enough to pull me back, preventing the damage from a kick that would have killed a level fifteen warrior with one touch. </p><p>All the while making it look like I had received substantial damage — one that I reinforced by using Biomancy to show my HP depleting — to give the impression that their plan was working.</p><p>Unfortunately, while a sword halfway into his skull would have been enough to kill almost anyone, a warrior in his high thirties — or maybe even forties — with some monstrous stats to support, was one of those rare exceptions. </p><p>His HP energy rushed to the wound, quickly reducing the blood loss as the wound disappeared, though the eye stayed destroyed. </p><p>Even at that level, HP had its limitations without healing spells to assist. </p><p>Yet, the loss of an eye didn’t delay him more than a second as he rushed forward, his ax cutting through the air once more, forcing my prediction to the limit as I parried once again, delivering another counter-attack that would have been deadly for a weaker opponent. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised that my opponent didn’t fall after my move, as even if they didn’t have any additional trick, I calculated his HP to be well over ten thousand, likely breaching twenty thousand. </p><p>It required more than a couple well-placed sword hits to actually die, probably in the range of dozens, maybe even hundreds. I wasn’t annoyed by it, as if I truly wanted to kill the reckless warrior with no apparent magical defenses, I had better options. </p><p>Such as tricking him into a ward to lock his movement, and bombarding him with fire spells. </p><p>Or, if I was feeling particularly merciless, using Necrotic energy. </p><p>If there was one benefit to my confrontation with Zokras, that it taught me how fragile was HP against necrotic energy. Even those little pesky liches were enough to destroy hundreds of HP with one hit. And while they wouldn’t have the same effect against the man in front of me due to his stronger Endurance…</p><p>I wasn’t as weak as them either. </p><p>Yet, it wasn’t just the disgusting sensation of copying that energy that prevented me from relying on that. I didn’t want to reveal my trump cards that easily.</p><p>His HP might not be a real barrier, but I still made a show of disbelief while leveraging my Subterfuge to the limit. “How are you still alive,” I gasped in disbelief, showing any potential observer that I was far from truly understanding what I was facing. </p><p>Yet, before I could deliver another stab, the other two caught up to us, and joined the attack. They didn’t coordinate at all, showing that they lacked even the instinctual battle sense of beasts. I didn’t need to check their soul spaces to know that they were about to go completely berserk. </p><p>Unfortunately, with their abilities, their lack of coordination didn’t matter as much as I would have liked, especially with their recklessness that made them perfectly willing to take damage to deliver one in turn. </p><p>Even with my perception and martial abilities pushed to the limit, I was overwhelmed quickly, and forced to rely on the mobility of the air elemental to avoid the bulk of the damage, though I still received some simple wounds</p><p>[-84 HP]</p><p>Wounds that I exaggerated in appearance with an unusual application of healing magic to give the impression that I was already pushed to the limit, hoping that it would allow revealing whoever was responsible for the ambush. </p><p>But, whoever they were, they stayed silent even as the other warriors reached me, their numbers reaching half a dozen. </p><p>It was time to push the situation a notch. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7153 / 7334 Mana: 8284 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [118/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [100/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Against a majestic phoenix looking angrily, most would have felt fear above anything, and the rare few that could suppress that fear would still play it safe, anxious to prevent an explosive reaction — a reaction that Cinder was clearly capable of, both in terms of power and in terms of attitude. </p><p>I chose to go in a different direction. </p><p>“Is there anything I can do to help you, sweetie?” I asked, only to receive a loud cry in response. I wasn’t sure whether calling it a shout was the correct term, as it wasn’t particularly loud in terms of the sound it created. </p><p>However, it was different in terms of mana. The cry wasn’t accompanied by the living fire directly, but it still carried a metaphorical sense of pressure that hit every single construct in range,  including the wards that surrounded us, making them tremble badly. </p><p>I intervened to maintain them, but if it wasn’t for the Tether allowing me to control the wards, they would have collapsed regardless. </p><p>Another interesting ability of the transformation, one that she was clearly unaware of, but that didn’t save her from punishment. </p><p>“You need to learn to wait for your turn,” I said even as I raised my hand, casting chains of ice. They were beautiful, intricate constructs, with no chance of surviving against her heat. </p><p>But when I combined with reaching our connection to block her mana flow, the combination worked much better. </p><p>Her flames suddenly dissipated, leaving her blinking in shock. Even her wings had disappeared, leaving her hair as the only source of flame on her body. Which meant my trick also doubled as a convenient experiment, showing that I had the ability to block a full transformation as well. </p><p>Which was nice to know, but I didn’t focus on that. Not when her beautiful naked body was completely on display as the chains of ice wrapped around her limbs, immobilizing her. </p><p>“But —“ she started, but even as she tried to answer, I cast another small spell, blocking her mouth with an ice gag. Her beautiful eyes widened in shock as I smirked at her, then looked down to Isolde, who was doing her best to recover from her recent climax.</p><p>But, her expression of pleasure wasn’t just one of carnal joy, growing more intense as her gaze fell on Cinder. Isolde was happy to see that she wasn’t the only one that was the target of my punishments. </p><p>“A good way to punish a mage,” she said as she held my arm and pulled herself up, strong enough to balance herself despite her trembling legs. </p><p>Her words didn’t surprise me. “Well, technically, she’s not a mage, but something else,” I suggested. Not that I expected Isolde to care much about the distinction. </p><p>Isolde shrugged as she turned toward me, showing my guess was accurate. I chuckled even as she wrapped her arms around my waist, showing an uncharacteristic forwardness. Normally, she was happier passively accepting my invasion. </p><p>But the possibility of punishing a mage was enough for her to ignore her preferences. </p><p>I had no doubt that it was more about punishing Cinder, because even as she hugged me, she made me turn so that she could look at Cinder directly. </p><p>I let her succeed, knowing that Isolde could anger her much more than I could, which worked excellently as a punishment. </p><p>I still created a small mirror so that I could watch Cinder’s expression — partially to enjoy the show, partially to make sure I didn’t push her too much. </p><p>Punishing her was a delicate affair, due to a beautiful combination of her sense of entitlement, her underlying complex of inferiority, and her beautiful newly discovered submissiveness. </p><p>“Someone is feeling frisky,” I whispered to Isolde’s ear as she rubbed her hips against mine, her monumental wetness showing that, no matter how much she enjoyed punishing Cinder, it was just a side benefit to the main event. </p><p>“I — I just want to punish her,” she stammered, not wanting to confront her own pleasure. </p><p>I chuckled. “So, that means you’re hating what we are doing, right? Maybe I should stop, it’s not right to push you just to punish her.” </p><p>Her hands dug into my shoulders painfully, showing just how much she disagreed with the idea. “N-no need,” she stammered cutely. “I’m willing to help.” </p><p>“Oh, such a helpful little warrior, I’m so lucky,” I whispered, even as I grabbed her hips and lifted, impaling her with one smooth motion. Cinder’s eyes widened beautifully as she realized the extent of the show she was going to suffer, tugging her chains to free herself. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, without the enhancements given to her by the living fire, she lacked the strength to free herself from the chains, making her suffer the punishment. </p><p>But, since I wasn’t completely evil, I had made sure to leave a little range of movement around her legs, allowing her to move her legs enough to rub them against each other. </p><p>It didn’t take long for her to discover that, doing exactly that to control her arousal, showing that being punished — even in such a distant manner — was not without its perks. </p><p>“Faster,” Isolde murmured, who had been doing her best to quicken the treatment, only to be prevented by my grip around her hips, slowing her down. </p><p>“Why,” I whispered. “Isn’t it just to punish her. The slower we go, the better.” </p><p>“Right,” she murmured, her reluctance beautiful as she slowed down. But she managed to slow down only a few seconds before her hips burst into action once more, picking up speed. </p><p>Only to be stopped by my grip once again. “Slow down,” I ordered, but I kept my tone playful rather than delivering it as a steely statement, amused by her chosen form of rebellion. </p><p>She once again followed that order, though that only lasted until I shifted one of my hands, letting it climb up, trailing her spine as it climbed up, pushing her arousal to a new level with contrast. </p><p>She let out a moan as she pushed her hips down once more, this time experiencing greater success as she competed against only one hand. </p><p>I let her succeed momentarily as I once again turned my attention to Cinder, who was watching the show with growing frustration, her gaze bouncing between head level and waist level.</p><p>After adding a second mirror to see what was going on at my back, it didn’t take long to identify the source of her anger. Isolde was looking directly at her, her smile as vicious as it was wide. </p><p>I had to give her credit. Maintaining that expression was difficult with her face invaded with pleasure. Luckily for her, the intensity of the pleasure just helped to drive Cinder’s anger deeper, enough for me to feel a tug of her magic despite the block I was maintaining. </p><p>Her attempt to reach against that was intense, but the block held, which was another useful thing to learn about our connection. Whatever that was, it was nowhere as simple as I assumed.</p><p>Another nice unexpected bonus. </p><p>I let her continue a while more, letting Cinder’s anger climb even higher. Isolde was not the best when it came to understanding others’ moods or manipulating them, but luckily for her, Cinder was not the best in hiding them either, giving her the feedback she needed. </p><p>I let my finger caress back down as she continued to pick up speed, my earlier warning about staying silent completely forgotten. I let her act freely for a moment, rewarding her for her success to annoy Cinder.</p><p>Especially when Isolde’s mocking victory was much more effective than any punishment I could come up with for the bound beauty, her anger building into frustration as the desperate rubbing of her legs was nowhere near bringing her where she wanted to go. </p><p>But as Isolde’s moans started to get more and more intense, I decided to intervene. “What did I tell you about the speed, sweetie?” I warned her, but she acted like she didn’t hear that, letting her hips dance even more intensely as she searched for the climax. </p><p>The moan that she let out threatened to overwhelm the meadow. </p><p>I might have accepted her disobedience considering how close she was to a climax, but I never had been particularly forgiving. </p><p>“Maybe I should stop, if you’re not going to listen to my words,” I whispered. </p><p>“No,” she gasped as panic invaded her tone, her legs tightening around my waist desperately. But that was still enough for her to reduce her speed to an acceptable level, which, at this point, worked perfectly as a punishment.  </p><p>I smirked, enjoying the unique feeling of punishing two girls at the same time, all without sacrificing even the slightest from my own pleasure.</p><p>Sometimes, life was truly beautiful. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I approached the parking lot, I realized that I might have created an even bigger event than I had first predicted. The parking space was crowded. Not full as it was the game night, but still enough that I would have struggled to find a parking spot for myself if I wasn’t using reserved parking. </p><p>The crowd started even before I arrived at the locker room, however. Three of the offensive linemen stood in the corridor, loitering, ready to block my path. </p><p>I just smirked as I walked toward them, not even skipping a step as I closed the distance. They turned toward me, looking at me sharply. I could read their reaction enough that they were playing mind games with no intention of following. </p><p>Though, as I walked, I hid my frown. After the fight, they should have known that I was not the one to pull away from the fight. One of them even had a blackened eye to prove that. </p><p>Then, I noticed their position, right under one of the cameras, and I realized. They didn’t want to fight. They wanted me to start one, right under a security camera. </p><p>Smart. </p><p>Too bad I had no intention of allowing them to succeed. Before even reaching them, I noticed a few defensive players dashing toward me from a corner, no doubt to help me. I gave them the signal to stop. It was a football signal, enough to trigger their habit of listening. </p><p>They looked confused while I continued walking. I stood in front of the offensive as they blocked my path, sneering threateningly. </p><p>Before they could even react, I pulled out my phone and started speaking. “Hi guys, too bad that Kevin is cowardly enough to send thugs to keep me away,” I started. The widening of their eyes was amusing as they beat a hasty retreat. </p><p>“Coward,” mumbled the one with the black eye, only to be replaced with a blush as I turned my phone toward them, revealing it wasn’t recording. </p><p>There was no need to make too big of an enemy out of the offensive players by humiliating them publicly too much, especially the ones that were going to be tasked with my protection if I succeeded in my ploy. </p><p>That was the limit of the chaos I created as I reached the locker room, only to find it filled with defensive players. Interestingly, there were no offensive players. </p><p>“You’re almost late,” Marcus, one of the cornerbacks, and the most senior member of the team after almost a dozen players departed with Coach Bill said. I noted that he was already wearing gloves. </p><p>“There’s no such thing as almost late,” I said with a shrug. “There’s late, and right on time.” </p><p>It earned only laughter from the rest. “It’s a waste of time. You can’t defeat a nerd with words,” said someone, but it lacked the derogatory weight it carried the week before. It seemed that my performance in the match, combined with the show I put in during the fight, managed to earn their allegiance. </p><p>Enough that, even when I declared a seemingly unfitting challenge, they decided to stand behind me rather than trying to make a mess. </p><p>“So, you’re willing to face me on the field,” I said as I turned him, looking in mock anger. </p><p>“Fuck no,” the answer came in an instant, and the locker room filled with laughter once more. A little forced, considering the mood had been extremely low as not only we lost Coach Bill, who was the only thing that was keeping Coach Spencer’s idiotic trips away, but also several of our best players were gone.</p><p>The absence of Carter and Thad, in particular, left a gap that required a miracle to solve. </p><p>Luckily for them, I had several miracles in my pocket, ready to be launched and leveraged. I quickly changed into my uniform while the rest of the team chattered, then, I started walking. </p><p>The rest of the defense followed, like we were an army ready to go to war. A hopeless war, one that required a miracle to win. </p><p>Luckily for them, I had a handy miracle dispenser buried in my soul, even if it came together with a rather dubious user manual. </p><p>When we arrived at the field, the nearest seats were already filled, and most of them gathered the side of the offense, which was holding the side we would have used if it was an official match. </p><p>Interestingly, the full practice squad was there on their side as well, which created a great crowd.</p><p>Leaving the place of the visitor to the team to us. Which was a strong message, especially since Coach Spencer was in the middle of the team, surrounded by the full cadre of his offensive assistant coaches, almost reaching twenty. </p><p>The situation on the other side was rather more deficient. Only three people waited for us. I recognized Coach Juana among them. “What happened?” I asked Marcus. </p><p>“Coach Spencer decided to make a reorganization effort, and fired anyone hired by Coach Bill, or supported him,” he explained. </p><p>No matter if he was that somber. </p><p>“Such a smart decision,” I said as I snorted in disdain. I had known Coach Spencer was incompetent, but he still managed to surprise me with the full extent of his incompetence, acting like a dictator, and cleaning every candidate. </p><p>I wished that I had the luxury of standing back and watching the intensity of the pyre he would create without Coach Bill to reign in him. </p><p>Pity the shadow assassins that attacked me created an unfortunate urgency. </p><p>When I arrived at their side, one of the other Coaches, another conditioning coach, stepped forward. The body language of Coach Juana showed she didn’t appreciate it, but she said nothing. </p><p>I owed her for creating extra work for her, so ignored him and turned to her instead. “What’s the situation, Coach?” I asked. </p><p>The man looked dissatisfied, but he lacked the confidence to push as several defensive players slotted themselves in between, showing that I wasn’t the only one who recognized the attempted coup. </p><p>And, since my preference was clear, they just followed it. </p><p>“Oh, our great head coach decided, in his infinite wisdom, a simple challenge is not enough to show the caliber of the players, and a true quarterback needed to fight against great odds.” </p><p>“Oh, how interesting,” I said, while the rest of the defense started to shift enthusiastically, enthusiastic enough to put the offense in its place. </p><p>However, my elation didn’t last long, because Coach Juana only frowned more at our enthusiasm. “What’s the catch,” I asked. </p><p>“Coach Spencer wants it to be a fair battle, so instead of offense and defense alternating, or putting both of you on command of the same team, he decided that both teams will run against the practice squad defense.” </p><p>The number of curses rising from the rest was not unfounded. The amount of effort each player put to learn their role was immense. The defense was clearly willing to play offense, and confident that they would win against the offense trying to reverse the role. </p><p>However, trying to match the offense with their own expertise was much more difficult. Our offense was underperforming. </p><p>Just not that much. </p><p>The fact that we were both going to run against the practice squad defense, which was under Coach Spencer’s orders, made it even more unfair. </p><p>I glanced toward the offensive side, only to see Coach Spencer actually looking toward me. It was too far to accurately see his expression, but his posture left no doubt about his childish enjoyment. </p><p>He was like a little boy, proud of his win despite using maphacks. </p><p>Such a childish man. </p><p>Luckily, I was already determined to crush him until he get kicked out of the school. </p><p>But first, I needed to attend to my team, who was getting angry. I raised my hand, and ordered, doing my best to tap into Leadership and Intimidation at the same time. “Silence!” </p><p>It was not a shout, but worked much better than if I tried to shout. “It doesn’t matter,” I said as I turned toward them. “No matter what they do, even the worst of us is better than the best of them, and we can win,” I said. </p><p>“Yes,” they cheered, though their forced enthusiasm told me that they didn’t believe in victory, they wanted not to make too much of a mess in the process. </p><p>“Now, we just need to decide on our strategy,” I said as I turned toward Coach Juana… </p>",

    "content": "<p>If there was one benefit to having my own channel, it allowed me to manipulate the perception of people easily. </p><p>I returned to my dorm, picked a few balls and my laptop, and found myself an empty field, with some conveniently distant targets.</p><p>That time had been enough for Kevin to make another video, accepting the challenge, and turning it into a beautiful controversy. Especially since Megan, ever the opportunist, created a beautiful collage from our fight and posted that underneath, further inflaming the people. </p><p>Before I could make a single throw, however, I received a call from an unknown number. </p><p>I opened, only to hear the familiar voice of Coach Spencer. “What are you doing, you arrogant shit,” he started. One of the strongest men on the campus due to his role, and his riches making him even more important. </p><p>Not a man to cross under ordinary conditions. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the shadow attack, I would have either closed the phone immediately, or acted a bit innocent. Instead, I took a deep breath, tapping into the fear of being assassinated — one that was stiff and fresh in my mind — and reflected that as cold, intimidating anger. </p><p>Conditions were far from normal. </p><p>“Look, little man,” I growled, my voice cold. “I have more important things to cater to your overgrown ego. You either keep your little mouth shut, or I’ll give you a painful lesson about how to behave.” </p><p>“Y-you,” he stammered, showing, even through the phone, the intimidation worked excellently. “I’m the coach—“ he tried to add, but that was the limit of his word before I could say anything. </p><p>“Do you want to test how good you can coach with broken legs?” I said before slamming the phone close, not wanting to deal with him anymore. </p><p>Was that ill-advised, certainly, but I was already doing my best to hold on. Two supernatural assassination attempts didn’t put me in a peachy mood, and I had more important things to optimize my approach toward Coach Spencer. </p><p>I ignored the potential disaster on the horizon, and focused back on my little experiment. I continued setting up targets, and started making a show of throwing the ball. </p><p>I was not a total newbie when it came to passing, but most of my practice had been limited to middle school, until the coaches realized that while I had the necessary visual acumen and arm strength, I had been severely lacking in accuracy. </p><p>It was good that I was not live streaming but recording individual videos to create a collage. </p><p>“Let’s warm up,” I murmured as I sling several passes, which went with all the accuracy of a shotgun. The act of throwing the ball looked simple, but it was deceptively so. Throwing a ball sixty yards was not a simple affair, and required a perfect twist of the whole body, generating and transferring momentum, starting from the legs. </p><p>In a way, similar to throwing a full-strength punch, which I was very good at. Unfortunately, it was only because punches only needed to be accurate in one-yard range, not sixty, which explained why my passes turned into great disasters. </p><p>I was not the one to be dissuaded by short-term failure even without the assistance of the Traits. Agility helped me to learn the correct movement faster, allowing me to progress more than I would have normally shown in a month in less than half an hour. </p><p>Though, the role of Strength was hard to underestimate, as thanks to its general assistance, it allowed me to throw the ball more than fifty yards without pushing myself to the limit. </p><p>And, not pushing myself to the limit meant I was much more accurate. It was like trying to walk through a tightrope. Difficult, certainly, but not as difficult as trying to run on the same tightrope. </p><p>“It’s time to push myself,” I murmured even as I went and collected the balls, and placed a target in the forty-feet range, distant, not too far away. </p><p>At first, barely one in twenty hit the target, even when I was throwing some simple bullet passes mid-range, with all the benefits of Agility and  Strength. </p><p>Luckily, I was just trying to pick the best shoots. I took every video separately. After I had ten decent passes them was ready — all shirtless to also impress the part of the campus that wasn’t as interested in football skills — I called Kim. </p><p>“Hey, handsome,” she said as I opened it. </p><p>“I need your help,” I said even as I transferred the videos to her. </p><p>“I’ll say,” Kim answered, her tone deliciously frustrated as she realized it was not a booty call. “A girl might feel neglected if you only call her when you need something.” </p><p>“Well, help me, and I’ll spend a full day making that up to you after the next match,” I said. Then, I chuckled. “Assuming you can resist more than an hour, of course.” </p><p>Her gasp was beautiful, but luckily, it wasn’t an impediment for her to continue speaking. “What do you need?” </p><p>“I sent you a bunch of videos, and I need an impressive video put together. I’m sure you can handle that.” </p><p>“I’m not a video expert…” she started and paused, no doubt to quickly go through the videos. “Lucky for you, it’s not too hard to create one. When do you need it?” </p><p>“Ten minutes ago,” I said with a cheeky tone. </p><p>“You’re lucky you’re handsome,” Kim murmured in frustration as she ended the call. I didn’t bother trying to call her and ask for confirmation whether she would work on the subject or not. Her personality might be prickly, but her professionalism was never in doubt.  </p><p>I continued practicing, and ten minutes later, my phone buzzed with a message from her. ‘Give me some time if you need something decent, but it should be workable,’ it read. </p><p>I whistled in appreciation as I watched the video, transitioning through one scene to another with a smoothness that wouldn’t look bad in an actual movie, with colors and contrasted enhanced. </p><p>Much better than I expected in ten minutes. Her skills were impressive, even more than I had given her credit for. </p><p>I posted the video, and didn’t bother checking the responses, just continued practicing. I didn’t have too much time to waste. </p><p>Especially since I had a better way of measuring the effect than the likes and comments. I felt the Intent flowing intensely once more. I paused for a second, closing my eyes as I channeled as much as I could to the System. </p><p>As the benefit of the controversy, the Intent came in a big wave, allowing me to channel a sufficient amount of it to the System before my Guide devoured the rest.  </p><p> And, I received my reward.  </p><p>[Precision I, Acquired]</p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured as I continued to throw the ball, and suddenly, hitting half of my attempts rather than a fraction of it. </p><p>Cheating in life was fun. </p><p>I paused after the flow of Intent diminished, checking the comments. Despite the Intent it managed to generate, most of the comments were negative, treating it as empty bragging, rightfully mentioning that those passes were not consequential, but just samples. </p><p>The offensive players, in particular, were quite active, insulting the defensive players, who felt duty-bound to come to my help. </p><p>Luckily, enough gullible people were affected by their argument — or at least, my shirtless upper body — to give me the Trait I desperately needed for my gambit. </p><p>“It’s time for the second video,” I said as I started attacking the target in bursts of ten passes. After a dozen tries, I finally had a video that I had managed to hit all ten of them. Another quick message to Kim, and I had a second, even more beautiful video. </p><p>Which changed the discussion about my skills, intensifying the fight even more as the defensive players retaliated. </p><p>More importantly, gave me another reward, one that actually turned me into a passable quarterback. </p><p>[Precision II, acquired]</p><p>I would have loved to repeat that trick again with a third video, but I held back for one important reason. </p><p>I didn’t want to scare Kevin from the competition. It would hurt his reputation, but nowhere as much as actually losing the competition, and even the second video only looked like the last-minute attempt for me to create an excuse. </p><p>So that I could claim I wasn’t playing particularly well when I inevitably lost. </p><p>Kevin was in for a nasty surprise. </p><p>However, the Trait itself wasn’t enough to guarantee my victory. Incremental improvements were useful, but only because I had the capability. More practice was necessary. </p><p>So, I practiced until it was time to leave. As stepped onto my new car, I called Megan. “Do you think we can bully Coach Spencer to take a leave of absence if some embarrassing communication about him came to light?” I asked immediately. </p><p>“You don’t do things halfway, do you?” Megan asked, though I didn’t miss the fascination in her tone. </p><p>A girl of my own mind. </p><p>I just chuckled. </p><p>“Maybe, if some kind of blunder comes out about him, a big one,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that,” I said with a chuckle, my mind already on how to create one. </p><p>But that was a task for the evening. </p><p>Before, I had a coup to complete. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Another man might have felt guilty creating an illusion of cheating to convince a sexy Asian beauty lying underneath them to take that last fateful step… </p><p>There was no shortage of idiots, I always believed. </p><p>After all, the only thing that made that an illusion of cheating rather than the reality was the lack of ability on Charlie’s part. The way he had responded to Brenda’s fake advances showed that he would have no problems actually taking that step forward — and while I assumed he wouldn’t have been stupid enough to do so next to his fiancee without the assistance of the alcohol, I wasn’t particularly sure after his performance. </p><p>As I watched Umi wrap her petite hands around my hips, trying to pull me forward, I had no problem taking that final step. “Are you sure?” I asked, though only because I was sure of the answer I would receive. </p><p>The first rule of business, never to ask a question with an uncertain answer. </p><p>Of course, just because the answer was certain didn’t mean it was immediate. Umi froze as my question hit, the pressure of my presence over her core made the question even heavier. I was curious just how long her decision would have taken. </p><p>So, it was a pity when Brenda shouted once more. “Oh, you’re so big! Harder!” </p><p>Umi said nothing, just tightened her grip on my hips once more, and pulled herself forward, depriving me of the answer to the question of just how long it would have taken for her to come to such a question unaided. </p><p>Admittedly, considering what it followed, it wasn’t the greatest of losses. </p><p>Her hips rose to allow the invasion of my shaft, destroying her purity just weeks before her wedding. Her gaze, a mixture of vindictive anger and shock told me that she was aware of just how far she had been letting things go. </p><p>Yet, the depths of pleasure that followed, invading her beautiful black eyes told me that the decision was not just driven by anger. </p><p>Our show with Tiffany clearly left its memorable mark. </p><p>Since I was a nice man, I allowed her to set the pace, following her pushes and pulls as I waited for her entrance to get used to my presence. She said nothing as she led me back and forth in her pristine core, leading me to enjoy the tightness of her grip — accompanied by her moans, moans that she did her best to keep contained, only to fail miserably.</p><p>I could have assisted with a searing kiss to silence her, but watching her trying to swallow her words was simply more delicious.  </p><p>That was not an attitude I had adapted for the whole thing, of course. It was just the first two minutes I granted her mercifully for her to get used to the moment; both in physical terms, and to her to properly process that she was the one that took the decision to betray her fiancee. </p><p>“That’s enough warm-up,” I whispered as I shifted my hands, putting both sides of her as I trapped her against the deck. </p><p>“W-warm up,“ she stammered, unable to do anything but quiver in anticipation under my confident grin. Normally, such a move, lacking in confidence wasn’t the greatest source of attractiveness, but such a generalization would have missed one very important detail. </p><p>Her amazingly large pale breasts, currently unencumbered by any inconvenience, such as any kind of clothing, jiggling beautifully with her move. </p><p>“Naturally,” I whispered as I pushed my hips forward, destroying her attempts to keep her moans down. There was no doubt about the ultimate fate of her attempts of staying silent, but my push turned that ultimate end into the immediate result... </p><p>I pushed my hips forward, the sound of her cries mixing with the wind simply beautiful. </p><p>I continued pushing forward, each push making her cries louder as we christened the deck of the ship, her generous tits bouncing freely, her killer body on full display. </p><p>Her killer, yet extremely sensitive body. Combined with the intensity of her arousal, and the great build-up that started since the evening we shared with Tiffany, her failure to resist the invasion of pleasure was not too shocking. </p><p>I pulled out, letting her take deep breaths. Not because I was not tempted to continue — as my shaft was throbbing desperately for more — but to make sure she didn’t pass out due to overwhelming pleasure. </p><p>That didn’t mean that I intended to let her recover without the slightest intervention. “So, how did it feel, taking revenge,” I said as I wrapped my finger around her soft, smooth hair, playing lazily. </p><p>Her only answer was a beautiful whimper. My finger didn’t stay long on her hair, trailing down to her neck and collarbone, the additional sensation making her tremble. </p><p>Though, her reaction was nothing compared to the moan she let out once my fingers arrived on her beautiful chest, clamping around one of her nipples. “It seems that we need to work on your habits a bit. After going to the trouble of asking a question, I expect a proper answer.” </p><p>“Sorry,” she responded immediately. </p><p>“Not a problem, sweetie,” I answered with an excessively cheerful voice as I let my hand travel down even more in a gentle caress. </p><p>Not experienced with the carnal side of things, Umi didn’t realize that it signaled the end of the little period of recovery I had given to her. Well, at least not until I grabbed her waist and threw her against the beautiful lounge chair, the soft surface ensuring that it was merely shocking rather than painful. </p><p>I did so, as I didn’t want Umi trying to explain why her back was covered with friction burns. </p><p>Umi let out a shocked gasp, but that had been the full extent of her resistance. Rather than trying to fight back, she pushed her hips up, giving me an even better entrance to her recently defiled core. </p><p>“So, is your opinion about Tiffany’s comments changed somewhat?” I asked as I delved into her softness once more. </p><p>“W-what opinion?” Umi managed to ask, her voice coated with pleasure, suggesting that she was currently lost in a primal part of her brain, enough to destroy her ability to find the relevant aspect of the discussion. </p><p>“About the perks of making the boss happy, of course,” I answered, punctuating my words with a spank on her beautiful ass. </p><p>“M-maybe,” she managed to answer, though the desire packed in her tone certainly surprised me. “But I need to see more to make sure.” </p><p>Her flirtatious answer gave me just to answer I needed to push forward even more. My hips pushed forward, each push invading deeper into her core, exploring the undiscovered depths, each push redefining the pleasure for her. </p><p>Her inability to contain her voice was just enough to confirm my conclusion. </p><p>It would have been a horrible choice if Charlie was actually awake and busy with Brenda if we led her to believe, as Umi’s cries were too loud and too filled with passion to be mistaken for anything else. If he had been still awake, he would have rushed to ‘save’ his fiancee, which would have ruined their fun. </p><p>Luckily, that was far from being the case, allowing me to work on her beauty relentlessly even as I grabbed her beautiful hair and pulled it back, making her cries even louder, showing just how much she had lost the track of the situation. </p><p>Yet, the growing intensity of her pleasure made me wonder about the direction of some of her inclinations. I raised my hand, landing on her beautiful ass again and again. </p><p>“Is this supposed to feel this good?” she moaned, while the glimpses I was able to catch of her beautiful face confirmed the depths of the pleasure she had lost herself, her eyes firmly shut, her tongue lolling out of her mouth whenever she wasn’t busy speaking — or more often, moaning. </p><p>“Well, you can ask your friends for their opinions, but in my experience, it certainly doesn’t work as well when the man in question doesn’t know how to handle a lady.” </p><p>“R-really?” she managed to moan. </p><p>“Really,” came the answer, but amusingly, I wasn’t the source of it. </p><p>No, it was Brenda, who had just stepped into the deck once more, wearing only a semi-transparent pareo which normally helped a woman, even one as curvy as Brenda to reduce the sexiness they displayed. </p><p>Fortunately, that was only relevant when the pareo was actually combined with a bikini. Without that, the semi-transparent fabric only made the scene more erotic. </p><p>Not accidental, certainly, I decided as I watched Brenda walk toward us, each step making her hips sway just enough to displace it a bit more, the hope of it sliding enough to enrapture any viewer. </p><p>It was a pity that I was the only one that in the mood to enjoy that show. Charlie was downstairs, unconscious and unaware of what was going on…</p><p>And Umi was watching her approach, the venom in her gaze strong enough to temporarily displace the intense pleasure that invaded her body…</p>",

It looked counter-intuitive to do so while the enemy this time was clearly doing their best to pull the forces outside the school.</p><p>[-2190 Mana]</p><p>Otherwise, they wouldn’t have started attacking the towns farthest away from the school. Even the involvement of their spies preventing the guard force from gathering supported that, despite looking contrary to it at the first glance. </p><p>I spent quite a bit of mana on the construct, more than necessary, giving the spies the impression that I prioritized speed over anything else. </p><p>And if they believed that I was already suffering from a lack of mana after such spending and it was a good opportunity to ambush me, it was even better. A miscalculated ambush was often more dangerous than a direct battle. </p><p>A strategy that I expected them to launch at some point. Especially since their aim was to clearly render the guard force unable to send out a functional expedition, which would force the headmistress to send her elite forces instead. </p><p>Forces like a mysterious mage that singlehandedly prevented Zokras’ invasion. </p><p>It was the reason I made a spectacle out of my departure. I wanted the spies to inform the mysterious enemy that the first stage of their plan was a success, so that the enemy would reason the first stage of their plan was a success. </p><p>The only problem, I didn’t know what would be their next move. If I were them, I would have attacked the school directly without bothering the peripheral attacks, but the problem was I had no idea of their priorities. I only knew they wanted to target Mariel and Janelor ultimately, but I had no idea other than that. </p><p>I still left the school, because I was ready to return. I had prepared three hidden teleportation arrays I could use to return — which was not permanent, but would last for a few days — and both Janelor and Mariel had magical means to communicate with me in case of an emergency. </p><p>Not to mention, I set Oeyne as the bodyguard, and the companion node she had would work wonders to alert me if she fell into danger. </p><p>And the same applied to Titania and Marianne, as well as Helga and Cornelia, their proximity giving me a useful teleportation destination in case their target wasn’t limited to current warriors stuck at the school. </p><p>I continued moving toward the destination, but not without another little detour. Rather than pushing directly, I moved in a spiral for a while, casting a wide number of detection spells to see if there was any buried surprise near the school. </p><p>I still remembered the buried undead armies that had been prepared as the last step of a deadly trip, one that would have been enough to force Mariel between defending the school and letting it fall — which would have been a dangerous choice with the struggles she had been having with Divine Spark at that time. </p><p>I shook my head after three spirals and started moving toward my destination directly, wondering whether they didn’t bother setting a similar trap, or they prepared one but managed to hide it well enough to keep it away from my attention.  </p><p>Risky, but I decided to trust Mariel after the great boost she received as she started to sublime her Divine Spark, especially with all the hidden cards I arranged for her — both Janelor and the Princess. </p><p>Not to mention I could already feel the girls moving back to Silver Spires, giving her another impressive weaponry she could raise. </p><p>She had all the weapons she needed to resist anything less than the full force of the Eternals — a full force that I certainly didn’t expect to come at this point. After all, why would Eternals push forward aggressively when they had the perfect tools to maintain their position. </p><p>But, soon I realized that assumption wasn’t correct. </p><p>Pity that little lack of information was reached in the form of a huge, oppressive ward with a rotating structure, locking me in place. </p><p>A familiar ward structure, one that I remembered vividly from Mount Doom, when I worked hard to save Janelor. </p><p>“Okay, I might have miscalculated,” I murmured even as I checked my mana. </p><p>Mana: 8422 / 9000 ]</p><p>Luckily, it was already mostly recovered, enough to give me a fighting chance. More than enough to punch through the wards, especially since it was only the blocking ward I could feel, and not the detection ward that had been accompanying it earlier. </p><p>Unfortunately, rushing toward the wall and breaking out was not an option, not with the presence I could feel all around me, their mana flaring to show their willingness to fight, their numbers as impressive as the strength they displayed. </p><p>“Not a great prediction,” I murmured even as I pulled my sword, waiting for them to get closer even as I tried to come up with a way to escape. The presence of the fake elemental was nice, giving me the necessary mobility, but I wasn’t willing to rush toward the edge. </p><p>Despite being confident that I could break the wards faster than they could hit me, I waited for them to approach. </p><p>I needed to understand why they were targeting me, which I had no idea about.</p><p>Or, more accurately, I had many ideas. They could be targeting me for a myriad of reasons. Maybe revenge, as they had many reasons to hate me. I had destroyed their plans with Zokras and apparently killed him, I saved Janelor from their ploys, I intervened with their plans with the Empire by saving and empowering the princess, and I directly assassinated their members. </p><p>Together, they created compelling reasons to make me pay, but the problem was most of those were supposed to be hidden, with no way to trace them back to me. </p><p>But revenge wasn’t the only reason to target me. If they got a true sense of my capabilities and my growth trajectory it would make sense for them to target me as well. Just my incredible leveling speed might be enough to mark me as an anomaly. </p><p>Yet, it wouldn’t be enough for them to target me considering their own capabilities. But my ability to level up others, without suffering from the obvious horrible side effects they had been dealing with in terms of going berserk, was a different story. </p><p>And, I realized despondently as my opponents flew closer, not impossible to deduce if one explored the great change in Helga and Marianne. </p><p>Of course, there was also the biggest reason, the true nature of Tantric and its capabilities on Divine Spark, but I hoped that wasn’t the case. Because the others marked me as a target of interest…</p><p>While that one marked me as a great trouble, one that needed to be either controlled or destroyed. </p><p>Ironically, I didn’t expect that last one to be the case, because of their limited assault — even though terming an unbreakable ward and dozens of high-leveled combatants, each strong enough to be an absolute overlord outside as limited was ridiculous.</p><p>But everything I learned about the Eternals suggested that it didn’t even count as a true response from their true forces. </p><p>And I was confident that freely manipulating Divine Spark certainly earned a greater response from them. </p><p>Still, even a minuscule response was dangerous, as I was the target. I could escape successfully, but it would be nothing but highlight me as an even greater threat against Eternals, to be hunted down with their full force. </p><p>A force that I certainly didn’t want to face at its full potential. </p><p>But fighting and defeating them was hardly better. It would awaken an even stronger response, though there was one great advantage, as it would keep my full strength a mystery for the moment, making them hesitant. </p><p>As the auras came closer, I faced a dangerous choice… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 8753 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [118/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The princess was enthusiastic enough for her tongue to invade my mouth aggressively, which was to be expected after she got a taste of the reward, and expecting even more leveling. Unfortunately, it was not what she would receive. Not because I wanted to ration my mana — as the regeneration helped me immensely on that aspect — but I had seen the risks of leveling too quickly. </p><p>While my method was not as barbaric as the Eternals had been using, it was still enough to make quick leveling a bit of danger. Her soul space needed to settle to make it safe. </p><p>Luckily for her, I had an even better reward. I reached a small internal storage, and pulled the little present I had picked from Mariel’s room. </p><p>A little flicker of Darkness Spark, beautifully treated with Tantric. </p><p>[-450 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Tantric]</p><p>A gasp escaped her mouth as the Darkness touched her, which was much more strained than I expected. Luckily, I was aware that it was an experiment, and used a very limited amount. </p><p>I wondered whether it was the difference between an angel and a human that was the source of the difference, or it was the fact that Mariel had been much more aligned with the nature of the Divine Spark after carrying it with her for two centuries. </p><p>Either way, I clearly needed to make it more malleable. Luckily, it was the whole reason I was experimenting with her. </p><p>“Focus on the way you have been using your Divine Spark,” I ordered, curious whether the mindset would have any impact on it. I didn’t do that with Mariel, but she was already strongly aligned with Light, making that redundant at best. </p><p>She tried to say something, but considering I had stolen her lips once again, the only thing she let out was a soft gasp. But I could imagine her trying to say my actions were not conducive to focusing on darkness. </p><p>I didn’t care about the intensity of her success. At this point, I was more interested in understanding the nature of Divine Spark than empowering her — for empowerment, I had easier options. </p><p>I just waited to see if the difficulty of the absorption process was changing. </p><p>Her mana started to cycle inside her. At first, it was smooth, but soon, she started to sieve her mana into her own Divine Spark reserves, letting it gain a shadowy quality while she tried to focus. </p><p>The result was not earth-shattering, but promising. As her mana started to gain Darkness nature, but not fully. In parallel, the difficulty of absorption started to reduce, but it was noticeable only because of my sharp senses. Maybe meditating for hours and days would have worked much more efficiently, but I didn’t have the time to do that. </p><p>Luckily, I had my own cheat tool. I used Tantric to dilute the darkness effect more and more, until her body finally accepted it, the minuscule Darkness Spark melding into her quickly.  </p><p>It wasn’t a lot of Divine Spark, not enough to give her an actual power-up, which was nice since that was not my objective in the first place.  </p><p>But, as a nice bonus, somehow it made an impact I hadn’t been expecting. Not directly, but somehow, it worked like a skill, and the ease of using her own darkness multiplied several times. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>Too fascinating, even. If I didn’t have the ability to examine her soul space to know the exact skills she had, I might have actually thought that it triggered a skill. The similarity, combined with my unique system’s constant demand for Divine Spark, raised some interesting questions about the link between the Skills and Divine Spark. </p><p>Pity we were facing an emergency, which prevented me from whisking the princess to a three-day retreat filled with experimentation and debauchery. </p><p>“How’s this as an advance payment,” I said, acting like I hadn’t simply multiplied her capabilities several times, making her a much more formidable and dangerous opponent.  </p><p>“Enough to make sure I succeed,” she whispered. And, considering she was already capable enough to grab the Crown Princess position strongly enough that other princes needed help from the Eternals to push her out — and failed to attain complete success even then — it was not hard to imagine what that power up meant in terms of effectiveness. </p><p>“Good, but since I don’t want to show my face around, let’s make sure you will succeed,” I said as I captured her lips once more. I didn’t want to spend more mana, but since I was facing such a convenient experimentation opportunity, I decided to do so. </p><p>Especially I could feel the small pull of the System, trying to absorb the Divine Spark her body absorbed. </p><p>I needed to solve that. </p><p>[-382 Mana]</p><p> [Companion Acquisition: Progress 1%]</p><p>[+2 Tantric]</p><p>Ordinarily, Companion Process wasn’t supposed to start with just a kiss, but at this point, I was capable enough to trick my own System by using trickery. </p><p>Amusingly, it still required a mental component, which I had achieved by pushing her toward the </p><p>Yet, the results were on the negative side of my expectations. It slowed down the absorption, but only because it was generating a reverse pull. Still, while I was unhappy with the result, I wasn’t surprised by it. </p><p>Not when my system had been subtly blackmailing me for more and more Divine Spark.</p><p>Yet, that didn’t mean it couldn’t be used for my benefit. </p><p>First, I reached that companion node, and absorbed it back. Then, I flared my mana even as I let my own Divine Spark take its place as we kissed.  </p><p>[-1280 Mana]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 25%]</p><p>I didn’t receive any notification of experience gain or stage completion, but considering I had been using my own Divine Spark, it wasn’t shocking. However, while I didn’t care about my own experience, I was slightly frustrated by the lack of achievement at the Princess. </p><p>Yet, the benefit of it was clear. The companion node was still pulling the Divine Spark toward itself, but with a lesser intensity. And, when it brushed against the node, it bounced back. </p><p>It was another advantage of creating the node myself. I was able to create an inverted storage around, blocking it from actually absorbing the Divine Spark, while still pulling enough to prevent the System from absorbing. </p><p>It wasn’t the most elegant solution, but it worked well, which was all I could hope for at that point. I pushed another sliver of Darkness Spark inside her, noting the absorption process. It still took a great deal of Tantric cleansing, but a sliver less than the earlier attempt. </p><p>A piece of evidence toward the existing Divine Spark helping assimilation, but ultimately, not conclusive, requiring much more experimentation. </p><p>When I pulled back, her eyes were wide in shock, easily distinguishing the smoothness of her darkness mana flowing with surprising smoothness. </p><p>“I’m sure you can feel the improvement in your capabilities,” I whispered as I pulled back. Earlier, she was barely able to maintain two puppets, but I was confident that, after my improvements, three wouldn’t be out of the question, maybe even more if she could use her increased flexibility as an advantage. </p><p>“Yes,” she said, trying to sound confident, but unable to suppress the fascination in her tone.  </p><p>“Don’t forget I expect a good performance. I won’t be happy if I find myself forced to act,” I said as I pulled back. It was another subtle trick, it worked as a threat, but also a promise. I was implying that I would punish her if she failed, but I was also saying that I was ready to intervene openly if things got too bad. </p><p>Which conveniently removed the dilemma of a possible last stand and the merits of an early retreat from her. Why would she retreat even if the worst outcome of staying was better than retreating. </p><p>It was not true, of course, as I was weaker than what I had been reflecting her, but I didn’t feel bad about that, after she made the choice of doing the same to Silver Spires, involving the school with her political realities. </p><p>Also, she was a politician. Lies were basically foreplay for them. </p><p>Looking at her, still trying to catch her breath after our latest kiss, I was tempted to lean forward once more, but delaying my arrival at the border was not a good idea. I didn’t battle to start immediately, but it was not a bet I was willing to take. </p><p>I disappeared from the room with an illusion trick before leaving the school, hoping the princess wouldn’t waste the trust I had laid in her…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 7126 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [118/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I watched Cinder fly in the sky unimpeded, flying low enough to touch the ground, and high enough to brush against the wards, radiating happiness. I was tense the first time I had watched her flying toward the wards, ready to cut her mana once again, afraid that she had lost herself in transformation once again. </p><p>Just like the first time, she took a sharp turn before hitting, her flames brushing against the ward. </p><p>A smile bloomed on my face as I continued to watch her, deciding not to call her down or bother her directly or indirectly. Clearly, after a lifetime of failing to transform, she was exuberant with her success, and deserved a moment to celebrate it. </p><p>“Fascinating, right,” I whispered into Isolde’s ear even as I let my fingers dance over her wetness. </p><p>“She’s just a bigger target for my bow,” Isolde answered, but she was nowhere near a good actress to successfully hide her jealousy. Or fascination for that matter. </p><p>“Oh, really, maybe we should practice that … later,” I said even as I let my hands dance over her body, removing the remaining scraps of clothing, and leaving her completely naked. “But first, some additional entertainment.” </p><p>Isolde gasped as my hands danced over her body hungrily. </p><p>Very hungrily, even, I realized even as I enjoyed the tight body of Isolde, her soft skin contrasting with her tight muscles underneath. </p><p>I wanted to frown as I was not used to unexpected bursts of emotion like that, but my body had other ideas as my lips landed on Isolde’s neck, biting hard enough to earn a beautiful, charged cry. </p><p>A sharp move like that might have earned a negative reaction from someone else, but I didn’t need to know this reaction to know that Isolde enjoyed a rougher treatment. I let my hands follow my instincts even as I closed my eyes, trying to understand my own uncharacteristic reaction. </p><p>Finding the source of it was trivial. There was only one thing that changed during the last day that could result in such a major change. </p><p>My connection with Cinder. </p><p>I turned inward, examining our connection. With Cinder successfully transformed, we were resonating even more intensely, which increased the impact of the flames. Not only strengthening of my magic getting faster, but also I was feeling my magic getting stronger and stronger. </p><p>I twisted her nipples, triggering a beautiful moan off Isolde, still nibbling her neck, but I kept my attention on the way the connection to Cinder worked inside me, noticing that, this time, the impact was not limited to my magic but also spread to my body. </p><p>I was not a healing expert, but I was competent, as no dark lord that was at least competent in curing poisons — or immune to it completely by being a lich or a similar creature — would last long. It allowed me to make sure it wasn’t hurting me, just like my magic. </p><p>But instead, strengthened me. The sudden impulses were just a side effect of the sudden burst of vitality. </p><p>With the impact of the flames on the living things, that result was not shocking, and best classified as a pleasant bonus. I might have focused that more, but a needy moan from Isolde triggered my instincts, even more, begging me to focus outward. </p><p>Who was I to deny the call of my own body and my needy assassin? </p><p>I grabbed Isolde’s hair and pulled hard, making her bend backward until she created a dangerous curve. If I tried to do that against someone else, the best I would get was a painful accident, but Isolde managed to balance herself even as I pulled hard, the pain only intensifying her pleasure further. </p><p>For a while, I just looked down, enjoying the sight of Isolde’s tight body as she did her best to maintain her balance. Meanwhile, I continued examining her, watching the flickers of emotions on her beautiful face, cycling between various intensities of arousal and desire. </p><p>And any kind of shame was completely absent. </p><p>“Obedient slave,” I whispered as I caressed her cheek with my free hand. “Are you ready to serve your master?” </p><p>I had expected my choice of words to trigger her emotions, at least frustration if not anger. Her mouth parted open, showing that her emotions had been affected, but not in the direction I had expected. </p><p>Her face was filled with elation. “Yes, master,” she whispered, one that managed to reflect obedience and arousal at the same time. </p><p>Maybe I underestimated her desire for obedience. </p><p>“Excellent, and what does an obedient slave gets,” I said, giving her the option for a reward. </p><p>“Whatever her master desires,” she whispered back as she looked at me, amusingly not even flinching when Cinder passed close to us — who was no doubt annoyed at my lack of attention. </p><p>I ignored her, and stayed focused on Isolde, who certainly earned a reward. “Excellent answer,” I whispered as I slapped her beautiful breasts, making them sway freely in her nakedness. </p><p>She said nothing, just moaned, which didn’t stop even as I pushed her down harder, and her naked back hit the ground, hard. I knelled down next to her, my finger rapidly invading her core with a vengeance. </p><p>I considered teasing her softly, to test her determination to trust her ‘master’, but luckily for her, we were short in time — I didn’t trust Cinder to not act out as I neglected her, making Isolde’s reward a priority. </p><p>And what better reward than an explosive orgasm, I decided as I let my fingers drill into her core aggressively. She was not able to talk, but considering it was her moans was the thing that was blocking her words, assuming that she was enjoying her treatment wasn’t too difficult. </p><p>Isolde trembled in excitement as my fingers continued to invade her core, her nipples rock hard, pushing up as her back arched in pleasure. Cinder passed over us, even closer, and her flames were even more intense, brushing against my hair. </p><p>I was ready to cast a ward if necessary, of course, but the few flickers of flame that fell on my skin danced harmlessly, almost gleefully, making a defensive effort unnecessary. I leaned over Isolde, grabbing her breasts hard. </p><p>Her moans were quick to rise, only to intensify as I slapped her breasts to create some contrast. “You’re lucky you have such a good master,” I said as I changed my position, and soon, positioned myself between her legs, and pushed my head down. </p><p>It was time to reward her properly. </p><p>“Ohh,” she gasped as my tongue danced around her clit. “It’s too—“ she started, finally managing to speak once again, though it was interrupted before she could actually finish her sentence. </p><p>I chuckled even as I grabbed her thighs, forcing them wide enough that even with her flexibility, it was an uncomfortable experience. Of course, with her preference, such discomfort was nothing more than another bucket of water to her growing arousal. </p><p>She cried in desire, her eyes tightly shut, this time not even flinching as Cinder made another close pass. Unlike the previous attempts, she was fully lost in her growing pleasure under my tongue. </p><p>What an impressive focus. </p><p>I chuckled even as I treated Isolde. She was not the first lady I discovered at the Capital, the greatest bastion of light, with a submissive side — a position that was competed for by Emma and Aria depending on the benchmark —  nor she was the most shocking one — a position that was held firmly by the Queen — but she had her own unique twist. </p><p>None of the others liked the pure physical domination much, appreciating power in different, more abstract terms. </p><p>In contrast, Isolde loved the sheer physical pressure generated by my muscles, each touch pushing her deeper.  </p><p>When I pulled back and flipped her, my hand pressing her head against hard ground with only a layer of grass in between — shockingly thick thanks to Cinder’s influence — and slid my fingers in her core once again, she was already pushed to the edge of a climax, requiring only a touch to topple her over. </p><p>Which was good, as I had noticed Cinder finally coming down, still wrapped in flames, but even the head of the giant phoenix managed to reflect her annoyance.  </p><p>I decided to wait until she landed to decide how to take such a decision, and focused on bringing Isolde to completion. After all, the poor girl deserved her reward for not being spoiled at the last step. </p><p>“Someone is close to the end,” I whispered, which made her gasp scandalously, but that was all she was able to do as the climax hit, making her collapse under an endless rain of trembles.</p><p>But, before I could attend to her further, Cinder had already landed, her giant phoenix face turned to me, her jealousy clear…</p>",

    "content": "<p>When the next morning arrived, I was driving a beautiful, jet-black convertible out of the garage, a huge smirk on my lips. </p><p>It took the full application of my Traits, as well as using a great number of the parts on the corner, but I managed to finish repairing the car in exactly a day. </p><p>Certainly a great achievement, I thought as I drove it, enjoying the sensation of wind flowing through my hair. A beautiful flow. </p><p>Even better, there were no shadow assassins all night, making me hope that, whoever was responsible for that lacked the ability to send another one — or at least, lacked the ability to summon it back, and just assumed that I was dead. </p><p>As I drove back, I could feel the hints of exhaustion, but I had no intention of even shutting my eyes, not before I could awaken my guide — or at least, I could push things under control.</p><p>Luckily, I had the chance to do so. I drove back to the college first, and uploaded the video to my computer. </p><p>And while the computer was busy with it, I opened my computer, and started working on the tools I developed. My first target was the news crawler. As my fingers danced on the keyboard, I changed significant portions of the code, cutting, modifying, or even erasing completely. </p><p>Earlier, Pattern Recognition allowed me to write cleaner and more efficient code, but its benefit was nothing compared to what Design trait gave me, allowing me to make big, conceptual changes about the nature and the functionality of the program. </p><p>I was tempted to reveal my increased coding abilities as well, but after some thought, I decided against it. </p><p>I had already used my programming capabilities in several illegal tasks, and there was no guarantee that it was the end of it. </p><p>It was for the best if people didn’t know my prodigious capabilities didn’t extend to the digital space. </p><p>I spent the next hour making the necessary changes in the code to improve its distinguishing capabilities several times, even adding some basic machine learning principles to add some automatic improvement of capability. </p><p>Then, when it was done, I turned my attention to the video, aggressively editing it to turn it into something that could be watched in less than fifteen minutes. I also prepared the full-length version — after a few cuts to remove some absurd moments — for comparison, but didn’t post it yet. </p><p>I wanted to wait until people started to complain I didn’t repair it on my own. </p><p>And even if they didn’t, I had my bots to do that exact fight. </p><p>Either case, I wanted to maximize the controversy around the repair as much as possible. “So, who’s ready to watch the first test drive of my new ride,” I posted to the people. It was already almost twelve, meaning most of the students were already up and bored. </p><p>After I posted that, I went to my new car, and quickly drove toward one of the more challenging roads near campus, one that had been usually leveraged for illegal racing.</p><p>Rich kids, rich hobbies. </p><p>After I arrived there, I placed my phone on my dashboard, and turned on the live stream. Yet, this time, the feed was coming from two sources. One of the dashcams — as I put three of them after what happened to my last car, in case a genius tried to replicate his earlier trick — provided one source, while my face was the second source. </p><p>“So, Kevin, do you mind having a race? Maybe you’re interested in losing another car,” I said with a chuckle as I looked at the camera, but this time, I waited until the number of watchers had reached mid-three figures first. “Oh, I forgot, you’re not allowed to own one.” </p><p>It was hardly the greatest show. It was childish and mean, but it gave me more Intent than anything I could collect through local chess tournaments and other adventures. </p><p>More importantly, it maintained my name in connection with the football team. Even if childish, the more my name was talked about, the more impact it would have once they lost their game spectacularly. </p><p>Maybe to the point of total collapse. </p><p>Yet, as I pressed the gas and challenged the car to the limits, I abandoned those concerns, enjoying the challenge. Agility was not only useful for footwork. It also helped boost hand-eye coordination, which was the primary component of driving. </p><p>A classic car was not slow, but it lacked many of the simple features that modern cars possessed, making their steering a more challenging affair. </p><p>Luckily, as the people watching my feed enjoyed the show, I received a reward for it. A meager one compared to yesterday’s win, but I appreciated the increasing flow of ability. </p><p>[Control I, acquired]</p><p>More importantly, it gave me the chance to actually enjoy myself. </p><p>Enough that, I almost missed the sudden crawling of my skin once more. As I felt that familiar sensation, I reached by two ways. First, I reached and shut the streaming, before the shadow appeared visibly. </p><p>I had no idea whether they were visible on the camera, but if they were, I didn’t want to deal with the advanced scrutiny it brought. </p><p>Clearly, I was not the only one that was aware of the supernatural, and posting a video of my own would be waving a flag to get their attention. </p><p>Instead, I managed to throw myself out of the car before it could even fully stop, rolling on the floor to turn deadly into just painful. </p><p>Then, just as I came to a stop, I had to throw myself back as I felt crawling around me once more, this time a second shadow appearing around me. </p><p>“Holy hell,” I growled as I tapped onto the intent flow, which came much easier as I coated my hand, and stabbed it in the chest even as it tried to skewer me. It disappeared, but this time, along with its blade. </p><p>Just in time to turn and avoid the attack of the first one. Even as I prepared to retaliate, I noticed the blade in its hand was different. Less substantial, flickering like the shadow, only with reduced intensity. </p><p>Curious, I grabbed a rock and threw it to the blade, only for the blade to be pushed back rather than cutting it through the ease. </p><p>Still, considering the deep mark it left on the rock, it wasn’t exactly comforting. It was still capable of easily killing me like the previous knife. </p><p>Even as I killed the shadow, three others appeared, doing their best to surround me. </p><p>I was so glad that, whatever was responsible for the shadows made the grand mistake of just sending one of them at the beginning — my best guess, trusting the capability of the blade the shadow was equipped with.</p><p>That made me consider — even as I stabbed another shadow in the chest, destroying it as two others appeared — whether I should go and pick the blade, but, after some consideration, I decided against it. </p><p>I didn’t trust the energy radiating off it. </p><p>Even as I had thought, another shadow appeared, only to be destroyed by me, with a much more significant ease now that I knew the secret of their destruction. </p><p>Yet, it stopped only after the count reached two dozen, my breathing desperate. I didn’t want to think what would have happened if all of those shadows appeared at the same time, preventing me from escaping. </p><p>I sagged down as the great exhaustion hit, but my rapid breaths, while resolving my exhaustion, didn’t resolve my horrible mood. </p><p>I needed even more intent, and I needed it as soon as possible. </p><p>But for once, luck was on my side. When I returned, I saw a lot of mentions about a video, and clicking, I saw it was a rebuttal from Kevin.</p><p>The video itself was useless. It was boring and childish, but it gave me what I wanted. </p><p>‘I can beat you in everything, including quarterbacking,’ I posted on his video. ‘How about a duel, tonight at nine, and the loser quits the school.’</p><p>The chaos it triggered was incredible. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After my first words, I walked around the car for a full turn before muttering, acting like I had just started examining the car. </p><p>Yet, even a minute later, when I turned to my phone, I saw a message from Megan, before the stream gained viewers in two digits, showing that, as usual, she was on top of things. </p><p>‘What are you doing?’ her message read. </p><p>‘Fixing the car you helpfully acquired for me, of course,’ I wrote back. </p><p>‘You are mad.’</p><p>I smirked. ‘Honey, you can’t be just realizing that,’ I answered with a chuckle. </p><p>‘Your funeral,’ was her answer. </p><p>‘Good. I will owe you another favor if you drive people to it.’</p><p>She didn’t answer, but she didn’t need to. The sudden spike of viewers that followed, easily reaching a hundred in less than fifteen seconds, was more than enough answer. </p><p>With a smirk, I sent another message, this time to my computer, one that would trigger the chatbots I had created all night. </p><p>Just like that, the comment screen started to be filled with comments, people fighting each other about inane aspects, though it didn’t take long for the others to join the fight. </p><p>Showing that, even in its written form, Taunt was surprisingly effective. </p><p>“Of course, I might have just bought a car like other useless rich kids on the team, but I appreciate a classic,” I said, looking at the screen with an infuriating smirk that showed the full range of my anger. </p><p>Then, I pulled the Seduction instead. “Of course, a good classic is like a beautiful woman, only when it’s acquired through great effort, the ride could be termed spectacular.” </p><p>It was something cheesy and extremely annoying, but I trusted the assistance of the traits, helping me to perfect the cadence and the delivery to turn it into something better. </p><p>The viewer count continued to explode, and so did the number of comments, soon overcoming the chatbots through sheer number. </p><p>“Let’s start with something simple,” I said as I grabbed the rust removal spray and applied a generous amount on the hood, before putting on gloves and grabbing a large sandpaper. </p><p>“Of course, I could use an automatic scrapper, but it would be an insult to such a beautiful classic,” I murmured as my hands continued to move over the surface of the car. </p><p>The screen was far away that I couldn’t see the comments or the number of viewers, but I didn’t need to. Not when I could feel the significant increase of the intent I received, enough to allow me to channel to the System. </p><p>Soon, reaching to a point of giving the first reward I was seeking. </p><p>[Repair I, acquired]</p><p>I smirked even as I continued working steadily on the body of the car. I had to admit, it would be an interesting sight even for an expert, mostly because of the absurd level of Strength and Agility I possessed, allowing me to work on the surface of the car with a shocking speed. </p><p>Especially since I pushed myself to the limit, working much faster than any mechanic worked — with the exception of professional pit crews — as I resolved the issues on the surface of the car. </p><p>Of course, I continued speaking as I worked on the car to maintain the attention of the people, alternating between mocking the other football players, speculating on how badly they would fail without me, and actual car repair facts. </p><p>When, as I finished going through the body in less than an hour — an incredible speed of achievement considering the mess it was earlier. </p><p>[Mechanic I, acquired]</p><p>[Repair II, acquired]</p><p>I didn’t know the difference between Repair and Mechanic, but if the System taught me anything, there was no harm in receiving extra traits. </p><p>Then, I opened the hood, and after some struggle, hoisted the engine block to the engine holder, raising it up. </p><p>Then, I changed the camera. “The easy part is done, now, let’s start with the real work,” I said.</p><p>Then, I started disassembling the engine block with a shocking fluidity, the Mechanic, Repair, and Agility working in concert to give my fingers an unprecedented fluidity. It wasn’t the first time I was disassembling the engine — as it was my old car that forced me to learn that — but it certainly helped me to enhance my ability. </p><p>[Mechanic III, acquired]</p><p>[Repair III, acquired]</p><p>[Design III, acquired]</p><p>I received these rewards, because I managed to finish separating the engine despite speaking constantly. The phone was near me, enough to allow me to read the screen, and I occasionally answered the questions. </p><p>I received a boost to my Design and Electronic Traits, because I used the opportunity to answer some of the questions that I noticed, using that to brag about my programming abilities, particularly the nature of the design challenges as they pertained to coding. </p><p>Apparently, it made enough of an impression to give me the boost I had been seeking. </p><p>“Now, let’s move on to the electronic challenges,” I as I started dismantling the cables, but after finishing that aspect, my gains were much more meager. </p><p>[Electronics I, acquired]</p><p>But that hadn’t been surprising, as I could feel the significant decrease in the intent I had been receiving. Even with the amazing fight of the bots, people were losing interest in the show. Oh, the number of viewers still stayed high, even increasing, but the novelty of the achievement slowly disappeared, dragging down their fascinated surprise along with it. </p><p>Which meant reduced Intent. </p><p>“I think that’s enough show for today, ladies and gentlemen,” I said even as I finished separating the last piece of engine. “After all, we still need to maintain some surprise as you see me moving with the car tomorrow.”</p><p>With that, I turned off the camera, but continued recording the repair process. Maybe I could create some kind of compressed video out of it that would benefit me, or put it on the net after people claimed I was driving a different car. </p><p>Making a very public bet and then revealing the truth would have been extremely fun. </p><p>“You’re not half bad,” came a voice from behind me. I turned and caught the gaze of the brunette owner of the garage, looking at me with an interested gaze. </p><p>I had long noticed the gaze she had been throwing my way as I was busy making my video, of course, but I didn’t say anything. Since I was in her garage, I didn’t have the luxury of asking her to stop — not that had any point when I was actually live-streaming the process. </p><p>“I dabble,” I answered with a shrug, but the confident smirk on my face turned that into a brag rather than a display of humility. </p><p>Humility was overrated. </p><p>“Good, I was afraid that you would make a mess out of my garage, but you seem to know what you’re doing. Would you be interested in a part-time job?” she asked. “</p><p>I was certainly interested in, especially in a high-end garage with no problem with income if the quality of the cars sprawled around was any indicator. I could only imagine the salary she would offer. </p><p>It was a pity that the appearance of the shadow ruined anything I had toward the game. I doubted that I could actually fall asleep without someone watching me — and considering the nature of my attacker, the only viable source of protection was my guide. </p><p>Which meant Intent over money. </p><p>“I am, but I currently don’t have any time. Maybe after a few weeks,” I answered with a sigh. She just nodded, proving that she was a woman of few words. </p><p>I had no idea whether that would be possible, but there was no harm in keeping my options open. </p><p>I expected her to leave, and she did, but not before saying one last thing. “You can use anything in that corner,” she said as she showed a corner, where a great number of parts in various conditions, likely removed from the other cars were sprawled around, each in a different condition. </p><p>“Thanks,” I said as she turned back and moved away, and I was sincere. The parts might be second-hand, but considering the machines they came out of, they were hardly cheap. I had no doubt that, to the correct buyer, they were worth a lot. </p><p>A part of me, the same part that rejected the car Thad offered, wanted to reject her generous offer, but I bit my lip and accepted. </p><p>The assassination attempt by a shadow did much to blunt my pride. </p><p>Not enough that I actually failed to take the picture of every single part I used, to be paid later, once I had enough money. I had no problem receiving that ruined car from Megan, because ultimately, it was still an exchange of favors, and the things she had received from me were significant — and also, the monetary value of the ruined car was low enough to be affordable even for me. </p><p>I focused on the repair. </p><p>“I’ll lock the garage, do you want to leave or stay,” she asked several hours later. </p><p>“I’ll stay,” I answered as I turned my attention back to the car, continuing to work with shocking efficiency. Since I had no hope of sleeping, I might as well make sure that I finished the repairs. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The answer, coming with a gruff voice, was enough to put a big frown on my face, especially since I had wasted two hours of my time coming here. Though, the horrible crackling of the speaker prevented me from guessing anything about the owner, the amount of cynicism packed there reminded me of Coach Bill. </p><p>“I’m here about a car,” I said, hoping that it was not a joke from Megan. </p><p>“Not interested in buying or selling, this is a private garage,” the voice answered, getting tighter. </p><p>“I’m a friend of Megan, and she must have some arrangements for me.” </p><p>No answer came for almost half a minute, making me wonder whether it was really a trick from Megan to waste some of my time. I wouldn’t be too shocked if that was the case. </p><p>Then, before I could turn and leave, a buzzing sound reached my ears and the door opened. The voice said nothing. With a sigh, I walked forward. </p><p>I stepped in, and after going through a small corridor, I found myself in a large garage — surprisingly large considering the unassuming entrance. It could easily fit more than two dozen of cars, and most of the area was already filled. </p><p>More importantly, I could see an elevator at the corner, showing that it wasn’t at the full capacity of the garage. </p><p>For a mechanics garage of that size, I expected at least a dozen mechanics bustling around, serving the cars. Yet, other than a figure at the other end of the garage — who I guessed was the owner of the voice, the garage was empty. </p><p>And, it was certainly not because no one was working there. Instead, almost all free space was occupied by cars, some looking pristine — at least outwardly — while the others were literally in pieces, even the engine block separated. </p><p>If the garage had been in a less affluent part of the town, I would have assumed the place was in the last throes of death. </p><p>That, and if the cars that filled the place hadn’t been extremely expensive. The cars I managed to recognize, both the classic ones and the modern ones, were ludicrously expensive. It easily into a six-figure kind of expensive, and not all of them were on the lower end of that range. </p><p>“Hello,” I said, hoping to sound pleasant enough. Normally, I didn’t bother to look likable, but considering I would be spending a considerable amount of time in his garage as I tried to repair whatever car Megan arranged for me, acting my usual charming self might not be the solution. </p><p>“Wait,” the answer came, sharp and gruff, but still clear enough to correct one of my assumptions. </p><p>The owner was a woman. </p><p>“Lucky,” I murmured as I waited for her to leave, happily didn’t try to talk with her. </p><p>I had to wait a minute for her to appear, and when she did, I repeated the word lucky mentally, and this time, it was not about the blunder I managed to avoid, but the view that appeared in front of me. </p><p>I didn’t know what I had expected from a mechanic, but certainly, it wasn’t that. She was a beautiful brunette in her early thirties, her hair tied into a ponytail, but that hardly took anything from her allure, especially since she was only wearing a short overall that didn’t hide most of her impressively thick legs, and a white t-shirt that stuck to her body significantly thanks to the sweat.  </p><p>She was clearly wearing a bra underneath, but that bra was fighting a hopeless battle trying to contain those great expanses. </p><p>Yet, I recognized the sharp expression on her face, waiting for the slightest mistake to pounce on. </p><p>“So, you’re my guest for the week,” she said, her voice even gruffer as she closed in, like speaking a great chore.  </p><p>“That’s right,” I answered. </p><p>“Follow me,” she said as she moved forward, her steps aggressive and steady, a pace that fit well with the boots she was wearing. Though it certainly wasted the potential of her amazing hips. </p><p>I did so, following her through the mess of half-assembled cars, having enough presence of mind not to mention my rating about how her walk would rate on a podium. </p><p>Then, she stood in front of a pile of rust, or what I thought to be a pile of rust, before she pointed down. “A Mustang, 1960, in poor condition, just as requested,” she said before pointing to a large bag of tools. “And this is the equipment left by the last moron that I had to fire,” she said as she took a step forward. </p><p>Which managed to give a sense of intimidation despite the amazing sight it created with her sweaty white t-shirt. </p><p>“Touch any of my tools without permission, and I’ll cut your tool in return,” she said before walking away. </p><p>“Charming,” I whispered, but only after making sure she was sufficiently away. No need to anger my new landlady — at least not before I could get a better sense of her attitude.</p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the pile of rotten metal she claimed to be a car. “Megan,” I chuckled, finally finding her real payback. Apparently, she used my vague direction to the extreme limit, beautifully turning it into revenge. </p><p>Too bad for her that it actually worked better for my benefit. </p><p>For a while, I said nothing as I walked around the car, taking a stock of the situation. The body was a mess, almost no paint remained, replaced by a thick layer of rust. The windows — at least the ones that were still in place — were cracked badly enough to the point of uselessness, making it necessary to change. </p><p>Of course, that was hardly the limit of the damage. The headlamps were broken, the radiator grill was exposed, and the seat leather was ruined.</p><p>While I walked around the car, the woman whose name I was yet to learn — who was probably the owner of the place — had already returned to her job, and hidden under one of the raised cars. </p><p>I turned my attention back to the car, and pulled open the rusty hood, and the view inside didn’t give me any kind of happiness. The softer parts, like wires and hoses, were almost completely gone, or corroded enough to be useless. </p><p>The engine block looked just as horrible, covered with an even thicker layer of rust, but that didn’t annoy me as much as I feared, because I grabbed a little hammer and hit it with it, the interior felt solid enough to suggest that the rust was limited to the top layer. </p><p>That didn’t mean that the engine was definitely working, of course, as there were hundreds of other problems that might prevent it, but still, it was not as bad as he feared. </p><p>It seemed that Megan still had a hint of mercy, arranging a merely very difficult car for him to repair, rather than an impossible one. </p><p>Hunting for a brand new engine for a classical was far above my current means. </p><p>With a sigh, I loaded the car on the vehicle lift before pressing the button, raising it enough to allow me to slide down and examine the tires, axle, and other features. The tires were completely useless, but luckily, the axle looked solid enough to avoid replacement. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I murmured, happy with the result. A lot of work, but technically fixable, especially if I could manage to earn a few Traits in the process. </p><p>But, to do so, I first needed to set up an appropriate structure. </p><p>I was not an expert when it came to setting up a camera, but the photoshoot with Megan and Kim taught me the basics about light and camera, at least the importance of the angle. </p><p>More importantly, it taught me about the importance of giving the necessary visual stimulation, I thought as I removed my shirt, revealing a tight white shirt underneath, tight enough to reveal most of my muscles. </p><p>I picked white, because it would get dirtier as I worked, enhancing the impression of repair further. </p><p>And, hopefully, give me the trait I was hoping for. </p><p>Then, I started the lifestream, and turned to the camera, unable to resist the temptation of being a bit naughty. “Hello, everyone. Since the team decided that they can play without me for a week without being humiliated, I had some time to kill, and I thought it was a good time to give you a different aspect of mine…” </p><p>The taunt was turning out to be a surprisingly useful Trait. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was lucky that the temporary suspension before the hearing didn’t kick me out of the dorms as well, as it would have created another mess to deal with. Nothing impossible, but I didn’t want to waste my time either. </p><p>And, with my latest adventure, I certainly didn’t have the time to waste time. </p><p>So, when I returned to my room, rather than going to bed, I sat in front of my computer. It was impossible for me to fall asleep after being attacked by the shadow creature — as there was no guarantee that a repeat was not on the table — so, I had to use my time more efficiently. </p><p>My first decision, I needed to turn my car repair project into something more, to see whether I could get more Intent while I attempted the repair. It was not the most efficient way of spending time, but tomorrow was too easy to start working on getting back to the team. </p><p>I turned on my computer, and turned on a code editor. </p><p>My mind was already on how to leverage that project for something more. Not just to acquire a car and some Intent, but convert it into a tool that I could use to generate more intent. </p><p>Luckily, Megan’s performance earlier today gave me an idea about the direction. I needed to have a channel under my control, with enough fans paying attention to my every move. With that, I could actually control the Traits I received.  </p><p>Yet, I also knew that it was not easy to actually create a platform that would get people’s attention. </p><p>So, as usual, I decided to cheat a bit, hence the code editor. </p><p>My first preference would have been to create several thousands of bot accounts, giving enough fake popularity to earn the attention of the rest. </p><p>Unfortunately, while that solution was simple, it was also one of the first things any platform checked the ensure the authenticity of a stream. And, while there were ways to bypass that, none of those methods were particularly simple, especially at my current level of ability. </p><p>Things might change once I gained some Traits to provide direct assistance, but for the moment, that was not viable. </p><p>So, I decided to focus on a different aspect, leaning toward a trait that helped me immensely today.</p><p>Taunt. </p><p>I stayed in front of the computer, and created several chatbots. Nothing too extreme, just a few rough personality traits that would replicate some passionate commentators, some faking being football fans while insulting nerds, some faking nerds lacking confidence that constantly insults my looks and the girls that actually found me handsome, some just flinging general misunderstanding and insults. </p><p>Of course, a few of them was there for a very detailed battle against the chaos that happened earlier in the team house.</p><p>Altogether, I hoped that Taunt-assisted insults would be as effective as when I used them directly, because when I finished writing these comments and finished setting up the eight distinct chatbots, the sun was already up. </p><p>I had no problem sacrificing sleep to finish that, for two reasons. First, my Endurance and Recovery had increased significantly during the game, enough to significantly reduce my need for sleep. More importantly, I didn’t have training today, so I didn’t need to be at peak capacity. </p><p>That didn’t prevent a long yawn from forcing its way out as I stood up and stretched, only to see two messages on my phone. One was from Coach Juana, warning me not to skip training for too long. </p><p>I ignored that, as with my latest Traits, training lost its significance significantly. I couldn’t even use the full range of my physical abilities in the field anymore, let alone push them to the next stage. </p><p>The second one was from Megan. ‘It’s done,’ she wrote, followed by an address for the garage, warning me to be there at eleven at the latest. </p><p>Which was a bigger challenge than I expected, I learned as I checked the address, and saw that it was on the other side of the city. </p><p>It was barely half an hour's drive considering there was no traffic, but using buses, it was much harder to actually focus. </p><p>After a quick shower, I grabbed my earbuds and left. Since I was going to be waiting for the bus for a long time, I decided to leverage the moment by watching car repair videos — since I was about to shoot one of my own. </p><p>Then, before leaving, I also put on a hat, just in case people recognized me. </p><p>It turned out to be a good decision, as almost everyone on the bus was talking about the sudden retirement of Coach Bill and most of the players, and what would that mean for the team. </p><p>Interestingly, not many people were talking about the fight itself, other than the occasional teasing terms. Apparently, they had been more common than I realized. </p><p>Yet, as I continued to move, an alert appeared on my screen, a custom one from my detection. It was news about a plane disappearing in a storm. Interestingly, as I tried to search for that news, they were already gone, replaced by an official explanation that it was just a hoax. </p><p>A frown appeared on my face as I read that. I might have ignored that, but the whole reason I set up my little news crawler was to catch news like that, and the speed it disappeared was rather impressive. </p><p>Especially since there was no follow-up. </p><p>The copy my program made showed that the plane had disappeared in the middle of the ocean, which was good news and bad news at the same time — assuming it was actually linked to this mysterious darkness mentioned by my guide, of course, but at this point, I didn’t have the luxury of assuming the safe option. </p><p>Instead, I turned my attention to the implications, particularly whether it was good or bad that it happened on the other side of the planet, suggesting whatever that was happening was truly not localized, but happened all along the planet. </p><p>Unfortunately, the news didn’t include much about the details of the flight other than the number. I tried to search for it, but they were absent. </p><p>Suspiciously so. </p><p>Then, I checked the flight number, to see the destination and the arrival. Only to come up empty, as whatever was responsibly erasing the news also erased any reference to the flight number.</p><p>Or, such a flight didn’t exist in the first place, but I had a feeling that that wasn’t the case.  </p><p>I took a note to research it further before turning my attention back to the repair videos. </p><p>One task at a time. </p><p>Of course, there was a significant amount of material on the web about repairing classic cars, some with little impact in working conditions but with great importance in general ability, such as finding the right shade of paint, as none of those shades were in production anymore. </p><p>Luckily, that was not exactly a priority for me. I wanted to restore a car, but my aim was not to achieve perfect authenticity, but something resembling it, enough to give an impression of expertise to anyone that watched my show. </p><p>It had been a long while since I discovered that the traits I received were less about actual achievements, and more about the perception of the observers. </p><p>So, as long as I gave the impression of expertise, and achieved a visual approximation, it would be enough. And, if any expert chimed into the live stream to explain just how bad of a job I was doing, even better. </p><p>There was no better thing than some controversy to drive views. </p><p>The second challenge was finding the parts. Unlike the paint, parts were not exactly optional when it came to restoration. Just like the paint, they were not exactly supplied in every shop. Of course, real enthusiasts had many ways of dealing with that, from ordering from the original producers — with some mind-blowing price tags — to scavenging the junkyards — with equally mind-blowing time requirements. </p><p>And I expected the car to need a lot of replacement parts. I had requested Megan that the car needed to be cheap, and for people to sell it cheaply, they should believe it was impossible to be fixed in the first place. </p><p>Yet, even if I could bypass the problem of finding parts, it was only a prerequisite for the real challenge. Making sure the car actually started running. </p><p>And, after my experiences with my old rustbucket, I knew just how hard that was to solve the chronic problems that affected the consistency of the car, enough to make me glad that it was more about farming Intent and Traits, and acquiring a running car was a secondary aim. </p><p>But, as the bus pulled to the target stop, I put my phone back in my pocket, and started walking. The bus was almost empty, which usually meant two things. The place was either in a very poor part of the city, like the areas I grew up, enough to make people afraid of visiting… </p><p>Or like the current one, I thought as I looked around, taking note of the sleek coffee shop, expensive shops filled with designer brands, and other luxuries. </p><p>Extremely rich, enough for me to earn suspicious glares as I walked forward from the surrounding crowd as followed the map. </p><p>Unlike a poor district, however, their suspicious glare was the limit of their attitude. No one walked toward him as he followed the map direction and arrived at one of the side streets. </p><p>Until I came across a small garage, with its greasy and damaged door closed, looking rundown enough to fit into the ghettos rather than the middle of the place. </p><p>The place also looked like it was closed. I hoped it was not a joke from Megan. I rang the doorbell. </p><p>The answer came from the speaker system immediately. “We’re not looking to buy anything. Leave.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Irene, hug him tighter,” came the order soon, and I felt Irene’s arms around my torso tight, her tits pressing on my back hard enough to allow me to distinguish the hardness of her nipples, her sorry excuse of a bra not able to contain them. </p><p>Though, as I faced Ida with my axe raised, the amazing presence of her tits wasn’t the only challenge I faced. Ida often leaned down to get a certain angle she was seeking, which had an impressive impact on her chainmail bikini — especially since in her hurry, she failed to fix it properly, making it drop down much more than it might normally do. </p><p>I didn’t bother trying to disguise where my eyes were pointed, especially since Irene was on my back, unable to see where I was looking. Nor that she felt attentive enough to notice that in the first place, not when her attention was stolen by her own priorities. </p><p>“Raise your leg like you’re trying to kick someone,” Ida ordered. I did. “Higher,” came the next command, and I followed it as well, only for my loincloth to miss alignment. “Irene, fix his underpants,” came the following order immediately, making me grin impishly. </p><p>I grinned, because with my leg raised pointlessly tight, the angle was certainly not a good one for a photograph, but it was certainly good to challenge my deficient costume, evidenced by my shaft peeking from the corner. </p><p>To her credit, Ida managed to contain herself to a few hurried glances, once again relying on the great mental strength given to her by her camera, using it as a totem. </p><p>Irene was a different issue. “M-me,” she stammered helplessly. </p><p>“Yes, he can’t do it himself, not with one leg raised and holding that very heavy axe. Do you want him to fall and injure himself?” Ida responded aggressively — one that was even more intense than necessary. Leaving her on the edge certainly didn’t help her already abrasive attitude behind the camera. </p><p>I could have balanced myself on one foot easily even with the axe in my hands, as a significant portion of my training focused on balance, but since I wasn’t a complete moron, I didn’t say anything, letting the sexy, barely dressed redhead to fix my little wardrobe malfunction. </p><p>And if her trembling fingers accidentally brushed against my shaft once or twice — or five times — I was sure it was completely accidental. </p><p>So were her shocked gasps that warmed my back whenever her fingers brushed against my shaft. </p><p>When her hands started climbing up, there was a certain slowness to them, like they didn’t want to go back, but that was soon replaced by enthusiasm when she put her hands on my midsection, busy caressing my abs as if she was trying to map them. </p><p>Ida made no comment to stop Irene’s actions, instead focusing on her own movements. </p><p>Then, her next order came. “Let’s reverse the position. Irene, stand in front of him. Chad, use one hand to keep the axe in front of her, and put your second hand on her belly to pull her close, tender.” </p><p>Irene took a step back like she was burned. “Isn’t it a bit…” she whispered. </p><p>“It’s the exact same pose you two were holding, just reversed. Where’s the harm,” Ida challenged, one that Irene failed to answer. </p><p>Not because there were no answers to be given, but poor redhead lost all her blood to the full-body blush she was displaying to search and answer, leaving her silently obedient as I turned toward her to wrap my arm around her waist. </p><p>I pulled her a touch harder than necessary, playing the role my costume gave to me efficiently. “N-not that hard,” Irene gasped as she found herself in front of me, our bodies still apart by a couple of inches. </p><p>“Why?” I leaned forward, connecting our bodies, my hand on her belly. More importantly, my shaft burying against her cheeks, her cape a poor insulator. “I’m just playing the role of the barbarian warrior,” I said, letting my smirk widen as I dipped my head down, whispering into her ear. “After all, you’re the one that wrote the character, doesn’t it mean you’re one to blame for anything that happens.” </p><p>Irene froze at the sudden reversal. “M-maybe,” she stammered, unable to reject. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at her reaction. It was hardly the most elaborate and complicated argument even by my standards, but my mostly naked body pressing against hers did most of the convincing. </p><p>Ida’s presence, constantly taking photos, hardly helped. </p><p>“Raise the axe with one hand, and pull her against your body tighter,” she ordered. </p><p>I followed that order immediately, as it was hardly the worst request I had ever received, which buried my shaft into her cheeks even more, making her whimper. “How about it,” I asked. </p><p>“Good, now, drop the axe on the ground and lift her on your shoulders,” Ida ordered. </p><p>“W-wait, what,” she gasped in shock, but it only went halfway before it got terminated as I put the axe on the floor and grabbed her waist, easily lifting her and putting it on my shoulder, still keeping her horizontal. The pressure of her tits against my shoulder was certainly welcome. “Chad, please!” she gasped, but that was followed by an involuntary laughter, loud enough to fill the room. </p><p>“Raise her up even more,” Ida ordered. “Balance her just on your hands and show me your strength,” Ida ordered. </p><p>I wondered whether Ida was aware it was an easy task for me, or she lost herself in her task to consider whether it was a risky task in the first place. </p><p>Either way, it didn’t change the fact that it was too much fun for me to risk ruining the mood by asking that question. Especially since it was trivial in the first place. For me, lifting Irene was simply trivial. </p><p>“N-noo,” Irene gasped, her voice between shock and laughter, but a glance upward showed that she closed her eyes firmly in panic. </p><p>“Good, keep her in place,” Ida said as she walked closer, her camera working overtime. One had on her shoulder, the other on her firm thigh, it was not the most unpleasant chore, especially since gravity worked wonders to move her costume due to its lack of proper support, giving me a glimpse of her beautiful breasts. </p><p>A rather impressive view, I noted, especially when accompanied by her delighted shrieks. “L-let me go, I have a fear of heights,” she stammered, her eyes getting even more firmly closed. </p><p>“Just a minute,” Ida said as she pressed her camera more, walking closer as she did so. In the beginning, I had assumed it was just because she wanted to get a better view. </p><p>Then, Ida showed that I underestimated just how much her courage was boosted by a camera in hand. When she reached in front of me, I certainly didn’t expect her next action to collapse on her knees even as she pushed my loincloth to the side, giving herself an excellent view of my shaft. </p><p>And she didn’t stay as an observer and leaned forward. One hand stayed around her camera, pressing the shutter occasionally, but it was not pointing anywhere, just making some noise to distract. </p><p>I tightened my grip on Irene just in case she opened her eyes to catch a glimpse of the scene, afraid of how she might react if she opened her eyes. Yet, that turned out to be an unnecessary attempt, as Irene kept her eyes shut…</p><p>Even as I felt a certain warmth around my girth. </p><p>With that, I couldn’t help but gaze down, seeing Ida’s tiny mouth already around my shaft going back and forth, barely one-fourth to the distance at her apex as she did her best not to make any suspicious sound. </p><p>The location of her free hand was even more interesting. It had long slipped under her skirt, teasing her nakedness. </p><p>I took a deep breath, not knowing what to enjoy more, the comfortable weight of Irene as I felt the weight of her half-naked body — the way her clothing reacted to the unexpected angle of gravity doing its best to remove the qualifier half, but not succeeding — on my palms or the way Ida’s lips were stretching around my girth while the angle gave me an amazing show. </p><p>A tough battle, especially as Ida did her best to push her limits, but the fact that she tried to keep her voice down prevented her from being adventurous enough to challenge her other friends that completed the same challenge. </p><p>Not that it bothered me. After all, we had all night to work on that to make sure she caught up with her friends. </p><p>Ida continued steadily, her finger on the camera getting slower and slower as she got distracted. I didn’t say anything, curious whether she would stop, or Irene would open her eyes first. </p><p>In the end, neither happened. Irene whimpered helplessly instead. “Please, let me go down,” she begged.</p><p>For a moment, Ida didn’t react, which gave me the impression that she had no intention of stopping. Yet, she surprised me when she raised her gaze, catching mine before she pulled slowly back, a naughty smirk on her face. </p><p>“Payback,” she mouthed without making any sound, leaving my shaft free. </p><p>“Naughty,” I mouthed back, amused at the fact that she used the opportunity to reverse my little trick, once again using Irene as an excuse. </p><p>Ida stood up and grabbed her camera again, but didn’t bother fixing my loincloth. Well, if she was under the impression that it was a problem for me, she was mistaken. </p><p>“You can lower her,” Ida said, her domineering tone back. I flipped Irene easily and lowered her back to her feet, once again in front of me, unable to see my state of nudity. </p><p>“That was … scary,” Irene gasped, but her breathing was more excited than scared. </p><p>An excellent mood to push forward even more.</p>",
