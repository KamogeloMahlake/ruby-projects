    "content": "<p>Pearyin’s arms were tight around me as we kissed, seeing the comfort of the physical release. The opportunity to tease her was tempting, but I decided to ignore it. With everything going on, she was too fragile, and required comforting more than pleasure…</p><p>I started kissing her neck gently even as I rubbed her back, signaling to her that I would not go. Her arms around me stayed strong even as she shuddered with pleasure. It was not like her, showing just how much she was unsettled by it. </p><p>“Sweetie. I can’t comfort you if you don’t let me go,” I whispered, but only after a few minutes. A blush crept to her cheeks, and then her arms around me weakened.</p><p>“Sorry—“ she started, but I interrupted her with a searing kiss that left her breathless. </p><p>“Nothing to be sorry for,” I replied, happy to see her losing that desperation. “But, if you want to pay back, why don’t you put on a little show for me.” </p><p>She received the message as she took a step behind, and started dancing. It wasn’t the first time I asked her to put on a show for me, but this time, it was more beautiful, more enchanting. Her cultivation added a flexible charm to her dance. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I whispered as her hands traveled down, caressing her breasts over her clothing, while subtly unlacing its front. Her cleavage widened slowly along with my smile, tempting me to interrupt her dance. </p><p>I ignored that temptation for one important reason. I could see her desperation slowly receding as she danced and received positive reactions. Her thoughts were transparent. She was lost and afraid, and wanted me to stay with her. She also knew that I had important things to handle to ensure our security. </p><p>Unconsciously, she probably thought that, by proving that she could attract me, she could ensure my return. It was good to finally watch her trying to take some initiative, so I let her. </p><p>Not like watching an erotic dance that was somehow supernaturally enhanced was a punishment. </p><p>She continued dancing even as she shed her clothing, stripping to her underclothes. My eyes widened as I noticed, that rather than wearing something practical, she had been wearing a transparent silk shirt that looked incredible. </p><p>Someone had been prepared for my arrival. </p><p>I smirked, and her expression turned as delicious as her body covered with transparent silk. She blushed, feeling self-conscious about her attempt at planned seduction, but it made her dance even more alluring. </p><p>She was innocent and sexy at the same time. The perfect balance. </p><p>Once she got rid of all her clothes other than the silk set, I gestured to her to move closer. She stilled. “Don’t stop dancing,” I asked. </p><p>She followed it while I picked a rock and sat. Once she approached, the dance turned into a beautiful mixture of lap dance and an epic show. I wanted to watch it for hours … but also, I wanted to unwrap my present immediately. </p><p>“I could watch you forever, but,” I whispered. </p><p>“But, you need to leave,” she completed, her desolation back. </p><p>“No, I can’t resist such a beautiful dance,” I said as I grabbed her silk dress and ripped it off aggressively. It was not only fun, but also it showed Pearyin that she was successful in tempting me. </p><p>“Oh,” she moaned as I grabbed her waist as tightly as her desperate hug earlier while I pushed my pants down. Her back arched as I wrapped her, her body begging for my touch more than anything else. </p><p>I could have slipped inside her easily, but that would mean ignoring another opportunity for her to ‘serve’ me. I  pushed her on her knees. “Open your mouth, and serve me,” I ordered. </p><p>Her lips parted open readily, her smile beautiful before it was destroyed by my push. I was immediately between her lips, pushing back and forth as I invaded her throat mercilessly. Another benefit of cultivation, she took it like a champion despite her inexperience, her moans rippling around my shaft. </p><p>Spectacular. </p><p>Her lips tightened, increasing my pleasure even more. I grabbed her hair hard, pushing her down, which only made her moan harder as I tickled the depths of her throat. </p><p>I couldn’t help but appreciate the difference between her and Aisnam. With Aisnam, even if we played around sometimes, there was no doubt she always believed herself to be the dominant and superior party. </p><p>Not a complaint, as it was still incredible, but I appreciated the variety. </p><p>I soon abandoned that track and returned to the present, letting myself be distracted by the pleasure. I focused on what mattered. </p><p>Our pleasure. </p><p>When I pulled out, I pushed her against the cave wall and took her from behind aggressively. She moaned as I invaded her wetness, the way our flesh clapped making me glad that we were in the middle of the wilderness. </p><p>“You’re beautiful, and you’re mine,” I whispered even as one of my hands trailed her spine, climbing gently with great contrast to my merciless invasion. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she moaned back. “I’m yours.” </p><p>I pulled out and flipped her so that her back was against the cave wall. I slipped inside her again, but I came face to face with her. “Then, believe me when I say I won’t discard you,” I whispered. </p><p>Everything until now suggested that there was some kind of supernatural higher power that saddled her with me, so there was no guarantee that I would succeed. From one perspective, the feeling of being toyed with was annoying … but considering everything fate could deliver, some kind of sexy super cultivator obsessed with pleasuring me was hardly the worst. </p><p>I would even say it was very near the top.  </p><p>“I believe you, sir,” she said as her legs wrapped around me. At the same time, her hips started to rock with a shockingly alluring pattern that was supposed to be impossible with her current leverage, showing another benefit of her new cultivation. </p><p>I soon exploded inside her, but her hips didn’t slow down even for a second. “More, sir. Please,” she begged. </p><p>I complied. “Five more minutes,” I whispered, but I had a feeling that it would be even longer… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I moved to the outskirts of the city, I received the first benefit of the storage ring. I put the recently acquired book in it and passed the security checkpoints easily before leaving the capital behind. Could have escaped the city regardless? Certainly, but I wanted to test my newest toy. </p><p>I didn’t pull the book out immediately after I had comfortably arrived at the outskirts. I had other chores to handle. First, I stopped by my hiding spot and took the talisman supplies and various items with me including the two remaining spirit stones, happy that I no longer needed to leave them lying around but keep them with me in an emergency. </p><p>My second stop was the tunnel leading to the capital. I gathered some more cursed Qi, wondering whether I would discover the reason that Cursed Qi stayed around like a bubble rather than dispersing widely once I started reading the formation book. </p><p>Then, I started pulling cursed Qi, preparing for another visit to Pearyin. I was much more reluctant to steal Qi after the mysterious trapped being spoke to me, showing that not only it was alive and conscious, but also it had a rudimentary awareness of what had been going on, but leaving Pearyin to starve was not an option. </p><p>I gathered the Qi into a tight ball, this time, confidently gathering a hundred strands into a tight orb. I had tested with fifty the day before and it worked well, so I decided to risk it. The journey went without a problem — thankfully — and when I arrived, Pearyin was still sitting cross-legged, lost to the world. </p><p>I replenished the Qi for the chained talisman-based purifier and checked its output before I interrupted her, and when the task was finished, I turned my attention to her. </p><p>“Hello, beautiful,” I called, breaking her meditation, but only after making sure an interruption wouldn’t cause an accident. “Why don’t you come here and give me a hug.” </p><p>“H-hello, sir,” she answered, her beautiful face brightening with a smile as she stood up. She closed the distance with an excited step, faster than I expected. I kissed her, she murmured in satisfaction, but I didn’t miss the way her arms wrapped around me a bit too tight, showing her distress. </p><p>That part wasn’t shocking. Being a cultivator might have been a dream for her, but not in the same way being a martial artist was a dream. In a way, for her, being a martial artist was like a homeless person getting an executive-level job, with enough money to buy a nice house, representing safety and security. </p><p>Cultivation represented winning the lottery, riches too far from her comprehension that it became more comforting than scary … in a country with lax security, where any criminal might attempt to rob those riches with impunity if it was known. </p><p>And, admittedly, abandoning her in a cave with strict instructions wasn’t exactly the best way to help her process that revelation. I kept hugging her even when she pulled back from the kiss and rested her head against my chest, listening to my breathing. </p><p>I wanted to sigh, but I held it back, afraid that she would misunderstand and think it was about her rather than the situation. </p><p>Still, it was not all bad. Even with all my System-provided improvements, I wasn’t equipped to deal with a cultivator-backed martial artist war that I somehow continued to end up getting involved in after several attempts of pulling back. I had no doubt that, someone with the proper training — and perspective about the local dynamics — even with a fraction of my tools, could have dealt with the crisis already. </p><p>Consoling a woman feeling distressed was different. It was my true area of expertise, particularly if the lady in question was already familiar with me. I let her keep hugging me even as I sat in a corner, leaning against the wall while my hand drew small circles on her back. </p><p>As for pushing for more, I avoided it. As much as I enjoyed her enthusiasm in the bed if I initiated something, she would see it as an opportunity to serve me to prove herself, which would foster an even deeper codependency. </p><p>Even at its best, dealing with a clingy girlfriend was a frustrating experience. I didn’t want to experience that if the girlfriend in question — or whatever Pearyin thinks herself as — had not only the ability to cultivate, but do so in a way that was exceptional even among the cultivators of this world. </p><p>Her dantian was still absorbing Qi, with no end in sight, which meant she had yet to properly stop into the first stage, yet the passive improvement she had received was more than I did when I reached the Qi Gathering Second stage. </p><p>Certainly not the ideal obsessive stalker to have. </p><p>I let her hug me, her tenseness disappearing slowly. She didn’t seem inclined to speak, and I acquiesced to her wordless request. One hand stayed on her back, gently caressing her back while she purred. At the same time, I pulled the book from the storage ring. </p><p>Pearyin didn’t react to it, as she had seen me do more amazing things. </p><p>I opened the book. The first page had some information about the book, outlining how the disciples that were lucky enough to touch this book should thank three elders who had gone all that trouble compiling a book to teach them, and hoped that they would contribute to the eternal glory of the Nabata sect, which would stand strong for hundreds of thousand years. </p><p>The irony: it was the sect that had been destroyed by that mad swordsman Xantum. </p><p>Still, that fact was comforting for two reasons. It showed that it was unlikely the owner would come looking, as they had bigger problems. Also, it explained the source neatly, coming from the ruins of the mansion that had been destroyed. </p><p>That fact renewed my desire to raid the auction house, maybe even the royal treasury. Who knew what other valuable items they picked from there. </p><p>Still, rather than dreaming about the treasures hidden there, I started reading the book, hoping that it would share some similarities with Talisman Crafting to allow me to make quick progress, and fearing that it would be like the first time I had tried to understand the meditation technique and comprehend nothing. </p><p>The answer, it turned out, was somewhere in the middle. Talismans and formations had nothing in common — well, at least, if they did, it was not something I could identify immediately other than both using Calligraphy as a foundational skill to draw the necessarily complicated symbols. In essence, talismans were cultivation spells, suspended in a medium through special tools and methods. </p><p>Technically, it was possible to convert spells to talismans, and reverse. I wasn’t able to do that, because I knew nothing about how to use spells, let alone create them. </p><p>Formations were … different. As different as computer programming and organic chemistry. At least, what I could remember from the college classes I attended, which wasn’t much. As a student-athlete, I only attended classes after four hours of exhausting morning training, and most of those classes passed in a haze. </p><p>I spent four hours reading, just to get a general idea of how they worked, which was possible due to the book being written as an actual primer for beginners. </p><p>At its very core, formations were like computer programs, very temperamental computer programs with certain parts only worked under various circumstances, requiring the cultivator to assess and understand every single detail about the environment. Setting even the most rudimentary formation was an effort that would take weeks. </p><p>I continued reading, hoping that, just like talismans, greater expertise would allow me to set the faster. </p><p>Then, I continued browsing, trying to understand how to set up intricate arrangements, etched onto various hard surfaces to channel Qi appropriately to unleash unique features they were designed to do, whether to collect, refine, or store Qi, create barriers, unleash devastating attacks, even provide passive security that would selectively allow people to access.</p><p>One good thing was that, unlike talismans that required very delicate materials, formations worked on a variety of items, because they didn’t need to hold Qi. That was one big advantage of their stability. Of course, the book still went over the advantages and disadvantages of various materials, like spiritual jade working orders of magnitude better than ordinary rock, but that part, I didn’t care at the moment. </p><p>The advantages and constraints I operated under were completely different from others. </p><p>Unfortunately, as the darkness started to arrive, I was yet to achieve anything but understand the index of the book, showing once again that learning cultivation arts required not only some kind of unique aptitude, but also years and years of effort. </p><p>Or, a way to cheat. </p><p>It was why, before I left, I wrote another letter from Aisnam’s mysterious allies, one that told the story of an intercepted delivery along with some other details, and asked her to make the best of her opportunity. If Aisnam could learn it, I could in turn benefit from System lessons. </p><p>I closed the book and put it back on, ready to leave. “I’ll see you tomorrow, sweetie,” I said as I kissed her. She responded, but when I tried to pull back, her lips stayed connected. </p><p>“Don’t go yet,” she whispered gently. </p><p>“As you wish,” I chuckled and kissed her again, this time with far more passion. I didn’t want to initiate it so as not to feel indebted to her … but it was a different issue when she was the one to demand it, even gently.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Excellent,” I muttered even as I twirled the broken ring on my finger. I had been hopeful about the ring, but the reward still shocked me. </p><p>A storage ring. </p><p>I moved to the nearest empty room I could detect, and put four protection wards to block any potential Qi flow before I reached my Inventory. A ring popped into my palm. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I muttered as I examined it slowly. It was certainly a lucky discovery. It solved my biggest problem, that whenever I had to remove anything from my Inventory, I had no way of putting it back on, forcing me to constantly hide things around like a squirrel. </p><p>I was happy that I had a solution to that. Now, I could just bring them along. </p><p>As for its value, I didn’t even want to imagine it. Not only was it a bona-fide artifact, but also a rare one. Even though it was merely a Profound-Low Grade ring, it would cost thousands of spiritual stones, unlike a talisman of the same grade. </p><p>“Now, it’s time to take ownership,” I said as I reached my Qi. I didn’t know much about artifacts, but I knew that subduing them required blood and subdued Qi, even the weakest artifact taking a few strands, while some of the truly strong ones required months, maybe even years to properly control. </p><p>Even with my abundant Qi, I was ready to work hard for hours until I could establish a rudimentary link … but when my Qi touched, I felt the space, enough to hold about ten gallons of liquid, accessible mentally. </p><p>“Cheating is fun,” I muttered as I realized that, just like Qi strands, artifacts came properly subdued. </p><p>A fascinating advantage. I hooked the ring to a chain and put it on my neck, making it less noticeable. It was not the largest space, but I didn’t need a lot of space to hold pills, talisman materials, gold, and spirit stones. </p><p>A gallon of water might not be impressive, but a gallon of gold was a completely different matter. A gold piece was barely five grams, and a gallon of pure gold was almost a hundred and sixty pounds. Converted, a gallon of gold represented about twenty thousand gold pieces. </p><p>A nice pocket change … especially since I still had my Inventory for more.</p><p>Speaking of it, the ring was also a good excuse in case I had to access my Inventory. Revealing the existence of a storage ring was not ideal, but it was much better than showing I had a wondrous ability like Inventory despite being a Qi Gathering cultivator. </p><p>Arousing the curiosity of strong cultivators was not a smart idea. </p><p>I collected the protection talismans and put them into the storage ring, happy to watch them disappear. “Excellent,” I muttered as I returned to the auction house, repeating the same trick several times. </p><p>I received a nice haul, but nothing fascinating. I played my role well, but even when frustrated, most of them didn’t give out their gifts. Some didn’t care about my plight, and some were willing to bring those useless stuff with them even if they moved out. Not that I could blame them. </p><p>Worse, not every successful acquisition resulted in a treasure. More than half of the items I had identified were actually martial artist tools, and they were merely tainted by Qi. And, since none of the sellers had high cultivation, ten times return only resulted in repaired weapons of the same rank. </p><p>Admittedly, it wasn’t horrible. They might be martial artists' weapons, but a profound Medium-Grade weapon was still a dangerous treasure. If auctioned, it would easily go for several thousand gold pieces, maybe even higher depending on the purchaser. </p><p>Unfortunately, at this point, it wasn’t worth my effort. Mortal economy didn’t have much use to me. </p><p>Luckily, the day was not a waste. The storage ring alone was worth dedicating a far longer time, and I also received a few talismans — my skill meant that I was able to identify them successfully even in their ruined state. </p><p>I had managed to get some kind of lightning talisman, another flame talisman of higher quality, a shield talisman that was geared for direct combat, and most importantly, a concealment talisman. I still needed to study them to learn how to draw them, but it didn’t make them any less valuable. </p><p>Then, sometimes, my luck rewarded me. “Thank you, great master,” I said as I grabbed the broken dagger the middle-aged man had in hand. He thought himself to be a martial arts genius, with a desire to develop a masterful dagger art. </p><p>He clearly lacked the ability, the willpower, and the intelligence to achieve that, but I didn’t care about it.</p><p>My eyes were on the reward. </p><p>[Pity Bonus - 10 (Capped)]</p><p>[10x Return - Qi-Enhanced Dagger, Damaged, Profound Peak-Grade]</p><p>“I’m sure an enthusiastic young man like you would do wonders when inspired with a tool like this,” he said. </p><p>“Yes, great master,” I said and departed. I was happy with the dagger, as a cultivator weapon, even a damaged one, was a treasure. I didn’t have a proper dagger technique to maximize its value, but even without it, it was a valuable advantage. </p><p>Unfortunately, he was the last candidate I had identified on the line. I threw one last glance at the royal auction house. While walking around, I also learned that they weren’t planning to hold an auction for a while, which further my willingness to rob them further. If they held an auction, I might have considered buying them — well, making a rich woman buy them as a gift — but since that route was not available, I decided to put my hands on it directly. </p><p>Hopefully, I would find a much larger variety of talismans. </p><p>Of course, I wouldn’t rob them in the middle of the day. Nighttime was a far better time.</p><p>However, just as I was about to leave, I noticed a trio of Tiger Fist members walking away from the auction house, one in the middle of a thick book with a dense Qi imprint that he tried to keep hidden but failed. Two of them were connate realm martial artists — though they tried to look merely at Skin Refinement — and the one in the middle was a young man at the peak of Muscle Refinement. </p><p>A young master and his guards. </p><p>The ensemble was impressive enough, but what really caught my attention was their attitude. They tried to look casual, but they weren’t particularly successful. The two Connate Realm experts were tense as they subtly checked the environment, while the young master was vibrating with nervous excitement. </p><p>Whatever was in their hands must be pretty valuable for them to react that way. </p><p>I followed them from a distance, and when they chose to take a shortcut, I pulled my newest essence sword from my inventory, and rushed from behind, and before they could react, I stole the book from the young man. </p><p>“How dare you!” the connate realm artists moved to attack me, but I forced one of them to stay back by throwing a knife at the young man they were tasked to guard. </p><p>“Follow him! He stole the tribute!” the young man shouted, and one of the connate guards chased me. </p><p>I could have escaped easily if I had used my full speed. But, I didn’t forget my aim of ruining the relationship between the Tiger Fist and the Royal family. And, leaving them to look all the wrong places was a fun idea. </p><p>So, I ran toward the palace, letting the guard catch up with me a couple times … and deflecting him using the Imperial Sword, making sure he pinned me as a royal guard. And, once I arrived at one of the secret entrances to the palace ground, I made sure to avoid his gaze before I used my full speed, and rapidly left the city, leaving him to think I went into the palace ground. </p><p>Only after I had left the city, I checked the book. My eyes widened. </p><p>It was a book on the basics of Formation Design. A beginner book, but a complete legacy. </p><p>No wonder they were so excited!</p><p>“What an interesting turn of fate…” I muttered as I examined the book for a moment before I put it into my storage ring. Once again, a lucky encounter that defied any reasonable understanding of probability. </p><p>More interestingly, I realized that any such ‘lucky’ encounter had the potential to drive my conflict deeper with Tiger Fist, and likely the force behind them as well. It was far from the first time I was dragged into that conflict, and at this point, I flat-out refused to believe that it was an accident. </p><p>Karma, fate, or anything else… Something was driving me to that conflict.</p><p>I sighed and stopped thinking about it. Unfortunately, I had tasks more urgent than solving the working of the mysterious principles of the universe… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The changes capital had gone through in a mere day since I saved Pearyin were enough to be classified as shocking. The Tiger Fist Disciples filled the streets, patrolling every part of the city like they were the royal soldiers. </p><p>Arguably, they were looking for me and Pearyin, who, according to the gossip, ambushed their brave commanders cowardly before escaping. Quite a bit different than I remembered. And, even if that was true, it didn’t explain why they were getting exorbitant protection fees from every shop, and beating any dared to resist. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly looting, but it wasn’t too far away from it. </p><p>I didn’t feel any guilt even as I saw the army filling the streets. What they were doing was a dare, one that required a response from the Royal family. Tiger Fists were not soft-hearted to something like that for a couple Bone Forging realm members, and even if they had been, looting wasn’t exactly a necessity. </p><p>No, combined with the hidden Connate Realm experts they had brought with them to build the fortress, it was clear that they had bigger ambitions than taking revenge, and they were just using an excuse. With one notable exception, I didn’t have any good feelings toward the royal family. It was their mess to clean up. </p><p>I still walked around, looking to see if I could get a nice opportunity. Tiger Fist Disciples demanded a lot of money or other items of clear value, and not everyone had such liquidity, so they had been desperately selling stuff. </p><p>Stuff that included collector items like broken cultivator items. Since they required inspection from experts — as well as willing buyers — the disciples weren’t interested in taking them. They preferred cold cash. </p><p>It was a good opportunity for me for some bargain shopping. At a minimum, I wanted to buy some useless talismans, which then I could reverse engineer. A few empty talisman papers and other craft items wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>However, that was just the worst case. The sudden flux was an excellent opportunity to go back to my roots and swindle some people for valuable items. All I needed was to make them pity me, or better, insult me in an indirect way. </p><p>Pity was an interesting emotion, one that I had learned a lot, both after my injury that ruined my career as an athlete, and after my summoning during my stint as a beggar. Pity came from a combination of empathy, combined with a sense of superiority. </p><p>Of course, my experiences with Elsana and Aisnam had shown a much more productive — and fun — way of eliciting pity before turning that into pampering, but it required a lot of preparation and good timing; and the rewards required careful balancing. </p><p>Acting as an unlucky beggar offered many other possibilities. Naturally, I didn’t plan to be dressed as an actual beggar. Even in their most content time, it was hard for a rich noble to feel empathy toward a poor beggar properly, let alone when they were actually worried about their own lives. </p><p>They would gut a beggar without blinking. </p><p>Luckily, at this point, my quick-change ability, combined with all the junk I had in my inventory, allowed me to respond to the situation quickly without too much preparation. </p><p>First, I disguised myself as a nondescript young scholar with dusty and slightly ripped clothes, which was a flexible identity that I was comfortable with. Also, it gave me the flexibility to buy or beg for any paper-based scrap, particularly if they weren’t aware of its true value. </p><p>Then, I went toward the royal auction house. There was a huge line in front of it, with many nobles and merchants with piles of items. </p><p>“… Please, esteemed master. You can’t be serious. Just five coins. I purchased it for three hundred gold pieces last month. Check your records please.” </p><p>“That was between you and the auctioneer. Now, you’re selling it to us directly. Feel free to pay a gold piece deposit and we will try to auction,” the employee explained smugly. And, he wasn’t the only employee doing so. In front of the auction house, they had set almost fifty desks, each with a line of anxious merchants and minor nobles, many with either no martial skills or merely in the Initiate realm. </p><p>Money bought a lot of things, but it didn’t buy safety. </p><p>Still, I was surprised by the reaction of the royal auction house, which was another reflection of the attitude of the royal family. Not only they didn’t try to moderate the Tiger Fist army, but also they were actually trying to rob their citizens. </p><p>Interesting stance, but nothing more than passing curiosity. Even before Aisnam’s little summary, I had realized how insignificant was the mortal kingdoms. Understanding the true scale of the world drove that message even deeper. Even if I wanted to help the unlucky people, all I needed was to raise Aisnam to the Foundation Establishment Realm. </p><p>I took a position near the line, trying to feel a hint of Qi on the broken items they were trying to trade, trying to get a hint of Qi from them. It was hard to detect Qi from a distance while trying to stay hidden, but the long lines allowed me to walk to them and examine their items. They were more than happy to get a second opinion. </p><p>The royal guards weren’t as happy. “Hey, you can’t just try to buy anything here!” one of them said as he moved toward me. </p><p>“Please, my lord. I’m just looking for a gift so I can impress my master. I’m going to buy only one item.” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter. You can’t intervene with the business of the royal auction house. Now, go away—” he started, only to fall silent when I bowed down, but using it to flash a small pouch. His hand moved far faster than her cultivation suggested. </p><p>His bribe-taking skill would have been at Major Immersion if the world had recognized it as a skill. </p><p>He checked the contents quickly, and his eyes widened when he realized there were coins inside. Still, he schooled his expression, ready to fish for more. I didn’t want to deal with him for long. “Please, sir,” I said as I grabbed his hand. </p><p>He smiled smugly, his ego boosted by my move, but soon, his eyes widened. I squeezed his hand, hard enough to tell him that I was much stronger than him. “Alright, but you can only buy one item. And, I need to check it beforehand,” he said. Then, he paused, and added with a whisper. “And, you can’t get it back if you don’t buy anything.” </p><p>Carrot and stick was a devastating combination as always. </p><p>I nodded. “Thank you, brave soldier,” I said. I didn’t bother arguing about the item limit. In the end, I wasn’t planning to buy anything useful while on the line, even if I had seen several valuable items. </p><p>Either they would fail to sell, which then I could target them in a way that would trigger the System under an appropriate identity, or I could just rob the auction house for things that would be useful without multipliers. </p><p>Under different circumstances, robbing the auction house was too high profile, and would have incited a chase that I could live without, but right now, the Royal family wouldn’t have dared to do so, afraid that it was a trap for them. </p><p>I might even frame Tiger Fist for it, which would make the lives of my enemies even harder. </p><p>Half an hour later, I had managed to identify several dozen items that had the potential to be useful after the System. Unfortunately, there were only a couple items that had the potential to be useful without a System bonus, and even then, it was only because my talisman skill was high enough to learn from them. </p><p>The first one I decided to target was a ruined ring. It was too mangled for me to even begin understanding what it was supposed to be used, but it was being sold by a woman in her fifties, who had just argument with the employee that she would rather throw it away than sell it for three gold, and left angrily. </p><p>“Damned bastards, how dare they,” she muttered as she walked away. “I just needed to get enough gold to pay my idiot son’s debt…” she muttered. “Damn those Tiger Fist bastards and their grubby fingers.” </p><p>She was the easiest target imaginable. </p><p>I moved forward until I was in an alley that would cut her path. “… I know, mother. But I don’t even have money to buy her a gift after those Tiger Fist bastards destroyed our shop and stole our money. I can’t even give her a token gift. How can I ask her not to break the engagement,” I said, doing my best to sound proud and pitiful at the same time as I burst out of the alley, and collided against her.</p><p>Her ring flew off. “Sorry, madam,” I said as I grabbed the ring and bowed in front of her. “Please forgive me. I wasn’t myself.” </p><p>As I did so, I embodied the type of ideal young man, the kind that every mother nagged her son to be. She was particularly vulnerable to it because of her son’s most recent failure — who was clearly a moron since he dared to gamble with what essentially was an invasion force. He was lucky to lose, as winning in such a situation would have ended worse. </p><p>“Keep it, young man,” she said. </p><p>“But —” I started, but she wrapped my fingers. </p><p>“Take it as a little token from an old woman. I heard you,” she said as she squeezed my fingers, and walked away. </p><p>Leaving a very happy young man behind. </p><p>[Pity Bonus - 10 (Capped)]</p><p>[10x Return - Storage Ring, Profound Low-Grade]</p>",

    "content": "<p>When I returned to the bar, Tara greeted me. “Everything is as usual, sir. There’s nothing out of order. While there had been a few henchmen that drifted close, none of them got closer than two blocks.” </p><p>“Excellent work,” I said as I caressed her cheek, her blush beautiful as the compliment triggered her kink excellently. “Now, while I’m here, I want you to go and rest. You deserve a nap,” I said. I wanted to reward her more viscerally, but I could see that she was tired mentally. Leaving her alone at the bar and asking her to be responsible was taking a toll on her. </p><p>I needed to get a better security method. I had the cash for it, but the problem, I didn’t trust any high-end security provider to sell me something without a backdoor. </p><p>I immediately started checking the national news, trying to find where Daria had gone, but I failed to find any news … but as I had been searching, one of the keywords brought a brand new article. </p><p>Blue Princess was floating in the middle of the ocean, helping the evacuation after an oil rig explosion. She wasn’t the only hero doing so, but she was clearly the most high-profile one. The oil rig was burning intensely while she evacuated it … but there was something that was wrong with that oil rig. </p><p>Unfortunately, the grainy news footage was not the best way to identify that. I was tempted to overdrive my power, but after a momentary consideration, I decided against it. I couldn’t let my early success blind me to the fact that the day was still long. </p><p>That, and since discovering that function, I was starting to act lazy, relying on it at first rather than focusing more. Instead, I saved the videos to my hard drive in case they were removed — it wouldn’t be the first superhero footage that had been censored — before I started searching for other oil rig and ship accidents, trying to see what exactly was different between them that I felt something was wrong. </p><p>It turned out there was plenty, but as I compared them, I was quick to catch what had triggered me first. It was the actions of the rig employees. They were too professional as they evacuated. At first, I assumed that it was that they were well-trained, but as I went through the other disasters, none of the tanker and rig personnel had such amazing performance. </p><p>The closest to it was the military ship accidents, with everyone knowing exactly what to do when facing a great emergency … but even they weren’t as good as the rig employees. The efficiency they moved was incredible. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to get to a conclusion. They were performing like a group that not only trained well, but also expected a disaster like that to happen. There was no shock, just the competency from weekly drills. </p><p>I didn’t know what they were doing there, but they were certainly not looking for oil.</p><p>Once I reached that conclusion, the rest of the events were easier to connect. I already knew that Daria had worked together with Rosa, chasing the person responsible for the weapons the Syndicate had been selling, and they had been doing so for the services of the super rather than to stop the trade. Therefore, it wasn’t hard to guess that the oil rig belonged to one of their allies — or at least, someone they were trying to turn into an ally. </p><p>Considering the limits they were operating under, both in terms of money and other support, I was more inclined to believe that it was the second option. Still, for the moment, that was all I could dig around. I had already learned all I could from that video without Emily’s assistance, and I wasn’t sure I wanted to involve her immediately. </p><p>While the reports from the now-defunct Giant Force had been very useful, they also showed that she was getting reckless as she discovered the new facets of her power. I was afraid that she would poke the wrong source and bring even bigger trouble for me. </p><p>No, the oil rig disaster could wait. </p><p>Instead, I turned my attention to my next objective. The toy I had picked from the Valley Mall, one with the puzzle that had been leading to whatever secret stash was supposed to be under the junkyard. And more importantly, showing where that supposed hero was.</p><p>At the headquarters of the New Giant Force. </p><p>Knowing Dalia and her ally were looking for the same hero was both a relief, and a source of stress. It was a source of relief, as I was rather fascinated by a hero who could create high-tech weaponry, and particularly what they could do for me. </p><p>So-called Chrome Defender was a good example. Clearly a spoiled kid with next to no training, and even worse combat instincts, yet he put a credible threat against Tara. In the end, she took him down easily, but only because we had two big advantages. My power allowed me to pinpoint weaknesses in his weapons and style that even he wasn’t aware of…</p><p>And, he was extremely reluctant to damage the warehouse — though learning that they had some kind of teleporter there explained their extreme reluctance — which allowed Tara to restrict his more destructive abilities as she closed in and dealt with him. </p><p>That was with a reckless, overconfident moron controlling it. Even without my power, I would have done much better… </p><p>Assuming, of course, I was able to get help from the mysterious tinker in the first place to create a similar armor for me.</p><p>Of course, when I had discovered the mystery of the puzzle, I had promptly ignored it after checking the safe house under the junkyard and discovering it was under observation. I wanted a power armor, but not at the cost of angering both the New Giant Force and the Syndicate to a degree that they might decide to target me even with the mysterious organization targeting me. </p><p>Daria and her ally’s interest gave me another chance. Even with her powers potentially weakening, Daria was more than capable of confronting them, especially since the New Blue Giants had valued their veneer of legitimacy too much to openly coordinate with the Syndicate and target her. </p><p>Maybe I could feed Daria information carefully about the situation, controlling where she was targeting. And, since the Syndicate had no reason to link the sexy redhead that visited my bar to Blue Princess, I should be able to do that relatively safely. </p><p>I was already planning on how to target her toward the junkyard in a way that not only kept me safe, but also managed to escalate the situation step by step. </p><p>With a sigh, I turned on the city map, trying to come up with a reason to make her act while leaving the equipment in the safe house to me … assuming, of course, the Syndicate left the equipment there untouched. It was worth a try… once I went and detected exactly where the mysterious hero genius was being hidden. </p><p> I needed Emily’s help for that, and unlike the previous times, I needed her help in a controlled, directed way. A way that was definitely illegal. </p><p>More importantly, deadly. </p><p>Legally speaking, guilds weren’t exactly consulates with total legal immunity, but in practice, it wasn’t too different. No one would question why someone had tried to infiltrate their building had ‘mysteriously disappeared’. Not the government, not the other heroes; and certainly not the villains, whose implied alliance against heroes did not extend to such behaviors. </p><p>It would take a lot of effort to convince Emily to help me. Luckily, I actually needed to train her in infiltration, and it could be started subtly to achieve that aim. But, I needed an excuse for it …</p><p>I looked at the security cameras, and an idea flashed. Why not bring Emily here so that she could use her power to rewrite the software of the security cams and customize the security in a way that would mesh well with my power. </p><p>Not to mention, it would give me a chance to pay Emily generously, softly linking her with me. Developing a taste for luxuries was a good way to slowly link her deeper to my schemes without scaring her. I just needed to buy some good cameras with poor software and see how well she could do with her touch. </p><p>If it worked as well as I hoped, I might actually have a chance of victory in my little game… </p><p>“I was supposed to be a fake villain, but it doesn’t feel that way,” I muttered, followed by a self-deprecating chuckle. </p><p>Still, that idea wasn’t as scary as it had been just days ago… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well, beautiful. Did you decide how you’re going to pay?” I asked while she continued to tremble in my seat. </p><p>“Pay for what,” she muttered, still dazed. </p><p>“For my skills as a photographer, of course,” I replied as I grabbed her waist once more to pin her against the bike. I had already gathered all the information I could safely get from her from the moment, but I didn’t stop the seduction. While technically it was about making sure I could replicate the trick …</p><p>The real answer was it was incredibly fun. After all, even discounting our identities, she was still a busty, extremely sexy redhead who was currently dressed in nothing but a misaligned skirt and leather boots. Hardly a chore to interact with her. </p><p>“Give me your number,” she whispered. I did, and a moment later, my phone buzzed. I received a photo of her from her back, my body pressing against hers. It showed the beautiful arc of her back as I pulled her head back, but didn’t show her face. </p><p>“One that doesn’t show your pretty face contorted with pleasure. Maybe I should ask for another,” I asked. </p><p>“You have to buy dinner first for that,” she quipped, and I chuckled. She managed to stand up. “I think I need to visit the bathroom first before we go…” she started as she looked at the shop, only to freeze. “D-did you know we had a voyeur,” she whispered. </p><p>“Sweetie,” I said as I slapped her ass. “We have just done it in the parking lot. We’re lucky that we had only one voyeur and the camera is broken,” I said. Her face suddenly lost color, showing that, it was less about exhibitionism and more about losing control. </p><p>I had to admit, the idea tickled my pride. </p><p>“I’m going to the bathroom,” she repeated, blushing. </p><p>“Well, if you say so,” I said. “Do you want to watch as I punish our voyeur,” I added. </p><p>“Punish, how?” she said, her voice suddenly gaining an edge. I realized my misstep. She might be playing along for her own fun, but she was still a hero, and she wouldn’t let a civilian come under harm. Of course, my mistake wasn’t to harm her but to use an ambiguous statement. </p><p>Going forward, I needed to be more careful. “Taking what we are owed, of course,” I said. “She had watched a show of ours. Don’t you think she owes one to us as well?” I asked. </p><p>“You can’t force her,” she said. </p><p>I put my hand on my chest, acting like she had just hit me there. “Honey, you’re insulting me. I never once forced a woman to do that,” I said, then smiled. “You have just sampled my services, do you think I need to? Maybe I misread, and your shouts were a call for help. They were loud enough to qualify, particularly when —” I added, each word making her blush even more. She interrupted me with a punch to my shoulder. </p><p>“That’s enough, I got it!” she said, her head dipping down. </p><p>“Violent much,” I whispered, then I grabbed her chin. Not hard, but gently. “Also, I don’t like being attacked, even jokingly, so be careful,” I whispered, doing my best to be dark and threatening, knowing full well that she would only feel arousal and no threat, once again thanks to her power. “Understood.” </p><p>“Yes,” she whispered, her legs parting slightly, showing that she would be very amenable to another show. </p><p>“Excellent. Now, do you want to punish our wayward cashier,” I whispered. </p><p>At the peak of her arousal, there was only one answer she could give. “Yes.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I hugged her waist and led her inside, not even bothering to give her time to fix her clothing. She tried to do so on the way, pulling and pushing, but she was too distracted to use her power for it, and she was still a sexy mess when we were inside the shop until we stood in front of the sexy blonde cashier. </p><p>Dressed in leather, the cashier was certainly delicious, and her deep blush as she realized she had been caught made it even more fun. The way my current partner looked, didn’t help her contain her blush any.</p><p>A glance was enough to confirm that getting that show wouldn’t be particularly difficult. “You owe us a show,” I declared even as I hugged Daria from behind. </p><p>“I … I beg your pardon,” she replied, looking shocked. </p><p>“My pretty friend here saw you watching us. Didn’t you, sweetie?” I said as I hugged Daria’s waist. It was another subtle trick, making sure she was not just a passive observer but an actual contributor. </p><p>“Y-yes. You were watching us,” Daria said, her tone far too hesitant to be coming from the Lady of Destruction, showing that she was not ready for such a confrontation. </p><p>Not ready, but still wanting, as the arousal was still present. </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I caressed her belly, climbing up until the edge of her breast, which was not covered by her hastily fixed top. She moaned as the pleasure spread through her aching body, and she lost her ability to speak. </p><p>I turned to the cashier. “As you see, she’s very insistent that you have to pay back for seeing her in such a slutty, undignified manner, giving herself to me like a two-dollar hooker in a parking lot,” I whispered, each exciting my sexy redhead even more. </p><p>She once again lost herself in excitement, abandoning herself to the role of a rich girl, the impact of my earlier gaffe gone. Excellent. </p><p>“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do,” the cashier whispered, but she was clearly enjoying our show. </p><p>“Well, you’re a smart girl. You’ll figure it out,” I said, easily reading that she was at the edge. Everything was perfect —</p><p>Until our fun was interrupted by a phone ringing. Daria’s phone, but the ringtone was different. Her eyes popped open as she reached for her phone. Any other girl, any other time, I would have interrupted to not ruin the excellent fun. </p><p>But, one didn’t get in between a superhero and what was clearly an emergency call. “I need to take this,” she whispered as she walked out. I let her go. Outside, she had a brief talk, and mentioned several codes, though it felt more like emergency service codes than spy ones, aiming to condense information rather than hiding it. </p><p>“You’re lucky … or not,” I said as I looked at the cashier, and watched her expression dance between relief and excitement. It looked like she didn’t know which either. “I wonder what you’ll do if we return. Ignore the offer, or decide to continue…” </p><p>With that, I left the store, just as Daria ended the call. “I need to go back to my apartment. It’s an emergency,” she said, her voice leaving no doubt she would seek alternative methods if I didn’t comply. </p><p>“Sure, hop on. What’s another ride,” I said. She didn’t react to innuendo. I didn’t expect her to in the first place. I just said that to keep her from being suspicious. “Do you want me to go a reasonable pace, or as fast as I could go?” </p><p>“Even faster,” she said as she put her helmet on. I put the newly purchased helmet on as well, wondering about the exact nature of the emergency. Since she was willing to drive with me instead of flying directly and ruining her cover, it was not an extreme emergency, but it was clearly not a leisurely task either. </p><p>“Alright, hold on,” I said as I pushed my bike to its limits as I ripped through the city streets. I didn’t even bother with the sudden sharp turns unless they were necessary, though, I noted that while she was afraid of them, she had a far easier time ignoring them when she was focused on the mission. </p><p>It made me realize just how great the difference was between her mission mode and casual attitude … reminding me not to underestimate her even with my incredible success. </p><p>Soon, we parked in front of an apartment building that was even worse than the others that surrounded it, showing that her financials for the mission were even worse than I had expected. “Thanks for the ride,” she said as she jumped down. </p><p>“Not without a kiss,” I said as I removed my helmet, feeling like pushing my luck. Her expression flickered in confusion for a moment, but then she leaned forward, capturing my lips in a kiss. </p><p>It was an aggressive, domineering kiss. It felt very different than the passive and excited kisses she delivered while in disguise. But, as her tongue invaded her mouth, she still gave a lot of signals of attraction, showing that, even in her hero mentality, the attraction wasn’t gone. </p><p>Too bad it didn’t last long. She bounced away soon after, leaving me with an excellent view of her ass as her skirt bounced, the absence of her panties paying incredible dividends. </p><p>I rode away with a big smile. The emergency call might have ruined my plans somewhat, but the day still had been an incredible success… I made contact with the Lady of Destruction, gathered her contacts, and discovered her home. </p><p>And most importantly, I discovered her mission. Now, I needed to decide what to do about it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I woke up to a stirring in my arms. Exhausted, I tightened my arms reflexively, trying to remember where I was, and who was the woman in my arms. A gasp reminded me exactly who. </p><p>I let her go and she moved away. Meanwhile, I tightened my grip over the dragon heart, wondering if it was too early to start working on my cores. The strain of my cores was intense, but using the mana for multiple drops worked as intended. </p><p>They felt strong enough to handle the strain of a breakthrough … hopefully. Unfortunately, I could already see a glimpse of the dawn, which was bad for two reasons. The rain had finally stopped, and it was the best time for scouts to explore the island. Reaching the realm of the mage was hardly subtle. They wouldn’t be able to detect it from the cove, but any magically sensitive scouts they sent would be able to detect it. </p><p>Of course, there would be no problem if they sailed away during the night, but I didn’t consider it a reliable possibility. Since, for some reason, they valued Lillian enough to fight against the pirates led by a very strong and very skilled water mage, they wouldn’t just depart. </p><p>The best case was that they would find the scraps of her dress and believe that she had died. </p><p>“How are you feeling?” I asked Lillian. </p><p>“Worst I ever felt, yet better than I expected,” she answered. “Is that weird?” </p><p>“Not at all. Unfortunately, I know it from experience, and they are never fun,” I said. “My old man trained me well, but it was often painful.” </p><p>“Your father?” she asked. </p><p>“No, my grandfather. I never knew my father, actually. The old man raised me, and while he had done his best … let’s just say he believed in tough love, and his perception of tough had always been warped.” </p><p>“Is this why you chose to path of four elements?” she asked. “It’s not exactly an easy route to take.” </p><p>“Certainly. He had a force of personality that made it impossible to fight against, particularly as a child. I had always thought that it was a stupid path once I was old enough to understand the full implications.” I found myself chuckling. “Who knew the old bag of bones actually had a dragon heart hidden with him?” </p><p>She looked like she wanted to ask more questions, but I felt like walls were tightening around me. It was the first time I actually talked to someone about him after his death … and I didn’t like the sensation. “I’m going to go scouting,” I said. </p><p>“I can come with you. I’m feeling better.” </p><p>“No, I need you to stay in the cave. If you’re in, if another beast arrives, you can kill it easily using the tunnel to your advantage. If you come with me, other beasts will come looking for prey, and we’ll lose our food,” I added. Both excuses were flimsy. The real reason was that I could move far more easily without her presence, but I didn’t want to tell her that. “Meanwhile, I want you to work on your aim,” I said. “Use the far wall as a target, and try to make sure you can hit from the other end with water blades.” </p><p>She nodded, not particularly enthusiastic, but there was a limit I could cater to her feeling. Instead, I moved to the possum we had slain, and pulled two of its bones. “Can you use your water blades to cut them from here,” I said. </p><p>“I can, but why?” </p><p>“They will make decent daggers,” I said as I swung them testing their balance to determine the best spot to cut them. Not exactly great weapons, but much better than the spear. </p><p>She followed my directions and used her magic to cut them. “Good. Just focus on your training, but pay attention to the entrance. I will be back soon.” </p><p>With that, I locked the dragon heart back into its box and climbed the steep entrance. I could have left the dragon heart with her, but with her mana renewed, there were few immediate benefits for her. And, I might face a danger that would force me to use all four elements at the same time. The ability to replenish my mana would likely be the distinction between life and death. </p><p>I would need the mana because the inner parts of the island had much thicker vegetation. The concealment would allow me to deal with several mages with relative ease as long as they decided to split for faster searching, provided I could use dragon heart to replenish my mana in between.</p><p>I wondered if anyone else decided to use a dragon heart as a battlefield supplement rather than a very precious training tool that they could use to raise sorcerers, or if I was the first one. </p><p>Once I walked out, I was met with the bright morning sun, with no clouds in sight. Not exactly good news for me. I would have much preferred an overcast sky, maybe even a fog. Unfortunately, I wasn’t as lucky. </p><p>“At least it’ll make it easier for initial scouting,” I muttered as I looked around, searching for a heightened spot with some concealment. There was a large rock cropping at a distance away, with no beasts around. </p><p>I flipped my bone daggers as I walked toward the cropping. A nervous tick. I took a deep breath, trying to stay focused. I didn’t have the luxury of making mistakes. Missing the presence of just one beast might alert the enemy to my existence, which would be deadly. </p><p>“Please be gone,” I wished as I climbed the rocks, despite knowing it was an empty hope. An empty hope that had dashed the moment I managed to get a glimpse of the sea, and noticed a small fleet. Three ships, each as large as the pirate ship I had been hijacking a ride. However, what I noticed was their sail…</p><p>All three carried a familiar sigil. A snake. The same symbol that was on the blade of the mage I had killed raiding my grandfather’s house while his body lay discarded… </p><p>“What a nice surprise,” I muttered casually as I climbed down, though my own voice felt weird. It was cold, and foreign at the same time, and my fingers were trembling. I took a deep breath, trying to calm down. </p><p>The moment I climbed down, I sat down, my back against the rock, breathing hard, trying to control my fury. It was hard. I was looking at the people who were responsible for the death of the only family member I cared about. I hated my uncle even more, but that did nothing to abate the red-hot fury I felt against them. </p><p>“Never try to take revenge while feeling anger,” I said, repeating my grandfather’s words he loved to utter as I lay down, trying to get up after his painful training sessions. It was one of the lessons he was most insistent. I always felt that there had been personal reasons for it. I always thought that it had something to do with his injury, but he never shared. “I would be a bad student if I reject your most repeated lesson, old man,” I muttered and I stood up. </p><p>Instead, I started thinking about the coincidence of encountering my enemies in such a random spot. What were the chances of encountering them on an abandoned island… Then, I started to analyze it. It was a good way to distract myself from my anger. </p><p>First, their identity. I didn’t know what that black snake represented, but since they were displaying it proudly, it was obvious that they were not an illegal organization. Either an obscure religious order or a well-known mercenary group. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have flaunted their identity to the point of stamping their sigil on their weapons. </p><p>I was leaning toward the former, as they wielded a strong influence on the provincial governor, easily starting an island-wide manhunt on false pretenses. The mercenary groups strong enough to wield such power might have been tolerated at the border, but not in the core territories. </p><p>Their strength was another obvious feature. A scarily obvious. I had already killed two of their mages, which, for any ordinary organization, would have been enough to force a serious reorganization, yet they didn’t even skip a beat. </p><p>They were rich, easily able to pay ten thousand denarii just for the news about my location. It was not a small amount. </p><p>Altogether, it was obvious that they were not from Britannia. If they were, with their influence and the ease they wielded their power, it was impossible for me to miss them. They were from the mainland, and considering the influence they had wielded over the provincial governor, it was a safe bet to assume they were linked to Rome itself one way or another. </p><p>Of course, none of those details was as important as one spectacular one. They were led by a sorcerer. Even without a mysterious organization of significant political influence, filled with mages, a disciplined military, and incredible riches, a sorcerer was a deadly threat… </p><p>Luckily, he wasn’t here, or we would have been already caught. Nothing on this island could even slow down a sorcerer. He clearly had a more important task.</p><p>Then, I chuckled as the realization hit. “Oh, the irony,” I said as I realized there was a good chance he wasn’t here because he was looking for me.

    "content": "<p>Lillian looked at me, shocked, while I used the opportunity to recover my mana. </p><p>The moment I let go of the elemental cores, exhaustion hit me hard, while the darkness of the cave started to get domineering. I would have turned blind if it wasn’t for the multi-colored light of the active dragon heart. I focused on the water core, trying to hasten my recovery. </p><p>I was lucky that none of the claws or bites had hit an artery, or it wouldn’t have been as simple as relying on the passive recovery of water element. I would have to rely on fire element for a quicker way to stop the blood … and that was never fun. </p><p>The worst of the bleeding stopped quickly as I fed the water core with the mana from the dragon heart to its limit, the rest slowly recovering my reserves. Unfortunately, many lacerations that covered my body weren’t as easy to recover. </p><p>It was going to be a long, painful night. </p><p>Meanwhile, Lillian stumbled toward me, showing she was about to collapse. “All that blood…” she gasped. “You need healing!” </p><p>“It’s not as bad as it looks. Most of the blood is from the beast,” I said. </p><p>Her expression sharpened as she put her hand on my shoulder. I felt a stirring. “Don’t try to lie to me,” she said. “I might not be an expert healer, but I’m not blind.” </p><p>“Alright, but you need to recover your mana first,” I said, then raised the dragon heart once I noticed that she was looking for the defeated water-natured possum. “Just wait your turn.” </p><p>She looked at the dragon heart, her expression dismissive at first. “A crystallized piece is not even enough to recover your reserves —” she started, only to freeze in shock, finally paying attention to what I had in hand. “Is this a dragon heart?” she asked. </p><p>Her shock was understandable, and so was dismissing it as some kind of crystallized piece of mana. Dragon hearts were not the kind of treasures one expected to find in the hands of a random apprentice mage on an uninhabited island; or anywhere but the most guarded compounds, surrounded by hundreds of guards. </p><p>I nodded. </p><p>“How?” she gasped. </p><p>“Sweetie, it’s a long story with an even longer answer,” I said. “Why don’t you just close your eyes and rest a bit while I finish draining it, and then you can replenish your mana,” I offered. She nodded absentmindedly and sat against the wall, trembling. “Do you know a way to enhance your body with your element?” I asked. </p><p>She shook her head. “No, I never thought that it would be necessary,” she answered, dipping her head down in shame. </p><p>“Don’t feel bad. It’s not exactly normal to develop alternative elemental expressions,” I said. Personally, I thought it was stupid to miss such a critical aspect, but there was no point raking her over and ruining her mood. It wasn’t like I could change her past. And, I had no doubt that, if we managed to get away, she would be far more willing to go address that particular deficiency. “Tell me what exactly you can do?” </p><p>“Other than using my magic to farm some extremely rare and delicate plants?” she asked with a derisive tone. </p><p>“Hey, using magic to make a fortune is a perfectly acceptable way to live,” I answered. </p><p>She smiled sadly. “I can use some simple elemental attacks, and I know healing to handle open wounds, but nothing else that’s useful under the circumstances. I’m useless.” </p><p>“Hey, you’re the one that killed the beast,” I reminded her, finding myself with the unusual task of consoling her depression. It came surprisingly easy, just imagine what my old man would say … and say the exact opposite. </p><p>Once the dragon heart’s dancing colors faded, I brought it to her. Let only a drop of your blood on it, and make sure to absorb all the mana it lets out,” I explained to her. </p><p>“Where are you going, you’re still wounded,” she said rather than reaching for the dragon heart immediately. I looked at her face, trying to see if she was trying to play me, but only saw honesty. Kind…</p><p>But also very naive, showing just how sheltered she had been raised. </p><p>“I need to get rid of the blood, and maybe also clean the beast,” I said. “I prefer to deal with it before the rain stops. That way, it’ll be easier to get rid of the blood and the mess.” </p><p>Lillian nodded. “I can help with the rest if you can bring some water while returning,” she said. </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I climbed the slope of the tunnel. I walked some distance away until I found a nice stream created by the rainwater, picked a nice rock on the way back, creating a stone knife with a sharp edge before I processed the beast, getting rid of the blood and other mess but kept everything else, including most of the internal organs and all of the bones. </p><p>Every part of a second-order beast was a treasure. Even getting rid of the blood and some other stuff was annoying. Even they were enough to go for at least a denarii for the right buyer. </p><p>Once the initial processing had finished, I washed myself under the rain, including my ruined pants, getting rid of the blood. On the way back, I found a nice hollowed-out rock that could work as a water bowl, filled it, and returned to the cave. </p><p>Lillian was still exhausted, but with her mana depletion solved, she looked better, but considering she looked like she was about to keel over, it was not an incredible improvement. She was still shivering due to the cold, the mana from the dragon heart not a solution to it. The dragon heart was still glowing in her hand, while her eyes stayed closed, not letting even a hint of mana escape. </p><p>As a mage, she was better than me absorbing the radiating mana. </p><p>“Come here, I’m going to heal you,” she said the moment I walked in. I chuckled at her attitude, but I had to admit, it was good to have someone care about my wounds. It was a rare experience. </p><p>I followed her command only after placing the improvised stone basin and the butchered beast parts in the corner. I sat next to her, and she put her left hand on my cheek, while her right hand danced over my open wounds, a soft blue glow hastening my recovery many times. </p><p>“Well, I have to admit, it went well,” I said. Normally, healing like that was not advisable, but I had many ways to deal with an internal infection, particularly if I decided to rely on fire for healing. </p><p>“Yeah, I can see,” she said, still trembling. Yet, she ignored it and waved her hand, gently pulling the water from the stone basin, and used the flowing water to clean the cave of the dust, blood, and other mess before dropping it to a corner, making the cave a much more livable place. </p><p>Not exactly the most important thing, but she clearly wanted to contribute, so I didn’t say anything. However, as I watched her, I realized that her trembling was getting more intense. I touched her arm. “You’re freezing,” I said. </p><p>“Can’t we start a fire? I can dry the wood with my spells.” </p><p>“I wish, but it won’t go well in a cave,” I said. “And, even if you can dry them, wood would create too much smoke. It increases the risk of getting caught too much, not to mention the smell might alert the surrounding beasts.” </p><p>“Sorry to be a burden,” she whispered, ducking her head. </p><p>I sighed as I wrapped my arms around her, and pulled her against my chest. </p><p>“W-what are you doing?” she stammered. </p><p>“Benefits of being a four-element apprentice. I can self-heat,” I said even as I used fire to heat myself up, until her cold skin felt uncomfortable against mine. </p><p>“But this is…” she whispered, clearly feeling shy. I didn’t have trouble understanding her point, as having a poorly dressed beautiful blonde in my arms wasn’t exactly the easiest feeling to resist, particularly after spending the whole day fighting for my life. </p><p>“Think of it me as a blanket,” I said. </p><p>“You’re the best blanket I ever had,” she said, chuckling. Not the best joke, barely even qualifying as one, but I found myself chuckling with her, which then turned into laughter that went on for a while, leaving us exhausted. </p><p>“Coming from a noble, </p><p>“You’re talking like you’re not a noble,” she said. “You’re the one from a patrician house.” </p><p>“A failed patrician house that managed to get exiled out of Rome long before I was born, and a banished bastard,” I answered. “Not sure I qualify to be one.” </p><p>“I would have argued but…” she said, not even able to finish her sentence before a big yawn interrupted her. “I’m spent.” </p><p>“Make sure to stay awake until the dragon heart dims again. It’s just a few minutes,” I said. “I don’t know if it’s possible to use the mana created by someone else’s blood, but I prefer not to test it.” </p><p>“Just pinch me if I fall asleep,” she said. I decided to ignore the implication. She shuffled in my arms but managed to stay awake until the glow of the dragon heart faded. Only then, she collapsed against my chest. </p><p>“Not bad for a spoiled noble,” I said with a chuckle as I took the dragon heart off her hand, and dripped a drop of blood … but, after a momentary concern, added three more drops, and channeled the mana flow into my cores. </p><p>Trying to quicken my breakthrough to mage rank was risky, but, at this point, I didn’t feel like I had an option.</p><p>Not after my plan to hide in an uninhabited island had crashed and burned so spectacularly… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Stay calm, always make sure that you stay between me and the beast,” I reminded her again as we entered the cave, not bothering to whisper. The cave started with a small tunnel, one that Lillian could walk comfortably, though I had to crouch down. </p><p>“Shouldn’t we whisper? Maybe we can catch it sleeping?” she asked. </p><p>“No chance. Even a first-order beast is difficult to ambush in its nest, let alone a second-order one, particularly after the battle at the shore. It’ll be hidden in a corner, ready to ambush us the moment we arrive.” I took a deep breath. “Be ready. It’s not going to be fun. Possums are hard to deal with even under the circumstances.” </p><p>She didn’t answer as she followed me, staying three steps behind me as I requested. I took every step carefully, stretching my senses to the limit. The magical presence of the possum was strong, though thankfully, I could feel more water than anything from its presence. It wasn’t too shocking considering the location, as water-natured beasts had a great advantage fishing, making them more suitable for a small island, but I still whispered a prayer to Diana, the goddess of the hunt. </p><p>I wasn’t particularly religious. From what I had seen, gods seldom bothered with mortals, leaving their temples and priests to deal with, intervening only during the greatest disasters, and I doubted they cared about our prayers. Still, at this moment, I decided to hedge my bets and thank her. </p><p>The last thing I wanted to deal with was an earth-natured beast in a cave. Even if it was a second-order beast, therefore unable to express its magic externally, the cave would still give it too many advantages. </p><p>Instead, the geography would work to my benefit. As I approached the end of the tunnel, I reached all four elemental cores at the same time, channeling them simultaneously. It was one of the tricks that had been drilled into me by the old man. Learning had been painful, but I had to admit, that using all four elements at the same time came with receiving the boost of all four elements. </p><p>Unfortunately, it came with some great drawbacks as well. The first drawback was the mana usage. With four elemental cores draining mana at the same time, my reserves dipped at an alarming speed. That had been by far the worst disadvantage until recently, even the shortest practice taking more mana than what I could gather in weeks, delaying my already slow progress on the path of four elements. </p><p>However, the other disadvantages were still valid. Using that much mana meant that my presence flared strongly, enough to rival a mage casting a spell, which was the reason I waited until we moved deeper into the cave before I used it despite the next disadvantage. </p><p>Slow activation time. Using all four cores at the same time was a delicate effort during the activation phase, requiring a couple seconds of pure concentration. Not a long time, but deadly during a fight. </p><p>The only other great disadvantage was the elemental expression of power. Many apprentice mages had almost religiously believed the traditional expressions of passive elemental power. Earth for physical power, fire for perception, air for movement, and water for recovery. </p><p>They were the easiest and most efficient expressions, but nowhere near the only methods. For example, if I tried to use fire-based perception earlier, I wouldn’t be able to detect the presence of the second-order beast in the cave. </p><p>Unfortunately, trying to channel four elements at the same time was difficult enough with their primary expressions, preventing more creative methods. Developing them would require an absurd amount of practice, which, even with the dragon heart, would have been pointless when I could use the same effort to reach the ranks of mage. </p><p>“W-what’s going on? I can feel —” she started. </p><p>“I’m a four-element apprentice,” I said, realizing that I neglected to mention that, too used to keep it a secret. </p><p>“But that—” she started. </p><p>“Not the time,” I cut her off. “Focus, stay in the tunnel, and don’t act without my express signal. The possum is waiting for us to step into the wider part of the cave,” I warned, which was not a situation I particularly liked. The wider area would allow the beast to put its smaller size and greater mobility to the best use, but any method we could use to push it out of its cave was counter-productive, as not only setting them would take too much time, but also a battle out in the open would alert the mages. </p><p>A painful struggle with the risk of a serious wound was a better compromise. </p><p>As we reached the end of the tunnel, I was tense. Switching the detection method from earth to fire meant that I had lost track of the beast until it acted. “Stay in the tunnel,” I reminded Lillian while I took a couple steps forward, and examined the cave. </p><p>There was little light in the cave, but enhanced perception allowed me to see enough despite the low light, better than the possum. However, as I looked around, I was unable to discover its location. The cave was large, roughly circular, with about fifty feet radius. There were enough rocks and other debris for the beast to stay hidden. </p><p>I couldn’t go forth, because then, the beast might circle around and attack Lillian. Even third-order beasts didn’t have an intelligence close to humans, but Lillian’s exhaustion was too obvious even for a second-order beast, making her the inevitable first priority. </p><p>I took a deep breath, preparing for the next stage. With my elemental cores active at the same time, I was the one that was under the pressure of time … but luckily, that level of strategic thinking was above a beast. I just needed to bait it. </p><p>“Be ready, and start gathering your first spell,” I said as I took a step forward, and made a show of stumbling. The beast didn’t react, so I actually fell to the ground, sprawled forward, revealing my neck as an easy target. </p><p>I hoped that it would approach from the right, where my spear was. </p><p>A blur appeared from the side of the cave, too fast to react from my position if I wasn’t already prepared. By revealing my neck, I had given it a target it couldn’t resist. The only problem, was it attacked from the left, forcing me to punch the beast to cut its momentum…</p><p>It didn’t go particularly well. A second-order possum was as big as a hunting dog, and even more vicious. Even with my enhanced strength, the best I could do was to break its attack and push it away, but it managed to swipe its claws to leave a deep wound along my forearm. </p><p>It was too fast, giving me an idea about its primary elemental expression. Mobility and speed. Which was a dangerous combination in the cave … but it would have been even worse outside. Worse, possums were an unholy mixture of cunning, endurance, and sheer evil stubbornness before adding extra mobility. </p><p>That meant, rather than rolling away from it like I would have preferred, I rolled forward, swinging my spear toward it as I forced it to dodge toward a corner. It easily avoided my attack, but that was the point. I only wanted to force it to a corner. </p><p>Unfortunately, even a rat was dangerous when it was forced into a corner. A second-order possum, on the other hand, was a nightmare, especially since my spear was too low quality to penetrate its skin. Instead, I targeted the spear to its eyes and mouth, kicking it with my enhanced strength to keep it pinned, trying to confuse and exhaust it for the next stage. </p><p>Without the water element slowing down my bleeding through passive recovery, I would have long collapsed. Even then, without my improvement after getting the dragon heart, I would have collapsed, exhausted. Risking discovery by practicing in the bilge pump room had paid off. </p><p>“Is it time?” Lillian asked, slowly panicking. </p><p>“Not yet,” I answered, suddenly glad that the cave was too dark for her to notice what was going on. My legs were covered in blood, and Lillian would have certainly panicked if she had seen it. The situation was precarious enough that her help might ruin everything. </p><p>The horrible scrap continued until, even with my most recent improvements, I was at the edge of a collapse, but I continued fighting, locking the beast into the corner, making it feel trapped. “Now, be ready to release, but wait until my signal no matter what,” I warned her. </p><p>Then, I reached my reserves, flaring my mana even more. A pointless gesture, nothing more than a vain display, but against a beast that felt trapped and scared, it was effective. It burst out, trying to knock me down to freedom. </p><p>I dropped my spear, grabbed the beast, and rolled toward the entrance, and pinned it under me, its head visible. “Now,” I called. The water blade of Lillian landed on the pinned beast, ending the battle, but the exhaustion proved too much, and she fell on her knees. </p><p>“I need to heal you,” she gasped as she raised her hands. The darkness prevented her from seeing just how bloody I was, but it wasn’t hard to guess I got away from </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. Just close your eyes, and focus on staying conscious,” I said. She listened to my order, and I wiped off my right hand carefully to make sure there wasn’t much blood. I needed mana, but I couldn’t absorb it if I activated the dragon heart to its limit. </p><p> Then, I unlocked the box and grabbed the dragon heart, slowly draining the mana while a soft, multicolored glow filled the cave, enough to cut through the darkness. </p><p>A gasp reached my ear even as I started absorbing the mana. I wondered whether it was about my bloody state, or about the treasure I was holding. </p><p>However, I focused on my recovery. </p><p>I preferred not to be bleeding profusely during the discussion. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Charlie and Mark were lost in an angry staring match as Tiffany dealt the next set of cards, paying extra attention to the cards as each tried to win and keep their significant other from the indignity, too drunk to question why they weren’t simply calling it off. </p><p>They didn’t pay much attention to me, confident that I was too drunk to put up a coherent game therefore my defeat was a foregone ending. However, they also wanted to avoid their significant others sitting on the lap of their boss. </p><p>A mistake, as it meant I was free to play with more freedom than their presence should have allowed. As usual, Tiffany was a redheaded goddess, more than happy to push limits. She started rocking up and down, subtly enough to keep them from getting suspicious but taking me deeper at every repeat. </p><p>Soon, I was buried halfway in her, her husband unaware of what was going on just a couple feet away. I folded my hand, which made the two focus on each other even more. </p><p>“I think we’re the better ones,” Tiffany said as she looked at Umi. Mark smiled, thinking that his wife had been supporting him, but Tiffany pushed herself down even more, devouring all of my shaft, which told a different story to Umi. </p><p>“We’ll see,” Umi answered, pouting when she realized Tiffany had played her. I put my hand on Umi’s leg and caressed it while Tiffany rocked, trying to console her. After all, her turn would come. </p><p>She decided some preparation was needed for it, and parted her legs, pulling her skirt up once more. She stood up slightly, I slid my hand under her, and when she sat again, she was straddling my hand. My fingers slipped inside her while she rocked, readying herself for her fiancee’s defeat. </p><p>However, she had to bite a moan down, which would have been quite suspicious if the two men across the table hadn’t had the awareness of a concrete wall. </p><p>Naughty girl, I thought with a smirk. I had been hopeful about her, but even in my most generous estimations wouldn’t have allowed that. She was surpassing all my estimations. I enjoyed her wetness as my fingers danced, interrupted only when Mark flipped his cards. “Three of a kind. I win,” he declared before he turned Umi. “Sweetie, go and be a proper secretary for your boss,” he said, not neglecting to try to look good at me. </p><p>Unaware that he was triggering Charlie’s inevitable retaliation in the process… well, assuming he didn’t get blackout drunk at first, as he knocked down another drink to suppress his annoyance. And, we already knew he couldn’t hold his liqueur. </p><p>“You heard the man,” I said as I slapped Tiffany’s ass. “But why don’t you go put some music before the next hand,” I said, then chuckled. “Something that’s fit for a lap dance.” </p><p>Charlie looked even angrier, but rather than targeting the rightful responsible — me — he turned that gaze to Mark. </p><p>Meanwhile, Umi once again fixed her skirt and stood up. “Maybe you should sit the other way,” I said. “I don’t like the way Mark looks at your tits.” </p><p>Mark immediately blushed. “Hey, I don’t —” he started. </p><p>“Shut it, Mark,” Tiffany interrupted from the other side, and then a strong beat filled the room. It wasn’t loud enough that we had to shout, but loud enough to conceal any errant moan. Then, on her way back, Tiffany pulled another trick, this time unprompted. She played with the dimmer until the room got dark enough to keep some moves secret.</p><p>Umi turned toward me and threw her leg over mine, sinking slowly. The parting of her legs was enough to ride her skirt up, which was enough to give me direct access to her core. She pressed against it, managing not to make any noise as the crown disappeared into her core. </p><p>“Lap dance was an excellent idea, Mark,” I said, happily giving him credit, making sure Charlie firmly blamed him as Umi rocked back and forth on my lap in an effort to take me deeper. Even with preparation, she wasn’t able to take it as easily as Tiffany. </p><p>She didn’t miss it. “Do you need help, honey,” she said as she grabbed Umi’s hips, and pushed her down. </p><p>“Ohh!” Umi moaned, her voice echoing despite the music, making Charlie freeze. </p><p>“It’s rude to pinch, Tiffany,” I said, giving Umi an excuse for the voice even as she hugged me, trying to resist the desire to make more. She stayed in place, trying to get used to my presence. “How would you like if I done so?” </p><p>“Only one way of knowing, sir,” she said as she put her hands on the table, and bent forward, the angle riding her tiny skirt up completely. I pinched her ass, and she let out a throaty moan. “I have to admit, it’s not as bad —” she tried, interrupted halfway by a loud spank. “Okay, that’s bad,” she admitted playfully. </p><p>“Honey, maybe you should distribute the cards,” Mark said, unhappy about his wife’s behavior after his victory, which was supposed to keep her safe. </p><p>“Whatever you say, husband,” Tiffany replied, not bothering to hide the mocking edge, but Mark didn’t seem to notice it. </p><p>“It looks like someone can’t handle what they are dishing,” Charlie commented as he looked at Mark even as Tiffany distributed the cards. </p><p>A mistake, as Mark’s fragile ego couldn’t handle a subordinate talking back to him — unlike making his wife sit on his boss’s lap. “Umi, weren’t you supposed to be giving a lap dance,” he reminded me. </p><p>“You’re right,” Umi said and started to move. I was glad that Tiffany dimmed the lights because even those two morons would have realized something else was going on once Umi started moving, her walls were already used to my presence to make her move aggressively. </p><p>A beautiful dance. Tiffany distributed the cards, and the next hand started. I trusted Tiffany to manipulate the game accordingly, so, instead of watching, I put my hands under the table, leaving no doubt about where my hands were — though Charlie probably assumed I was cupping her ass over the skirt rather than enjoying her naked ass. </p><p>Umi was happy with that addition, rocking back and forth as her tight pussy devoured my shaft repeatedly. And, in her wild movements, her blazer buttons popped open, letting her naked tits smash against my chest. </p><p>“Your move, boss?” Mark interrupted. </p><p>“Call,” I said, not even bothering to check my cards. The pot was small enough for it to be okay. </p><p>Meanwhile, Umi bent backward, giving a better view of her tits. I swallowed and licked my lips, wishing that I could put my lips on them like usual, but that would be too much even for the two morons still playing poker seriously. </p><p>I called a few times while they played, but otherwise didn’t pay much attention. That was why I was surprised when the game ended, and I won, thanks to a pair of pocket Queens. </p><p>How delightfully ironic. </p><p>“Since I won, what are we going to do?” I asked. </p><p>“Maybe you should just stitch, sir? Variety is key to life, after all.” </p><p>“No. I think Umi should lose a piece of clothing,” Mark interrupted, proving just how vindictive — and shortsighted — he could be. </p><p>“Excellent idea,” I said. “Umi, arms.” </p><p>She followed that order, and I pulled her blazer, leaving her top naked, though thanks to her position, nothing but her naked back and a little side boob was visible. “You two, look the other way,” Tiffany called sharply. “It’s rude.” </p><p>“But —” Mark said, which died quickly under Tiffany’s angry glare. </p><p>“She’s my fiancee. What’s the harm,” Charlie interrupted, but he was too weak to resist Tiffany’s glare. </p><p>Her sharp tongue was worse. “So, are you saying you enjoy watching her giving him a lap dance because of your mistake? What’s wrong with you,” she called. </p><p>At this point, both Charlie and Mark were too buzzed to realize the absurdity of that statement. During the last couple of hands, they had decided to deal with their frustration by drinking faster, which was a bad idea. </p><p>Frustration and alcohol didn’t mix prettily. At this point, they were pretty sloshed, but still thought of themselves as sober.</p><p>They looked the other way. I lifted Umi to the table, ramming her to the beat of the music so the noise from the table mixed with other instruments. Tiffany put a leg over a chair, playing with herself while I rammed into Umi again and again, until the inevitable happened and I flooded her core with my seed. </p><p>“I think we tortured them enough,” I said as I let Umi put her jacket on, but she stayed on my lap. “Let’s continue playing… We still have a game to finish... ” </p>",

    "content": "<p>The challenge of unlocking her phone was not exactly simple, particularly since I didn’t have the luxury of taking it with me. I would have only one chance to unlock the screen protector, and even then, I would have to find a position that would keep her looking in a different direction.</p><p>The worst, all the while, I would have to maintain my attention on her completely to make sure she was lost in her ecstasy and not notice what was going on. Well, at least from a mission perspective, as otherwise, railing a sexy redhead dressed as a horny biker chick on top of a working bike was closer to the purest definition of heaven even without the ego boost from taming the famous Lady of Destruction.</p><p>“Do you feel like repeating your words, princess?” I said as I put my helmet on the bike, with her phone still inside, making sure it stayed in my reach for the eventual opportunity. “Because if you say those again, there’s no turning back.”</p><p>Only after seeing her flinch, I realized my mistake. I had called her the Lady of Destruction in my mind, forgetting her official name as Blue Princess.</p><p>I decided to distract her directly. I pushed my pants down to reveal my arousal and pressed against her wetness. “Looks like I’m not the cowardly one, miss the spoiled rich girl,” I followed, using an alternative to make her feel it was just an accident. “I shouldn’t have bothered a spoiled little girl like you. I should have known that, when it’s time to —” I added, goading her into action.</p><p>It worked spectacularly. Her legs tightened around my waist once more as she skewered herself with my cock. “You — were — saying,” she gasped, gleeful in her victory.</p><p>“Yes, you win. I don’t know just how I could live with such a great loss,” I teased her even as I moved my hands to her hips, and started ramming her aggressively. As a culmination of everything we had been doing, she was already at the edge, and the thrilling location didn’t make it any easier for her to resist the explosion of pleasure.</p><p>She looked spectacular as her body trembled, a beautiful dazzled expression on her face. I continued to impale her, enjoying her tightness, the mission to break into her phone momentarily shelved. I wanted to enjoy the first few moments of my time with the famous Lady of Destruction properly, etching the details in my mind.</p><p>She should have stopped me, thinking that we had gone too far, but instead, she parted her legs even wider, allowing me to access her core as she treated the thin seat of the bike as the most luxurious bed possible.</p><p>She said nothing as I continued ramming into her, her face filled with pleasure, which, unlike some of the aspects she was faking, was perfectly fitting for a spoiled rich girl to wear as she banged by a big bad biker.</p><p>She embraced her role.</p><p>I grabbed her top and pulled it down, the fragile fabric giving up a bit. ”How careless of me,” I muttered. “Let me cover them up!”</p><p>“Jerk—” she said as she saw the huge smile on my face, but that was all she was able to say before I started playing her with her nipples. I had learned exactly how to treat them to trigger her pleasure further, and her planned admonishment died a premature death just like her top did.</p><p>I could see that she was surprised by my reckless actions, but not enough to ask me to stop, or even slow down. She was already lost in the land of pleasure, as if she had been drinking from a fountain she had never tasted before.</p><p>Maybe she never did, I realized. It wouldn’t be a stretch to believe her other partners were aware of her identity, therefore couldn’t even imagine treating her like a bored rich whore looking for a proper fucking to calm down.</p><p>Even with my power, I doubted I would have dared without the circumstances forcing me. After all, my power was not omnipotent, capable of making mistakes — just like my failure to recognize her before catching her using her powers on the camera — and moreover, it wasn’t capable of seeing the future.</p><p>There was nothing preventing her from returning a few days later, and decided that since she regretted her brief stint as a biker girl, I should spend the rest of my extremely short life feeling regret as well.</p><p>Still, there must be something wrong with me as well, as I realized that thought didn’t scare me. Instead, it excited me further. “Let’s give you a proper dicking, whore,” I said as I flipped her. Her belly pressed against the seat, turning the position into some kind of enhanced doggy.</p><p>I slapped her ass without thinking.</p><p>“Hey, be careful—” she moaned, which lasted only until I slid inside again, her words cut sharp with a wave of pleasure as I invaded her. I spanked her again. “Hey,” she moaned, but said nothing. I spanked again, falling into a beautiful rhythm, her deficient skirt doing nothing to reduce the blows.</p><p>Soon, even her half-hearted complaints disappeared, leaving their place to high-pitched moans, lost in pleasure. And, I wasn’t too far away.</p><p>I was ashamed to admit it, but it took me a long time to realize the current position was absolutely perfect to snoop through her phone as I wished. I was too distracted by the way her red hair stuck to her sweaty back, moving with her every desperate moan.</p><p>I grabbed her phone, leaned forward, and pulled her hair back. “How about a selfie, slut,” I said as I pulled her head back. She tensed. “Don’t worry. It’s your phone, I can’t spread it around,” I said, which was a reasonable concern.</p><p>Too bad it distracted her from the most important thing. As an undercover agent, she had just given me access to her phone to me. I took a few photos, and they looked amazing. “Look how slutty you are,” I said as I showed her the picture, and she tightened around me even further. “Do you want to see your ass?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said.</p><p>Excellent. It gave me a chance to browse her phone, and even better, it did so with her permission. Too bad I didn’t have too much time. Thirty seconds, maybe a minute was alright … but I couldn’t keep holding her phone for ten minutes without making her suspicious.</p><p>Luckily, my power was perfect browsing through a lot of information. The first thing I did was to check her messages. Most of them came from a woman called Rosa, who even had a picture attached, making it an absurd security risk.</p><p>As I checked the messages rapidly, I learned a few valuable things, including her real name.</p><p>Daria.</p><p>A quick check of her messages confirmed some of my guesses. She was there to check the warehouse like I had suspected, and visited my bar only because it allowed a nice base to operate further. She was aware that it was a ‘villain’ bar, but she visited it despite Rosa’s pointed warnings telling her that it would make her a target, Daria refused to listen to them, confident in her success.</p><p>There were several mentions of her training, showing that Rosa was the one who trained Daria alone. That surprised me, as Daria had shown signs of pretty stringent and effective training — which turned useless due to her arrogance and recklessness, but that was another topic.</p><p>As much as delving deeper into their relationship was entertaining, I decided to focus on different topics. But first, an excuse to hold the phone longer. I took a picture of her reddened ass as I buried it in her wetness.</p><p>“Look just how sexy you look,” I said I showed her the picture, and she tightened even more, and pulled back with the excuse of taking another picture.</p><p>This time, I focused on the reasons for their interest in the warehouse, and how they discovered it. The answer surprised me, but also did not. Apparently, they had managed to discover the warehouse by tracing some kind of teleport that had been used to drop a weapon shipment.</p><p>I had been wondering why the Syndicate hadn’t moved away from the warehouse, which had been answered. The teleporter must have some restrictions.</p><p>However, the reason why they were tracing was even more surprising. Their messages showed that they didn’t care about the harm the weapons might deliver, but they were interested in discovering who was responsible for making them.</p><p>They wanted to recruit them for their mission … which they only referred to as the mission. A pity.</p><p>Still, I had learned far more than I had expected, and even better, what I had learned was to my benefit.</p><p>Was I happy with the prospect of a potential super battle right at my doorstep where I might end up as collateral, not necessarily. Was it better than any of these parties focusing on me — or god forbid, gang together against me.</p><p>Without a doubt.</p><p>I spent the last few seconds of my ability to browse through her phone going through the details about Rosa. There was not much. A picture showed that she was a Latina woman, likely in her late thirties, but still looked amazing with curves to die for.</p><p>I memorized her phone number before pulling out of Daria, and pulled her down as well. “Now, smile, beautiful,” I said as I covered her face with my seed, took one last photo, and passed the phone to her.</p><p>She absentmindedly locked her phone again, dazed and panting, while I enjoyed my beautiful artwork.</p><p>Stained Destruction…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Wow, are you serious?” the cashier gasped excitedly as I completed the purchase, yet dropped some extra cash. Serious cash. While she picked it up, I appreciated her deep cleavage even as her platinum blonde hair sprawled over her chest.</p><p>“Yes, just pass me the key to the changing room,” I said, requesting the emergency keys every shop had. </p><p>“We are not—” she started, but when I glared at him, he was quick to accept. The way we walked with my hand on her ass already suggested a relationship that reduced the risk for her. Even if she got fired, the tip she received was more than enough to bridge the gap while she searched for a new job. </p><p>Altogether, a decent deal. </p><p>I nodded and walked away, ignoring her sudden coy gaze. She was beautiful, and if I didn’t have someone else with me, particularly someone who could easily demolish the store if annoyed, I would be very happy to take her on that suggestion. </p><p>Well, even villains couldn’t win all. </p><p>I wasn’t planning to do anything else in the shop — I had more fun activities planned — but there was no harm in being prepared. My heroine might decide that she didn’t like the clothes, or she might like them too much. Either way, we might make some noise, and I didn’t want to be bothered. </p><p>Once that was done, I walked toward the dressing room, which was still closed. I smiled when I heard a subtle yet distinctive wet noise, and realized she decided to take her problem into her own hands. </p><p>That would not do, I decided as I knocked on the door. “Come out,” I said. </p><p>“O-one minute,” she gasped. </p><p>“No,” I said even as I fiddled with the door. It was locked from the other side, but I was already prepared for the occasion. I thought about opening it … but there was another temptation. Her phone. </p><p>I tried to fiddle with it, but it was locked. There were several notifications, all from one party, but the identity of the other party was not shown. Her phone was silenced, but being flooded with new messages. </p><p>It looked like the other party was aware that our naughty heroine had gone awol; which wasn’t too shocking considering she had done the exact same thing the last night as well, just before giving me a lap dance. However, as I checked her phone, I was sure that her supporters were not a big organization. </p><p>Or, they would have had a security expert who would have blocked her phone’s facial and fingerprint recognition. Both were significant drawbacks for an agent, even if that agent had superpowers. </p><p>However, since I couldn’t open her phone, I knocked on the door again, disrupting her focus. “Get out, now,” I ordered, and when she ignored it, I opened the door. I pushed it slowly when I noticed a blue glow, though my eyes widened. </p><p>I wasn’t expecting her to use her powers as a masturbation aid. </p><p>Creative. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t have the luxury of teasing her about it. Instead, I opened the door slowly until the glow dispersed so I didn’t see anything incriminating then, pushed it open completely. “H-hey—” she started, ready to complain. </p><p>It was a good time for the first kiss of the day. I leaned in for a quick kiss, one that was merciless and aggressive as I wrapped her beautiful red hair around my fist, yet short-lived, leaving her panting for more once I pulled back. </p><p>While she tried to control herself, I took note of her outfit. She had been already dressed when I opened the door, which might have been a pity … if most of her outfit couldn’t also function as napkins. </p><p>She had a tight tube top a size too small, which looked amazing when combined with her lack of a bra, particularly since it was designed to be a perfect fit in the first place. However, that was nothing compared to her plied skirt, which might be easily mistaken for a headband if she hadn’t been wearing it. It was tiny enough that even the slightest breeze would cause a scandal. </p><p>Especially since she wasn’t wearing her panties. They were hanging on a hook, no doubt removed to make her earlier self-care easier. Interestingly, she had been wearing the rest of her outfit, showing that she enjoyed its looks. </p><p>The rest of her outfit was even more scandalous, a pair of boots that ended a few inches below her knees, and thigh-high fishnet stockings. Altogether, she looked like the perfect biker girl, ready to serve the whole gang with gusto. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said as I once again hugged her on her waist, my hand on her skirt as I dragged her out, holding her small bag and her phone in my other hand. Since I was interested in its contents, it looked like a good idea to get her used to the idea of me carrying it. </p><p>“Wait, my panties —” she gasped, which ended with a moan as I slipped my fingers under her skirt, testing her wetness. What I did was unfair. Not only she had been tense due to the long ride, but also I had interrupted her attempts to solve it herself. </p><p>Even worse, I abused my power as I caressed her wetness for a few seconds, pushing her right on the edge, but not letting her go over. “You’re right, they are not there,” I said teasingly. “Unfortunately, we’re already late. You should have been more careful.” </p><p>That comment earned a gasp from her, but I could see her excitement growing even more as her bad boy refused her the chance to put on panties. </p><p>I dragged her out, picking up my new helmet on the way. Once outside, she glanced around in shock, as if only now she realized how revealingly she dressed. I even noticed her using mini forcefields to keep her skirt on, too small to give out a glow, but still noticeable due to their shape. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel amused at that. She was showing incredible flexibility using her power, which meant she never had to be the Lady of Destruction … well, not necessarily, I corrected myself. Maybe only after her power started to weaken did she develop some control, or that was a benefit of the weakening. </p><p>Either way, it was not a topic I wanted to delve deeper into at this particular moment. Instead, I wanted to deal with her sudden panicky reaction. I leaned forward and earlobe before whispering. “What’s wrong, Amelia?” I asked, deliberately using her fake name to remind her she was undercover and, therefore didn’t need to worry about pesky things like her reputation. Followed by an attack on her courage. “Don’t tell me you can’t handle it.” </p><p>The combination worked wonders. The hesitancy in her eyes disappeared, replaced with anger. “I’ll show you whether or not I can handle it,” she whispered as she grabbed my hair and pulled me for a kiss, pulling hard. She jumped up, her legs tightening around me, her naked pussy right on top of my bulge. </p><p>Not exactly what I had been planning, but the aggression of her lips as they danced, or the way she pulled my hair suggested that she had already reached her limit. It looked like that last dig about her weakness was all she needed to break things. </p><p>I was glad for my foresight in bribing the cashier, who had been watching us from the window rather than trying to stop us from giving a show in her parking lot.</p><p>My tongue invaded her mouth, enjoying the spectacular kiss even as I walked toward the bike with her. However, rather than asking her to stop, I put her on the bike, helping her to let her relax, which gave me a better range as I dry-humped her. </p><p>She just parted her legs, giving me an excellent view of her beauty as she lost focus — and intent — to keep her skirt under control with her power. I leaned forward, kissing her neck, the pleasure maddening her. </p><p>I turned on the ignition, which added a new dimension to her pleasure. “Too bad you’re not enough man to take me right here,” she gasped. </p><p>It was a weak insult, its function obvious. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the luxury of ignoring that temptation, my bad-boy persona didn’t allow that. It looked like I had finally pushed her too much. </p><p>Admittedly, I wasn’t worried about delivering what she was asking. The parking lot was empty and reasonably concealed, and while we had an audience, a sexy girl watching us with obvious pleasure was not exactly a dealbreaker. </p><p>No, the problem lay in the fact that I had been planning to use her post-coital haze her to poke around her phone, discovering her secrets while she napped. That was out, as there was no way she would do so in an open space, or when we traveled back. A bike was not exactly a comfortable bed. </p><p>However, refusing her was not an option. Then, just as I was about to throw my helmet and her bag down, I got another idea. </p><p>What if I didn’t explore her phone after, but during… </p>",

She was supposed to go upstairs immediately to bring the letters to ‘her Queen’. </p><p>Instead, she was sneaking out of my bed in the morning. </p><p>I suppressed my desire to tease her, and instead acted like I was asleep, my mind already churning about how to act. I needed to visit Pearyin to replenish her Qi, but on that, there was a huge problem. The replenishment rate of cursed Qi was not enough to satisfy her consumption. </p><p>I needed to find a better source of Qi, which was not as simple as it sounded. My first inclination was to try and find some more spirit plant seeds. Once enough of them had been planted, Pearyin would have enough Qi to meet her needs.</p><p>Unfortunately, too many cultivators were shameless bandits for it to be tenable. The protection talismans were a temporary measure, and the more spirit plants there were, the higher the probability of her being discovered by other cultivators — and that was before adding our weird luck into the mix. </p><p>With that option unviable, the only other option I could use was to damage the stone door a little more to increase the cursed Qi flow … and the craziness of that plan had been obvious enough before that mysterious voice spoke to me. </p><p>No, that, I would leave alone. </p><p>Which left other, not-so-immediate options. Use Aisnam to set up a trade channel to get lots of spirit stones, visit cultivator market to trade for stones, and actually bring Aisnam to Misty Mountains and hope that the unique nature of the area would keep her safe. </p><p>All three had their own disadvantages, mostly relating to depending on outside sources. </p><p>No, I needed to use the information Aisnam would — hopefully — provide about the cultivation world to get some new skills. Formation mastery was the biggest target, followed by more talisman plans, and alchemy was a distant third. I treated alchemy as a lower priority, not because it wasn’t useful, but because I was afraid of the challenge of gathering even more materials. </p><p> Then, my thoughts wandered over the being that was locked behind the stone door, along with a feature that I had triggered very rarely. </p><p>Insult. </p><p>I wondered if I could actually goad that being to throw a qualified insult to my side, but I failed to come up with a way, particularly since I wasn’t looking for Qi. I already had that in abundance, but I was afraid of triggering the System’s punishment if I just transferred it to Pearyin. </p><p>That particular option was a literal last resort. </p><p>I was still pondering over my options, when Aisnam came downstairs with a letter and a small booklet. “The Queen has her answer. Can you bring it to them?” she said. </p><p>“Anything for you,” I answered with a smirk but didn’t make a move. We had already spent more than a little time together the last night — partially driven by her relief at my safety after my longer-than-planned disappearance — and I didn’t want to crowd her too much. </p><p>Another little trick of being a boy toy. Leaving her wanting was better than boring her with too much too soon. Occasionally taking the initiative like I did last night had its benefits, but too much initiative had its risks.</p><p>Particularly when the lady in question was a cultivator. </p><p>“So, any special requests?” I asked. </p><p>“Just keep your eyes open. Her Highness is happy with your observations,” she said, her earnest expression would have been enough to make me feel guilty if she hadn’t been benefiting from them incredibly. </p><p>One or two white lies — well, a lot of them — were nothing compared to the help she received. </p><p>I left the Palace through the tunnel. There was no surprise communication from the trapped entity, which didn’t surprise me. The pattern of cursed Qi suggested that it was not as active during the day. </p><p>Once I got out of the cave, I spent some time to make sure I wasn’t being followed. I didn’t expect it, as by following me she would risk her deal with the mysterious organization. Also, she was reluctant to leave the Spring Palace unattended, afraid of the consequences. </p><p>I first checked her letter. It was a long, indirect statement written in fancy language, but the general gist was she accepted the deal I had presented. It even mentioned that the booklet was a general breakdown of the local powers. In return, she requested a twenty-percent discount for the next delivery I would make on Markas. </p><p>There were two more things. First, there was a list of services and prices. She offered to act as an in-between for the cultivation materials, but only if I paid triple for their cost, but she was willing to accept finished products. Smart of her. </p><p>Even better, she had a list of materials that she could provide, which was very helpful. I knew nothing about alchemy and formations, so the list guided me. </p><p>I immediately put a list for a hefty delivery of resources, particularly talisman paper, and ink, though just to be on the safe side, I also requested some jade and basic alchemy materials, enough that I could pay with my current stockpile of talismans but still leave some for myself. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the real reward. The knowledge about the regions. First, the layout of the mortal kingdoms. In that part, she didn’t get too much into detail, just mentioned barely to show highlights. </p><p>Once I saw the true extent of the land, I understood why she did so. The local area — being the continent we were in — had twelve mortal domains, the forty-three kingdoms, with their billions of mortals, only one of them. Yet, the current mortal domain wasn’t even the biggest one. </p><p>And, this world had multiple continents. A shocking scale. </p><p>She didn’t include too much information on the mortal kingdoms. Instead, she focused on drawing the locations of the various sects, cultivator families, and markets. She didn’t put the exact location of any sect, but the general area of influence area, and some of the key information. Styles, notable elders, products, and other stuff. </p><p>I paid more attention to the information she provided about four premier sects that effectively ruled the continent. Kartpa Valley, Entsa Pavilion, Mutmah Sect, and Dragon Peak; each with multiple Nascent Soul Elders … which, apparently came after Golden Core. I didn’t even want to imagine how strong they were. </p><p>So, instead, I focused on the details of each sect. Dragon Peak was famous for its saber skills and its bloodline, which apparently came from actual dragons. Also, they were the best at weapon forging, which mixed well with their focus on sabers. </p><p>And, from what I could get from the notes, they were also the unofficial leader of the four sects, but I got the impression that Aisnam was not happy about it. She didn’t write anything about it, but her handwriting carried some resentment. </p><p>Mutmah sect had the smallest territory among the four, with a lot of notes putting them as the premier formation masters of the continent. Too bad even their nearest base was on the other side of the continent. </p><p>A lesson on formation mastery was my greatest need. </p><p>Entsa Pavilion, I was already vaguely familiar with. Though, to my surprise, every single notable elder and important disciple was a woman. I didn’t know whether it was a female-only, or female-heavy sect. Their area of expertise was talismans, which meant their importance was a bit more nuanced. I didn’t care about buying talismans, but getting some gifts, particularly one or two of peak Qi Gathering power and letting them get multiplied by the System was a good way to ensure my safety from a surprise attack from a higher-ranking cultivator. </p><p>And, then, there was Kartpa Valley, the enemy I somehow managed to make. They were a sect that focused on unarmed combat and alchemy, which was an interesting combination. Still, their focus on alchemy made them the richest of the four. </p><p>Unlike the other disciplines, alchemy allowed cultivators to increase their power permanently, which made them the most important purchase for any cultivator. Technically, for saber and sword cultivators, their weapons were more important, but even then, a weapon was a rare purchase. </p><p>Pills were consumables. Expensive ones. </p><p>Once I had finished reading about the major four, I started reading about minor sects and families, each with its own details, though the details on the Verdant Family were suspiciously absent other than their territory. </p><p>Even now, she didn’t want to work against her family. I disagreed. If my family sabotaged me like they had done to her, I would have sold them out in a heartbeat. </p><p>“That’s enough reading,” I muttered, and burned everything after committing them to my memory. Now, the next task. </p><p>A visit to the city… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but sigh as I stepped into the Spring Palace once more, ignoring the stirring of exhaustion, more mental than physical, even though the physical part was not negligible either.</p><p>I hadn’t been particularly concerned during my self-appointed mission to bring Aisnam her medicine, even though it required me to trek through the wilderness and trick a lot of people who could kill me despite my blatant supernatural cheating. </p><p>It was supposed to be an investment, just a burst of effort before I settled down to my role, and lazed around until my dear Queen got bored with her boy toy. Things were supposed to calm down once she got strong enough to intimidate the others. </p><p>The eight Stages of the Qi Gathering Realm are supposed to be enough to deal with everything. Then, Tiger Fist army arrived, forcing me to save Pearyin before going to help Markas. It was bad enough, then somehow I managed to trigger Pearyin’s ability as some kind of super cultivator who devoured Qi like a black hole. </p><p>The situation was getting away from me. </p><p>I didn’t even have the luxury of blaming anyone, which might not be productive but it would have calmed me down. Not Aisnam, not Pearyin, not Marana … I couldn’t even blame myself. </p><p>Yes, I gave Pearyin the spirit stone, which escalated the mess, but at this point, my knowledge about cultivation was not limited, and such a thing was supposed to be near impossible. Who knew it would trigger a random waitress who decided to stick with me. </p><p>The odds of something like that happening were supposed to be lower than winning lottery, therefore suspicious. That suspicion was also a major reason why I didn’t just run away. Clearly, probability didn’t matter that much here. Even if I arranged for Pearyin to join a sect and leave, I would probably encounter another messy situation. </p><p>As for abandoning Pearyin, that was even worse. At this point, she was rather obsessed with me. The last thing I needed was to trigger her resentment after awakening her super cultivation ability. </p><p>Ironically, the other reason I was reluctant to leave was the opposite case. What if I left, and my luck stopped working on the principles of exceptionalism. The more I learned about the cultivation world, the more I realized just how unbelievable was my encounter with Aisnam. A cultivator from an established family, alone and depressed, yet with easily manageable problems… </p><p>If I left her, it might take years for me to find another chance to enter the cultivation world, which was shockingly insular and merciless. They wouldn’t be as willing to play along with my poor martial artist act.</p><p>And, while I could show some of my talents to gain admission, being a productive servant would make it very difficult to trigger the System, slowing down my growth. </p><p>Then, there was the warning I received about the coming Darkness, which was even more ominous than the mysterious being trapped behind the stone doors that could speak into my mind. </p><p>No, I had no choice but to stay. </p><p>“You’re finally here,” Aisnam gasped as she appeared on the stairs, her clothes slightly skewed. She must have changed back to her servant outfit after she heard me enter. I opened my mouth, but before I could answer, she closed in the distance with her cultivator speed and started patting me, trying to make sure I was still okay. </p><p>It was not just her hands, but also her Qi, checking me. Some of it mixed with my essence, and I silently absorbed it. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pity Bonus - 60 (Capped)]</p><p>[110x Return - 17 Qi Strand]</p><p>Not exactly the incredible reward that our fun dances provided, but every little bit counted. Too bad her worry seemed to be escalating. I interrupted her with a kiss, then pulled back. “Don’t worry, I’m okay,” I explained. </p><p>It took a few seconds for her to process it. “Why are you late, then?” she asked, still cross. </p><p>“There were a few problems. Nothing dangerous, but we needed to stay back for a while,” I said. </p><p>“Tell me,” she ordered. I was happy to oblige and spun a reasonable tale of encountering a small team of Connate realm artists, but avoiding them easily because they were afraid of revealing themselves. I added several details to match the letter in hand, trying to make a believable scene. Then, I passed the letter to her, and she read it without even bothering to go upstairs. </p><p>It was not something a servant, even a trusted one should do. She must have been really worried about me missing that detail. </p><p>“So, what do you think about them?” she asked, then a flash of realization passed over her face as it clicked she wasn’t acting too much like a servant. “Any idea why they are helping her Highness?” </p><p>I paused, trying to gauge her reaction, and trying to decide exactly what she would find believable, while I also considered everything I had shown before. I revealed both the ability to create high-quality talismans and essence pills. </p><p>Technically, I could still claim that the organization was made only of martial artists, and the talismans they had given her had been acquired in a one-time deal. But, I decided against it. The moment I confirmed it, it would mean my ability to provide her with cultivation treasures would come to an end. </p><p>However, I couldn’t just reveal the presence of cultivators as well, as she would want to meet with them. </p><p>I decided to pick a middle road. “I suspect they are working for a cultivator with a grudge against Kartpa Valley,” I said, which was the most reasonable explanation for their sudden involvement. After all, Kartpa Valley had already revealed itself during the first battle of Markas, which gave that non-existent cultivator a reason to support Markas excessively, to the point of offering Aisnam an incredibly favorable deal. </p><p>“Have you seen that cultivator? Any idea about his power. He must not be strong if he doesn’t dare to approach the Queen now that she’s recovered?” </p><p>Her questions were good, with the implication of how a weak cultivator dared to target Kartpa Valley. Luckily, I was already prepared for that line of questioning. “No, their attitude implies their leader is not a simple man. I received the impression that they were far away.” </p><p>She frowned. “Any idea about what they need?” </p><p>I smirked proudly. “That, I know because they didn’t realize how sensitive is my hearing. I heard them discussing how they lacked a local channel to buy cultivation supplies. Apparently, they are lacking in spirit stones, talisman papers, jade for formations, and alchemy supplies,” I said. </p><p>The last two were not immediately useful, but it wasn’t like I was struggling to find more. I hoped that she had a better way to purchase them, as the itinerant cultivator market was particularly lacking when it came to that. For example, I had already depleted the available talisman paper there. </p><p>The formation of jade and alchemy supplies were not immediately required, but sooner or later, I would learn them. I just needed to find a way to teach Aisnam the basics first. </p><p>She fell silent, considering the implications of the organization with a grudge against a major sect. It was a dangerous thing. Understandable, as such a thing was risky enough to cost her life. </p><p>Soon, her face settled to a resigned expression, showing her acceptance. It didn’t surprise me. The scraps I had learned from her situation showed that her family dispute had something to do with the rivalry between Entsa Pavilion and Kartpa Valley, with her branch of the family on the side of Entsa Pavilion. </p><p>It made the prospect of weakening Kartpa Valley much more acceptable. </p><p>“They say they’ll only accept you as the messenger,” she said. </p><p>I shrugged. “Makes sense. It’s an easy task with little risk. Not even a job, and it gives me a chance to stretch my legs,” I said, doing my best to undervalue its importance. I didn’t expect such a small thing to interfere with the System returns, not with the way our relationship had turned out. </p><p>But, there was no point taking risks. </p><p>“Good. I better go talk with her Highness,” she said, signaling her need to leave. </p><p>I gestured for her to stop. “Two things,” I said. She nodded, signaling me to go ahead. “I got the feeling that they are from a faraway place. They didn’t talk much about their grudge, but they implied that it happened in the Battlefield.” </p><p>“And…” she said, realizing that I was leading to a point. </p><p>“The Queen might offset a lot of the money she needs to pay for Markas if she offers that knowledge,” I suggested. </p><p>“Good point,” she said with a thoughtful nod. I smiled. She believed it was because I managed to help her. I was happy because it solved my biggest problem by far. “And, what’s the second point.” </p><p>I grabbed her hips and pulled her close. “Well, her Highness could wait for a few minutes while you tend to my wounds, right?” </p><p>Her seductive smile was all I needed. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Tanpitana Tnak, Outer Elder of Kartpa Valley, master of the merciless fist, was not a happy man. Admittedly, it was not an unusual state of mood for him, a fact that the outer disciples had learned repeatedly. </p><p>He never had any problem taking his frustrations out of them while he trained them. Of course, a few people complained about being too rough, but he didn’t care. Who cared if a few outer disciples had been injured or died. </p><p>None of them were as important as a Golden Core cultivator. What if he killed a few of them. It wasn’t like they were lacking in itinerant cultivators with weak Immortal Roots. </p><p>Today was different. As he walked toward the gold-inlaid marble corridors, he didn’t have the option of being dismissive, even though the cultivator he was about to meet was merely a Foundation Establishment Cultivator. </p><p>He might be an Elder, but ultimately, he was an Outer Sect Elder, and even against Inner Sect disciples, let alone a Core Disciple … one with a high chance of leading the sect in the future. He stood in front of the door, bowed, and waited, not even daring to knock on the door, waiting for an invitation. </p><p>“Kowtow, dog!” the voice reached from inside, along with the pressure that a Foundation Establishment cultivator at the peak could bear. It hit Tanpitana hard, making him hit the floor hard as his gaze turned dark for a moment. </p><p>As a Golden Core cultivator, it was easy for him to counter the pressure. All he needed was to touch the crystallized Qi that was his golden core, and he would be safe. Major cultivation represented an unbreakable barrier when it came to raw power. Rare, once-in-a-century geniuses might break that — like that mad swordsman who wreaked havoc, who luckily went and disappeared into the Great Battlefield, hopefully forever — but even they only achieved it with superior weapons and expertise. </p><p>No one could use their Qi to pressure cultivators of a higher realm. </p><p>Unfortunately, Tanpitana didn’t dare to reach his Golden Core and obediently accepted his punishment. From the time he had decided to be his follower, he tried to defend himself once … his punishment was still a part of his nightmares. </p><p>He had chosen a cruel master, but it wasn’t like he had a choice. The other, more palatable candidates had too many Inner Sect Elders to choose from to pay attention to an Outer Sect Elder like him. </p><p>There was no escaping the indignity. </p><p>He kowtowed in front of the door for a day, all the while, making sure to keep a somber and fawning expression on his face. Finally, after a day, the door opened. “Crawl,” an order came. He followed, until he was in front of his merciless master, not daring to look up. “Explain how your so-called amazing plan failed before it even started, you pathetic dog! It’s a mere mortal city, not even the capital, but you failed to take over!” </p><p>Tanpitana didn’t need to fake his shivers. After all, he was right. His great plan failed before it even started. </p><p>Everything seemed so simple at the beginning. He had been lucky enough to discover the signs of a sleeping spiritual vein. Technically, it was a few outer disciples discovered, but since they were stupid enough to discuss it in their sect residence rather than reporting to the sect master for a reward, Tantipana dealt with them — permanently — before offering it to his master. </p><p>A new spiritual vein, regardless of its grade, would be enough for his master to make incredible progress. </p><p>The only problem, the Zaim kingdom was under the control of Entsa Pavilion, the only sect that could resist them, even with their most recent troubles. Worse, the spiritual vein was under Markas, an unremarkable city that was ruled by an ordained city lord. </p><p>Even he wasn’t arrogant enough to openly kill an ordained city lord. The matters of the battlefield were not something their sect could deal with. </p><p>So, he came up with a genius plan. He slowly instigated the local instructors of three Martial Arts schools. Tiger Fist was easy, as it was already under their control. A few Connate Realm artists could have dealt with the situation easily … but it would also point back to their sect. </p><p>He arranged a few bribes, arranged a few deaths, and soon, local chapters of Demon Claw and Dragon Saber schools were willing to support the coup as well. Since Demon Claw’s background was equal to Kartpa Valley, and Dragon Claw had an even bigger backing, the situation would be muddled enough. </p><p>Once that was done, Tanpitana planned to instigate a civil war in the Zaim kingdom to cover things up. Ironically, that would have been even easier. Verdant Family was already going through a messy internal fight, with one of their pawns even sent to a mere mortal as a bride. </p><p>Kill her in a manner that couldn’t be covered up, blame the King, and the Verdant family would throw enough of a fit to overshadow the death of an ordained city lord. It was supposed to be simple… </p><p>Then, things started to go wrong. First, that bastard city lord revealed he possessed an array plate. It wasn’t particularly valuable. Even that Inner Disciple from Entsa Pavilion took it down with one hit. Unfortunately, Martial Artists were useless pathetic worms, and couldn’t take down a barrier like that forever. </p><p>That was the first hitch, forcing him to intervene directly, using the excuse of the ban against cultivators intervening in mortal battles. It was a difficult technicality, one that he wouldn’t dare to use against Entsa Pavilion if it wasn’t for their recent troubles. Still, it was the limit of what he could do directly. </p><p>Not just because of Entsa pavilion, but also to avoid his rivals from suspecting him. Still, at that time, he thought that everything was resolved, the rebellious forces far stronger than the city lord. </p><p>Who knew that a pathetic local martial artist was hiding her cultivation all along. </p><p>He wanted to torture and kill every mortal in the city. How dare those mortals resist the plans of a cultivator. Unfortunately, that was not an option, not with the hidden spiritual vein. </p><p> Worse, he didn’t have many mortal agents that he could mobilize to handle the situation discreetly — who knew they would actually be useful one day. And, any attempt to suddenly develop some would alert his rivals in the sect. </p><p>So, he took a risk, and partially awakened the spiritual vein. He had hoped that the resulting monsters would erase Markas from the map, and no one would suspect him. Unfortunately, he miscalculated again, as Entsa Pavilion decided to support the city with their apothecaries despite the problems they were facing. </p><p>Luckily, he didn’t mention that particular fact to his master, or he would have been suffering even more problems. As far as he knew, it was just a natural flare from the spiritual vein that triggered the beast wave. </p><p>Luckily, he didn’t need to intervene much to trigger a reaction from the Tiger Fist. It was pure luck that the martial artist Entsa Pavilion decided to support had a grudge against Tiger Fist school. By selectively killing and crippling their martial artists, they ensured a revenge. </p><p>All he needed was to poke slightly to make that strike excessive. Martial artists might be pathetic ants, but a hundred Connate realm martial artists were enough to devastate multiple mortal kingdoms. They would probably do so now that they were mobilized, but Tanpitana didn’t care about what happened to mortals. </p><p>He only cared about his own cultivation. </p><p>“Tell me that you have a plan,” he ordered. </p><p>“Yes, master,” Tanpitana answered, still bowing. “I have --” he started explaining, only to be interrupted by a kick to his face. He could have resisted the blow with his Qi, but once again, he didn’t dare to. On the contrary, he deliberately weakened himself, and his chin caved in. </p><p>“I didn’t tell you to explain it. Go away, and you’re not allowed to cure your broken bones before your plan succeeds. Humiliation will teach you well!” </p><p>“Yes, master,” he said, though it came out garbling with his broken chin. </p><p>If he had a more reasonable master, he would have explained that walking around with a broken chin would be too suspicious, and would prevent him from intervening in case of another unexpected variable. </p><p>But, he would never dare to correct his master. Instead, he decided to go closed-door cultivation to avoid the suspicions of his rivals. His plan was good enough, and a year behind closed doors shouldn’t matter. </p><p>And, if it failed again, he could always come out and kill everyone, using a momentary cultivation deviation as an excuse. It was not ideal, as killing that many mortals would earn him a punishment. But, the biggest punishment would receive was a hundred years in the Great Battlefield, which was an acceptable alternative to disappointing his mercurial master… </p><p>The alliance wouldn’t care about mortal kingdoms as long as he left the tomb underneath the capital intact. </p><p>Only a year … then, one way or another, it would end. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>The distance between Pearyin’s cave and the capital wasn’t particularly grueling for me. Once I arrived, I didn’t waste any time before stepping into the secret entrance, and walking forward. </p><p>“Now, the best position to drain some Qi,” I muttered as I moved. The best location was the direct opposite of the stone door, but eliminating that option didn’t take long. It was inevitable that, as I drained the Qi, there would be some fluctuations in the surrounding motes, and the last thing I needed was to alarm Aisnam. </p><p>Instead, I picked a spot halfway in the tunnel. A nice compromise between Qi density and distance. Then, I crossed my legs, pushed my meditation technique to the limit, and started gathering Qi. “There are unexpected benefits of having a superior meditation technique,” I muttered. Cheating was certainly beneficial. </p><p>Five minutes had been enough for me to gather ten strands of cursed Qi into an orb, holding it tight under my control. I was confident that I could make that orb far bigger, but I decided not to take a big risk during the first trip. </p><p>It would be the first time I used my meditation technique while running. And, </p><p> Just to be on the safe side, I wrapped it with half a strand of my own Qi before I pulled it into my body. A layer of essence to keep it hidden, and I traveled back without a problem. Carrying ten strands had been easy. </p><p>“Hello, sweetie,” I said as entered the cave once more. “Continue meditating, I’ll be busy,” I added when I noticed she was about to say something. Then, I used several wards to create an exact copy of Aisnam’s purification setup before letting the cursed Qi I had gathered into the pseudo-storage it represented. </p><p>I wished I knew a talisman that could be used to store Qi. It would have made things so much easier.  </p><p>The Qi density in the room doubled immediately. It would have increased even more, but Pearyin’s suction was enough to handle the rest. </p><p>I settled next to her. “How do you feel?” I asked as I once again checked her body. </p><p>“Slightly more energetic, stir,” she answered obediently. I waited for a moment, wondering if she would ask a question about anything … including my displays, which, at this point, revealed my status as a Qi cultivator. Yet, Pearyin avoided asking even a question, accepting it silently. </p><p>Her mentality was truly difficult to understand. </p><p>“Good. I need to observe you a bit. Let’s work on your reading in that time,” I said, and started tutoring her. The difference between her earlier and current learning speed was different enough to be noticeable. A good detail, as it turned the fifteen-minute teaching session into something truly useful. </p><p>Unfortunately, the results of her consumption were different. The signs of starvation started to get more intense. I added four more Profound-Low Grade purification charms before her dantian reached its absorption limit and left some Qi to nourish her body. </p><p>Finding a solution was fortunate, though I would have preferred one that hadn’t increased cursed Qi consumption to an absurd degree. The setup required hundreds of strands of Qi to keep active. </p><p>“I’ll be back in a moment,” I said as I kissed her temple, and left for another round of Qi delivery. This time, I gathered fifty strands of Cursed Qi. It was more difficult to carry that much. I doubted that I could have lasted an hour. </p><p>Luckily, my mobility allowed me to handle the distance in minutes. </p><p>Three more repeats, and I had to move deeper into the tunnel, because Qi density had lessened significantly. It increases the risk, but taking that risk was inevitable to give Pearyin enough Qi to keep her satiated for a full day. </p><p>However, getting close to the stone gate had an unintended consequence. As I pulled the Cursed Qi, familiar whispers filled my mind, once again with the promises of endless rivers of blood and glory. This time, I chose to ignore them rather than retreat in fear. </p><p>“That’s the last delivery of the day,” I muttered as I dumped the last orb of dense Qi into the pseudo-storage. “It should be enough until my last visit,” I said. </p><p>“Thank you, sir. You’re too good to me,” she whispered. </p><p>“Think nothing of it, sweetie,” I said. “It’s an investment. You’re going to help me a lot as well.” </p><p>“My life is yours—” she started, but I pressed my finger against her lips. </p><p>“Nothing too dramatic, honey,” I said with a chuckle. “Now, before I leave, why don’t you show me the results of your study session?” </p><p>She blushed, but said nothing as she grabbed a brush, slowly writing the new words she had practiced in my absence. “Fascinating,” I said, which was not an exaggeration. She had progressed significantly. She was still a Beginner, but I could see that Minor Familiarity wasn’t too far away. </p><p>She had improved more than she had all month. Incredible, considering she wasn’t cheating like I was.  </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, feeling curious whether it was affecting only ordinary skills. “Now, why don’t you show me your Forest Dance stance.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said obediently, and went through the katas I had taught her, from Initiate to Connate. “Focus on initiate moves, and repeat thirty times,” I ordered. She followed that direction under my gaze. She was more proficient in those moves than writing, yet her rate of improvement was once again dozens of times better than her earlier achievement. </p><p>Her physique might be greedy beyond belief for Qi, but it was clear that the benefits were equally impressive. I hadn’t experienced such a sharp increase in my learning capability, and unless she was holding back seriously, neither did Aisnam. </p><p>“Good, let me teach you a new technique. It is called Rabbit Dash, and its only function is to run faster,” I said, then showed her the self-derived moves. </p><p>“Is this how you can run that fast, sir?” she said. </p><p>“Sure, what did you think?” </p><p>She blushed. “I thought it was a cultivation technique.” </p><p>“No, it’s a martial arts technique,” I replied. “Now, show me.” </p><p>Another martial artist might not have appreciated learning a technique that could be only used to run fast, especially since, learning multiple arts affected the purity of their essence. Pearyin clearly didn’t share that perspective, and learned the technique even more enthusiasm than Forest Dance.</p><p>Though, knowing her weird dedication, it might not be about the strategic benefits of such a technique. She might be just excited about learning a technique I knew. </p><p>I didn’t question it. Regardless of the reason, having the ability to run faster would be helpful.  </p><p>While she practiced under my guidance, I wrote a letter to Aisnam, arguably from the mysterious organization, which included a general summary of my deliveries for Markas, with some mentions that Tiger Fist had brought far more Connate Realm martial artists than they had shown. </p><p>As for the reward, I added a note that it was rather sensitive in nature, so I chose to deliver via her messenger. The reason for that was simple. I wanted to read her in real time as I made my cultivation-related requests. Based on her reaction, I could change my requests. </p><p>Also, having an excuse to question her about the nature of the cultivation would be useful as well. </p><p>“I’m about to leave. I’ll try to return tomorrow, but make sure you stay here even if I can’t,” I said. “But, before I leave, repeat the rules,” I said. </p><p>“I won’t leave the cave no matter what happens. If someone discovers me, I’ll claim that I’m a martial artist trying to perfect my art through traveling. If they insist on fighting, but are strong enough to deal with them, I will run away toward the Capital, and will go to the cave entrance you described.” </p><p>“And, what if you can’t ditch them until the capital.” </p><p>“I’m going to use five flame talismans in the pattern you taught me and target them in the air, then hide and wait for you. And, if I got discovered by other cultivators first, I’m going to claim that I was a new recruit by the sect, but before I could be sent, my recruiter had been killed by a crazy swords master.” </p><p>“Perfect,” I said. I hoped that it wouldn’t be necessary, but extra preparation never hurt. </p><p>With that done, I returned to the secret tunnel. I deserved a rest. However, as I walked, I touched the cursed Qi that filled the tunnel, trying to see if the amount increased enough to sustain Pearyin’s consumption. </p><p>It did not. </p><p> However, as I passed in front of the stone door while poking Qi, I felt a presence in my mind, similar to the earlier vogue promises … but this time, it was not another delirious choppy fever-dream vision.  </p><p>It was a whisper. </p><p>“Have you taken enough of my Qi, little cultivator?” the voice said, filled with promises of blood and victory. </p><p>I pointedly ignored that whisper as I went into the Spring Palace, hoping that I wasn’t making a horrible mistake. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I needed to make a decision about how to handle her exhaustion. I could see that it was not just about her physical exhaustion but also a lack of mana. </p><p>I touched the small box that was hanging on my chest, wondering whether to give her the dragon heart so she could recover. It would increase our survival chances significantly, but also it would give her a pretty good incentive to betray me. And, I needed to make a decision quick, because the battle was winding down even more. </p><p>“By the way, we still don’t know each other’s name,” I said, trying to. “My name is Marcus. You know my family name, but just assume that you don’t,” I said. </p><p>“Lillian Malone,” she responded, still looking down, ashamed of her condition. She certainly should be ashamed, as she was literally the worst mage I had ever seen, but it ceased to be a surprise once I heard her name. </p><p>Malone family was a minor noble family with little renown, with no notable military names or political figures. What they had was a large wetland rich with mana toward the North of Britannia, making them a notable supplier of various water-aligned materials. </p><p>It wasn’t too shocking for them to raise even a daughter to the rank of mage. Money and a proper supply chain was enough to solve a lot of problems. </p><p>Unfortunately, it also meant that, she would almost certainly recognize dragon heart, which might be an extremely rare magical wonder, but its descriptions were far more common. </p><p>I walked toward her, ignoring the way she looked. Well, trying to. Even under mortal danger, it was hard to ignore her long legs, coated with water droplets, her silk undershirt barely covering a couple inches below her hips. I was glad that I gave her my shirt because I might not be as successful in hiding my reaction if she didn’t have my large, baggy shirt to cover her other assets. </p><p>“Hop on, I’ll carry you,” I said as I turned my back to her, delaying the decision about the dragon heart for the moment. Ultimately, we needed to be in a safer location for her to absorb it properly, and staying in the cave was not an option. </p><p>“Are you sure?” she asked. “Maybe if I push myself—” she said as she forced herself to take a step, which was successful. The second, less so. Her leg gave under her as the exhaustion caught up with her. I covered the rest of the distance with a large step and wrapped my arms around her waist to prevent a painful fall. The last thing I needed was a head injury to complicate things even further. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she gasped, but I was more interested in the way her fingers landed on my chest, naked after giving her my shirt, and she caressed it. “So many scars,” she muttered absentmindedly as she traced one, but she didn’t sound repulsed. </p><p>In a way, it was good that I wasn’t the one having thoughts that were wildly inappropriate under the circumstances. On the other hand, it was bad, because it made my thoughts go in dangerous directions. Directions that were best left unexplored while under mortal danger. </p><p>With that in mind, I crouched down. “Hop on,” I ordered her again. It was the only way I could carry her while leaving my hands free. She did so, her arms around my neck, and her legs around my waist. I ignored her beauty, just as I ignored how easily she could kill me from that position, and started walking. “Don’t use any spell unless I expressly ask you,” I ordered her. “We’ll be going deeper into the island, and will pass near territories of the third-order beasts.” </p><p>“Are you sure that there are third-order beasts here?” she asked. “The island is a bit small for it.” </p><p>“Almost certain,” I said. “Either that, or they have one of the beasts that move around as a group, which is not any less dangerous than a solitary third-order beast.” </p><p>“I see,” she said before falling silent, and we continued to move deeper into the island. The downpour was both a blessing and a curse in terms of avoiding the beasts. Most of the beasts stayed in their dens, making the situation easy. Unfortunately, it also removed or muddled their tracks and territorial markings, making it more likely for us to stumble upon the nest of one of the beasts with a lower presence. </p><p>On my back, Lillian was lighter than some of the camping supplies I brought along for longer trips, which meant I could easily ignore her … well, at least her weight. Ignoring her fingers occasionally caressing my collarbones absentmindedly was harder to ignore. </p><p>Altogether, it was one of the harder multitasking challenges I had to go through. The temptation only faded when her weight suddenly changed. Her fingers stopped moving, and her weight settled against my back. </p><p>She managed to fall asleep despite the rain, showing that she was even more exhausted than I expected. </p><p>I continued moving deeper into the island, fully focusing on my senses as I used my detection ability to the limit, to the point of wasting mana. But then, mana was the one thing I wasn’t lacking. Occasionally, I looked back, watching the signs of battle. It was still ongoing, but the distance between flame attacks started to get larger. </p><p>Unfortunately, it didn’t make me feel any calmer, because it allowed me to see that the pirates had been being pushed away from the island, and the other mysterious party taking their place. It was not good news, because the pirates only wanted Lillian to sell her back to them, looking for money. No buyer, no deal,, so they would have no reason to explore the island. </p><p>The other party wanted Lillian as a hostage. I didn’t know — or particularly care — about the reason. But I knew that they were much more inclined to stick around and search for Lillian. </p><p>I sighed as I moved even deeper into the island, close enough to the center where I expected the third-order beast to be. I would have seen it as an unacceptable risk if it wasn’t for the even bigger threat behind, eventually coming looking for us. </p><p>With a cadre of mages chasing us — as I didn’t have the slightest doubt that the enemy had more mages than the fire experts I was able to see through the darkness, or the pirates wouldn’t have retreated — those dangerous beasts represented a shield for us instead. </p><p>It would be best if they decided it was not worth further search for a woman who was likely dead, but even if they stuck around, every day was actually to my benefit. I continued searching for a viable residence… </p><p>Soon, I found a nice cave. Small entrance, concealed surroundings, and even some edible plants. It might turn completely invisible if we pulled a rock in front of it. </p><p>But, its greatest value was the depth, enough to block the presence of the dragon heart when it was active. The only problem, once I got sufficiently closer, I felt a presence, one that I could identify as a second-order beast even with the ground blocking our way. </p><p>I gently shifted Lillian, and pressed my hand to her mouth before waking her up, not wanting her to alert the beasts. The moment she woke up, her eyes widened in panic, but subsided after seeing my face. I pulled back my hand. </p><p>“What’s going on?” she asked.</p><p>“I found another cave, but there’s another second-order beast inside,” I said. “Probably some kind of possum.” </p><p>“How do you know?” she asked. </p><p>“Wilderness training,” I cut her off, as it was hardly the time to explain the various tracking concepts. “I know you’re tired, but can you fight?” </p><p>“I … I can try,” she said, but she didn’t sound hopeful. </p><p>For a moment, I considered giving her the dragon heart so she could recover, but I soon decided against it. It was too risky. Once activated, it would radiate a lot of mana, and if we did that out in the open, it would inevitably be noticed. </p><p>Then, it would be a question of whether the third-order beasts or the mysterious mages caught up with us first. Neither option was safer than trying to deal with a second-order beast alone. It would be even easier with Lillian helping. </p><p>“How many spells that can cut through the defenses of a second-order beast without collapsing?” I asked. </p><p>“Three at most,” she declared bravely. </p><p>I decided to make all my plans based on two, and several contingencies assuming she would collapse after one. Still, considering I had been ready to take the beast alone, so any help was welcome. I started developing a set of signals. “Now, let’s make a plan. I want you to hold your casting until I show you…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Hey, lady, calm down a minute,” I called as I rolled to avoid another water blade, trying to understand what was going on. “I’m not with the pirates!” </p><p>“I know!” she bellowed, only to send another water-blade attack, which I dodged with surprising ease. A part of it was her lack of combat experience, which had been obvious from her earlier show, but even more pronounced was her mana depletion. She was clearly running on fumes. </p><p>That, more than anything, held my hand despite her clearly murderous actions. I was confident that I could handle her with only a minor risk to myself. As whether I would have taken the risk to keep her alive if the assistance of a friendly mage could be the key to staying alive during the inevitable chaos that would follow … but that was a question that didn’t need any answer. </p><p>However, I didn’t roll back to speak with her, not when she was at the entrance, cutting my escape path. Initially, I had been treating the small size of the cave as an advantage, but that was when I didn’t even consider keeping the visitor alive. </p><p>I timed a gap between two attacks before charging forward, and hit her chest with the blunt end of the spear, right under her ribs. Her eyes widened as her ability to breathe was suddenly gone, and she fell on her knees, temporarily unable to speak. </p><p>I immediately ripped a strip from her skirt and tied her hands, wishing that it was that easy to immobilize a mage. Unfortunately, I didn’t have any of the extremely rare and expensive tools that could suppress the mana of a prisoner. I tied her hands more of a mental trick. Since she was unused to combat, maybe she wouldn’t immediately consider one of the dozen ways she could use it… particularly when she had a spear pointing at her neck, this time the sharp spear. </p><p>I examined her while her breathing returned. The first thing that I noticed was her beauty. Blonde hair as bright as gold even after running through a downpour, a fair, beautiful face. Not to mention her curves, which had been very noticeable with her drenched dress sticking close. It was particularly noticeable since the battle was over, but my blood was still pumping. </p><p>I forcibly raised my gaze to her face. She mistook me for someone else, and I didn’t want to risk annoying her further. However, the more I looked at her face, the more, I found her familiar, as if I had seen her before. </p><p>I decided to speak once her breathing calmed down. “Why don’t we calm down and talk. I don’t know who you think I am, but I’m sure—” </p><p>“Really, you Scipio dog. Do you think I don’t recognize you!” she interrupted me. A part of me wondered whether she was brave or stupid, insulting the man who was holding a spear against her throat, but I didn’t ask her that. </p><p>“You know me? How?” I asked, which made her look even angrier. “Is it the wanted posters?” I asked, ready to explain to her the gist of the situation, and hoping she would believe. If she recognized me from them, then her anger wouldn’t be too shocking. </p><p>Patricide was a hated crime for a reason. </p><p>“What poster?” she asked, surprised, but it didn’t take long for her expression to shift back to anger. “I shouldn’t be surprised. It’s clear that finally, someone caught your reprehensible family’s ways!” </p><p>I paused a moment, shocked by her statement, but connecting the dots had been easy. After all, there was only one man I know who carried the family name whose actions would be credited to the whole family. “It’s my fucking uncle, right? What did he do?” I asked but kept my spear against her throat. </p><p>“You know very well what did he do!” she said. “Don’t think that you can get away!” </p><p>I sighed. “Just calm down and think for a second. You’re tied, and I have a weapon. I had you under my mercy. Why would I bother talking with you instead of knocking your head and taking you down,” I said, then looked out. The battle was still ongoing, but the distance between the two groups was getting wider, signaling the battle was winding down. “And, speak fast. We don’t have much time, and I would be running away. Without you, if you can’t convince me to bring you with me.” </p><p>“You have a way to escape?” she asked. I nodded shamelessly. Technically, it was even the truth, but it required staying on the island for several days first. “I’ll speak,” she said. </p><p>“First, tell me how you recognized me?” I asked. </p><p>“You were fighting for the Scipio family during the games three years ago. I had seen you during the fights, and … I remember you,” she said. I thought that I caught a blush, but it was hard to be sure under the light. Maybe she was getting sick. </p><p>I remembered the games. They were a bunch of pointless duels between noble families, with their warriors fighting against various imported first-order beasts. My bastard of an uncle had arranged for me to fight when my grandfather’s illness first started to flare up, flaunting his increased control. Worse, he had managed to arrange that the pair of tigers imported tigers I arranged to fight had been drugged, forcing me to reveal far more of my abilities than I had been willing to, and still only winning after some very painful wounds. </p><p>“Alright, that’s how you recognize me. How did you get caught?” </p><p>“My family has been invited to one of his feasts in Londonium, but he drugged us. When I woke up, I was on a ship, locked down. I was there for two weeks, when a water mage attacked the ship and kidnapped me from there.” </p><p>I sighed. It was just my luck that I escaped from Britannia, but somehow found myself entangled with the ploys of my bastard of an uncle. </p><p>“Now, I’m going to cut you free, but please don’t attack me. We’re in a very dangerous situation, and only by cooperating we can survive,” I explained. </p><p>She nodded, blushing more. Her condition must be even worse than I expected. “Why are you helping me? They are determined to capture me for some reason, and staying together with me will only risk you.” </p><p>“Because I don’t have any choice. After such an intense battle, the beasts of the island will get far more aggressive, and no matter how hard I work, I can’t avoid them all. I need your help to get deeper into the island to avoid the pirates and the other party, and you need my assistance not to anger every beast on the way.” </p><p>“Well, putting it that way, we’re helping each other,” she said as she stood up, but her legs were trembling. “I’m ready.” </p><p>“First, remove your dress,” I ordered. </p><p>Her blush got more intense, and this time, it was clearly not about her exhaustion. “I … here … right now,” she stammered. “But, we need to escape. And I never…”</p><p>“We need your dress to bait the inevitable chase. The rain is going to help us to erase our tracks, but we can’t easily leave false tracks either. So, we’re going to use one thing they will be looking for.” </p><p>“M-my dress,” she stammered. “But, I will be…” </p><p>“You have other clothes under your dress, right. I know that much about fashion at least,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, but—” she tried to argue. </p><p>“We don’t have time. I’ll even turn my back, and you can wear my shirt,” I said, and turned my back before removing my shirt. </p><p>She gasped. “So many scars.” </p><p>“I had a tough training,” I countered. “Now, quick. We don’t have much time.” </p><p>When something heavy dropped to the ground, I picked it up and walked without looking back, no matter the temptation. The view would be spectacular, I had no doubt, but nowhere near valuable enough to anger the mage I would be relying on for my survival. </p><p>Instead, I left the cave and went for the location of her battle, where I found a second-order snake bisected in two, surrounded by several deep crevices. I shivered. “Thank gods she’s an incompetent fighter,” I muttered. I didn’t want to imagine how the fight in the cave would have gone if she wasn’t at the edge of a collapse. </p><p>Still, once I looked around, I saw what I had been hoping for. Several first-order beasts, were drawn to the blood despite the rain. I quickly wrapped the dress around the snake, trusting the other beasts to do the job of dragging the dress around when they inevitably fought for the remains. I didn’t cut any meat for myself, because I didn’t want any of the beasts following me for an easy reward. </p><p>It wouldn’t convince any tracker, not even a novice one, that she died there, but my hope wasn’t to convince them to call off the chase but give them too many false leads, hoping that, eventually, they would anger too many beasts to make it worthwhile no matter how much my new ally was worth to them. </p><p>And, at one point, they had to believe that a rich girl with no training had died to a beast, and leave. We just needed to stay hidden until then. </p><p>When I returned to the cave, she was at the entrance, trying to stand, but her legs were trembling badly. “Can you walk?” I said. Her head dipped in shame, which was enough of an answer. </p><p>Like things weren’t difficult. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I ignored the alarmed shouts of the rest of the pirates as I moved deeper into the island … a move most would have been treated as madness. After all, once the ship sailed away, I would be deserted alone on an island teeming with magical monsters. </p><p>It was truly teeming. Around me, I could see the territory markers of many different animals with hints of mana, some strong enough to make me suspect that there were second-order beasts in the mix. Meaning, a wrong move would end up very badly for me. </p><p>Against one second-order beast, I would probably win, but it would be a long and painful battle. And, it certainly wouldn’t be silent. If that battle was close to the shore, it would be noticed by the pirates, ruining my attempts to avoid their notice and triggering a manhunt, particularly since they were tense for their upcoming deal. </p><p>It was even worse if the same happened deeper into the island. With some exceptions, higher-order beasts avoided the shores so as not to leave themselves open to attack, which in turn, made the weaker ones migrate to the outskirts of the island. Any fight deeper into the island would bring other second-order beasts to spectate. </p><p>Even with my most recent improvements, I was still an apprentice mage, and there were limits to what I could do. Taking multiple second-order beasts, particularly without proper weapons forged with mana. I doubted the spear could even pierce the skin of a second-order beast.</p><p>Worse, despite being relatively close to the shore, I was seeing the territory markers of the second-order beasts near the shore, making me suspect that there might be a third-order beast deeper into the island. If I awakened it from its slumber…</p><p>“Keep your mind on the game, Marcus,” I muttered as I carefully moved deeper into the island, carefully reading the territory markers of the various beasts to carefully skirt between the territory of the beasts. It was a slow, careful progress. After three hours, I was merely a mile deeper into the island, looking for a nice little cave. The progress was slower than I could crawl, but trying to dance between the territory of the different beasts hadn’t been easy. </p><p> “Looks like I have a new home,” I muttered as I looked at the empty cave in front of me. It was large enough to function as a room, with an entrance that was barely enough for me to walk in comfortably. However, its biggest feature was that it was empty, and every beast avoided it. The reason, it was safely nestled between the territory of three second-order beasts. A second-order beast couldn’t move in without triggering a territory battle, and any first-order beast would eventually become a meal. </p><p>For me, they represented a shield, one that would allow me to lay low until the trade was conducted and they left. As long as I stayed inside, not searching for food and water, I would be safe. Food was not a problem. The trade would probably happen in a couple days. A week at most. It wouldn’t be the first time I stayed hungry for a long time. </p><p>I couldn’t go without water for a week, but that didn’t seem to be too big of a problem. If there was one thing Britannia didn’t lack, it was rain, ready to turn any hunting trip into a muddy challenge. Even now, I could see the clouds gathering at the horizon, promising that fresh water wouldn’t be a problem. </p><p>“It won’t be fun,” I muttered to myself as I settled against the empty cave wall. Just because I knew I could survive a week without food didn’t mean it was an enjoyable experience. It was worse than being stabbed … and I had experience to compare. The cave was uncomfortable as well, but I didn’t dare to cut a few branches from the nearby trees, not willing to leave any markings for something as useless as comfort. </p><p>The bare ground was uncomfortable, but nowhere near as uncomfortable as the hunger, especially without anything to distract me. I settled against the wall, and closed my eyes, wishing Jupiter that pirates completed the hostage exchange sooner than later. Then I would be alone, free to reach the next order and finally become a mage. </p><p>A mage of four elements. </p><p>I only moved near midnight, when the cold winds and lightning turned into rain, which soon turned into a downpour, enough to block the view, which allowed me to go out safely and gather some leaves, making a primitive bowl, enough to allow me to drink the rain, its freshness making me feel like everything was going to be fine. Almost like a dream…</p><p>A dream that had been squished by a sudden column of flame, coming from the direction of the cove the pirate ship had docked, cutting through the darkness and the downpour to alight the night sky for a moment. </p><p>“Please be a monster attack, please be a monster attack…” I begged even as I moved back to the entrance of the cave, ready to disappear at any moment. It wasn’t impossible, as while many beasts avoided such downpours, some of the water and air-natured beasts reacted differently. It wasn’t outside the realm of possibility for them to attack a ship despite the risk. </p><p>But, I knew that wasn’t the case. Not with my luck. Somehow, even before seeing any evidence, I knew that the deal had fallen through. Nothing else was possible with my luck. </p><p>However, I was still surprised when another thick column of fire covered the sky, stronger than what Publius had released. Far stronger… </p><p>No wonder the pirate captain had been tense about the prospect of the trade. The defender was strong, easily a peak mage, or a group of mages cooperating. Either way, a dangerous situation … but the fire column died halfway. With the downpour, I couldn’t see, but it wasn’t hard to guess that the captain, an extremely skilled water mage, blocked the attack. </p><p>I pitied their opponents. Fighting against a water mage would be troubling enough on the thick downpour of rain making the advantages of a water mage even more pronounced. I watched the horizon, unable to see anything but the occasional flashes of fire, wondering how the battle was going. </p><p>I wasn’t afraid of one side’s victory unless it came in a Pyrrhic variant where the ship of the victorious party had been damaged to sail away. An even worse situation would be a stalemate, where one party is forced deeper into the island while the other party chased them. </p><p>That would be a disaster even if they manage to kill the defending party. I was confident in surviving the island, but only under the condition that the beasts stayed calm. A battle between mages would inevitably kill some and displace others, which might trigger a cascade of movement, and my little cave disappeared. </p><p>The worst thing, there was nothing I could do. I was powerless to do anything but wait, stretching my senses to the limit as I tried to notice any magical presence. It was a tradeoff, as it prevented me from suppressing my magical presence, leaving me open to detection. I could just hope that any being with the ability to detect me would be more interested in the magical battle that was going on the shore. </p><p>It turned out to be the correct choice, as merely two minutes later, I felt a presence running toward my location. A water mage, which almost sent me panicking before I realized that he wasn’t as strong as the captain. His presence felt weaker as he rushed forward, casting some kind of spell to cut down the beasts. </p><p>A deserter, I decided even as I pulled back into my cave and suppressed my mana once again, as tight as I could manage, and leaned against the cave wall, invisible from outside, hoping that the deserter would find another location to hide. </p><p>With my magical presence suppressed, I was blind to his as well, but that didn’t make me deaf. The death throes of a beast were clear enough, and so was the sound of multiple water blades moving at a great speed, telling the story of a short yet intense battle. </p><p>The mage was strong, but not particularly competent as most of the blades hit against the rocks and ground, the noise was distinct enough. </p><p>Once the battle ended, silence followed, but I stayed tense, hoping to hear another battle far away. Instead, I heard footsteps, just several feet away from the entrance, but it was hard to be sure with the downpour covering. </p><p> I waited with my fingers tight around the inferior spear, hidden in the shadows, ready to take down the opponent before they could react. As for whether I would stay in the cave or leave, that was a question for the future. </p><p>However, when the wayward mage appeared at the entrance, I froze. Long blonde hair, tattered and drenched remains of a silk dress, an exhausted gait. I think that I had just met with the unlucky hostage. It seemed that she had managed to use the chaos to free herself. </p><p>I froze, trying to find a way to call her without receiving an attack, but she noticed me first. The face was vaguely familiar, but before I could remember why I recognized her, her eyes widened. “You!” she gasped, and waved her hand, a few raindrops from the entrance turning into a blade that I only dodged barely. </p><p>And, only because the delay allowed me to release my magical presence once more. </p><p> I rolled on the ground as the water blade bit into the wall… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“… Any volunteers for the scouting duty, maggots,” Publius shouted, loud enough that I was able to hear from the lower decks. </p><p>It was time to check, I decided as I once again suppressed my magic and climbed the stairs. I needed to see the location of the deal in order to decide on an escape plan. Publius’ shout was already promising. Since they asked for scouts, it meant we weren’t going to a city or a large town. </p><p>A small village was an option, but the likelier option was that they wanted to land in the wilderness, preparing in case things devolved into a fight. They had been running drills for the last few hours, preparing for that exact probability. </p><p>I stayed holed in lower decks, afraid of getting caught. Captain stayed in his cabin to my knowledge, but the constant drills meant the other two mages were constantly moving around, entering the crew area repeatedly. </p><p>I couldn’t suppress my magic for half a day, not unless I wanted to turn into a wreck ruined by pain, so I silently took the pump duty. No one bothered to reassign the duty to someone else, and I was happy with that negligence. </p><p>I didn’t dare to use the dragon heart during the mess. I had enough mana, and the benefits of the little extra power it would generate were not worth the risk. </p><p>Even now, I thought about staying down while the others scouted, but decided against it. I needed to see exactly where we had reached. I hoped we were at the shores of Gaul. Germania shores would be a nice alternative as well. It would mean I was free of Roman authority completely. </p><p>Of course, that would mean I had to deal with the tribes, which wasn’t exactly simple. A lot of Romans had dismissed the tribes of Germania as savages, but considering they had resisted the combined might of the Roman Republic of West and Roman Empire of East for several centuries despite several dedicated invasion attempts meant that they weren’t as simple. </p><p>Elemental magic was not common among them, but considering their beast tamers and priestesses were able to push Roman legions led by sorcerers, treating them as weaklings was an easy way for a quick death … or not so quick, if they decided to turn that said idiot into a sacrifice.</p><p>It was a dangerous place, but I much rather go there than return to Britannia, where I was the subject of a province-wide manhunt. </p><p>When I arrived at the upper deck, a smile bloomed on my face. We were not at Britannia. Instead, we were just a mile away from one of the small islands that lay between Gaul and Britannia. </p><p>Which one, I didn’t know yet since I was holed with the pump, but, I had studied the region aggressively for my eventual escape to make an educated guess. </p><p>There were only a few viable options, and, every one of those islands was closer to the shores of Gaul than Britannia, making them good places to hide. I could find a cave and hide, wait until they left, complete my breakthrough safely before I constructed a small but serviceable boat, and replicate the Captain’s trick for a quick trip to Gaul. </p><p>I wouldn’t have his power and control after the breakthrough, but the dragon heart was an excellent tool to solve such problems. </p><p>I just needed to get away from them without getting noticed by a second-order beast that was without a doubt occupied the island. People didn’t live on those small islands because of the constant threats from sea beasts, but the island would still have several dangerous land beasts. </p><p>Hopefully, they would be deeper into the island, trying to avoid their sea brethren. </p><p>I wanted to volunteer as a scout, but once again, I held myself back. Volunteering for such a mission would be too flashy for a new recruit, particularly one that built a reputation for cowardice. Instead, I picked a nice spot to stand. Not directly in front of Publius, but close enough that he didn’t miss the presence of a strong-looking recruit. </p><p>“No volunteers. Pathetic,” he grunted as he pointed at several people. I hid my smile when he pointed at me, and instead walked to the weapon rack to pick a spear. “Your mission is to scout the area around the cove. Walk around with the teams of four, and alert the other teams if you come across any magical beast, even if they are only first order. Understood,” he said. </p><p>“Yes,” I said, while other people also mumbled confused replies. It was a pirate ship of dubious discipline, after all. </p><p>Five teams, and a total of twenty people left the ship and used a boat to go to the shore, though it took three trips to bring all of us out. “Look, rookie. Listen to us and go where we order. The last thing we need is for you to panic and anger the beasts,” he warned me. </p><p>I nodded, looking fearful, but my attention was on the island. It was a beautiful little island, about eight miles from shore to shore, with a large hill at the center. It wasn’t exactly a lush forest, but there was enough vegetation to suggest the existence of a freshwater source. </p><p>Food was even less of a concern. I could see birds flying above the island, and fish was always an option once the deal with the mysterious party was done and they departed. </p><p>The only problem was the size. The island was too small to hide from them if they searched for me. But, it was not a serious problem, I was confident that they would not. I had already seen that they didn’t particularly care about their new recruits. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I stepped on the land, a big smile on my lips. I didn’t try to hide it, because the other new recruits had a similar expression. </p><p>Even discounting the mortal danger, spending a week in a cramped and smelly pirate ship hadn’t been fun. Just because I could handle that — and more — didn’t make it any less annoying. </p><p>The group leader quickly distributed assignments for each team. It was still noon, so there was no need for torches and other equipment. Once again, I positioned myself in a way I had been chosen for the most dangerous and least rewarding mission. </p><p>First group. </p><p>My wilderness knowledge revealed just how much a horrible job it was. Any beast that felt strong enough to attack a group of humans was also strong enough to kill a novice fighter with a spear before reinforcements could arrive. </p><p>Luckily, I preferred it, as I was more concerned about my human ‘allies’ than the beasts. </p><p>Luckily, there was no image in the group. They were too precious to risk in a potentially dangerous situation where the disposable troops would work just as well. Of course, one of the mages could have waited at the shore to respond to emergencies, but I could understand why they did not. </p><p>Fighting against the beasts would cost them valuable mana, and they didn’t want to waste it before their trade. </p><p>It meant I didn’t need to keep suppressing my magic. I stopped pressing it and even used a touch to enhance my senses. Technically, it was a risk, as our group had three more apprentice mages. I took that risk, because not many apprentice mages learned how to detect other magic users. It was a difficult trick that required a lot of hard work, for a skill with limited utility compared to hitting harder and moving faster. </p><p>It turned out to be a reasonable assumption, as none paid me a second glance even as I examined the island as much as possible, trying to detect a beast that would give me an excuse to die. </p><p>Only when my group moved deeper into the island, they paid attention to me. “Just hold onto your spear tight, and watch your surroundings carefully,” the leader of my group said. “We’ll support you immediately if a beast attacks.” </p><p>I nodded, acting like I didn’t notice him slowly lengthening the distance between us as we went deeper into the forest. I had already picked an ideal target. A small rocky outcropping, with some large bushes surrounding it. Together, it was imposing enough to create a nice concealment as I escaped. </p><p>More importantly, I could see the distinct presence of a first-order beast there. Not exactly a beast I wanted to fight. There was no guarantee that I could run away from it if I was alone. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t need to run faster than the beast. I just needed to run faster than my teammates. “A beast,” I shouted as loud as possible without warning, and threw my spear to the presence I felt, ignoring the shouts to stop. </p><p>I started running even before a boar appeared. “Excellent,” I muttered as I made a show of panicking while I ran deeper into the island. A boar was dangerous enough to threaten a group of novice warriors without magic. </p><p>A first-order boar … I would be surprised if any from my group survived, not that I cared. I had more important things. I ran deeper, happy that another step in my mission for freedom was complete. Now, I just needed to survive on a wild island filled with monsters while avoiding a ship full of pirates…</p><p>And a mysterious group that was strong enough to make those pirates threatened. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“How about if I add ten thousand more, boys,” I said during another hand, slurring my words to show I was getting drunk. The mostly empty bottle next to me reinforced it further. </p><p>I decided to make a move, because when Tiffany turned the first three cards, there was an ace there, which guaranteed my victory unless they had revealed something ridiculous as four of a kind. </p><p>I had pocket aces, which was a bit more literal. I had literally stolen them during earlier hands, hiding them in my pocket, waiting for such an opportunity, but the boys hadn’t noticed it. Even Umi didn’t notice it, and her hands were still very close to said pocket as she gave me a slow handjob whenever she was out of the game by folding. </p><p>“That’s an excellent idea, sir,” Mark said. </p><p>Charlie didn’t share his idea and leaned to whisper something to him. Unfortunately, they were also drinking, and while they weren’t drunk, they were certainly tipsy, enough not to realize their whispers weren’t as inaudible as they might have liked. “Maybe we should stop. What happens if he doesn’t remember losing all that money, and refuses to pay,” Charlie whispered. </p><p>“Don’t be a moron. We’re not going to take his money, but generously forgive it, and he’ll be thankful enough to assign us better districts, and we’ll make more in commissions. The more he owes us, the better,” Mark said, his whisper equally ineffective. His plan was not terrible, but execution left much to desire. </p><p>Tiffany and Umi grinned mockingly, but neither said anything to protect them. </p><p>“Sure, boss,” Charlie said. </p><p>“Good, but I need a beautiful fairy to give me some luck,” I slurred as I let my gaze between the two, and tapped my lap. “Who will be the lucky one.” The silence that followed was beautiful. After all, what I was asking was absurd, yet they couldn’t say anything to me because I had the excuse of being drunk. “I think it’s only fair for you two to decide it,” I added as I pulled a coin and flipped it.</p><p>Frozen by the sudden change, neither reacted until the coin could land on my palm, which I put on the back of my hand … but not before revealing the coin to Mark, knowing exactly how he would react. </p><p>“Heads,” Mark said. Charlie froze once I revealed the coin, unable to react to the sudden change. </p><p>“It looks like you’re the winner, my sexy secretary,” I said as I pushed my chair back slightly, careful to keep my boner hidden under the table to avoid some uncomfortable questions. </p><p>“Well, since my fiancee decided to put me as a bet,” she said as she pulled her blazer as tight as possible, and shifted to my lap. </p><p>“I … but … what?” Charlie stammered, trying to come up with an argument, but failed. It didn’t surprise me. Charlie was not a very assertive person at his best, and facing a crowd that was willing to ignore his opinion didn’t make him any more assertive. “Umi?” he asked. </p><p>“Oh, since my dear fiancee wants to use me as a bet, who am I to refuse,” she said. </p><p>Charlie looked at me, but an angry gaze from me was enough to dissuade him even as I slipped my hands under Umi’s blazer and caressed her belly directly. I didn’t need another reason to disrespect him, but I had one anyway. </p><p>He glanced at Tiffany, no doubt wishing that she was the one on my lap rather than his fiancee, but even in his tipsy state, he was able to realize it was an absurd point to take. Yet, he was still frustrated, so he turned to the only person he could. </p><p>His ally, who had just betrayed him. It was the reason I had used a coin flip and revealed that to Mark, who was too much of an opportunistic stain not to use the chance to keep his wife away from me while she was angry. </p><p>Too bad he was too late. </p><p>Charlie looked at Mark angrily, preparing to say something. “I raise my three grand,” I said, interrupting their romantic gaze. “How about you guys.” </p><p>I interrupted it because I wanted Charlie steaming, ready to take revenge. “Yes, sweetie, how about you?” Umi asked with a seductive tone, which impacted the mood even more as she rocked her hips, which felt amazing on my naked cock. </p><p>“I call,” Mark said, happy to keep his betrayal unmentioned. Charlie nodded as well but was nowhere near as happy as he pushed his chips forward. They pushed bravely because I almost lost thirty thousand, which was split between them. Three grand was nothing, particularly since I was a bad poker player, right? </p><p>As Tiffany added more cards, I was paying more attention to Umi than the cards, the results were already fixed, raising twice more. Then, Tiffany flipped the last card, and I cheated my way to victory with my three aces. </p><p>“Excellent, it looks like I was lucky,” I said as I pulled the pot in front of me, instantly recovering half of my losses in one hand. I grabbed Umi’s hair pulled it back, and kissed her neck while passing five hundred dollars worth of chips to her hand. “Your tip for my fortune,” I said, then kissed her neck. </p><p>Rather than keeping her moan in, Umi moaned. Charlie stiffened. </p><p>“Stay calm,” Mark said as he grabbed his shoulder, once again thinking that he was whispering. “It’s a good way to distract him. This way, we’ll win even easier.” </p><p>“It’s not your wife that’s on his lap, struggling to put on a brave face,” Charlie said. Tiffany barely held back her laughter at the absurdity of that statement. Umi didn’t try to laugh, but she was too busy not to moan as I continued to nibble her neck. </p><p>They looked at each other like they were about to fight, so I interrupted. I needed more than an inept boxing match between two skinny tipsy dudes to entertain me. “Deal another hand,” I ordered Tiffany. </p><p>Charlie was frustrated, but once again, he was unable to adapt quickly, which left his beautiful fiancée on my lap as we played. How unfortunate. </p><p>I lost next hand spectacularly, my ‘stupid’ move coinciding with Umi’s moan, which triggered another argument between the two about how to win, while the girls and I acted oblivious to it, like we were unable to hear them. </p><p>Meanwhile, while they argued, Umi rolled back her skirt until my shaft was not resting against the cloth of her skirt, but against her wetness directly. She moved back and forth with renewed passion, coating the side of my shaft with her juices. </p><p>Beautiful. </p><p>“… I just think it’s unfair,” Charlie muttered, trying to whisper, but once again, his voice was nowhere near as low as he thought. Meanwhile, I said nothing, enjoying Umi’s subtle dance. He spoke again once the hand was over, and he won. “Maybe Tiffany should take her place since I’m the winner,” Charlie said. </p><p>What a genius idea, I thought, but said nothing while Mike looked at him in shock. </p><p>Tiffany was the first one to speak. “He has a point, my dear husband,” she said. “After all, it’s not fair for Umi to be the only one to keep him happy, when you asked me to keep him satisfied … several times.” </p><p>Mark blinked at the unexpected intervention, but when he Tiffany’s vindictive smirk, he didn’t argue. “Well, I can’t argue with that logic,” he admitted, though it was like trying to pull a tooth, no doubt cursing himself when he first accepted that as a part of the game when he saw the opportunity to cheat on the coin toss, which allowed him to act as a bootlicker while making Charlie pay. </p><p>Only now,  he realized Charlie wouldn’t be the only one to pay. </p><p>Umi slid back to her seat reluctantly, while Tiffany took her place with relish. Her plied skirt was easier to manipulate than Umi’s pencil skirt, and it allowed her to pull her skirt away. </p><p>It wasn’t the only difference. Unlike Umi, who kept herself rubbing, Tiffany aligned herself against my shaft, and sank slowly, taking my shaft inside. Not all of it, as even with her wetness, it was not a challenge that could be taken easily.  Barely a  third, but it was still impressive that she managed to deal the next set of cards with a perfectly smooth expression that revealed nothing. </p><p>“Oh, what an interesting reveal,” she said softly, concealing a moan. Alright, not that smooth or perfect, but it was more than enough to trick the two tipsy men across the table, too busy looking at each other in anger,  frustrated with each other’s betrayal…</p><p>Unaware of the real betrayal that was going on. </p><p>It was quickly shaping up to be one of the greatest poker games I had ever played despite some stiff competition. Not the best, but certainly in top ten… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The departure from Markas had been easy. After everything I had offered, Marana and Falnaher were quite tense, for very justifiable reasons. I might have given them the methods to fight against the upcoming army, but while that resolved their most immediate problem, it also meant their future just had become far more complicated. </p><p>There had been no mention of the city lord during my visit, making me wonder whether he was wounded, or he had some other reason for not appearing. However, ultimately, I said nothing. Being an ordained city lord was clearly a complicated matter, and their distrust was understandable. </p><p>I might have tried to force my way to a meeting somewhat under different circumstances, but it worked to my benefit since I wasn’t planning to spend any more time in Markas. </p><p>On my way back, I stopped a few times to examine the plants, trying to see if I could somehow discover the source of savage beasts from the differences in their growth rate as I guessed. A few stops confirmed that, yes, it was possible, though it required considerable expertise in gardening, along with the sharp senses of an apothecary. </p><p>Not exactly a common skillset for a scout. </p><p>After spending some time, I was sure that the source of the disaster was in the official borders of Markas, but near enough to fall into the surrounding forests with next to no population even before things had started to escalate. </p><p>I was just happy that it was away from the spot of my summoning. That was one complication I didn’t want to deal with. </p><p>While I managed to roughly identify the direction of the source, visiting was a completely different issue. I didn’t go there, because I didn’t dare to. I had no idea of what there might be there. </p><p>Technically, they might even have a cultivator or two waiting on guard. Admittedly, it wasn’t likely, as the presence of the Tiger Fist army was evidence that they wanted to limit their involvement as much as possible, but I didn’t want to risk it. Moreover, even without a direct presence, there might be a plethora of surprises there. </p><p>As a cultivator, I was reluctant to poke into a potential disaster like that. My current stage was troubling enough, but it wasn’t what kept me back. I might be at the third stage, but I only required a couple hours to push myself safely to the ninth level. </p><p>What kept me back was my lack of knowledge. My cultivation knowledge was limited to talisman making, and even for that, I had the designs for four talismans, two of them completely useless in battle. Formations, poisons, puppetry, flying swords, mystic flames… There were too many different ways they could rig a trap that I wouldn’t know where to start. </p><p>No, it was too early. I needed more. </p><p>I once again passed the border, the savage beasts unable to catch up with my speed. I left Tiger Fist forts unmolested, and soon, I was at the cave. “Good,” I muttered as I arrived at the cave, and saw that none of the protections I had added was disturbed. </p><p>No surprise last-second saving was needed. Maybe it was paranoid of me, but as the saying went, it was not paranoia when they were out to get me. </p><p>I entered the cave. Pearyin was sitting with her legs crossed, trying to meditate. It was not a proper cultivation meditation technique, lacking the conceptual patterns triggered by it, but Qi motes that surrounded her didn’t care about the distinction as they gathered around her.</p><p>She was consuming all the production of the six spiritual plants easily, pulling motes with more ease than I could do despite my unnatural competence with meditation technique. </p><p>Another evidence of her having some kind of unusual physique. Too bad my knowledge about different physiques was non-existent. </p><p>I moved back slightly before I knocked against the entrance, not wanting to scare her too hard. Her eyes opened in alert, only to relax when she saw me. “Sir, you’re here,” she said, her relief clear. “I thought you were going to stay away for two days.” </p><p>“Things went better than I expected,” I answered, which was an understatement, but I didn’t want to talk about Markas. Instead, I sat down next to her, and grabbed her hand to check her general state. The way she presented her hand showed she understood my intention, but that didn’t prevent a blush from appearing. </p><p>Her mind was clearly going in a naughty direction. Admittedly, I wasn’t against it, but I first needed to make sure she suffered no adverse effects from her cultivation. It was tough, while I was an expert on ordinary medicine and problems in essence, I knew next to nothing about Qi. </p><p>That meant, I couldn’t assess her condition directly. The best I could do was to test the direct aspects, like the development of her dantian, and hope that the lack of physical symptoms meant she wasn’t facing any problem, at least the immediate kind. </p><p>The long-term consequences — the kind that cultivators measured in terms of decades — were less of a concern. Sooner or later, I would find a way to get a lesson on medicine, and it would give me the solution. </p><p>“So, how does being a cultivator feel?” I asked. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she muttered as her gaze bounced between me and the nearest wall. “It’s hard to process. It’s supposed to be impossible. Only a chosen few even have the aptitude, and even then, joining a sect is supposed to be just as impossible. Most join cultivation families as servants, but there are stories…” </p><p>Her voice faded, not knowing what to say. I didn’t say anything about the stories, as I had heard too many of them, ranging from benign to complete horror, but without evidence, I decided to ignore those. The cultivation world was scary enough without starting to believe baseless conspiracy theories. </p><p>“Any second guess about following me now that—” I started, but she cut me off. </p><p>“No, I will follow you as long as you allow me,” she answered, the most assertive I had ever seen her. That weird mentality … not that I was complaining. I had already been planning to use her to gather information, and her status as a true cultivator increased her value thousands of times in the long term in that aspect.</p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I caressed her cheek, her blush thick. </p><p>She asked no question, and now that I made sure she wasn’t about to spiral, I didn’t plan to ask more questions. Instead, I started examining her body. The first thing I noticed was the incomplete state of her dantian. The strand of Qi produced by the six plants for most of the day, along with the spirit stone she had consumed hadn’t even come close to fulfilling the requirements of her dantian. </p><p>Not even close, but pinning the exact amount was difficult. It was certainly less than ten percent, but I wouldn’t be too shocked if was closer to one percent. Unfortunately, that meant that, she required somewhere fifty strands at a very optimistic minimum. </p><p>With the way my luck was going, I wouldn’t be shocked if she required a thousand, or even more. </p><p>However, that wasn’t the worst news. No, that honor went to the signs of starvation I could detect in her. </p><p>From the moment they started cultivating, cultivators required Qi along with food to maintain them — though the gossip implied that, once they reached higher realms, food even stopped being a need, turning that into a need for Qi only. That was the practical reason that kept cultivators away from mortal kingdoms. </p><p>Portable sources of Qi, like spirit stones, were expensive. Staying in mortal kingdoms offered no benefits — especially with the cultivation families blocking more profitable endeavors — yet cost a fortune. </p><p>Pearyin was already showing signs of suffering from it. I had assumed that her body would have prioritized keeping her fed over increasing her cultivation. The body should burn muscle first before cutting vital functions. </p><p>However, cultivation — at least in Pearyin’s case — didn’t work like that. Her dantian devoured the available Qi, not letting it support vital functions. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>I would have brought her to the cultivation market, but even with my speed, the journey took a week. Bringing Pearyin with me, even if I carried her, extended that time considerably. Then, I had to spend some time making arrangements… Of course, there was the chance that they were still searching for me. </p><p>Luckily, I had a better source of Qi nearby. The Spring Palace. </p><p>Too bad I couldn’t bring Pearyin near the capital without risking her getting caught by cultivators. Not just Aisnam — though that was a possibility — but also other cultivators around the capital. </p><p>“Stay here. I’ll go away for a moment. I’ll be back in less than an hour,” I promised, kissed her, and left. </p><p>I might not bring her to the source of cursed Qi, but I could always bring cursed Qi here…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Salutations,” I greeted her even with mock seriousness, but didn’t stop my refining even a second, once again showing off my skills in the process. Most apothecaries wouldn’t dare to refine high-grade medicine in anything but perfect conditions. </p><p>Marana didn’t say anything, taking note of the changes on my face. Realization passed through her face. I expected her not to comment on it, maintaining a polite fiction. She surprised me. “You never needed the techniques of Elsana and Lannayin, did you?” she asked. </p><p>She was even more protective than I had given her credit for. </p><p>“No. I just needed an excuse to keep the Tigers from realizing there’s another player in the game,” I said. </p><p>Her suspicious glare was deserved. “And who do you work—” she started, only to freeze when I threw her the letter, which had been sealed with Aisnam’s seal. “Royals,” she commented, her confusion clear. </p><p>“The Third Queen, in particular,” I said, noting her confusion. Her reaction showed that she wasn’t particularly familiar with the nuances of the capital politics. Not particularly shocking. Until recently, she was a Bone Forging realm artist, and while it had been an important rank in local politics, it was hardly significant in the wider kingdom. “I need to have a meeting with the city lord,” I said. </p><p>“I won’t arrange that,” she said, her tone decisive. She clearly didn’t appreciate my lies even with my help. Understandable. </p><p>“Bring the letter to them, and let them decide,” I responded. Since Aisnam gave me the key to arranging their cooperation, I didn’t want to bother with talking too much. Particularly since Pearyin was still waiting for me at the cave, and I wanted to return to her as soon as possible. </p><p>That actually made her feel better. I certainly emphasized her perspective. She just wanted to live in her little corner, away from the political games, but events forced her to a role she didn’t want to take. </p><p>She turned to depart. “Tell them that I will only stay here for another hour. If they are amenable to the deal, they should hurry up,” I said. A little rushed, but I didn’t want them to delay me a couple hours as a power play. Normally, I wouldn’t have minded too much, but I had too many things to do. </p><p>Marana left in silence, and I returned my pill refining. Barely ten minutes later, she returned, with a familiar armored figure in tow. Falnaher, the daughter of the city lord. </p><p>I took a moment to catalog the differences since our last encounter. She was still a beautiful woman, still with a sharp, decisive gaze, but her attitude gave a more mature impression. A bloody civil war, followed by an unofficial siege from the monsters, had some substantial impact. “Hello,” I said casually, still refining pills, like we weren’t about to have a discussion on a topic of utmost importance. </p><p>“So, you’re the mysterious apothecary,” she said, continuing on that casual tone rather than trying to force a formality. A credit to her flexibility. </p><p>I nodded. “I try.” </p><p> “And, you bring news from Her Highness the Third Queen,” she followed. </p><p>“Just a little trade deal between the small and insignificant organization I’m working for and her exalted self,” I explained. </p><p>“Why are you here, then?” she said, immediately attacking the core of the issue. “You have been helping us for far longer.” </p><p>I shrugged. “We assumed the eventual possibility of her asking for our assistance, and made sure the need continued,” I admitted. </p><p>“Or maybe, you have arranged everything to trick her, and we’re your pawns,” she said. As she delivered that, her hand landed on the hilt of her sword, and her aura flared, trying to oppress me. Her claim was nonsense, and she clearly knew that. She was just using it as an excuse to bring her pressure. </p><p>A little trick I decided to ignore, along with the pressure of her essence. I could sense that she had already reached the Connate Realm, but even without my Qi cultivation, I had the ability to ignore it. </p><p>“Maybe,” I said with a shrug. “But, if that was true, and you actually think that my organization had the ability to play two great cultivation sects at the same time for a mere mortal city, would you have spoken to me like this?” </p><p>The simple, non-confrontational answer was enough to cut the wind in her sails, and she bypassed it. “What can you offer to us?” she asked. </p><p>“An army, enough to fight against the upcoming Tiger Fist crowd,” I answered. “It depends on how much you’re willing to make your Queen pay, of course, but I recommend you to play it safe.” </p><p>“As much as we want?” she asked. “And, what if I ask for fifteen Connate Realm artists,” she said. </p><p>“I would say it’s a risky choice,” I said. “They had brought at least twenty Connate Realm experts, and they might decide to change their plans and bring all of them against Markas,” I said. </p><p>“Are you sure?” she said. “The Queen mentioned only ten of them in her letter. If you’re trying to make the Queen put into your debt by lying.” </p><p>“At least that many,” I said. “It looks like they might have other ideas in Zaim Kingdom.” I paused a moment, making a show of thinking. I wanted to offer them limitless support, but it was hard to do without awakening their suspicion. “I’ll tell you what. I’ll give you a bonus. I’ll not charge for the extra assistance if my intelligence report turns out to be false.” </p><p>That offer managed to cut most of her argument down. “You must really dislike Tiger Fist,” she said. </p><p>“They are not my favorite people,” I answered, letting my essence flare sharply for a moment, like I had lost control of my anger. There was no harm in implying some personal stake. It would be helpful. “Still, be aware that our little organization has its limits, and it might be the last time I could get away with a visit. Being conservative might be dangerous.” </p><p>Falnaher paused, then looked at Marana. “And, is the Queen going to be responsible for paying for Crane school as well?” she asked. </p><p>“No,” I said as I met Marana’s gaze with a kind smile. “We have an alternative deal in place that you don’t need to worry about.” </p><p>Marana didn’t look particularly happy about that declaration. She must have felt like she had made a deal with the devil. Still, she said nothing. </p><p>“Alright. What do you offer apart from the pills and other apothecary products.” </p><p>“I’m not bad when it comes to needles, so I could help people breakthrough. Combined with the pills, having at least thirty Connate Realm artists shouldn’t be impossible,” I said. </p><p>She tensed at my offer. Understandable, as, from the perspective of the mortal kingdoms, Connate Realm martial artists represented the peak of firepower. Having a couple of them would ensure their security. Thirty of them were effectively open rebellion. </p><p>“Of course, you need to remember that we’re helping you because of the request of our dear Queen,” I added before she could come up with it. “Any conflict between you and her, and we might decide to … take our gifts back.” </p><p>It was an open threat, which was not exactly conducive to trust, but I didn’t want her to start causing problems for Aisnam. </p><p>“So, that’s your offer. Thirty Connate Realm experts,” she repeated. </p><p>“Well, not only that,” I said as I reached for my pouch, and unfurled the calligraphy piece, Sword. The intent spread, earning matching gasps. “I’m sure it’ll be helpful,” I said, then I threw the second one to Marana without even unfurling it. </p><p>Marana unfurled it carefully, only to gasp. “And what do I need to pay for it?” she asked. </p><p>“Think of it as an investment for the future,” I replied. Then, I threw them the manuscripts I prepared on how to counter Tiger Fist, amused by their expression. I felt like Santa visiting an orphanage, each gift earning a bigger reaction. “I hope they are acceptable?” I said. </p><p>“Certainly,” Falnaher answered. </p><p>“Good, then go and bring your candidates for Connate Realm. I want them here when I finish refining pills. I’m a busy man.” </p><p>I didn’t bother explaining to them to select trustworthy people who could keep a secret. They would have been long dead if they couldn’t think something as simple as that. </p><p>What followed was half a day of treatment, where I had given almost a hundred people treatment to help them. Some of them were already at the Bone Refinement, so I helped them to breakthrough directly. The others were not as high, so focused on cleansing their acupunctures and smoothing their path for their eventual breakthrough. It helped that their talent was decent. </p><p>I could have helped all of them directly to Connate Realm, but I didn’t, for two reasons. Strategically, I had already shown up enough. What I had done here would eventually trickle up to the sects, and Aisnam’s story about the battlefield showed that sects had some use for a large number of martial artists. Showing off my exaggerated abilities too much might not be to my benefit. </p><p>The other reason was simpler. I didn’t have time. I still needed to visit Pearyin before fate decided to give me another ‘gift’. Not to mention, I still need to return to Aisnam. </p><p>The longer I stayed away, the more worried she would get, and I didn’t want to stress my cute Queen. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well, that was something,” I muttered once as I left Pearyin behind in the cave, though I didn’t depart immediately. First, I had spent quite a bit of time removing any evidence of Qi around the entrance, though not as much as I spent making sure she was distracted and mellow rather than panicking. </p><p>Hopefully, it would be enough. I had left her a small stack of my best talismans, along with strong orders never to leave the cave unless staying meant a risk to her life. As a Connate Realm Martial artist, and a true cultivator equipped with enough talismans to scare a middle-stage Qi Gathering realm cultivator, her safety in the middle of nowhere should be guaranteed.</p><p>And, just in case she met with a threat she had to escape, I also left her with four spirit stones if she had to depart urgently, which should be enough for her to travel to the capital of Xanhum kingdom and meet with the old lady if necessary. </p><p>It was a nice last resort. </p><p>Of course, if my fate decided to be particularly annoying, none of those might matter, but at that point, there was nothing I could do. Even with the System, I had limits. And, bringing her to Markas was far more dangerous than a cave in the middle of nowhere, covered with enough protection charms to block Qi detection. </p><p>I ran toward Markas at full speed. As I did so, I opened the letters of the Queen. I had three of them. One addressed as me, to be opened only in emergencies. I still did, its Qi seal was easy to manipulate. It was a set of instructions about going back to Xantum and waiting for her message in case I was met with hostility. </p><p>The second one was addressed to the ‘apothecary’. It was a long, formal letter, but to summarize, it accepted the nebulous deal I had presented in an earlier letter, but did not yet commit to the choice I presented between granting minor favors or gold. Not that I really cared about it. The only reason I added that was to make the offer convincing. </p><p>A generous offer would have been far more suspicious. </p><p>To my slight surprise, the third letter also had a familiar target. Falnaher, the city lord’s daughter, whom I briefly met when I accompanied Lannayin to the arena. </p><p>Her letter had a familiar tone, implying the Queen and Falnaher had a somewhat friendly relationship. It was not too detailed, but it was more likely about interception risk than the closeness of their friendship or alliance. However, I caught a few awkward phrases that gave me the impression of code words, probably to show the letter was genuine. </p><p>Content-wise, there wasn’t much. First, it mentioned the upcoming Tiger Fist army, and gave a breakdown of their numbers and their cultivation breakdown — which was accurate except one unlucky Bone Forging artist — and their estimated arrival time. </p><p>Then, it introduced the bearer as a distant ally who promised to assist Markas for a cost that would be handled by the Queen herself. There were some details about how to keep account of every assistance: pills, training sessions, auxiliary materials, and other things. The only thing that wasn’t mentioned was direct combat, suggesting that the Queen didn’t expect any direct assistance. </p><p>Well, she was right. </p><p>It was a good letter. Not too detailed, and despite my great familiarity, I barely managed to catch a few intentional awkward phrases that felt like pre-arranged code to validate the letter as genuine; and only because she had decided to be fancy and used some pieces of ancient poems I recognized thanks to my magical experience. Combined with her impressive handwriting, it was a good attempt to keep it secure. </p><p>Well, not from me, but I was cheating, so it didn’t count. </p><p>Once I finished reading, I sealed the letters back, unfolded two other pieces of paper, and started working on the first two rewards I planned to deliver. Two calligraphies, each containing a full strand of Qi along with the strongest martial arts essence concept I could manage to impart, one with the word, Sword; the other with another word, Crane. </p><p>Marana deserved her own reward. </p><p>Once that was done, I started working on two manuals. Both manuals were dissections of Tiger Fist, its major attributes, an analysis of every single move, its advantages, disadvantages, common tells, ideal counters, and possible group combat variations. However, the two manuals were not identical. One of them explained how to take advantage of them through a generic perspective, while the other went into great detail on how Crane Kick could be leveraged for it. </p><p>I didn’t have any pills prepared, which was somewhat of a problem, but I trusted Marana to gather some more herbs during my absence, and if there was one thing I wouldn’t lack, it was savage beasts to provide the necessary essence. </p><p>As I reached the Markas border, I met with a surprise addition. Several newly built forts, each carrying the flag of Tiger Fist school. Some of the forts were just logistic points, but a few of them, particularly ones close to the capital side, looked more fortified than it was necessary against savage beasts. </p><p>It didn’t tell anything good about their intention. Curious, I approached the biggest fort, trusting my ability to stay hidden, especially with all the people going in and out. A good choice, as I counted five connate martial artists inside, trying to hide their cultivation. </p><p>They would have succeeded if it wasn’t for my skill. </p><p>It was an interesting development, showing that Tiger Fist was investing far more than they had indicated. The difference between ten and fifteen Connate Realm fighters was not small. And, there was no guarantee that those were all of it. </p><p>I didn’t check all the forts, but I checked a few on the way, and I saw at least one in each fort, which was not exactly promising for Markas. </p><p>Too bad I was too entrenched that dealing with them, even with all the restrictions I was under, was easier than the alternative. </p><p>The Tiger Fist's presence lessened significantly once I arrived at the thickest part of the monster's presence. They were probably afraid of a stampede. A reasonable concern. Even with all my advantages, I wouldn’t have wanted to hold a fortified point against them. </p><p>There was fighting, and there was trying to stem a natural disaster alone. </p><p>As I passed, I realized that the density of the beasts had increased compared to my previous visit, which was not even a week ago. Whatever Kartpa Valley cultivators had done to gather so many beasts, it wasn’t losing its effectiveness. </p><p>I didn’t dare to explore what was going on. </p><p>In comparison, Markas was in a better condition. The slums were still tense, but unlike the last time, the streets weren’t filled with Tiger Fist Disciples disguised as ordinary thugs. Instead, the streets were patrolled by teams of Crane Kick disciples. Their cultivation was higher from what I could glean from their skill level significantly. </p><p>Marana was clearly putting the pills I left with her to good use. </p><p>I spent some time putting on my disguise, but this time, I had removed all of the boils and other distracting skin features. Previously, I had them for two reasons, even though the disgust made it hard to deal with people. I wasn’t good enough to create a convincing disguise without some eye-catching features, and the catchy additions made it easier. Additionally, I needed a reason to poke around without being suspicious, and acquiring Snow Blossom and Volcano styles was a good excuse. </p><p>Since neither excuse was necessary anymore, I chose to disguise myself as a distinguished old gentleman, though still maintaining the same main features so that Marana recognized me. </p><p> I climbed the walls, I noticed a similar trend in the city guards, showing that either they found their own source, or Marana shared some of her treasures. The latter was very altruistic in this new world, but after my own experience with Marana, her altruism didn’t shock me. </p><p>Luckily, it would make my next step easier. </p><p>Marana was not in her room once again, but this time, I found her in the courtyard, training a small army of disciples. Two hundred Skin Refinement Realm martial artists, spread across four stages. </p><p>An impressive force … for old Markas. Nothing against the upcoming tide. </p><p>Well, I was here to help. </p><p>I went into the hidden apothecary she set up for me, and deliberately left the door open so that she would notice my presence. The medicinal plants were replenished to a surprising degree, even more than what there was before my previous visit despite, that time, she had more time to arrange. </p><p>But then, it wasn’t a surprise. With the savage beasts crawling all around the city, the area where they could gather herbs had shrunk significantly. As their cultivation increased, so did their radius. Not to mention, their increased range meant that they were reaching areas that hadn’t been harvested for months. </p><p>However, while refining pills, I naturally examined the various herbs and plants that spread in front of me more in detail, and started to notice some interesting details, details I would have missed if it wasn’t for my lesson on gardening. </p><p>Thanks to that, I caught several abnormalities, often linked to rapid growth. A weaker version of what I had done with the spirit plants in Pearyin’s cave, too subtle to be caught by anyone but a true master — even if a cheating one. </p><p>I suspected that Whatever Kartpa Valley had been doing to the beasts also affected plants to a lesser degree. </p><p>I would have written it off, if it wasn’t for one interesting detail. The effect was not uniform. </p><p>A less-known fact about plants, secret to everyone but experts. </p><p>They were often immobile. </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder whether I could discover the source of what Kartpa Valley was doing by tracking its effects on plants. However, before I could consider it more, I heard a door open. </p><p>Marana was here. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You don’t need to fear anything, sweetie. Everything is going perfectly,” I said as I hugged her. She responded, her arms tight around me, radiating her stress. She was not handling her new identity as a cultivator well. </p><p>Luckily, I had the skills to distract her. I hugged her as well, but my arms were looser, while my hands danced on her back, occasionally caressing her shoulders, helping her to get in the mood. </p><p>I could have asked her to serve me, and she would have done so immediately, and enjoyed it as well. Ironically, she was too enthusiastic about serving me in any way possible, so asking her would make her shelve her personal concerns while she was with me … not exactly an ideal solution. </p><p>Ironically, she didn’t have such concerns during our first time, happily playing the role of the master ordering her students around, but that was before she realized my many talents. </p><p>I kept my hands in safer spots, slowly dancing on her skin while she trembled, preventing her from panicking too much. Soon, her hands, which were clamped around me, started to loosen. I started humming, and she accompanied the song. </p><p>As she hummed her song, it took a while for her to realize our lips were close. She blushed once as she realized it, still shy despite everything we had done together. Admittedly, it had been a while, enough for her to feel reticent. </p><p>Ironically, she might have pulled back if she was a more assertive person. Instead, she stayed in my arms, waiting for me to make a move as her lips parted, a little too much to be purely accidental. I held back a chuckle. I might be the only man she had ever been with, but a waitress, her flirting hadn’t been stilted at all. </p><p>It was her sense of worship toward me that was holding her back, and there was nothing better to break that than frustration. I acted unaware of her changing mood and sat down, while still hugging her, and she ended up on my lap. </p><p>What followed was a torturous teasing session that lasted about twenty minutes while she desperately gave every possible signal she could without breaking the cultural implications of her role as a servant, where it was perfectly alright for a master to request sex, but it was a scandal coming from a servant. </p><p>I wondered if that was why she didn’t recognize even my most obvious seduction tricks during the last hour. After all, in her mind, if I wanted sex, I could have easily requested it. </p><p>It was fun to watch her trying to convince me to take her without being obvious, but the real benefit was her mood. There was nothing like trying to seduce someone to stave off an existential crisis. </p><p>I didn’t know what finally enlightened her, but her beautiful eyes widened in ... well, not anger, but the closest thing to anger that she was capable of showing against me. “You’re doing that on purpose—” she gasped, which I interrupted by a kiss. </p><p>Admittedly, teasing her even more until her pseudo-anger turned into real anger, but there were two problems with it. I still had some important tasks to finish and couldn’t spend my whole day here — no matter how tempting.</p><p>And, she wasn’t the only one feeling the frustration of arousal. Teasing her was fun, but that fun did nothing to blunt the desire awakened by a sexy girl on my lap, doing her best to seduce me, particularly since, while her moves were subtle, they were certainly not unskilled. </p><p>As I kissed her, the beginnings of the anger she had displayed faded just as quickly, her body melting under my touch obediently. </p><p>She readily parted her legs when I freed her body from the oppression of her clothes, leaving her only in her underwear as she was pressed against the smoothest section of the cold cave wall. A pull was all that was needed to get rid of her panties while she dealt with her top, leaving her body free for my perusal. </p><p>“Marvelous,” I whispered, which was not an exaggeration. She was already a beautiful woman, but all that time practicing a flexibility-based martial art style turned her already beautiful body into a masterwork that would drive artists crazy. </p><p>And, currently, that marvelous body was melding against mine while she did her best to equalize our nudity. As she freed my shaft, I put my hand on her thigh, slowly moving back and forth. “More, please,” she begged. </p><p>Not exactly a shocking display of initiative, but it was progress, and it deserved a proper reward. I let my hand move upward a bit until it dipped into her glistening core, and a moan rose in response while she tried to caress my shaft in response. </p><p>Her fingers trembled too badly to be successful. </p><p>“I …” she murmured fleetingly, words slipping out of her mouth before her unique brand of passivity could assert itself thanks to her weakening self-control. </p><p>“Tell me what you want,” I said even as I squeezed her breast in celebration of such an important benchmark. </p><p>“I shouldn’t,” she murmured, her voice tight as she treated requesting something during sex as indecent due to her perception of our relative classes. </p><p>“Tell me,” I ordered. She was panicking, but it was far more different than her earlier existential panic. It was a sexy one, adding a new layer of eroticism to her incredible beauty. </p><p>“P-please, please, go further,” she begged. </p><p>“Are you asking me to fuck you?” I asked, amused at her indirect language. She nodded. “How do you prefer. Soft, or hard? Or how about I mercilessly?” </p><p>Her blush was incredible, but so was her answer. “T-the l-last one,” she stammered, her cowardly tone contrasting greatly with her request, making her even more alluring. </p><p>“As you wish, beautiful,” I said as I grabbed her hips and slid inside her, hard enough that her pelvis would have shattered if it wasn’t for her martial cultivation. That reduced the pain, but it did nothing about the clapping sound that accompanied it. </p><p>“Yes, yes, yes,” she repeated like a mantra every time I slammed inside her, her beautiful breasts dancing wildly with each push as I fucked her as mercilessly as she requested, wailing and moaning as she put our current location in the wilderness to best use. </p><p>After all that play, it didn’t take long for her to climax. “I … I need to catch my breath,” she begged and moaned, but I didn’t even slow down. After all, she chose merciless, and letting her recover for a while before the second round felt an awful lot like mercy. </p><p>“Did you change your mind about wanting the last one?” I teased her. </p><p>Her eyes widened, but soon her expression settled on determined. “No,” she whispered determinedly. It had been the last thing she had said for a while as I kept her locked against the wall, pounding against and again until she had experienced her second orgasm, then a third one, during which I finally exploded in her. </p><p>She collapsed against the side of the wall, and I kissed her temple. “Don’t forget, meditate, and don’t go anywhere,” I told her as I quickly dressed and left her behind. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had important tasks to deal with… </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>“Umm, sir,” she whispered as she looked at the dust in her hand. “What had just happened?” </p><p>“Nothing much. It’s more or less how it’s supposed to react,” I said, my voice wooden. I was angry, furious even, but I did my best to hide it. I had a feeling Pearyin would take that personally, and that was the last thing I wanted. </p><p>I was angry at myself. </p><p>I was a moron. Why the hell I was so confident in my half-assed knowledge of cultivation about how Pearyin would react. Clearly, slowly learning meditation arts and meditating wasn’t the only way of absorbing Qi. </p><p>Naturally, there must be something unique about Pearyin that led to it. I had heard the mention of special physiques when I was in the cultivation market. Unfortunately, the knowledge there was nothing more than idle gossip, so the reliable information I had on the topic was pretty basic. </p><p>They were rare even for cultivators. They could come with benefits, drawbacks, or a combination. And, it was never a smart thing to reveal their presence. </p><p>Of course, Pearyin having one of those physiques was literally one in a million, maybe even lower. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the first sign of probability having a … flexible quality since my arrival. </p><p>“Come here,” I said as I put a blanket on the ground, and positioned the calligraphy art I had created for her. “Sit down and close your eyes,” I asked as I put my hand on her stomach, ignoring her reaction as I examined her body. </p><p>I focused on her dantian immediately. Since she didn’t actively use her essence to cover it up, her Qi was easy to discover. Her dantian was already open, and more importantly, her immortal root was churning the Qi she had received with a shocking speed. </p><p>The initial stone I had passed her was the biggest I had, mostly to show off. It had almost a complete Qi strand, which had been enough for me to activate my Dantian completely, which signified the proper entrance to the first stage. </p><p>Yet, for Pearyin, a strand was clearly not enough. Her dantian aggressively devoured any Qi that was completely subdued by her … which was happening far faster than anything Aisnam — or any of the itinerant cultivators I had seen at the market — was capable of. </p><p>It looked like her Immortal Root was superior as well. </p><p>From a more general perspective, it was excellent news. The speed their immortal root processed Qi was the biggest bottleneck the cultivators faced in their early stages, and their other biggest concern, was the nebulous bottlenecks, usually factoring in once their cultivation grew to a certain point. </p><p>Unfortunately, with her dantian aggressively devouring any Qi that was converted to complete her breakthrough, that speed was less of an advantage. </p><p>She was at real risk of starving, or at least, the Qi equivalent of it, which was not good. That was the main reason the cultivators didn’t hang around mortal kingdoms — with some rare exceptions. I hadn’t seen any cultivator suffering from it, but from what I heard, it wasn’t pretty. </p><p>And, now, Pearyin was under real risk of it. How inconvenient. </p><p>For a moment, I thought about dragging Pearyin to the secret tunnel. By setting up a smaller version of Aisnam’s cultivation chamber, she would have the Qi she needed. </p><p>But, the moment I thought that, I vetoed it. I liked Pearyin, but she wasn’t exactly a picture of mental fortitude, and I didn’t want to see how she would react if that cursed being trapped behind the door started to whisper to her. </p><p>As for bringing her to Spring Palace, that was even more a terrifying idea, for more predictable reasons. Technically, there were no promises between me and Aisnam, but I wasn’t naive enough to think that Aisnam would be happy if I suddenly dragged another lover to her place. </p><p>And, Pearyin was too transparent to hide it. </p><p>As for transferring her my Qi, there was one big problem. The system didn’t appreciate me passing its gifts, and unless I faced a very dangerous situation, it wasn’t a gamble I wanted to make with Qi strands. Luckily, there was still still the indirect method. </p><p>“Close your eyes, focus on your heartbeat, and don’t open them without my say,” I ordered her. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said, quick to obey my command. Which was good. I stuffed another spirit stone into her hand, watching it being drained with a shocking speed as well. But, that was inevitable. </p><p>At least, it gave me the necessary time to play around. First. I pulled a dozen protective wards and placed them around the cave, making sure that there would be no Qi flow outside. </p><p>Then, I pulled half a dozen seeds from my pocket, collected at the Misty Mountains. </p><p>I buried them around the cave, each alongside a shocking number of essence pills, which would be a good — and very expensive — substitute for fertilizer a spirit plant required. Luckily, the endless blossom was a wild plant with limited needs, as well as an ability to metabolize essence directly as fertilizer. </p><p>There was a reason its presence was ubiquitous on the outskirts despite the cultivators constantly selling them. </p><p>Hastening their growth with Qi was harder, but my skill with spirit plants was at Perfection, it was far from impossible. Particularly since I was willing to spend thirty strands from my inventory at once, which was an amount that would hurt any other Qi Gathering cultivator seriously. Even Aisnam’s dantian barely held twenty strands at full capacity, and she was at the eighth stage of Qi Gathering. </p><p>It was a significant investment, one with bad returns in the short term, but ten minutes later, the cave started to be filled with first motes of Qi … which were promptly drained by Pearyin. </p><p>The output wasn’t enough to keep her cultivating at full speed, but it would keep her from starving, which was all that was needed. The preparations were complete. Now, it was time to have a more complicated talk. Leaving without saying anything was tempting, but with everything that could go wrong, it was a needless risk. </p><p>I sat in front of her. “You can open your eyes,” I said. </p><p>“Sir. This time, meditation felt very different. Like—” she started, then fell silent as she felt the cave was filled with flowers. “How —” she started, but I silenced her with a gentle press of my finger. </p><p>“You have just managed to absorb Qi,” I said. A little direct, but at least, with her double cultivation, there was no risk of heart attack or stroke. </p><p>She froze for a moment, trying but having trouble processing what I had just told her. Understandable reaction. “Q-Qi… L-like a … c-cul … cultivator,” she said, stammering horribly as she tried to let out one sentence. I didn’t interrupt her, letting her finish it. </p><p>“Yes. You’re a cultivator,” I said. “That stone you absorbed was a spirit stone, filled with Qi,” I said. </p><p>“How about you, sir?” she asked. </p><p>“I know a few cultivators,” I said, not willing to reveal my own cultivation yet. I still didn’t trust her capabilities when it came to keeping secrets. “Those flowers are spirit plants, and they’ll radiate Qi for your consumption,” I explained. </p><p>She still looked at me blankly, trying to process the shock, which was far bigger than the time I casually elevated her into a martial artist. After all, back then, she at least had to practice and receive an acupuncture treatment. </p><p>Here, she just touched a stone. </p><p>“How is this even possible?” she asked. </p><p>“Truthfully, I don’t know,” I admitted. Unlike martial arts, my knowledge of cultivation was highly limited other than the select few topics and techniques. Her condition was one of them. And, since I couldn’t even answer her most important question, there was no harm in hiding all of it for the moment. “You must have some kind of special physique or something, otherwise, you shouldn’t be able to absorb it without proper technique.” </p><p>She nodded. While she processed that, I thought of answers to potential follow-up questions, like why I had spirit stones with me? How come the cave was suddenly filled with Spirit Plants? Why do I even know that much about cultivation? Those were the bare minimum I expected, and ten times more questions would be reasonable. </p><p>Yet, Pearyin stayed silent. Not a strategic silence, but one filled with acceptance. </p><p>With a sigh, I pulled a protection talisman. The least volatile talisman I had. “Let’s teach you how to activate talismans, so in case of danger, you can protect yourself,” I said. </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” she said, just as respectful despite her new status as a true cultivator. How predictable. </p><p>“First, close your eyes try to reach your center, and bring your Qi to the surface. Just like you’re trying to manipulate your essence—” I started, only to stop when her finger was immediately covered with Qi. “Very good. Now, press at the center of the talisman, and let go,” I said. </p><p>That required a few repeats, but soon, she was surrounded was a Qi shield. “Excellent work,” I said. “With that, you can protect yourself from any martial artist, and a weak cultivator.” </p><p>She nodded, and I pulled passed her a few talismans, showing her how to use them as well. However, even after giving her tools to keep her safe from any situation she might face, she was still panicking. </p><p>Clearly, a different, more primal method was needed to let her relax… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I hope you’re not afraid of a bit of speed,” I said just before I pressed the gas. The bike jumped, and her arms wrapped around my waist. She gripped my waist tight enough to convey panic, but her pulse disagreed. She was calmer than she had been when I had been dragging her earlier. </p><p>Another attempt of hers to trick me. I appreciated her playing the same game, it made the game fun. </p><p>I was happy with that. My power made sure that I would be the victorious party in this game. Moreover, the more she focused on winning the game in that arena, the more she would ignore her powers. </p><p>The biker shop I picked was a distance away. I wanted to get a better sense of what excited her, what scared her, and what bored her, so I could get a better sense; of the wide selection of the store, not just for helmets but other peripherals that could be useful depending on how cooperative she was feeling. </p><p>I started small. I wanted to get a general sense of her preferences, especially since her power had likely changed her perspective significantly. </p><p>I had been driving bikes long before I had my power, and naturally, I had used the danger-to-excitement trick several times. Sometimes, to abject failure, as I didn’t have my powers to provide me with real-time input. Without the assistance of a superpower, it wasn’t always easy to determine the difference between excited shrieks and fearful shouts when driving over a hundred miles per hour, particularly when both parties had been wearing helmets. </p><p>And, barely a minute later, I was glad that I started slowly rather than applying the full range of learned tricks, because her reactions to my little bag of tricks were completely wrong. Driving intentionally close to other cars or passing through empty lines did nothing, and driving fast — particularly the limited way in city traffic and without a helmet — got a very mild response.</p><p>She cried and gasped appropriately, playing the role of the excited passenger, but it was entirely fake. </p><p>I sighed, realizing that my little plan of exciting her through a long bike ride was a dud. Admittedly, with her power, I should have realized it. She could wrap herself with forcefields to handle military-grade explosives easily, and fly under her own power. A little extra speed, or the risk of clipping against a car didn’t even faze her, let alone excite her. </p><p>Still, I appreciated that she cared enough about to lie about it. </p><p>With that, I changed my plan to take the long way, and instead took a sharp turn for a shortcut. Her hands tightened around my waist even more, and another cry left her lips. </p><p>This time, it was accompanied by a spike in her heartbeat! </p><p>That surprised me, enough that I actually wanted to stop and ask her about the reason. Too bad it was impossible without ruining the game we had been playing. Instead, I appreciated the rumble of the engine while I considered, it and once again made an unnecessary sharp turn while exiting the shortcut. </p><p>Another real, excited cry. It was fascinating, even though I didn’t understand why she was impacted by it. Still, it gave me hope that my motorcycle trick wouldn’t be a waste. I moved on to one of the lesser-used tricks. I used it rarely, not because it didn’t work, but because it worked particularly well only when they were adequately distracted, and once that point was reached, half of the time, I didn’t need the trick. </p><p>I changed the gear, and pressed the gas, choosing a configuration that would shake and rumble the engine excessively, turning the raving seat into an improvised vibrator, ready to distract her from the trick with sharp turns. </p><p>Another surprise. Sharp turns turned out to be unnecessary. The moment I sped up sharply, another cry reached my ear, and with it, the reason for her earlier reaction became clear. </p><p>Inertia. </p><p>Once that clicked, piecing things together was very easy. I was willing to bet everything that her power somehow negated the feeling of inertia as she flew, meaning, she never experienced the extreme sense of weight that came from sudden speeding up, braking, and sharp turns. </p><p>I didn’t suddenly turn our ride into a stomach-curdling mess once I discovered that trick. I sprinkled those around as we moved toward our destination, while I let the ravings of the engine and our physical closeness to the rest. </p><p>If seduction was a sexy cocktail, fear and excitement were condiments. Excitement was like lemon juice, a proper drink requiring a generous dash of it, while fear was like pepper, able to create some very delicious tasting notes, but needed to be used extremely carefully. However, ultimately, both needed to be supporting ingredients and not the core item. </p><p>Once again, I was glad that my power — even without overcharging — allowed me to maintain that perfect balance. Soon, her fake cries became more common, but this time, it wasn’t to stroke my ego. No, she was under the impression that those cries were a good way to conceal her moans. </p><p>They were not. </p><p>The results were fascinating enough for me to extend the trip once more, trusting that she was unfamiliar enough with the city to notice that trick once we were out of her neighborhood. It was important at first, but as her arousal started to climb, it started not to matter. At that point, even if by a miracle she recognized it, she wouldn’t comment. </p><p>Why should she, when her body already throbbed with excitement that rivaled the later stages of her spectacular lap dance? It wasn’t like she was losing anything … other than the initiative in the little espionage game she was playing, but she was too confident in her power — despite the evidence of its weakening — to be careful about that. </p><p>The city traffic had been particularly helpful for me in providing many excuses for sharp turns, sudden brakes, and other little gimmicks that worked well to keep her in the beautiful zone of excitement without devolving into panic. </p><p>And, of course, it went without saying that I never pushed enough to make her cum. While it would be fun to make her climax, it was a mere consolation prize compared to the power her desperate edging would grant me. </p><p>Last night, I was able to convince her to ignore her allies — or just one person, that part was still a mystery — and give me a lap lance. I was curious about what would be today’s reward. </p><p>When I parked in front of the biker shop, I had an extreme smirk on my face. “I hope it was not too troubling. The traffic was a mess. It’ll be more fun once we arrive at the open road.” </p><p>“N-not a problem,” she answered, her voice muffled by the helmet. She didn’t remove it, trying to hide her flushed face, but her neck revealed that still. “I can wait for you here. Just go and leave.” </p><p>“Honey, I can’t leave a sexy redhead like you alone in front of a biker shop. Most bikers might be stupid, but none is stupid enough to leave a beauty like you alone,” I said as I removed her helmet, her beautiful face flushed enough to rival her messed-up red hair. </p><p>I leaned forward. Her lips parted open while her eyes closed. Unfortunately, if I started kissing her, she wouldn’t stop. And, while it was not exactly a horrible fate, I didn’t want to ruin my plan’s full potential. </p><p>I helped her off the bike and dragged her toward the shop. This time, I didn’t hold her wrist but her waist. I could have acted like I was a gentleman trying to help her; she certainly needed help with her legs wobbly after the ride, the aftermath hitting her hard. </p><p>Instead, I kept my hand on her ass, squeezing hard just to highlight I wasn’t coping a sneaky feel like a coward, but staking ownership. Affected by the ride, and at the edge, she didn’t even complain as I brought her inside. As we walked, I checked for cameras, and was happy to see there was only one for the parking lot, and it was broken. </p><p>No recording, meaning I could be very adventurous. </p><p>“Nice place, right,” I said even as I dragged toward a corner, where there was a range of outfits. </p><p>“I thought you were going to purchase a helmet,” she said. </p><p>“Yes, for me. But we still need to pick something for you,” I said. </p><p>Her eyes widened. “What do you mean? You said nothing about it!” </p><p>“I’m not going to bring you to a biker dive looking like that. I have a reputation to maintain,” I said sharply, once again domineering. It was patently false. I didn’t have a reputation among the bikers, and I wouldn’t care to maintain them. </p><p>I just wanted to dress her up, and not just to see her in sexy clothes. I also wanted to be the one to choose what she was wearing. A little conditional trick that played well into the bad boy identity, while also giving her a permanent reminder about who was giving orders during our trip. </p><p>She listened to them for her own pleasure, enjoying the role, but she was forgetting one thing. Habits were dangerous, and hard to break once formed… </p><p>I decided to escalate the ordering part. I picked up several revealing clothes, ripped off their price tags without even asking for her opinions, and passed them to her under her shocked gaze. “Go and change,” I said as I slapped her ass and walked to the counter. </p><p>A wild smile was on my lips as I watched her from a broken reflection, my power the only reason I was able to make any sense. She watched me, frozen for several seconds before she did exactly what I asked and trudged toward the dressing room. </p><p>Excellent. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Engineering that encounter proved easier than I expected. She was in a cafe on the second floor of a cafe, one that overlooked the road, which was not too far away from an intersection with a traffic light. I timed my approach to arrive there while it was red light, which gave me an excuse to raise my visor of the helmet as I looked around lazily, and ‘noticed’ her presence and waved at her. </p><p>Ten full seconds after she had seen me, giving me a chance to hide. </p><p>It was a deliberate choice. As much as I wanted to engineer an accidental encounter with her — and more — considering her power, forcing that encounter into her was too much of a risk. I wanted her to be merely off-balance, not panicking. </p><p>It was never a good idea to push someone who saw throwing buildings as a measured response. </p><p>Still, I was happy to see that she hadn’t taken the chance to hide. Instead, her expression went through several phases, each I read — with my power in full overdrive. </p><p>She was shocked at first, which was inevitable, but that lasted barely a second, showing that, as a heroine, she was used to reacting fast. The truly interesting part was what followed. I expected a serious, thoughtful expression, a professional assessment of the risk I represented as she wondered whether it was just as accidental as it looked. </p><p>A flash of surprise was followed by a coy smile and several unconscious signs of sexual attraction. Flushing off her neck and ears, her suddenly diluting eyes, parting lips … the whole nine yards. Even her nipples hardened, but the only reason I noticed that despite her bra blocking was my power. </p><p>However, I didn’t need my power to notice her hurriedly unbuttoning her blouse quite a bit and fixing her hair rapidly in an effort to add some sexiness to her casual morning outfit. </p><p>Promising. </p><p>Once I waved her, she acted like she didn’t notice me for a second, then ‘noticed’ me with the fakest possible expression of surprise. She was a better actress in our previous encounter. I smiled even larger, parked my bike, and went into the cafe, making no attempt to ask her permission. </p><p>I had been already dressed as the bad boy, now I just needed to play the part. </p><p>She was more receptive than I expected, but maybe I shouldn’t have been too surprised. Last night, she had gone far more than what was necessary for her mission. Some part of it was about my seduction, but her bad boy kink was not particularly well-hidden. </p><p>She wasn’t the first girl I met with such a fetish. I had seen many of them while I worked as a bartender before I received my Power, rich and poor alike, all excited by the aura of danger surrounding the gang members and henchmen, throwing themselves in men they wouldn’t have otherwise interested in chasing that high, and ruining their life in the process. </p><p>Ironically, her current situation was the perfect opportunity to enjoy her not-so-unique preference. Her role required her to play the role of the warped damsel, but her power was more than enough to protect her from the inevitable downfall of that path. </p><p>Well, maybe. She didn’t know she was dealing with a bad boy with a superpower, after all. </p><p>When I arrived at the second floor, she was still waiting for me, but with several changes. To start, her expression of shock and hesitance was better, showing that while she was a decent actress — nowhere near enough to trick my power, but still — she required some time to get used to the role, which could be useful. </p><p>The more interesting change was her looks. Her blouse had already been unbuttoned earlier, but she decided to be generous and unlock another one, turning what was initially a modest piece that someone might throw on for a casual breakfast to fit with her casual sweatpants, but turned into something spectacular. </p><p>Well, the body underneath was spectacular, which was easier to see without her bra. She had removed it while I had been climbing the stairs. A good choice, as I could see it poking from the cushions of her seat — she didn’t have a bag to stuff it — and it was a boring, functional piece that would have ruined the show. </p><p>Her gravity-defying breasts were better off without its unwelcome help. </p><p>“Oh, what a nice surprise,” I said even as I approached her table, pulled a chair, and sat across her, all without asking for permission. Admittedly, I was also tempted to just kiss her, but her tenseness ramped once I leaned too far while pulling the chair forward, so I decided to ignore that temptation, no matter how tempting were her lips. </p><p>I might have kissed her before — while doing much more — but that was only after a very long game of two truths and a lie while she had been dressed skimpily, her arousal slowly ramping up. And right now, while her blouse trick showed that she was enthusiastic about what was about to arrive, that didn’t mean she was ready to jump the deep end. </p><p>She wanted to be seduced. Not the classical way like flowers and serenades, but instead by possessive behavior and displays of illegal power, but the principles were the same. Start slow, show confidence, display interest in a selective way that highlighted the qualities she wanted to push; and, most importantly, always follow the non-verbal clues correctly. </p><p>Naturally all while maintaining our roles: for me, a bad boy with several minor illegal dealings and excessive confidence; for her, a bored rich girl with precious little understanding of how the real world worked.</p><p>“I — I don’t remember inviting you,” she stammered. A bit excessive, but well-played. </p><p>“Too bad,” I replied with a dark smile, not making a move. </p><p>“How dare you?” she gasped, doing her best to look angry, but as she moved her arm, her cleavage parted to enhance her cleavage even more, showing that she just wanted an opportunity to almost flash me. </p><p>I didn’t miss that her shirt didn’t move as it was supposed to, stopping just before it revealed something important as something solid appeared inside for a fleeting moment. She had used a small force field to keep the moment tantalizing rather than revealing. </p><p>Impressive. </p><p>I leaned forward. “Oh, sweetie. After our dance, you should have a better idea about how much I can dare,” I replied, leaning forward like I was about to kiss her. She tensed, a real reaction. Luckily, I wasn’t planning to kiss her. Instead, I picked one of the pastries from her table and took a bite. </p><p>She might have not wanted that kiss, at least at that exact moment, but that didn’t mean she enjoyed being ignored in favor of a piece of breakfast food. </p><p>Particularly since it was subpar breakfast food. </p><p>One big disadvantage of my new power, I became far pickier when it came to my food. </p><p>Still, it was a good opportunity as any. I let my face scrunch in annoyance as I put the half-eaten pastry back, right on top of her food. “Hey, don’t put your half-bitten food on top of mine. I’m still eating.” </p><p>I could have said that it was too late to worry about that, which would be true but stupid — trying to reason over what was disgusting or not was hardly a good date talk. Instead, I leaned forward and grabbed her wrist. </p><p>“No, you’re not,” I said, doing my best domineering delivery. Thanks to Tara, I practiced that a lot. “You deserve much better,” I added, with just enough fascination to turn that into a compliment. </p><p>Her eyes widened in pleasure at the compliment despite its bare-bones nature. </p><p>That was the biggest advantage of the bad-boy persona. Among all the sharp edges and thorns, even the slightest compliment had been received incredibly well, just like a momentary cold breeze on a hot summer day. </p><p>It was effective enough that she obediently followed when I pulled her onto her feet. “W-wait, I have to pay,” she said. I didn’t say anything, but pulled a large stack of cash and threw three hundred dollars there dismissively. </p><p>Her eyes widened. It was another simple yet effective trick. During the dance, she had reacted well when I used the excuse to tip her, implying some cash flow issues… and, even without it, no girl complained about their paramour being too rich or generous. </p><p>“Where are we going?” she asked as she followed me rather than pulling her wrist out of my grip like she was capable of. </p><p>“I know a dive with the most amazing breakfast you’ll ever eat,” I said, which was true. The place was quite a distance away, and it was outside the city, and I didn’t want to risk it. </p><p>She said nothing as she obediently followed me. There was another benefit to dragging her out. It allowed me to take her pulse, which was an excellent way to measure her excitement. She only spoke when she noticed there was no helmet. </p><p>“How are we—” she started, and gasped when I passed her the helmet. “You can’t drive without it, you won’t be able to see.” </p><p>“There’s a shop nearby, we’ll make a stop there,” I said. “And, until there, it would be very exciting.” </p><p>I jumped to my seat, and she followed immediately, hugging me from behind, the contact replacing her earlier grip, still allowing me to take her mood, which I planned to use to optimize the trip into the perfect joyride. </p><p>I drove off…</p>",

    "content": "<p>As the bell continued to ring, I looked upstairs, trying to decide what to do. Once activated, I had no idea how to stop Dragon Heart from emitting mana. Every other time, it stopped once the drop of blood evaporated.</p><p>The drop of blood was already absorbed into the center, with no way of removing it. I couldn’t stuff it back into the box. It was enough to keep the dragon heart hidden when it was inactive, but things changed when activated.</p><p>Leaving the dragon heart here and going up was not a viable solution either. It stayed unnoticed under several layers of magical wood only because I was absorbing the majority of the mana it let out. The mana build-up would soon turn noticeable if I left it at lower decks before going up. </p><p>I enhanced my hearing as I listened, wanting to understand the source of the alarm. If they were organizing a defense, hiding would be easier. No one would bother counting. If it was an emergency raid, or a boarding attempt against a target of opportunity, it would be harder to hide.</p><p>In such a case, they would probably pay attention to the new recruits to see how they performed. So, my absence would go unnoticed.</p><p>Still, I decided to stay in the hull, and blame the guy that sent me here if discovered, saying that he ordered me to stay there no matter what, and I thought that a ship-wide alert was a part of it. Hopefully, they would buy it. If they didn’t buy … well, that was a thought for the future. </p><p>The perfect strategy was a luxury. </p><p>Instead, I enhanced my hearing to listen to them. It was a wasteful trick, using more mana than enhancing my strength with Earth, but I ignored it. If there was one thing I didn’t lack, it was mana. </p><p>“I see the captain’s boat,” someone shouted. “He’ll be here in two minutes. Everyone looks sharp!” the lookout shouted. I sighed. It wasn’t the worst possible case, but then it wasn’t the best. The captain had been a common topic of gossip among the crew. They enjoyed the tales of their captain’s incredible bravery and scary violence. </p><p>Annoyingly, those tales focused more on the violent and gory details of his fights rather than the technical details of his achievements. He was a strong mage, of water element, who loved to use his magic in creative executions. That was it. </p><p>Admittedly, stories didn’t even explain his strength properly. But, since a simple and violent mage like Publius was willing to follow him, he had to be strong. And, since he was able to operate as a pirate successfully while maintaining his political relationship, he must be intelligent as well. Or, at least, he had enough low cunning to make dealing with him very dangerous. </p><p>His arrival was not good news for me. I had been hoping that his absence would have lasted longer. The last thing I needed was another mage that I needed to hide from. Even with the mana wood blocking my presence, it would be difficult. </p><p>I stayed downstairs, desperately draining dragon heart’s mana, hoping that it would stop emitting mana before the captain’s arrival. </p><p>Breathe in. </p><p>Breathe out. </p><p>Feed the elemental cores. </p><p>Breathe in. </p><p>Breathe out. </p><p>“Finally,” I muttered as the dragon heart finally turned inert. I put it back in its box, and climbed the stairs as fast as I could manage without creating commotion. I was at the upper deck before the captain’s boat had arrived. </p><p>On the deck, Publius was shouting orders as he tried to establish a semblance of order, dealing with the worst of the mess on the upper deck, but the sailors moved around in confusion. </p><p>I was glad for that lack of discipline, as it allowed me to mix the crowd without alerting anyone. I grabbed a mop and moved to a concealed corner, furiously cleaning. </p><p>At the same time, I clamped over my elemental cores, locking them hard to keep my presence down. It was going to be painful, as in my current improved state, suppressing it got even harder. It would take merely ten minutes for the pain to start. </p><p>I had no choice but the suffer until the scary captain arrived. </p><p>I skulked behind as an ordinary boat started to approach. It was a small one, without a sail, designed to rely on oars. Not something designed for open seas, and trying to travel on it should count as suicide, either by monsters, or by bad weather. </p><p>Yet, despite having no sails, the boat moved forward rapidly, far faster than it was supposed to be possible. The water itself was pushing the small boat. </p><p>Captain was strong. Stronger than I expected. Pushing a boat with his own magic was not a simple achievement, requiring both raw power and control to display such speed without shattering the small boat. </p><p>A dangerous man indeed. </p><p>I moved to the middle of the new recruits, right behind the tallest one, hoping that their presence would make me even less worthy of attention. </p><p>With the speed of its boat, the captain arrived at the ship in a few minutes. To my surprise, the crew didn’t throw a rope ladder to the side, but that was answered soon. A column of water burst from the sea, lifting the boat he was on until it dropped both on the deck. </p><p>The display didn’t make me feel any better. He was even stronger than I expected. </p><p>As he stepped out of the boat, I took note of his looks. An older man, with hair more white than black, with a few wounds on his face, showing he had lived a hard life. And, if his crew’s fearful shift was any indicator, he made his crew live through the same. </p><p>“We have the cargo. Set a course to the meeting spot,” he said as he leaned down, and lifted a large bundle. A human-shaped one. Alive, and aware enough to struggle, her muffled cries enough to reveal her gender, but nothing more. </p><p>A kidnapping. </p><p>No wonder we had been idling in the open seas for a week. Initially, I had assumed that it was to find a good target for piracy, but the captain and his bundle suggested otherwise. I wondered what was going on. It was clearly not for slavery. Not because the crew seemed too upright to dabble in such a reprehensible trade, but even the most expensive slave wouldn’t bring enough money to justify them spending more than a week without doing anything. </p><p>Nor it would justify such a competent mage taking action by himself. </p><p>My thoughts were nothing more than idle curiosity. I pitied the unlucky woman as I watched the captain carry her to a room, but not enough to try to intervene. I wasn’t stupid enough to throw myself into what would be a pointless gesture of martyrdom. Against three mages, and a ship full of sailors, I would have no hope of resisting. </p><p>I couldn’t help but remember one of the favorite sayings of the old man. Mercy was a luxury that belonged to the strong, and the weak could only borrow it, and hope the interest wouldn’t ruin them… </p><p>And, considering my enemies didn’t just include a trio of pirate mages and their violent squad, I couldn’t even afford to borrow it. </p><p>At least she was treated far too valuable to suffer any indignity. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when the captain left the room a minute later, his expression still the same. “Anyone that dares to touch the cargo, I’ll cut them in small pieces and feed them to fish!” he warned. He didn’t shout, but he didn’t need to.</p><p>He flared his mana, and a thick rope of water rose from the sea, shifting threateningly. Then, that water column sank into the sea like a tentacle. When it pulled back, it was holding a sea turtle of second order. The beast was strong. Even with my most recent improvements, I wouldn’t have wanted to fight with it. I might have dealt with it on land, but it would have taken several minutes as I slowly chipped it down. </p><p>Underwater, I couldn’t even escape it. Yet, the beast of second order that could easily kill me snapped its mouth a couple times helplessly before the water tentacle tightened around it, and its shell gave a violent crack. </p><p>He didn’t need to shout, indeed. </p><p>“Cook it,” he said. “I need all of you strong when we arrive at the island.” </p><p>He was a good leader. Strong and merciless, but also smart enough to turn his display of intimidation into a reward. Already, I could see the new recruits looking at him with a mixture of fear and respect. </p><p>I made a decision. I was going to leave the ship, even if they wanted to return to Britannia for the deal. </p><p>That man was too dangerous to stick around… </p>",

    "content": "<p>My first week as a lowly sailor in a pirate ship was … surprisingly pleasant. Who would have expected? </p><p>Admittedly, the other sailors didn’t share that opinion, acting like the world had ended just because they were forced to work all day. </p><p>Weird, because living in the pirate ship was surprisingly comfortable. There were no late-night surprise attacks ‘to keep me sharp’, nor there were any servants that watched my every move like a hawk, trying to trip me up to gain my uncle’s favor. I wasn’t forced to train every day, wondering whether my body would give up first, or my elemental cores. </p><p>My sleeping arrangements weren’t luxurious — a mere moldy hammock that I was only allowed to hang at a moldy part of the ship — but it was better than sleeping on bare ground, which I had done many times, starting from when I was nine years old, and my grandfather thought that throwing me in a wild forest, armed with only a knife, was good training. </p><p>Alright, maybe the perspective of my fellow lowly sailor was more justified than I was happy to admit. </p><p>Still, despite the advantages I enjoyed, there was an aspect that thoroughly annoyed me. The first was the food. The newly hired sailors weren’t allowed to eat anything but dried meat and moldy bread that was harder than actual rock. That frustrated me, because even at the worst point in my training, I always had access to good food. Not exactly the fancy fare — mostly boiled vegetables, decent bread, and lots of meat, none of the noble delicacies like Ostrich eggs — but still leagues better than the garbage we were fed. </p><p>One had to take part in a raid and kill someone there to get better food. </p><p>I understood the reason for the clear segregation, as while my training focused on strategy, there were still large portions. The old man always said he didn’t want to waste all that training just because I was a moron that could be manipulated into an ambush, and taught some basics. </p><p>The first step for any military training was to isolate and oppress their forced hires while giving them clear targets, and slowly transforming their attitude. What pirates were doing was a simple version of it. I might have even respected them somewhat, if their rules of killing included combat. </p><p>No. Apparently, executing an old woman or a child after a raid was enough to earn their respect. </p><p>Knowing that, it was easy to ignore their constant disrespect. They insulted, mocked, ordered me around, and even threw occasional kicks my way. I took all with a pathetic whimper, using an act I had perfected for a long time. </p><p>Was bowing my head down to a bunch of arrogant pirates, certainly, especially since I knew I could kill half a dozen at the same time in a fair fight, even more, if I treated it as a proper fight. The two mages that ruled the ship as the commanding officers during the mysterious absence of their captain would have been impossible to deal with in a fair fight since both of them were mages, but they would still die in an ambush. </p><p>I didn’t do it, because I didn’t dare to cause a commotion, not when I was being searched by the full power of the provincial government and a mysterious sorcerer. The destruction of a known pirate ship was the exact opposite of subtle, particularly since they were officially privateers, which meant a link to the governor’s office, who had been looking for me. And, I would be stranded alone in the middle of the sea. </p><p>Which teemed with even more monsters than the wilderness of Britannia. They avoided our ship, because the mages took turns to flare their magic, which intimidated the sea beasts and made them seek easier targets. Second-order beasts avoided mages unless the mage in question stumbled to their nest, or the beast was too hungry. </p><p>Third-order beasts would have ignored that, but that was not a concern, not with the Republic Fleet and legions regularly hunting in the channel to keep the danger manageable. </p><p>Still, altogether, it meant that a solo sea voyage was not for me. A little indignity was easier to deal with than a full cohort of legionaries hunting me down or desperately trying to swim away from a horde of sea beasts. I was good, but not that good.</p><p>I desired to keep a low profile, which was why I acted like I didn’t notice the approach of an older sailor. He kicked me, not noticing I threw myself forward just as he swung his foot, reducing the impact significantly. </p><p>“It’s your turn to work the bilge pump again, rookie,” he ordered. </p><p>I looked at him with fake reluctance. “I just did it yesterday,” I whined. </p><p>“It’s the schedule. Why don’t you go and complain to the first mate if you have any problem,” he said with grim satisfaction of a successful bullying, and walked away. </p><p>I managed to keep my smile until he left, then stood up and went to the lower deck. </p><p>Admittedly, there was a reason for his cruel enjoyment. Working the bilge pump was the worst job on the ship. The function of the bilge pump was to throw away the seawater that had leaked into the ship. It was a difficult, exhausting job. </p><p>The location of the task made it worse. It was at the lowest deck, which was never the greatest place to be even in carefully maintained ships, and ours was far from it. So, the lower deck was wet, moldy, and cramped. </p><p>Constantly pushing and pulling a large lever in a cramped little hole was a horrible time, yet, I was happy for it. </p><p>The reason lay in the nature of the ship. Horribly maintained it might be, but the pirate ship had been made of high-quality wood with a strong mana presence, which allowed it to resist enemy attacks. It also interfered with the senses of the mages. </p><p>Meaning, I could use the dragon heart. </p><p>I once again opened the box, revealing the small crystal that belied its incredible value, and let a drop of my blood fall on it before I squeezed it with one hand, devouring the mana it radiated. I even grabbed the lever with the other hand, pumping steadily. </p><p>The bilge pump required a lot of strength to work, particularly since it was not maintained well. Yet, all I needed was to use Earth to empower my strength to do it with one hand while I focused on improving my four elemental cores. </p><p>The improvement I had experienced during last week had been incredible. My elemental caress was both larger and purer, growing as I channeled the pure mana from dragon hearts to them, making them slightly stronger with each heartbeat. </p><p>The day I would reach the rank of mage wasn’t too far away. </p><p>Technically, I could attempt to break through immediately. My elemental cores had already been strengthened enough to safely handle the strain of connecting with the world. </p><p>It was the difference between an apprentice mage of second order, and an actual mage of third order. An apprentice mage’s elemental cores were only connected to their body. That meant, an apprentice was limited to channeling the mana they gathered into their cores, and the elements would only be expressed indirectly, like my trick of using Earth to empower muscles. </p><p>A mage’s core — or cores, in the case of people who chose the harder road and raised four elements at once — was not isolated, but had a connection with the world as well. A mage could use that connection to cast external expressions of elements as spells. </p><p>The ability to enhance one’s strength was useful, but not as useful as throwing sharpened spikes of earth that could pierce through an armored man from a hundred feet. </p><p>Suppressing my breakthrough to further strengthen my elemental cores was beneficial, but not nearly enough to sacrifice the benefits of being a mage while my life was in danger. </p><p>I had a simpler reason for delaying it. A breakthrough was a long and delicate affair, taking days, sometimes even weeks as the apprentice slowly grew that ethereal connection with the world itself that gave a mage the command over the elements of the creation. And, since I had to establish connections for four elements at once, it would take even longer. </p><p>The connection gave a minuscule command compared to the potential of the world, but ultimately, it was still overwhelmingly dangerous. </p><p>One mistake, and it might ruin years of hard work, and that was assuming I survived in the first place. No, I just needed to wait until we stopped at a port in anywhere but Britannia … or failing that, drift close enough to a shore that I could swim to the land. </p><p>“Patience…” I muttered. “Just a few more days, and I’ll be safe.” </p><p>Fate must have taken that as a challenge, because the moment I uttered the last word, a bell started to ring furiously. A signal for every sailor to gather for orders. </p><p>And, dragon heart was still radiating mana, with no way to stop it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Finally, Londinium,” I muttered as I walked toward the port, carrying nothing but the silver and the small box that held the dragon heart, disguised as a regular pleb. Then, I took a deep breath, and my nose twisted. “And, the smelliest…” </p><p>It was hard to overstate just how badly the port had smelled. A part of it was more than fifty thousand people living there, all treating the sea as a convenient place to dump their garbage. The port area was even worse, with thousands of sailors, plebs, slaves, and livestock, each with its own smell. </p><p>The Republic might be famous for its incredible works of infrastructure, but that was only true for richer areas. Britannia was too unimportant to receive such investments, and even if it was assigned, I had no doubt that it would end up in the governor’s pocket. </p><p>Their riches were more important than the comfort of the lower classes. </p><p>However, I couldn’t complain. The smelly state of the ports meant that only the worst of the guards had been assigned to the area, meaning I didn’t need to worry about a hawk-eyed guard who might be looking for a potential escaped slave or outlaw. </p><p>As for the search for me, it was yet to spread that far. Thanks to replenishing my mana repeatedly, I managed to outpace the blockade they tried to create. They clearly didn’t count on me traveling non-stop for the last three days, not even stopping to sleep. </p><p>The only reason I hadn’t keeled over was the dragon heart. I had used it to replenish my mana several times, using Earth to push myself to the limit, and using Water to improve my recovery. A wasteful combination that was only possible due to the constant replenishment of the crystal I carried. </p><p>And, now, here I was, in the port, disguised as a wide-eyed pleb with dreams of more, looking for a ship to get in. I had enough silver to rent a cabin, but I was afraid of picking that path. Just because I managed to outpace them didn’t mean that I was free of their control. I needed to get a job, particularly on a ship that would be against being searched by government employees in principle. </p><p>That left smugglers and pirates as the best option. </p><p>My search soon brought me to the edge of the port, where the sailors were even more arrogant and the guards even more lacking. The ships that were docked there were far more attention-grabbing, and not in a good way. </p><p>One humongous ship in particular caught my attention. It was pulled to a premier spot, the area next to noticeably empty despite the overall crowded state. The colors of the hull and the sails were bad enough to hurt my eyes, and I spent my life with my uncle, who loved to initiate a colorblind peacock in a desperate attempt to prove he fit with his noble peers. </p><p>The ship was no less ugly than the silk tunics he thought of good taste, but in a different way. First of all, the ship was coated in black paint, and not a soft grayish black to make sure that the ship would be hard to spot in the dark of the night. </p><p>No, it was a shiny black that shouted its presence even under the slightest light. Red sails hardly helped. There was a flag I recognized, one that belonged to the governor, implying that they were under government service. </p><p>Privateers. Of course, that was a fancy name for pirates that promised not to attack government ships, instead raiding enemies. I could easily imagine that ship hitting the villages along the shores of Gaul and Germania, hunting for treasures and slaves. </p><p>Disgusting people, but they represented an opportunity. Their status as a privateer flying the flag of the governor, combined with inevitable illegal activities meant that they wouldn’t be willing to allow any casual search. </p><p>It was my best ticket to get away. </p><p>I just needed to get hired by them … which was surprisingly easy. I noticed a team of sailors prowling the streets, picking people off the streets before dragging them to the ship. Forcing people to work as sailors was illegal, but the few guards that frequented these parts turned the other way. </p><p>The perfect opportunity. </p><p>I drifted close to one of those gangs, acting like I was too careless. At the same time, I clamped over my elements, hiding my ability as an apprentice mage. Thanks to my most recent improvements, it was even harder to hide it. It would be lucky if I could hide it for longer than half an hour without it turning painful. </p><p>It was the cost of improvement. During the last three days, I experienced more improvements than I did for a full year. Now, I was at the edge of reaching the next order. No wonder the countries were willing to declare war on them. </p><p>Unfortunately, while the order of mage was closer than ever, I didn’t have the luxury of taking that step. Reaching the next order was a delicate process that might last weeks. Meaning, that only after I reached the mainland and found a nice corner to hide, I could attempt to reach it. </p><p>As for how to reach the fourth order and attain the power of a sorcerer … well, even with the dragon heart, it was years away. Dragon heart might have miraculous effects, but even it had limits. Otherwise, countries wouldn’t have treated their sorcerers as rare entities. </p><p>“Hey, you. Come with us,” said one of the sailors as he grabbed my arms, breaking my thoughts. He was an apprentice mage as well. </p><p>“W-what’s going on?” I stammered. “Please, let me go. I’m just here to find work.” </p><p>“It’s your lucky day. You’re hired,” he answered as he dragged me toward the ship. I hid my smile as the sailors pushed me among a few unlucky plebs, and moved toward the ship. </p><p>Still, when we got near the ship, I couldn’t help but wonder whether it had been the right choice to get recruited. The reason, was a sudden explosion sound that belonged to a fire spell, followed by a charred body flying off the deck. A fire mage, and one with a particularly poor attitude. “God damn it, Publius,” someone shouted. “How many times I have told you that don’t kill deckhands for stupid reasons.” </p><p>“It wasn’t a stupid reason,” a gruff voice bellowed back. “He insulted me.” </p><p>“How?” </p><p>“He brought my dinner late.” </p><p>“For Neptune’s sake, you idiot. The captain is going to gut you if we’re late because of you. We’re short-staffed as it is.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, we’re at the port. I’m sure the guys found enough sailors to replace him,” answered the gruff voice, but I could hear the fear in his tone. The captain in question was clearly a formidable man to scare a mage with such a poor attitude. </p><p>It was an explosive combination. I wondered whether it was the right choice of vessel. I looked around, wondering whether I should risk a commotion and get away…</p><p>After a momentary consideration, I surrendered with a sigh. Their attitude, combined with their obvious hurry, made them an excellent option to get away. </p><p>I just needed to be careful. </p><p>“Come on board, you useless sacks of shit,” Publius shouted from the upper deck, finally revealing himself. He was a tall, gruff man with a scared face, showing that he was no stranger to combat. Combined with his identity as a fire mage, he was a dangerous opponent. </p><p>I made a note to stay away from them as much as possible. </p><p>A few of the other ‘hired’ help stepped on board first before I followed, my back slouched. One advantage of living most of my life as a pariah in my own home, I knew exactly how to avoid attention. Keep my presence low, volunteer to take dirtiest, but least visible jobs, and never make eye contact.</p><p>“Listen to me, worms. I’m the first mate, and unless the captain is here, my word is law,” Publius bellowed as we stood in front of him. As he explained his status, he started punching us one by one. Then, it was my turn. </p><p>His fist flew toward me, fast but direct. Dodging a telegraphed punch was easy, but it would also alert everyone on the ship that I was more than another clueless pleb. I just looked shocked as I let the punch connect, but threw my weight back at the last second as I rolled back. </p><p>Publius moved to the next hire, satisfied with his achievement as I did my best to sell his success with grunts. “Stand up, dog,” said another sailor as he kicked my ribs. I rolled, then slowly stood up. As I stood, I trembled, like I was barely hanging on. </p><p>Not the most promising start to a journey, or a dignified one. Still, considering I was avoiding a province-wide manhunt by joining, I didn’t feel like complaining. </p><p>It might be rockier than I had expected, but it was still a new beginning. I just needed to stay calm and keep my head low in what clearly was a pirate ship until we reached a port outside Britannia. </p><p>How hard could it be?</p>",

    "content": "<p>As Tiffany set the table, I looked at Mark, who had been removing his laptop and other stuff from the dining table while his sexy wife, even more alluring than usual dressed as an erotic card dealer who wouldn’t look out of place in a strip club, provided it was a very expensive one. </p><p>I had chatted with Mark casually while my gaze was firmly on Tiffany. He had gone all the way convincing his wife to impress me. It would be wrong for me to neglect it. </p><p>Though, I had to admit, he managed to control his frustration better than I expected as he continued to share his opinions about the presentation, mixing a few comments about the current zoning of the sales regions and several possible amendments that looked neutral on the surface, but would benefit him immensely.  </p><p>That level of dedication to climb the corporate ladder was impressive…  </p><p>Our ‘pleasant’ discussion was interrupted by a voice coming from the kitchen.  </p><p>“ — Really! Now, you’re saying that! Go bring the drinks and shut up!” Umi said loudly. It wasn’t exactly a shout, but considering Umi’s reluctance toward conflict, it counted as a crazy hysterical shouting match. </p><p>“Rough patch,” I commented with a smirk, amused by the situation. </p><p>“Don’t be mean. It takes a while to learn how to live together,” Tiffany commented with a chuckle. “Sooner or later, she will learn how to cherish her significant other and help them complete their missions,  whatever it takes.”  </p><p>Her words were kind and understanding, but the way she stressed the last three words was unmistakable. Even Mark noticed it; and his ability to understand his wife’s mood was nowhere near his ability to decipher the middle-management nonsense.</p><p>“Well, within limits, of course,” Mark said, but his words were merely frustrated rather than wildly panicking, showing that he treated it as an empty threat rather than a prophecy about how the rest of the night would go. </p><p>Tiffany just smirked as she looked at him, her vindictive glee apparent. On a different, less attractive woman, it might have been an ugly expression, but on her, it reminded me of a beautiful villainess sent to seduce the poor hero away from his mission, her sharp gaze making her beauty even more striking. </p><p>That look alarmed Mark even more, but before he could say anything, Charlie arrived, carrying a tray that held three nice bottles of scotch, all three still sealed. Nothing that would break the bank, but not exactly cheap either. The cheapest of them went for eight hundred dollars.  </p><p>Another of Mark’s attempts to gain my favor, which paled against the way her wife had been dressed. </p><p>“Drinks are here,” he said as he placed the bottles down, his frustration apparent. He wanted nothing more than to drag her fiancee away and leave, a plan he no doubt shared with Umi, but as she had replied, it was too late. He might leave, but Umi was determined to stay. </p><p>Mark noticed that as well. “Let me help you with the drinks,” he said and elbowed him on the side. While he unsealed the bottles, he also whispered a few things in Charlie’s ears. What, I didn’t know, but it helped to douse Charlie’s impotent anger down to a childish frown. </p><p>Meanwhile, Mark poured all of us drinks, but my glass had considerably more, making their plan obvious, and not that creative. Mark was the one who had got black-out drunk during my last visit, and, inspired by it, he clearly wanted to drink me under the table. </p><p>Ironically, Charlie had fallen into the exact same trap during the sea trip, but he didn’t seem to connect the dots to weaponize it. </p><p>It wouldn’t have been a bad strategy, if they didn’t make it obvious enough to alert even a blind man. Charlie was looking at the glass like it would bring him salvation. </p><p>I grabbed the glass, and his expression brightened. We all lifted our glasses. “To the success of our department,” Mark said as they both drank their share. I was about to … when Umi walked in, bringing along Charlie’s punishment. </p><p>My gaze widened in surprise because she had made one tiny change to her outfit. Her blouse was gone, leaving the task of covering her chest with her blazer, which was something that it was woefully inadequate for, leaving a deep cleavage that almost killed me despite my strong heart. </p><p>I had seen her naked many times, but that didn’t make her look any more spectacular. Her daring attitude as she walked in, her shyness momentarily forgotten as she flared her femininity as a weapon to punish her frustrated fiancee was even better. </p><p>Especially since she ignored her fiancee as he pulled a chair for her, and sat next to me. Which meant, Tiffany was sitting at the head of the table, Mark on her left, with Charlie at his side. I sat across Mark while Umi sat across Charlie, closer to me than what was strictly necessary.  </p><p>Though, I barely held back a chuckle when I noticed Umi’s placement wasn’t just to anger Charlie, but also to keep her away from Mark’s gaze. Even her anger didn’t cover her shyness. </p><p>I paused for a moment, wondering how to play the game. Bullying them by revealing their drink trick and forcing them to match me, and take their significant others while they lay sleeping was easy, but also a betrayal … </p><p>After all, the girls had put so much effort into creating a fun environment. It would be rude if I let them waste it. Especially since I had the perfect props, I added mentally as I let my gaze fall on the two bootlickers, wondering how best to utilize their presence for a fun evening. </p><p>Then, I noticed Mark subtly lean to his side to get a secret glimpse of Umi. Charlie noticed, and elbowed him with a pointed glare. </p><p>That gave me a plan, at least, the beginnings of one, especially when combined with their plan to make me drunk. “Boys, do you mind if I take this bottle for myself. It’s my favorite,” I said as I pulled one of the bottles toward me. </p><p>“Sure, sir. Go ahead,” Mark said. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I pushed away the thick glass they poured for me, and picked a new glass,, but poured merely a single before drinking it. Then, I poured another small one, and finished it again, noticing matching smiles of Charlie and Mark, happy that their plan to get me drunk had a nice start. </p><p>I wished that I  could act drunk immediately and see what they had in mind next, but I had a reputation as a strong drinker, and it wouldn’t be believable. I needed to show them the process … it was also why I went with asking for a bottle of my own. I wanted them to check the bottle for how much I drank … while I slowly filled the pot of a fake plant with some of it.</p><p>Meanwhile, there was the other part. “I’m guessing we’re going to play small,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” Charlie said immediately. </p><p>“Boring,” I said. “How about ten grand from every player. Small enough for you guys,” I said, trying to open the deal high before bringing it low. </p><p>Charlie looked ready to argue, but Mark poked him to silence him. “That would be alright, boss,” he decided, and to my surprise, Charlie complied with it, though they started whispering once more.  </p><p>That surprised me, as earlier the day, the prospect of paying fifteen thousand had managed to intimidate him when he had been trying to protect Umi. </p><p>I decided to test their determination. “Which means fifty grand as the limit, not bad,” I said, reminding them indirectly that the girls had to play as well. </p><p>“The girls won’t play. Just the men,” Mark said, keeping the pot lower. Smart, at least monetarily, but potentially angering his significant other more was less intelligent. </p><p>“I still don’t — “ Charlie started, trying to argue about the amount, but Mark distracted him with another elbow before he started whispering. </p><p>Charlie was too focused on what Mark was saying to notice it, but Umi noticed that difference as well, and stiffened against me. Big mistake, particularly since she was already angry, and looking for excuses to justify her infidelity. </p><p>Her revenge came faster than I expected, in the form of a gentle finger reaching to my zipper and pulling my shaft with a smoothness she couldn’t have done before and started to give me an under-the-table blowjob, the suspicious movement of her shoulder only caught by Tiffany. </p><p>Umi was rapidly becoming an excellent secretary. </p><p>While my fun started rapidly, I also hooked my foot to one of the fake plants, pulling it closer so that I could dump some of my drink to make a convincing drunk. Then, we started playing, and I started by winning big despite their attempts to play slowly. Tiffany was the only one who was a good player, but she was the dealer, which kept her out, giving me an easy way to manipulate the table. </p><p>Winning was easy. They were terrible poker players. I had more trouble in the second part where I started to act drunk and was supposed to lose them. Charlie, already scared by his losses, was too hesitant, while Mark tried to bluff in some really absurd times, needlessly confident in his ability. </p><p>I actually had to cheat to make them win, which was absurd.  </p><p>Still, despite the struggle, I managed to lose all my winnings before adding twenty thousand more to the pot … and losing it as well. However, while I lost, I played the role of a lecherous old boss to perfection, occasionally grabbing Umi and Tiffany with the excuse of getting lucky.  </p><p>They were as willing as always, but watching their significant others grit their teeth as they swallowed their complaints was fun, especially since they said nothing to win more.   </p><p>Mark and Charlie smirked victoriously as they fleeced their drunk boss, who had already been slurring, with barely a thousand in front of him, confident that their night going amazing. </p><p>It was a good time to counter-attack. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You got to be kidding me,” I muttered. I shouldn’t have said anything, as it only made Pearyin look at me with worry, tears not too far away. “It’s not anything to worry about, sweetie. I just realized your cultivation had increased more than I expected in my absence. You must have worked hard.” </p><p>The compliment worked wonders in her fragile mode. She nodded shyly, then kept her gaze down. </p><p>I said nothing else as I kept my essence cycling in her body, while, at the same time, adding some Qi to the mix to make sure my earlier assessment was not a mistake. </p><p>However, it just confirmed my earlier diagnosis. She had an Immortal Root. It wasn’t a problem all in itself, but everything I had learned about cultivation told me that Immortal Root was rare, especially for children from mortal parents. </p><p>I didn’t have the exact numbers, but previously, the impression I got was that it was closer to one in a million than one in a thousand. The fact that Pearyin, the random waitress that somehow stumbled into my life having one could technically be just a coincidence.</p><p>Just like how my earlier arrival or events of Markas could be a coincidence. </p><p>I hadn’t been a believer of fate when I was growing up … but being sent to a new world by an unnecessarily vindictive goddess went a long way to change my perspective. Unfortunately, that didn’t even begin to answer what I should do. </p><p>Admittedly, I could see the benefits of helping her cultivate. Having a cultivator loyal to me would open up a lot of paths to the future. Unfortunately, the risks were not small either. For once, she couldn’t stay in the mortal kingdoms. The sects didn’t appreciate it, and I didn’t trust Pearyin to be able to keep it a secret. </p><p>I decided to stop thinking about it for a moment and focused on healing her. “Tell me, what happened?” </p><p>“A few martial artists visited the store, asking me to donate all the pills I had to the war effort. And, once I refused,, they started breaking things,” Pearyin said. </p><p>“It looks like they had been looking for a fight in the first place,” I commented. Either that, or they were entitled enough to rob a random shop, which didn’t bode well for the royal authority, but I didn’t care about the problems the king might face due to that. </p><p>I was fulfilling my patriotic duty to him by keeping one of his wives happy and satisfied. </p><p>“It looked like that way,” she commented. </p><p>“Why didn’t you just give the pills to them, and leave the shop once they went away?” I asked. “Or better, why not just slip out from the backdoor after you beat down the first ones. I’m guessing they didn’t visit such a crowd.” </p><p>“No, they did not. But, I couldn’t just let them have everything. They are yours,” she defended. </p><p>I sighed. “As much as I’m happy to see your determination to keep my possessions safe, we both know that there’s nothing valuable in that shop. We opened it just to allow you to gather some of the gossip. Even if they didn’t send the experts, the moment you fought against the other martial artists, the shop would be infamous, turning it useless for our purposes.” </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she repeated. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. That shop was just training for you in the first place. Just be more careful the next time,” I reminded her. </p><p>“The next time… You’re really not sending me away,” she said desperately, clearly expecting me to send her away. </p><p>“No, of course not,” I said. Admittedly, I was tempted to find a nice village for her to live in and do exactly that, but discovering her immortal root went a long way to change my mind. Having a loyal cultivator was simply too tempting. </p><p>However, to do so, I needed to find a place for her to train, one that was rich in Qi, safe, and out of the way of the other cultivators. Unfortunately, the closest I had to that was the misty mountains, particularly the outskirts. </p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough. Even if she could cultivate rapidly, it wasn’t safe. There were too many itinerant cultivators there, and some would inevitably target her. Pearyin was too softhearted to survive there. </p><p>And, that was with her cultivating rapidly, which wasn’t exactly something guaranteed. Unlike Martial Cultivation, I couldn’t just feed her a few pills and use acupuncture to boost her cultivation. Such a thing might not bee been possible in the first place, and I certainly had no idea how to do so. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t a decision I needed to make today. “How’s your reading?” I asked. “Have you made any progress?” </p><p>“Some,” she answered. I pulled paper and brush from my bag and wrote a few quick sentences on it, using some of the simpler words. She was hesitant, but she still managed to read, while the complicated words gave her some trouble. </p><p>Still, considering the complicated nature of the writing here, it was an incredible progress. Either she was smarter than I gave her credit for, or there was a significant cognitive increase that came with higher realms. </p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t use my own development as a test. Language jade, system lessons, martial aptitude pill… I had too many benefits to confidently pin down the source of my improvements. Ultimately, it wasn’t particularly important. </p><p>Pearyin’s rapid learning was useful, and I had no intention of starting a martial arts school. </p><p>“Very good. Just a bit more studying, and we’ll make a scholar out of you as well.” </p><p>“Women can’t be scholars,” she commented. </p><p>“Well, no one else has to know,” I said with a wink. It was stupid, but discrimination often was. I certainly wasn’t volunteering to fix it. “Now, do you have anything you want to do urgently?” I asked. She shook her head. “Good, we’re going to find you a cave, and you’re going to stay there for a day or two. I should have returned then,” I started, ready to explain quite a bit once she asked. </p><p>She didn’t ask anything, just nodded. </p><p>I sighed. Sometimes, I underestimated the lengths of her deference. No wonder the System didn’t trigger with her anymore. </p><p>Once we were sufficiently away from the crowd, I lifted her in a bridal hold and carried her. Despite her Connate Realm cultivation, it was the faster method. My Rabbit Dash martial arts was fast. Ridiculously so. </p><p>Together, we traveled in the opposite direction of Markas. The last thing I wanted was to put Pearyin in the middle of the upcoming clash. I should return by then, but no need to tempt fate. </p><p>She was enough of a bitch already without tempting it further. </p><p>Only when we arrived at a nice cave that was technically not a part of the capital’s territory but another city, I slowed down. All the while, Pearyin said nothing, but in my arms, her earlier panic lessened significantly. </p><p>“I want you to stay here for a couple days. Can you do that?” I asked. </p><p>”Of course, sir. What do you need me to do?” she asked. </p><p>“Nothing for now. Just stay in the cave and meditate, preparing for the future,” I said after a brief moment when I considered telling her about her Immortal Root. But, in the end, I decided against it, mostly because I still had to visit Markas to deliver the Queen’s letters and make the other arrangements. Explaining Pearyin about being a cultivator was too much of a challenge. </p><p>Even I was having trouble handling that revelation. The last thing I wanted was to leave her alone with that realization. Instead, I decided to search for a meditation art that didn’t belong to the Verdant family, in order not to make things even more complicated. </p><p>It wasn’t like a few days would matter. Everything I had learned about cultivators showed that Pearyin already missed the best time to cultivate, and it would take a miracle for her to even reach the first realm without significant external help. </p><p>Cultivation was a difficult path. Otherwise, the cultivator market wouldn’t have been filled with itinerant cultivators of the early stages of the Qi Gathering. </p><p>“Just that?” she asked. </p><p>“Sure, just that,” I said as I paused, trying to remember the map. “I will return in two days unless there’s an emergency. If I don’t return, wait for a week, then sneak into this village and wait for me here,” I said to her. </p><p>As a connate realm master, it was easy for her. </p><p>Then, I pulled a piece of paper, and my small pouch holding my spirit stones. I grabbed the smallest spirit stone, and my talisman brush. I grabbed the stone, activated the meditation art, and pushed my Calligraphy to the limit as I wrote a simple character. </p><p>Forest. However, it was imbued with the essence of the forest dance. Hopefully, it would help her cultivate. Since it was merely an impression rather than a technique, I didn’t need to subdue the Qi. </p><p>She looked too curious. “Feel free to ask if you have any questions,” I said. </p><p>“What are those, sir?” she asked as she pointed at the spirit stone pouch, her gaze bouncing between the dust from the depleted stone and the pouch. </p><p>“Just something to help focus martial essence,” I said, not willing to explain to her that I was also a cultivator. Less about trust, and more about not wanting her to get even more respectful. </p><p>“May I check one?” she said. </p><p>“Sure,” I said. After all, the spirit stones were pretty harmless without the interaction from a cultivator. I passed the largest one. She grabbed it…</p><p>And, the Qi immediately drained by her, responded by a flicker from her dantian. </p><p>What the hell had just happened. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Pearyin fought against two Bone Forging realm artists while I used the distraction to slip into the apothecary. She was losing, but the sheer superiority of her martial cultivation meant that it was happening slowly. </p><p>The two that were attacking her were far more experienced in her, taking turns distracting her while the other attacked, keeping her confused and reactionary. To her credit, Forest Dance was significantly lacking in terms of deadly blows, and she lacked the determination to use the few killing moves I taught her.</p><p>I didn’t blame her for that. I was certainly as squeamish about killing someone. </p><p>The aim of not intervening in the fight immediately wasn’t some kind of weird attempt to punish her. No, once I intervened, we either had to find a hiding spot for her in the capital, or leave with her. However, either way, the store needed to be abandoned. </p><p>As for city guards … well, they didn’t react until now, making it clear that they had no intention of helping. Not surprising. They wouldn’t have risked angering the army of the martial artists they had likely spent a fortune to hire. </p><p>I went through the store while keeping my presence hidden. I didn’t do much. I just took the majority of the gold in the safe, and sabotaged the pills. Not enough to be poisonous, but enough to create some trouble. I made sure to make that sabotage noticeable in case they tried to sell them to an apothecary, but not to an ordinary user. </p><p>I expected them to use those pills themselves. Regressing their cultivation permanently was a punishment they deserved for attacking my store. I wanted to punish them, which was also the reason I left some of the money in the safe. </p><p>I didn’t want them to realize I had the time to sabotage the place. </p><p>Pearyin was still fighting when I finished sabotaging the pills, so I also added a fire trap to the laboratory. It wouldn’t kill anyone, but it would prevent the royal agents from sifting through the place for clues about my real identity. </p><p>No need to take any risk. </p><p>While I was going through all those preparations — which barely took two minutes — Pearyin was steadily losing ground, nearing defeat. Seeing that she was about to be defeated, I couldn’t help but feel shocked at the coincidental nature of my arrival. </p><p>I couldn’t help but question if it was actually a coincidence. Under different circumstances, I might have wondered if the scene was deliberate to trick me, but no one truly knew that I would be here. Aisnam was the only candidate who could set up something like that, and even that was a remote chance. </p><p>Writing it off as a coincidence was tempting, but it wasn’t the first time things escalated around me through no involvement of my own. Instead, I was really starting to believe that there was something more to karma that everyone kept blabbing about. </p><p>Too bad that, even for Qi Gathering cultivators, it was a mystery, preventing me from exploring it. I stopped thinking about it, pulled a thick cloak around me, wrapped a shawl around my head to hide my face — I didn’t have the time to put on makeup — and left the house. </p><p>A couple jumps later, I arrived at the location from the other side, and jumped right in the middle of the fight, too quick for the surrounding disciples to react. To their credit, Bone Forging martial artists reacted far more professionally. One of them attacked Pearyin to keep on the defensive while the other turned toward me in a defensive stance, wanting to delay me until the Skin Refinement fighters could join. </p><p>Too bad he was barely able to throw a punch before I grabbed his wrist and locked him. My cultivation might be two main martial realms lower than Pearyin, but the difference between our skill levels was even more stark. She was barely at Minor Familiarity, while I was at Minor Immersion. </p><p>A difference of five stages. Hardly a trivial difference. </p><p>The Bone Forging instructor in my grip was quick to realize that difference as he felt my essence invading some of his most critical acupunctures and blocking his strength. “We are—” </p><p>That was all she was able to say as I forcibly fed him a pill while at the same time using my essence to force him to digest. It was faster to use my essence to break his cultivation, but it required more time than I had. The observers were already rushing toward us bravely … well, stupidly. I could have dealt with them easily if I didn’t want to keep my capabilities as hidden as possible, even when I was under a false identity. </p><p>Instead, I shifted my attention to the second Bone Forging martial artist, and grabbed him before throwing him away in a modified judo move. It didn’t harm him anyway, but it gave me enough time for me to walk next to Pearyin and whisper. “It’s me. Play along and don’t resist,” I said. </p><p>“Master. I’m sure we have a misunderstanding,” he started as he threw a fearful glance at his partner trying to stand up, but failing. “Why don’t we try to solve it peacefully.” </p><p>He wasn’t very good at hiding his vindictive expression. His plan was even easier to deduce. He just wanted to delay me while Connate realm martial artists of their school joined the fray. Not that it mattered. Even without his dubious intentions, I had no reason to stick around. </p><p>“You’re not worthy to talk to me, little cat,” I answered, making sure to speak in the creaky tone of an expert while also insulting his school. “Just know that this is not the first time your pathetic school has angered me, but it will be the last. This time, you attacked my disciple.” </p><p>“We —” he started, panicking at the declaration. However, before he could complete his sentence, I dropped a smoke pellet on the ground. </p><p>Forewarned, Pearyin didn’t resist as I lifted her in a bridal hold. When I reached the edge of the smoke cloud, I dropped another pellet, then reversed the direction, using a back alley to escape. To their credit, the Tiger Fist disciples reacted quickly to block my path, but they had no idea just how fast I could move. </p><p>It allowed me to pick a truly absurd route of back alleys and ignored streets, and soon, we were at one of the city gates. I had already got rid of my cloak, and Pearyin was wearing a new cloak that I bought from a stall. We walked out, ignoring the alarm bells. Once we left the city, I looked back. At a distance, I could see the gate that was closest to our initial location closing down. </p><p>Without my speed, I would have been in big trouble. </p><p>We walked slowly. As much as I wanted to run, there were too many people around, and a man running too fast even for a Connate Martial artist while carrying someone else was rather distinctive. I could still run away, but I didn’t want to reveal my speed to them. </p><p>I wanted them to believe that we were still in the city. That way, they would spend quite a bit of effort searching the capital. Wasting my enemies’ time was always useful. Also, it gave me the option to attack them once I returned to the capital. </p><p>“Are you feeling alright?” I asked. </p><p>It was a perfunctory question. With my medical skills, a touch was enough for me to diagnose her properly. She was exhausted, and had several terrible bruises, and some internal bleeding, but the difference in cultivation between her and her opponents meant there was nothing that wouldn’t cure a couple days of bed rest. </p><p>“Yes, sir. I’m alright,” she whispered obediently, but I could feel that she was dejected. </p><p>“You sound sad. Is it the pain?” I asked. </p><p>That turned out to be the wrong question, as she started crying. A little drop at first, but it soon turned into a flood she was unable to stop. </p><p>I gently grabbed her chin and lifted her face. At the same time, I pulled a pill that would help her recover. “Open your mouth,, beautiful. Let’s make sure you don’t have to deal with the pain,” I offered.</p><p>She started crying even more, which implied that it wasn’t the pain that drove her. Truly, I haven’t saw anyone crying that way since I broke up with —</p><p>It clicked. “Tell me what’s wrong,” I ordered with a sharp tone. </p><p>“P-please don’t send me away, sir. I promise I will do better. I won’t lose again.” </p><p>I hugged her gently, chuckling at her reaction. “Don’t worry. I’m not going to send you away just because you weren’t able to take down two martial artists with decades of training,” I said as I patted her back. </p><p>“Really?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes,” I said as I raised the pill. “Now, take this. We have a long journey in front of us,” I said. While I still needed to discuss with her what she wanted to do, and whether she still wanted to follow me, it was a discussion that was best had once she was calmer. </p><p>Once I fed her the pill, I added some of my essence to quicken the process. At the same time, it was a good time to assess her cultivation, to see how she developed in my absence. So, I delved deeper than usual. </p><p>And, found something I wasn’t expecting. </p><p>An Immortal Root. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>I wanted to visit Markas, but not immediately. First, I needed to find an opportunity … well, create one. </p><p>Luckily, Aisnam left the Spring Palace once once again once again the next night, after another day filled with training and ‘training’ — more later than former now that she adapted to her breakthrough, and focused on enjoying the pleasures she had been deprived during her strict life — giving me the opportunity offer the help from the apothecary. </p><p>“Now, the letter,” I muttered as pulled a piece of paper from my inventory. I tightened my hold on the brush, and once again used my minor immersion calligraphy skill to write a letter forged to perfection. </p><p>‘Dear Queen Aisnam,</p><p>Congratulations on your swift and effective recovery. We are happy to see that our efforts to interfere with the secret assassins that followed your courier had borne fruit, and you improved far above our expectations. </p><p>Therefore, it’s a pity that we don’t dare to approach to have a talk with you. As much as we respect you, we’re not daring enough to directly face a cultivator near the peak of her realm as mere martial artists. However, we hope that you will take out contributions in the goodwill they have been delivered. </p><p>Still, our reticence toward a direct meeting doesn’t represent any reluctance toward further cooperation from our side. At a minimum, we’re willing to provide you with a significant amount of pills for martial artists that could be used to raise enough force to confront several Connate Realm martial artists rapidly. </p><p>Additionally, if it’s to your preference, we are willing to send an acupuncture expert to further assist in the breakthrough of your selected candidates in Markas, or any other location, as long as it doesn’t bring us to any direct confrontation with other esteemed cultivators. </p><p>We are willing to provide all those services for a minor favor that we could request in the future. Additionally, if you find that favor unfavorable to your future goals, we are willing to accept an appropriate material payment, as long as it’s made by using spirit stones.  </p><p>If you’re willing to make the deal, send your messenger to the capital, and we will contact him after making sure he wasn’t followed. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>A concerned citizen</p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I folded the letter. It was more direct than the usual tone, but I hoped it would work better. The general idea was still solid. I extended an offer of assistance to her in a way that would solve a lot of her concerns about Markas if she was inclined to take it. </p><p>I didn’t know what was restricting Entsa Pavilion from supporting Markas, but solving the issue should grant Aisnam a better footing in the sect. </p><p>And, the more rewards she received, the better returns I would receive … assuming I could maintain contact with her once she went to the sect. </p><p>Still, even without contact, it would still help me help Markas without putting myself at risk at any point. Since there was a clear reluctance to involve cultivators directly, I was not at any risk as long as I maintained my cover. </p><p>I folded the letter and placed it on top of the kitchen table, to the exact spot where I had left essence pills in the past. </p><p>Once it was prepared, I lingered at the entrance of the secret tunnel while I waited for her to return. She once again climbed down the stairs after putting her dummy in place. “There’s a letter in the kitchen,” I said to her the moment she climbed down. </p><p>“How?” she asked. </p><p>“I don’t know. Whoever visited was good. Really good,” I said, faking frustration. “I only noticed when they were already leaving, and even then, I suspect they only did to alert me to their presence. Considering the spot where they left the letter, I decided that chasing them was not the right choice.” </p><p>“Good call,” she said as she went to take the letter, though, rather than opening it directly, she went back upstairs first, acting as she delivered it to the Queen. She returned five minutes later. “Any guesses about the content.” </p><p>“Either a threat or an offer of cooperation,” I guessed, which was an obvious guess. </p><p>“That’s an astute guess. There’s a mysterious party that wants to support the war through the Queen,” she explained. “What do you think?” </p><p>I shrugged. “Not exactly the kind of problem I understand,” I answered, not just to maintain my innocence, but also to avoid getting entangled in her political decisions. The last thing I needed was to be treated as a political advisor. “The sects, the cultivation families, royal orders, archaic laws… Not my cup of tea.” </p><p>Aisnam chuckled. “I wish I had that luxury,” she said softly. </p><p>“I’m guessing you need my help,” I said. She said nothing, just passed the letter to me. I read. “Sure, it’s just walking around the capital for a few hours before they contact me. Nothing difficult.” </p><p>“About the risk  —” she started, but I waved my hand to cut her off. </p><p>“There’s clearly not enough risk. Their words make it clear that they were aware of me bringing pills. They would have hit me then if they had any issues with me, and I have no value as a hostage,” I said. </p><p>That last part made her gaze tighten slightly, as it was not correct. As the lover of the Queen, I was indeed a good hostage, either for ransom, or to eventually discredit her. “You’re right,” she admitted reluctantly, unhappy about her hidden identity for the first time. </p><p>“Am I to leave in the morning?” I asked. She nodded. “Excellent,” I said. </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>I chuckled. “It means we still have the night.” With that, I wrapped my arm around her waist, and dragged her toward the bedroom.</p><p>It was a gentlemanly act to give her a chance to assuage her guilt, right?  </p><p>*** </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[125x Return - 415 Qi Strands]</p><p>As I walked into the hidden tunnel, there was a letter in my pocket, and a smile was on my face. </p><p>The smile was more interesting. A part of it was about the fun we had been having just moments ago, but no matter how enthusiastic my dear Queen had been, I would be lying if  I claimed that the payback from the System didn’t play a great role in my smile. </p><p>With that, I had over seventeen hundred Qi strands in my Inventory, which should be enough to not only bring me to the peak of the Qi Gathering Realm, and still leave a nice amount on the storage to allow me to fight some more. </p><p>And, my incredible expertise in gate transformation technique meant that I would need merely a couple minutes to break through each minor realm, which was supposed to be impossible. </p><p>Cheating was fun. </p><p>Naturally, I wouldn’t have used that unless I was facing an emergency. I didn’t want to sacrifice my return rate unless it was incredibly critical. </p><p>The moment I stepped into the tunnel, the whispers came once more, promising me power, victory, and endless rivers of blood. I sighed. I didn’t know exactly who was trapped there, but their pitch needed serious rework.  </p><p>With a sigh, I continued traversing the tunnel, ignoring the disgusting sensation of cursed Qi. The protection talisman prevented it from touching me, but my enhanced perception still allowed me to feel it. It felt like walking through a thick swamp. I might be wearing excellent boots, but they didn’t block the smell.  </p><p>“Now, what to do,” I muttered as I finally stepped out of the tunnel and picked up my supplies from the spot where I had buried them. I wanted to keep the talismans with me just in case. </p><p>After thinking for a while, I decided to visit Pearyin first. She was doing alright a couple days ago,   which meant she should be alright, but that was before the sudden arrival of a small army of foreign martial artists.  </p><p>Her identity as a Connate martial artist should protect her, but I still decided to pay her a visit.  </p><p>It turned out, that it was a good choice. As I approached the place, a great commotion reached my ears, and it intensified as I got nearer to my destination. </p><p>I arrived at the apothecary, just to find it surrounded by disciples of Tiger Fist. Almost fifty of them.  Most of them were Muscle Reinforcement, but there were six Skin Refinement ones a part of the crowd as well. </p><p>However, the real show was Pearyin, doing her best to fight against Bone Forging experts, and despite being Connate Realm, losing steadily. Though, to be fair, she had an excuse. Every single Skin  Refinement martial artist,  along with several of the Muscle Reinforcement ones were showing signs of damage. </p><p>Still, I was less concerned about her plight — which wasn’t as dire now that I arrived to save her — and more concerned about the timing of it. </p><p>How the hell did I manage to arrive right at what she was about to lose!</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>When Aisnam — and her puppet — returned, I was in the kitchen, cooking a small feast for her. I cooked mostly the local cuisine, a soup, a nice salad, some stir-fried meat; a nice spread, but not overbearing. However, I added a nice creme brûlée to the mix, even though caramelizing the crust had been a challenge.  </p><p>It was one of my more functional discoveries. A nice dessert worked wonders in dealing with a bad mood. Naturally, not as much as the precious bottle of wine I opened early to allow it to breathe and reach the ideal situation. I didn’t know for a fact that her mood would be bad, but it felt like a safe bet. </p><p>And, even in the case that I was wrong, there was no harm. </p><p>She walked down the stairs ten minutes later. She tried to look calm, but she wasn’t particularly successful, making me glad that I took that particular bet. </p><p>“Tough night?” I asked casually as I looked at her, acting like I was more interested in her mood than the source of frustration. To be fair, it was half right. I cared about Markas somewhat, but ultimately, it was merely a place I visited for a couple of weeks, and I had done more than necessary. </p><p>On the contrary, keeping Aisnam happy was much more beneficial. </p><p>“Somewhat, but I don’t want to talk about it,” she answered absentmindedly as she approached the kitchen. “Smells good,” she whispered. </p><p>“It's better. I cooked them just for you,” I answered with a seductive smile. “Now, why don’t you take a seat while I give you a massage.” </p><p>She might have reacted differently earlier in our relationship. However, we were long past in such false kindness. A ghost of a smile appeared on her face as she nodded as she sat down, and I served the first course. </p><p>I stood behind her, my fingers dancing on her back, delivering a combination of ordinary and essence massage, helping her drain her stress. What she discovered must have been significant, because she was even more stressed than I expected. </p><p>“I find that talking about things can help the stress,” I commented, but only after fifteen minutes of massage, turning her earlier frustration into a mellow calm. The wine certainly helped. </p><p>She stayed silent for a minute after my comment, but I didn’t push her. I kept messaging, acting like I commented only because I was concerned with her attitude. “I can’t believe how reckless the cultivators are, trying to plot against an ordained city lord,” she commented. </p><p>“Really? From what I saw, cultivators don’t care much about the mortals in general, do they?” </p><p>“Normally, yes. But an ordained city lord is different. It’s a reward for the merits of the Great Battlefield. Violating it directly goes against the pact  between the sects.”  </p><p>“What’s the Great Battlefield?” I asked. </p><p>“You never heard of the Great Battlefield —” she started, then nodded. “Sorry, sometimes I forget that you’re an itinerant martial artist,” she added. I hummed and continued to massage her back. “The Great Battlefield is a dimensional weak point between our world and the demonic world, where they constantly attack our world. Every sect is responsible for supporting the battlefield.” </p><p>“Really. Can martial artists play a role in such a battle? Maybe I should join the battle myself as well,” I asked, surprised by it. I would have thought that, with the difference in the strength between the cultivators and the martial artists, martial artists would be useless.</p><p>As for joining the battle, I was just playing the role of the brave martial artist. I had no intention of joining such a thing, not even with the promises of rewards. </p><p>“Only if you want to die without a grave,” she warned me sharply. “Every year, millions of martial artists are sent to the frontlines. Do you want to guess how many returns?” </p><p>“I’m guessing, not many,” I replied, still shocked at the mention of millions. And, from her tone, it wasn’t just a few million either. This world was ridiculously large and crowded, but even with it, the number sounded excessive.  </p><p>Her derisive chuckle showed that even that guess was an understatement. “Maybe one in ten thousand,” she said. “And, even then, most die in a few years due to after-effects of the forbidden martial arts or the side effects of the medicine they took.” </p><p>“Point taken. Don’t go to the Great Battlefield unless dragged,” I said. “Still,  that doesn’t explain how the Martial Artists can help the cultivators.”   </p><p>“The Great Battlefield is huge, far bigger than your mind could comprehend. Only through sheer numbers our world could occupy some of it. We don’t have enough cultivators to cover the whole field,” she explained. “Moreover, the Great Battlefield doesn’t have a stable structure. Often, some phenomenon happens, suppressing Qi significantly in certain areas, forcing the command to rely on martial artists.” </p><p>“I see. Definitely a place to avoid, then. I don’t want to be used as cannon fodder,” I agreed. Her tone showed that she didn’t want to talk about it anymore, and I was happy to follow that direction. Though, I couldn’t help but wonder if Black Tiger Onslaught was one of those forbidden martial arts. </p><p>It was a reasonable guess. Using that technique for years — or, maybe even weeks — would turn someone into a bloodthirsty monster, unfit for society. </p><p>“Surviving martial artists receive huge rewards, including being ordained as a city lord. The pact between sects openly forbids targeting ordained city lords,” she finished explaining.  </p><p>I understood the rationale, but I doubted the fight between Entsa Pavilion and Kartpa Valley was the first time an ordained city lord was targeted through proxies.  </p><p>After all, it wasn’t the cultivators that targeted them, but other martial artists. Also, it was interesting that, during my visit, I had learned nothing about the city lord being ordained by the cultivators, the battlefield, or anything else. Nothing I had read about the history even indicated such a thing. However, it didn’t make me distrust Aisnam’s account. Her explanation clearly included a lot of secrets, and it was absurd to assume a random book from a bookstore would share state secrets. </p><p>“So, my guess was right. Tiger Fist army is here to invade Markas.” </p><p>“Officially, they are invited to clean up the savage beasts, but otherwise, yes. They are here to take over Markas unless Entsa Pavilion helps. But, since there’s no movement, it’s clear that they have other priorities.” </p><p>“Why all the trouble for a mere city?” I asked. “It doesn’t look like something cultivators care about.” </p><p>“That, we don’t know,” she admitted. “Maybe it’s just a way to take over the kingdom. Zaim is supposed to be allied with Entsa Pavilion, but Kartpa Valley is making some moves in the region,” she explained. </p><p>“Why not take over the kingdom first, then deal with Markas.” </p><p>“If they do it, them breaking the pact would be too obvious,” she said. </p><p>“You don’t seem happy about it,” I said. </p><p>“No. My Queen has an invitation to join the Entsa Valley to establish her Foundation once she reaches the peak of Qi Gathering, but there’s no guarantee that invitation would still exist if the kingdom switches sides,” she explained absentmindedly. Then, she tensed. “That was my mistake to reveal it. Please don’t reveal it,” she added. </p><p>Her tone was intense enough to convince me that she had revealed that particular nugget by mistake. </p><p>“As you wish, madam,” I said playfully as I leaned forward and kissed her neck, making her shiver. She believed my words easily, as it was hardly the only secret I knew about her. And, if I wanted to work against her, all I needed was to sell the medicine to someone else rather than bring it to her. </p><p>She giggled, but that was the extent of her reaction, showing that she was not in the mood for some … escalation. I followed that wordless clue. After all, one rule of being a freeloader boy toy was to follow those wordless clues religiously. For a powerful woman, the constant humping that ignored her desires was very important. </p><p>“Have you tried the dessert,” I said as I grabbed a spoon, scooped some of the creme brûlée, and fed her gently. She looked hesitant at first, but her eyes brightened instantly once she tasted it. “I never had that dessert! It’s delicious,” she said as she reached for the spoon. </p><p>“No need. I got it,” I said as I filled another spoon, happy to take the opportunity to soften the moment. I let the discussion fade into less important topics. I was tempted to ask her a question about whether she wanted to support Markas, but, ultimately, I decided against it. I didn’t want to show undue interest in that topic. </p><p>The last thing I wanted was for her to start suspecting my connection with the mysterious apothecary helping her. Instead, I decided to extend her help through another mysterious letter. </p><p>After I had a talk with Marana. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Three days passed since I revealed to Aisnam the events surrounding Markas, and we fell into a new routine of sparring and having fun every day while she spent the nights cultivating. </p><p>None of my skills had improved, but my storage of Qi Strands barely cleared a thousand, which was far more than I had been expecting. It didn’t take long for me to realize that the side effects of her forced breakthrough and her even more intensive recovery actually helped me. </p><p>With the most recent breakthroughs, she didn’t have the control to keep a tight hold on her cultivation, which made her Qi leak, quite a bit of it being devoured by my essence.  </p><p>Even in a conservative estimate, I had enough to push myself to the peak of the Ninth Stage of the Qi Gathering Realm. </p><p>Especially since I didn’t need to deal with any pesky bottlenecks like other cultivators dealt with. Not many cultivators had the luxury of training until their understanding of the Gate transformation technique reached Perfection, let alone actually surpassing it. </p><p>For example, Aisnam was barely at Major Familiarity when it came to the Gate Transformation technique, focusing more on her palm and talisman techniques. </p><p>Not that I  was complaining. Her relative skill distribution worked wonders for me. Too bad she seemed not to know anything about other cultivator arts, be it alchemy or formation mastery. I would have loved to have learned some about any of those techniques. </p><p>As the evening turned into night, I prepared myself for another calm night where I stayed alone while she cultivated — she always cultivated at night to put the increase in the cursed Qi density to good use — only to be surprised by her approach. </p><p>“I need your help,” she said. </p><p>“Of course,” I answered, hoping that it wasn’t something too important, which was less about fearing some hard work, and more about the fear of solving her problems openly, therefore blocking the System returns. </p><p>“It’s a simple thing, but very important. I want you to watch a talisman, and light a firework if that talisman is overwhelmed,” she explained. I looked at her questioningly. She continued. “I need to leave with the Queen for a couple of hours. We’re just going to check a couple things. It’s more of a precaution than anything.” </p><p>I made sure to look worried. “I … May I ask a question first?” She nodded. “What exactly is down there?” I asked. Her reluctance to speak was clear. “I just want to understand my responsibility better.” </p><p>She sighed. “You’re right…” she muttered, but still, she didn’t talk immediately. “There’s something locked there, something that needs to lay undisturbed. I —  her Highness needs to maintain its protections. It’s one of her missions as a cultivator.” </p><p>“And, how about this curse effect? Was that supposed to exist?” </p><p>“Somewhat, but the effect would be far weaker, not enough to harm a mortal if they hadn’t been living here for years. Unfortunately, the protections failed, which resulted in her injuries.”  </p><p>I wanted to ask whether they were damaged or sabotaged, but ultimately, I didn’t want to do anything that might hurt my Freeloader status. I had already pushed my luck with that medicine delivery, but luckily, hiding the true difficulty of it prevented her from treating me differently.  </p><p>Still, I was curious about her answer, so I asked that question indirectly instead. “Was she breaking through a new realm when the accident happened?” I asked. Her face tensed, but she still nodded reluctantly. “Unlucky,” I commented, doing my best to sound like a naive fighter who could never imagine a betrayal. </p><p>“Yes, unlucky,” she said, her tone enough to confirm my guess. Someone had sabotaged her deliberately. “However, don’t worry about it. Her Highness already improved its protections. Nothing will happen in a few hours.”  </p><p>I shrugged, accepting her argument. However, the fact that I had no fear about what lay underneath helped that. </p><p>My presence here was certainly risky, but my visit to the cultivator market showed that, for someone who had no cultivator family or sect, there was no such thing as absolute safety, only degrees of danger. </p><p>Even the Freeloader System didn’t change that. </p><p>“Is there anything I can do in case of a problem?” I asked. </p><p>“No, just send an alarm,” she said.  “Now that she recovered, her Highness is capable of handling any problems until the formation master arrives.” Then, she looked at the window worriedly. “We need to leave, be careful,” she said, and stepped outside. </p><p>Amusingly, a figure actually jumped down from the upstairs window. I fell on my knees to the figure as per the local custom, which nodded. It was fortunate, because I could never hide my amused glare, and it would be hard to explain to Aisnam why I was grinning like a loon in front of ‘the Queen’, which was actually some kind of pupped she dragged with her Qi. </p><p>Not a particularly well-made one either. It certainly explained why ’the  Queen’ chose to jump out of the window rather than use the stairs. She expected the darkness to hide the coarse nature of the puppet. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said to myself with a chuckle once they went far enough. I was glad for the effort,  as it showed that,  even after recovering, Aisnam wanted to maintain her fake identity to interact with me. </p><p>There was only one inconvenient point about the identity. As the supposed personal maid of the Queen, she couldn’t show that she was rich, therefore, I didn’t expect any expensive gifts to come my way. Still, I didn’t plan on confronting it. I would be screwed if she decided to change things. </p><p>And, while money and gifts from her would be useful, nothing compared to the value of the Qi I received from her.  </p><p>Ultimately, I was happy to be her secret boy toy. Even if I decided to confront her, I would do so after the visit of the formation master, which didn’t feel like it was particularly near. </p><p>I wanted to see if I could get a lesson or two out of pity. </p><p>However, that was for the future. Since I couldn’t leave, I decided to use the chance to go upstairs, and check what she had, and more importantly, what she lacked. </p><p>In a sense, reverse-theft. </p><p>I might not give them directly, but luckily, I had the identity of a mysterious apothecary ally, who might decide to give her a few rewards. Of course, this time, I couldn’t confront her directly. I wasn’t sure if I could trick her now that she had recovered.  </p><p>I might have tricked the cultivators back in the cultivation market, but back then, none of them were invested enough to actually discover my identity. And, none of them were as familiar with my body as Aisnam, which only increased the chances I could be discovered. </p><p>A new method was necessary. </p><p>I was careful as I climbed the stairs, avoiding several traps, some ordinary,  some talismans. Luckily, none of those traps were actually new,  showing that she trusted me not to go upstairs. </p><p>I might have felt guilty if it wasn’t for her own good in the most literal sense possible. </p><p>However, once I was upstairs, I wasn’t able to find much. Almost nothing. The only positive was the Qi in the room. It was rich, pure, and dense, an excellent cultivation environment, especially with the walls layered with protection charms to keep it so. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was completely useless to me. Even if I wanted to create some more talismans, I could easily create a copy of the environment in the secret tunnel thanks to the dense Qi. </p><p>Other than that, every precious thing in the room was related to talismans. She had a stack of talisman paper — which could be useful, but not worth the effort —  an ink bottle, and a brush that looked like it was about to fall off in pieces. There were no spirit stones, no incredible weapon, not even a few potted spirit plants to radiate Qi to make the room. </p><p>The talismans were the only thing of actual value. Some of them were on her desk, stacked, ready to be used. The others were set up in a careful arrangement. Cleansing talismans pulled the Cursed Qi in the houses, a pattern of protection talismans kept them in place, and the purification charms converted them into pure Qi. </p><p>They were completely useless to me, as they were the only things I didn’t lack. </p><p>I examined her desk suspiciously, wondering if there was a secret compartment or something, but I decided against trying to find anything. </p><p>It was too risky. </p><p>Instead, I returned, waiting for Aisnam to return. </p><p>I wanted to ask her some questions about what was going on in Markas. </p><p><br></p>",

Doing so often triggered a devastating retaliation.

She would be just as capable, and angrier because someone dared to attack her during her time of rest. </p><p>No, I had a different plan in mind than attacking her.

Who would dare to flirt with the Lady of Destruction aggressively, knowing that a wrong step might result in the decimation of the building they were in, and possibly a few surrounding ones? </p><p>Me, as it turned out… Worse, even as I tried to come up with a way to arrange a meeting, I wasn’t feeling fear like a normal person was supposed to be feeling, but arousal. </p><p>The idea of receiving another lap dance from her, this time with the full awareness of her identity, was too tempting. Tempting enough to make me shiver even as I turned on her social media — who had been helpfully identified by Emily the last night, before I realized her true identity. </p><p>Ordinarily, identifying where she lived from her social media accounts was supposed to be easy … but, a more detailed examination of the details showed that most of them were fakes. Good fakes, excellent even, but I felt like they were made by a very skilled individual and limited hardware rather than an organization with cutting-edge computers. There were too many small details that would have been fixed otherwise. </p><p>Of course, when I said very good, I meant it. I would have never pinned them as fakes without my power. </p><p>Still, it was my first real clue about her current establishment. It implied that she wasn’t here on behalf of a large guild, or a government organization of similar stature. </p><p>My next action, pin down the real photos she had shared from the city, and search for a pattern. The fake photos went back for about four months, while her real photos started just a week ago. Meaning, they had been planning for that for a long time. </p><p>I wondered whether her real photos were a very clever bait, or just her arrogance. From any other undercover operator, it would inevitably be the former, but she had a reputation for arrogance. I could easily imagine her ignoring the reasonable advice of others in her team and posting some additional photos. Nothing that I had seen during her attempt at my bar suggested anything else. </p><p>And, I saw a lot. </p><p>Of course, while it was an arrogant move, I couldn’t blame her too much. With her power set, she had the ability to be arrogant. So, rather than wasting my time analyzing her mentality, I started to pin down every photo she had shared on a city map, and tag them based on the time of the day and other factors, trying to create a pattern. </p><p>I didn’t ask Emily, because I didn’t want her to realize I was looking into her further. Ironically, it was because of her impulsive decision to steal the confidential files of her guide. She was starting to act recklessly to prove herself, and I didn’t want her to repeat that with someone who could throw buildings with her mind. </p><p>Also, there was a little trick I used that Emily couldn’t replicate, at least not easily. I mapped the timeline not by the timeline of the photos, but based on the position of the natural light. It was surprisingly challenging to do for the photos that were taken inside, some even requiring overdriving my power momentarily. </p><p>As a consequence, it took quite some time, but I was able to create a rough timeline of her movements. Her early morning photos, taken in a number of cafes, gave me a good idea of where she lived. </p><p>A neighborhood at the edge of the city. Not exactly an affluent location, but not a ghetto either. It was not a place where a rich girl — as her cover story implied — would live, which seemed like an interesting oversight. </p><p>So, either her actual residence and cover residence were separate, or she couldn’t afford an expensive house … two different situations, with two wildly different implications for the organization that supported her mission. </p><p>Another detail I could discover later. For the moment, I continued to map her daily movements with an expertise that would make a stalker die of jealousy. Certainly, something to be proud of, right? </p><p>Once that was done, I started working on arranging the ideal way to ‘accidentally’ encounter her. One good thing about my current task, the Syndicate was aware of her presence, so I could play my plans in a straightforward manner, and meet her as the dubious bar owner. </p><p>Without her powers, I might have been afraid of bringing the Syndicate’s attention to her, but with them — even if they were weaker — there were no risks. Also, even if there was, from the way she moved around the city, the Syndicate had many ways of finding her that didn’t rely on following me. </p><p>She wasn’t exactly subtle in maintaining her cover. </p><p>My first step, selecting a wardrobe. I wasn’t under the impression that I was a great handsome man. Even my complicated and impressive love life didn’t change that fact. Emily was attracted to me because of her repressed feelings, and Tara was a submissive who wanted someone to control her. </p><p>As for Blue Princess — her real name still a mystery — she was clearly overtaken by the illicit nature of the situation, and then lost control as the arousal overcame her common sense. Meaning, she reacted well to the idea of a bad boy. </p><p>The idea of wearing a gaudy leather jacket to complete the sensation with the bike was tempting, but I chose against it. Instead, I deliberately wore a simpler set. Still a leather jacket and shirt combo, but kept both more utilitarian and understated, completing it with jeans. </p><p>Then, I strapped a combat knife around my ankle, and put a shoulder holster that would keep the gun hidden. Having two functional weapons turned my bad-boy disguise far more realistic. I thought about maybe acquiring a more destructive set of equipment, but I decided against it. </p><p>Too much, and I stopped being a bad boy and turned into a gun nut. </p><p>Then, there was one last touch. I went downstairs and found Tara. “How do I look?” </p><p>“A-amazing, sir,” she whispered, her blush tempting. Too bad my mission was vital. Still, I had time for a quick kiss. I leaned forward for a taste of her lips … which turned into hot and heavy. </p><p>“Unfortunately, I need to leave,” I said, then gave her the usual set of instructions about security. Once she went back to cleaning, I looked at the bar mirror to wipe off her lipstick … but my hand stopped halfway as an idea hit. I still wiped it off, but softer than I initially planned, making sure I left some residue that would be noticed by a careful eye. </p><p>A nice little challenge for her. I thought about another lipstick mark … but I decided against it. I needed to see her reaction to a subtler bait first. </p><p>With everything done, I rode my bike toward where I hoped to find her. She didn’t share any recent photos, but her pattern suggested a general location, which then could be turned into an ‘accidental’ encounter. </p><p>Then, I rode my bike. I didn’t have a game plan about how to play it once we met … I would have to play by ear based on her reaction. After all, she couldn't believe that it was actually a coincidence. </p><p>Or, she might realize that I actually tracked her and engineered an encounter. </p><p>Luckily, the latter was still acceptable. After all, I was supposed to be the bad boy criminal … and, a little stalking was certainly acceptable. </p><p>And, if I miscalculated … at least her reputation was about wanton destruction, and not murder… </p>",

    "content": "<p>An hour later, I was playing with a small bag of clear-cut, polished diamonds, their general size and clarity putting the total market value somewhere around a million. Not exactly a small payout. </p><p>It was the second time I exerted a staggering amount of money from the Syndicate, but this time, it was even more of a troubling issue. The previous time, it was merely a gift to make sure I wouldn’t attack them. Considering I lacked both the capability and the intent to actually attack them, not exactly a difficult trade. </p><p>This time, I had just promised them that I would distract the Lady of Destruction from their operation. Of course, they didn’t know the true identity of her, thinking that they were just dealing with ordinary undercover agents poking around. It was more about controlling the situation than feeling any danger, while also testing my attitudes. </p><p>I gave them exactly what they wanted. </p><p>My hope was that he had been distracted by my preferred method of payment. Diamonds were hardly the most liquid form of wealth. Even without a serial number, they were not completely untraceable. Converting them took time, and also opportunity. </p><p>However, they were also far too portable compared to their value. Paper money was too bulky to bring around unnoticed, and gold was too heavy for an equal value. Both required a briefcase at a minimum, and once detected, they were extremely suspicious.</p><p>There weren’t a lot of excuses for walking around a million in cash. </p><p>Diamonds, on the other hand, were a good method for that. Also, they were a good method for a local villain to steal some from his mysterious boss. The old man was happy to bribe me like that, as not only it helped our relationship — at least on the surface — but also gave him an advantage over me. I did my best to look like it was going to be a payment to me. </p><p>Which meant he could use that to snitch me to my — imaginary — boss. </p><p>I was happy that I gave them a fake leverage, but that didn’t solve my overall somber mood. What they were doing in that warehouse was that they were willing to pay me another million just for me to distract the ordinary undercover agents of an unknown organization. Yes, it was technically a bribe for me, but still, the operation had to be worth it. </p><p>What they were doing there, and why they chose to pay me all that money rather than moving to another base. Even more, they had already tried to attack me twice, both methods suspiciously lethal. </p><p>My phone buzzed, breaking my thoughts. Emily had just sent me the first set of reports as I asked, including one on the ‘ordinary’ agent in question, all in an encrypted, password-protected file. </p><p>I unlocked the files and started reading. It didn’t take long for my eyes to widen. Not because of any immediate discovery, but the source of information itself. </p><p>They were marked with the watermarks of the Giant Force; the old national guild that had shattered and split … and Emily worked for one of the offshoots. </p><p>Someone was being naughty … and not the usual, revealing photos way. </p><p>I sighed even as I sent her a quick message of thanks, but said nothing else. I wanted to admonish her for the risk she took … but I was hardly the poster child of safety. Instead, I made a note to talk about her exact approach later face to face. Hopefully, the fact that the reports belonged to the now-defunct Giant Force rather than the current incarnation meant that the security wasn’t as tight, and she stole it successfully. </p><p>And, I could do nothing if she was caught. It was a problem for the future. </p><p>I turned my attention to the report she had prepared. As I read, my frustration with the risk she took lessened even more. The Giant Force reports might be a few years old, but every report they had on the national supers was shockingly detailed in a way public information she collected earlier could never match. </p><p>It wasn’t her fault. Internet might be a treasure trove for her to pick easily, but it was hard to find special recordings of a hero’s attack taken by cloaked drones, taken in infrared, magnetic mapping, x-ray, and a dozen other esoteric method that I didn’t even know existed, followed by analysis from experts. </p><p>It was shocking how much information a national guild could access. Though, I didn’t even want to imagine how much money they spent on those reports. Not a lot of organizations could afford it. For example, I doubted that the New Giant Force could achieve even a fraction of it … if they could, they would have already revealed my lies. </p><p>The only problem with the reports was that they were dated, which meant not only they didn’t include a lot of heroes and villains that had risen to prominence lately, but the ones that existed were significantly lacking. It was worst for the heroes that were tech-based, as their load out constantly evolved. </p><p>As for the target of my research, it wasn’t as bad. She was included, though, at that time, she was a local rookie who was identified as a potential target of interest, which limited the details of the reports. She didn’t have her dubious nickname back then.</p><p>Still, she wasn’t a tech-based hero, meaning the recordings of her power should hold … well, at least somewhat. My own experience suggested that other powers could change and get overpowered as needed, but it gave me some kind of basis. </p><p>Not that it helped much. Her power was strong enough to devastate a city block at once, but it wasn’t what made her scary. No, there were many such heroes and even more villains that could cause bigger devastation at will. </p><p>The biggest advantage she had was her ability to destroy the locations while keeping people safe. Even villains were afraid of using their powers fully, knowing that the higher the civilian kill count, the harder they would get targeted. A few accidental deaths were fine, but a few hundred was a good way to be hunted by more militant heroes. Go over a thousand, and even other villains might take a shot — for the inevitable bounty if nothing else. </p><p>It meant they couldn’t match her destructive output. </p><p>The assessment of her powers turned even grimmer as I continued to read the detailed report, which included combat footage, rating her offensive and defensive reaction speed, as well as her ability to handle the damage. The verdict, she could react to an attack quickly enough that even a sniper rifle didn’t have a chance. They theorized that she had some kind of transparent and intangible field that turned active against higher forces. Similarly, the laser cannon I had in my possession was meaningless. There were visuals of her shrugging even bigger attacks. </p><p>Of course, the more I read, the more curious I got. Why suddenly switch from being one of the most successful — if infamous — heroines that could fight to an undercover agent? It was a mystery, one that I needed to solve for my well-being. </p><p>So, I focused on the other public news compiled by Emily, refusing the temptation to overcharge my power to reach a quick conclusion. I didn’t know when I would need it, and there was no need to take such a risk. </p><p>Instead, I went through every news, report, and public appearance … until a pattern started to become clear. The frequency of her appearance started to fluctuate about two years ago, getting worse and worse until she disappeared almost completely. There was a lot of gossip and guesses about what drove it, but the general idea was about her inability to control her destruction. </p><p>A careful analysis of every appearance, the destruction she created, and other factors led me to another conclusion. It was a subtle pattern, one that I caught only because of the synergy between Emily’s power and mine, and even then, I would have missed it without the report she stole from her guild. </p><p>The pattern of destruction and her disappearances matched. It was a very subtle shift, but analyzing the events just before her disappearances showed her power functioning worse than the peak the Giant Force’s analysis had shown, only to replenish. </p><p>Yet, every time she disappeared, it lasted longer, and the cycle of weakening got tighter. </p><p>It was a shocking conclusion, because I didn’t even know such a thing was possible. Her power was weakening. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel a chill. As much as I hated my power when I first realized I was a super, at this point, I was relying on it too much. The idea of it suddenly weakening was not a fun one. </p><p>Suddenly, I had another reason to dig into the situation of my errant spy. I needed to understand what was going on there. Not that I needed an additional reason, as solving the problem of her appearance was a literal life-and-death situation for me. </p><p>Still…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Goodbye, you crazy old man,” I muttered as I looked at the funeral pyre under the light of dawn, ignoring the wetness of my face as I turned my back. The funeral was complete. All that remained was for the wind to spread his ashes. “I hope you will be comfortable in Pluto’s halls.” </p><p>I walked away, exhausted. Inevitable, as I had spent all night traveling, first on a cart, then on horseback, and the multiple attacks from the wild beasts didn’t make the journey any easier. Then, I reacted to one of the attacks late, ending the life of my poor mount. </p><p>The rest of the way, I walked until I arrived at a hidden valley I had discovered during one of my hunting trips, and worked hard to cut a few trees and create a funeral pyre. It was a beautiful valley. A good resting spot for the old man. </p><p>I walked away, ignoring the desire to rest. It looked like my trick to avoid search parties had worked well enough, but I didn’t want to push my luck too much. Scipio family might be an exiled patrician family, but it was still strong enough to conduct a detailed search of the surrounding area. </p><p>Then, there was the mysterious sorcerer I angered. </p><p>The funeral had already taken the time I needed to get away. I might have managed to mislead the search efforts until now, but that didn’t mean I was safe. Even if the guard didn’t blab about my method of departure, sooner or later, they would discover the cart, giving them a direction to search. </p><p>I didn’t have the luxury of sleeping. </p><p>However, before leaving, I needed to replenish my mana. The overnight trip had resulted in my reserves draining completely. Just a day ago, it would have been an insurmountable problem under my current constraints, requiring weeks to properly solve. </p><p>Instead, I pressed several spots on the box in my hand, and once again looked at the dragon heart. This time, I removed it. I was so far away from the civilization that I dared to use it without getting caught. There was still some risk of being detected, of course, but it was better than camping here for weeks, hoping to recover. </p><p>The dragon heart was on my palm, its crystalline structure glistening under the light of dawn with a confusing set of colors that would have revealed its extraordinary nature even without its magical presence, intense even before awakening it. </p><p>A caress of my blade, and a drop of my blood landed on the dragon heart. Its colors turned ethereal, mana flaring thick. </p><p>I closed my eyes and tightened my grip as I absorbed the mana; for the first time in my life, without limit. I felt the mana gather and settle around the four elemental cores. Rather than clamping around them to control their growth, I let them absorb the excess mana. </p><p>I drank until my reserves were complete, and my elemental cores started to grow rapidly. I focused on the mana in my body, channeling the excess toward the cores, letting them grow bigger and bigger, with no outlet. It was the nature of an apprentice mage. The elemental cores could devour mana, but they were unable to let it out unless indirectly. </p><p>For that reason, apprentice mages were unable to use external spells. </p><p>When the dragon heart finally stopped spitting out mana, I was already feeling bloated. Even with years of training and preparation and infinite mana, breaking to the next order was not something that could be done easily. </p><p>After one last bow, I departed from the valley. My plan was to walk the whole day, maybe even risk another night's travel, until I could put some distance. The farther I was away from my uncle’s influence, the better. </p><p>However, that plan died a quick death when I saw a search party at a distance, going through the forest. They were hunters, probably locals considering the way they dressed, with no mage among them. Technically, I had no reason to believe that they had been looking for me. I didn’t leave any track, and even if I did, they wouldn’t have just sent a team of ordinary hunters to search for me. </p><p>Yet, it was too much of a coincidence to have a search party in the middle of nowhere just when I was returning. </p><p>Curious, I approached them even as I used Fire to enhance my gaze, reading their lips from a distance. It was not perfect, but it was enough to catch some key phrases they had been repeating. Phrases like patricide, Scipio, murder, and ten thousand denarii reward.</p><p>Putting the pieces together was not too hard. It was obvious that my uncle had decided to frame me for the death of my grandfather. I would have called it smart, but it was an obvious strategy. What surprised me was the process. </p><p>First, the prize. Ten thousand denarii was a shocking reward. For most plebs, enlisting in the army represented enough money to change their fate, enough for them to dedicate fifteen years of their lives. Yet, A legionnaire only received two hundred and fifty denarii salary for a year. Even adding the retirement reward and the occasional loot from the victorious battles, it would be impossible for them to get ten thousand. </p><p>Ten thousand denarii was not a reward my uncle could afford, not unless he borrowed even more money. And, even if he did, he lacked the connections to spread the news of the reward with such speed. Then, I continued to read their lips, learning a little more. </p><p>It looked like that reward was not for catching me, but for reporting my location to the military. Even more troubling. Not only did it mean they were willing to spend shocking amounts of money, but also they were connected with the military. </p><p>It looked like his mysterious guest was even more connected than I expected. </p><p>Troubling. </p><p>I had been initially planning to disappear into the wilderness and use the dragon heart to reach the third order before finding a way. But, if the scraps of conversation I managed to extract were correct, that would be tricky. </p><p>Since the sorcerer was putting so much effort into catching me, I must have angered him seriously. I wondered if it was just a grudge for killing his men, or somehow, he got an inkling that I had the dragon heart with me. </p><p>Considering the way they had been searching the house, they were clearly looking for something. They either knew about the crystal, or looking for something else that had been destroyed in the fire. </p><p>Either way, one thing was certain. I made an enemy out of a sorcerer, one that was connected enough to trigger a wide-area manhunt. It meant, my aim to find a remote village and train slowly was out. I had to stay in the wilderness for a long while … </p><p>“What would have you recommended, old man?” I said as I looked toward the distant valley. Living in the wilderness felt like a good idea at first … but I was afraid of the methods of a sorcerer. Worse, I erased my tracks, but no such method was perfect. Through a combination of hunting dogs and esoteric spells, eventually, they would detect my location. </p><p>No one could hide forever. </p><p>“Being predictable is the biggest sin in a fight,” I answered my own question, feeling the echoes of his gruff tone. It had been one of his favorite sayings, though often delivered when I was on the ground, panting after another painful blow. </p><p>He had been a sadistic trainer, but it was hard to argue with the result. I had no doubt that, without the torture that he claimed to be training, I would have been overwhelmed by the idea of the hunt that was led by an unknown sorcerer and contributed by the local garrison. </p><p>Instead, I went through the options calmly. My biggest chance to get away before they could establish a blockade. I could either go North, and disappear behind the Hadrian wall. Even a sorcerer wouldn’t be able to find me easily, especially since legions couldn’t help him without triggering a war with the highland tribes. The tribes might be barbarians, but they had their own strong points. </p><p>Otherwise, the Republic wouldn’t have halted the invasion halfway and built a wall instead. </p><p>However, I didn’t choose that. I was afraid that, it would be the predictable path. Instead, I decided to go south, to Londinium. My target was the port. </p><p>There was no harm in traveling for a while. Sooner or later, the sorcerer would return to his organization, and the search would die off. </p><p>But, my uncle would be still in the compound so I could ask some questions…</p><p>And more… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Leaving the compound was a challenge. One that was bigger than entering, even with all servants busy with the feast. I could probably use the tunnel, but that would mean I had to run away alone. Instead, I decided to go for one of the servant entrances, and picked one of the carts. </p><p>I ignored the unceasing laughter coming from the main residence, even my uncle’s distinctive laugh. Knowing him, his guest told a joke, and my uncle was laughing loud enough to show his bootlicker capabilities. </p><p>I wanted to go there. Go and have a ‘talk’ with my uncle about how to treat the deceased. Anger burned in my chest, making it harder to hold the elements suppressed. The temptation to go and interrupt the feast was strong. </p><p>I wondered if I could have refused it without the intimidating presence of the sorcerer, one that would have killed me easily even if I managed to ambush them. </p><p>Instead, I quickly set up one of the supply carts and hid my grandfather’s body at the back. </p><p>Then, I hitched one of the fastest horses to the cart, hoping that the guards would mistake it for an inferior one. I needed more than my two legs to get away from the compound. With everything done, I took the driver's seat, and went to the gate. </p><p>The gate was supposed to have at least four guards, but there was only one. He was one of my uncle’s hires, and ordinarily, not trusted enough to be given the gate duty. I wondered if more experienced guards were helping the servants, or busy with the search.</p><p>Ironically, looking for me. </p><p>Or maybe, it was linked to the sudden change of the guard leadership. Some of the guards, including the old commander, had been with my grandfather for a long time, too much to accept what was going on. They were either fired or dealt with permanently. </p><p>Either way, it worked to my benefit. Dealing with a guard was easier than four, especially since I didn’t have the luxury of ambushing them. Even without my fiery gift, they would eventually discover the deaths of their soldiers. I hoped that the fire would look like a fight that went out of control. </p><p>Once that happened, I hoped that they would believe that I was still in the compound. And, if I was lucky, the search would discover the tunnel — as I didn’t bother to hide it. By discovering it, they would search me in the wrong direction. </p><p>That meant I couldn’t kill the guard. </p><p>“What are you doing here?” the guard interrupted me as I drove the cart toward the gate. “No one could leave the compound at night.” </p><p>“Master ordered me to go and purchase some more wine. Apparently, we’re running out of the one that our valuable guest enjoyed.” The guard looked stubborn. “I can go and bring Master here. I’m sure he’ll be happy that I interrupted the feast to explain himself to you,” I added. </p><p>Ordinarily, I abhorred the new guards my uncle picked for their lack of discipline and general stupidity, but this time, it worked to my benefit. It helped that my uncle was petty enough to punish them for following the rules if it made his life inconvenient. </p><p>Not exactly an ideal patriarch … or an ideal son, for that matter, I thought as I drove the cart out of the compound. “Don’t you think so, old man,” I muttered sadly as I threw a glance back, doing my best to confuse a set of emotions. </p><p>“Deep breaths, control your emotions, or they control you,” I said, repeating the words that he repeated to me many times, but I doubted that even he could imagine I would use that to smuggle his body out of his own compound. </p><p>I had to control them, because I couldn’t afford losing control of them. Not when it would interfere with the control over my magic. I couldn’t afford that, because I was too close to the compound to successfully avoid the attention of a sorcerer. </p><p>Taking deep breaths didn’t work. I needed a distraction, so I pulled out the box, curious about exactly what was in it. I couldn’t guess, because even after being trained by him, I still didn’t know exactly why he had been training me that hard. </p><p>There had been days I thought that he only trained me to annoy and torture my uncle, who he always mocked as weak blood. Other times, I believed it was a way to lash against his illness, a way to relive his glory through an heir. </p><p>Then, there were days I thought more … almost affection, at least what passed for it in his warped mind. </p><p>I was afraid that the answer had been gone with the burnt letter. Another crime I could lay on my pathetic uncle … not that he needed help with any additional crimes, not when it was almost certain that he had a hand in his own father’s death. Directly or indirectly, I didn’t particularly care. </p><p>Either way, I would make him pay…</p><p>“Focus, Marcus. Don’t disappoint the old man,” I muttered as I clamped on the elements rotating in my heart. Trying to distract myself, I touched the box. It had a mechanical lock, but I pressed three locations at the same time, and the box flipped open. I looked inside. </p><p>And slammed it shut in panic. </p><p>I had to. I couldn’t afford any hint of its presence let out, because its content was enough to trigger a manhunt. It was one of the most precious magical items that had been even discovered. </p><p>A small crystal, barely bigger than a pebble. A treasure that might trigger a war. </p><p>A dragon heart. </p><p>I took a deep, trying to control my heartbeat. Why did my grandfather own a Dragon Heart? Why did he keep it hidden? Was the presence of the sorcerer in any way linked to the existence of the Dragon Heart, or it was just a coincidence. </p><p>It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that dragon hearts were some of the most valuable treasures in the world, for one very simple reason. They generated mana without limit. Even the weakest, the most broken piece was enough to elevate a slave into a noble, just by giving </p><p>I knew nothing about their origin, or why they were named such. Some actually believed that they came from dragons, but considering there was no evidence of the existence of the dragons, it was hard to be sure. Maybe dragons actually existed along with the gods, or maybe those crystals were just natural wonders that were linked to the legends of nonexistent beasts … but ultimately, I didn’t care. </p><p>What I cared about was their function of generating mana without limit, mana that could be absorbed by humans. </p><p>Finding appropriate sources of mana has always been one of the biggest challenges of growing as a mage. Mana existed all around us, and it was possible to collect it by meditating. However, the amount of mana that could be gathered like that was minuscule. Some unique locations had more mana, but those locations were either under the control of the various forces, or wild areas with enough magical beasts to threaten even the strongest mage. </p><p>There were various objects and materials that contained mana, and some were even fit for human use without dangerous drawbacks, but they were rare, expensive … and most importantly, limited. </p><p>Dragon Hearts had no such constraints. Just let a drop of blood activate, and it would provide endless mana to quickly raise a force of mages. </p><p>“No doubt you insisted that I stayed as a four-element mage despite the cost, old man,” I muttered dazedly. “You had such a treasure hidden.” </p><p>It was a treasure indeed. I could bring it to Rome and gift it to one of the Consuls, and I would get a valuable political post as a result. Or, I could gift it to one of the stronger Patrician houses, and get their support to elevate myself. </p><p>Or, I could leave the Republic, go to Constantinople, to the court of the Emperor, and receive a small city for my contribution… </p><p>Though, those were nothing more than a passing fancy. For me, the dragon heart represented one thing above any other. Revenge. I couldn’t take down a sorcerer even with a dragon heart, but that didn’t matter. </p><p>He couldn’t stick around forever. And, even with dragon heart, I needed some time to reach the third order, and more time to settle properly. Staying away for a while didn’t matter. Ultimately, revenge was a dish that best served cold… </p><p>Well, not so cold, I corrected as behind me, the night sky had suddenly gained a red color. My little trap had finally been triggered, even more brightly than I expected. It looked like Lion’s Bane worked even better than I hoped. </p><p>Ruining my uncle’s party was a good first step. One of many I needed to develop. </p><p>But, first, I had a funeral to hold. I continued to move with the cart in the middle of the night, focusing on the dreams of revenge. </p><p>It was less painful than the alternative. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Not feeling the presence of my grandfather was a big deal, though it was about his illness, which had shattered his inherent control over his magic. Any other mage would keep their elements in a resting state, which meant, that while they were possible to be detected by others, it required some effort.</p><p>In my current state of clamping down on my magic, I  couldn’t sense the presence of a mage unless they were casting a spell, but my grandfather’s situation differed. His presence was always active, like he was about to cast a spell. </p><p>Even with my own elements suppressed, I should be able to feel his presence.    </p><p>“Maybe he decided to join the feast,” I muttered, despite knowing that it was definitely not the case. My grandfather abhorred such crowds even before his illness had worsened. He would never go there. </p><p>I loosened my tight control over the elements, which allowed me to expand my senses. I would be able to sense exactly where he was supposed to be. </p><p>I couldn’t sense his magical presence anywhere, which meant he was not in the compound. And, with the current state of his illness, he wouldn’t go out…And, even if he did, he would have sealed his residence.  </p><p>I focused on my senses, letting the slightest sliver of fire enhance my senses even further. I should have felt the presence of my grandfather if he was around the compound, even if he was miles away. Instead, I felt the presence of people inside. At least for … maybe even more, but at least two of them were mages, and it made counting a challenge. </p><p>Worse, by expanding my senses, I noticed the presence of many other mages in the feast, barely noticeable. At least a dozen, maybe more, but one thing prevented me from counting. Another magical presence, strong enough to dim the others, mana dancing around him like a storm. </p><p>I never felt such a presence before, but I didn’t need to. Like most of the tricks I knew, the improved detection had been taught to me by my grandfather. He had educated me on the differences between normal people, first-order learners, second-order apprentice mages, and third-order mages; all of them I had felt many times.</p><p>But there was one he had educated on me, one that I had never felt before. A fourth-order existence. </p><p>A sorcerer. </p><p>I tensed. A sorcerer represented the peak of a mage. A man who could rule the elements like soldiers, turning them into one-man armies that could threaten actual armies. However, they were also rare, particularly in a backwater colony like Britannia. Commanders of the legions and the governor — both required to be sorcerers by law — and maybe the patriarchs of a few strongest noble families. </p><p>In the whole of Britannia, I doubted that there were more than a dozen sorcerers. And, now, one of them was in the compound, entertained by my uncle. </p><p>The safe thing was to turn back. Not just get away from the residence, but leave the compound behind, disguise myself as a hopeless pleb, and get passage to the mainland, draw my path. I had planned it many times, since I was eleven years old, crying after a painful training session that ended up with five broken bones: four fingers and a toe. </p><p>The old bastard had always been a harsh trainer.  </p><p>And, here I was, prioritizing that same old man’s fate rather than my life. Something was wrong with me. </p><p>I suppressed the elemental cores into my chest once, tightened my grip on my spear, and stepped into the residence from one of the side entrances. The first thing I noticed was the broken furniture. Every single piece had been broken with no exception, but it didn’t feel like an act of anger. Even the wooden panels of the walls had been ripped off.  </p><p>No, someone had gone through them systematically. Someone was looking for something. </p><p>I ignored the rabble as I moved forward, crouching down as I passed every single room, trying to stay away from the four. Their systemic approach suggested professionals, which was good, as it meant their approach was predictable. I easily avoided their presence by listening to the sound of crashes. </p><p>And, arrived at my destination, my grandfather’s room.</p><p>“No,” I whispered as I saw the unmoving figure, lying in the remains of the broken bed, discarded just like broken furniture. That was all I said as I took a deep breath, desperately trying to keep myself from touching the elements as my hand tightened over. </p><p>The merciless trainer that turned my life into a nightmare was nowhere to be seen. All that remained was an old man, his clothes messy enough to show that his body had been searched just like his room had been. </p><p>I took another deep breath, trying to control my anger from spiraling. The old man might be a merciless trainer who physically hurt me more than anyone, but also he forged the man I was rather than discarding me. Why he did, I had no idea …</p><p>Then, I looked at the wall, where his weapon was supposed to be resting, but only had an empty holder. A weapon that I was never allowed to touch. </p><p>The Spear of Scipio, one of the legendary Patrician weapons, is the most valuable thing the Scipio family owned. More valuable than the whole compound and all the farming land combined. There was only one reason that a family in exile was allowed to hold such a weapon. </p><p>It was locked into the bloodline of our family. Only a legitimate male member of the family could carry the weapon. The legitimate thing was as important as the blood, determined by a bestowment ritual that could only be cast on a baby. </p><p>It was why I was never allowed to touch it. I could never use it. </p><p>My anger wasn’t about a stolen opportunity. It meant my uncle had been in the room to pick up the weapon. Yet, he left his own father on the ground, discarded just like the broken furniture that surrounded him. </p><p>Then, I looked at a deep hole in the broken wall. The secret compartment. Empty, bereft of the letter and the sealed box that was supposed to be holding. Two items that my grandfather had left to me in case of an unexpected death, reminded me to never let anyone see. </p><p>Not even my uncle. </p><p>“It looks like you were even more right than you realized, you crazy old man,” I muttered as I wrapped his body with a sheet, then left the room.</p><p>Temporarily, my grip was tightening. </p><p>As I moved forward, I let the fire enhance my senses once more, trailing the locations of the four people walking in the room. In particular, the two mages. As an apprentice mage, I had no chance of taking a mage in a fair fight, let alone two. </p><p>The word fair was the key. </p><p>I approached the first presence, who was too busy examining a broken wall with his magic to pay attention to my approach. A fact that cost him dearly as I approached from behind. Only when I enhanced my muscles with the slightest touch of Earth, did he notice the danger he was in, but it was too late. </p><p>I pressed my hand against his mouth even as I stabbed him from behind with my dagger. He wore no armor, no doubt thinking the compound was safe. I taught him his mistake happily. I searched his body, but the box or the letter was not there. I took his pouch, and his gladius. A distinctive weapon, particularly with the sigil of a snake on its blade, which was not ideal. </p><p>But, it was a better one than my cheap spear, and I didn’t want to risk it. </p><p>I ignored the blood as I chased the other mage, who ended up the exact same way, ambushed to death. I didn’t try to take him prisoner or question him. Trying to do that to a mage was troubling enough even without the presence of a sorcerer.  </p><p>I searched for him as well. It went well. Not only did I find another pouch with enough silver denarii to make my eventual escape much easier, but I also found the sealed box my grandfather left me. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was no letter. </p><p>The other two warriors were together, busy demolishing a new room. They wore armor, but no helmets. I slammed the head of the first one with the back of my new gladius, enough to put him in a daze, then stabbed the other one in the neck.</p><p>Before he could recover, I grabbed the first one on the neck, Earth mana helping me to lift him with ease. “Tell me, what happened to the letter that was with the box?” I said as I raised him. His dazed state helped me.</p><p>“B-burned,” he stammered. I sighed. “P-please don’t kill—” he tried to say.   </p><p>I ignored him. Instead, I went to the kitchen, to the oil barrels, and set them up with some candles. Then, I set a candle in a way that would set them on fire. I picked the longest candle available, which should give me half an hour before it started burning, which would be enough. Then, after some thought, I put the Lion’s Bane into the oil as a nice surprise to the mage who would try to use magic to extinguish the flames. </p><p>Lion’s Bane didn’t play well with magic. </p><p>I changed my bloody clothes with another set … that belonged to my grandfather. Then, I went to the bedroom to pick up my grandfather’s body. </p><p>I had a funeral to hold. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You should get someone to look at that driveway. Parking is a hell. I never had so much trouble parking,” I said the moment I entered and saw Charlie’s worried expression, doing my best to look frustrated. </p><p>“I told you so,” Mark whispered, thinking that it went unnoticed, and Charlie relaxed as well. </p><p>It was a simple trick. From their perspective, I was the classic incompetent middle manager. I played the frustrated card because that required a big and fragile ego. I wasn’t naive enough to think that my ego was not big, but it wasn’t enough to feel a sense of failure if I failed to park a car.</p><p>However, they believed it to be so, which gave a reason for my late appearance. </p><p>“It can be tricky in the dark. I have been meaning to add some extra lights,” Mark answered, quick to create a bogus excuse for me as a professional bootlicker. I kept my disdain hidden. Mark’s attitude rubbed me wrong. It wasn’t so much the lack of a spine, but his utter confidence that he was the smartest person in the room, despite not having a single shred of evidence to back it up.</p><p>I would have enjoyed fooling with his wife even if Tiffany hadn’t been such an absolute redheaded bombshell, with a fun personality to match. </p><p>Charlie was different. I liked the kid enough that, I wouldn’t have messed with him if he didn’t try to follow Mark’s idiotic suggestion and tried to play me. Even then, I probably wouldn’t have been so heavy-handed if he didn’t have a treasure for a fiancee. </p><p>Umi was not only a diamond, but also a raw diamond. Her beauty was already fascinating, and there was a bonus sense of pleasure I got from slowly chipping away her sense of shame and propriety, leaving a striking beauty behind. </p><p>I said nothing else as I approached them, and went over the presentation. It was completely useless, had no actionable items, and carried a lot of idealistic nonsense theories that relied on assumptions that would never work in real life. For any practical purposes, it was completely useless. </p><p>In other words, the perfect corporate presentation. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I said. Mark smiled proudly, while Charlie just nodded, still looking miffed. Considering our last encounter included me ordering his fiancee to remove her underwear while I watched, all the while blaming him for the situation, not shocking. “However, there are still some changes to be made. The second page, for example…” I said, and gave them some corrections.</p><p>As we worked, Umi and Tiffany arrived with some delay. I planned to call them to stop working, but when Tiffany shook her head with a playful gesture, I decided against it. She had a plan. While I had never been much of a follower, Tiffany had proved herself enough. I said nothing as, after the momentary chat, they went upstairs. </p><p>We continued working until the changes started to get overwhelming. It would take hours to fix. A portion of those changes were necessary, but most were just there to create some extra work for them. </p><p>My ego might not be fragile, but I never claimed not to be petty. And, messing with them was a good way to kill some time while waiting for the two. </p><p>The only thing that saved them from a staggering amount of work was the disappearance of Tiffany and Umi didn’t last long. They came down merely fifteen minutes later, having changed significantly. </p><p>Umi was still dressed as a secretary, but she had changed her top to one from Tiffany. It was still a white blouse, but unlike the other one, which had a limit on how sexy it could be considering she actually wore it to the office, it was tight enough to be fit to a stripper, and transparent enough to be classified as erotic rather than suggestive. She still wore her blazer, which blunted the impact. Her nipples stayed hidden, for example. </p><p>But not enough to prevent her fiancee’s frustrated gasp. </p><p>Mark kicked him under the table, reminding him about the ploy they were trying to pull on me for my goodwill, unaware that I had long realized their intention and took far more. He was also unaware that I wouldn’t be willing to extend any favor to him for his beautiful wife’s hard work. </p><p>Tiffany was the one who worked, and she would choose her rewards. And, up to this day, she steadily chose her own benefit over her spineless husband’s career. </p><p>Not that I blamed her, particularly when the only reaction Mark showed when Tiffany walked in was a soft growl of frustration, one that he tried to hide when I glanced at him. For once, I was impressed with him one of his achievements. </p><p>Tiffany was dressed to kill. </p><p>Her outfit was one of a card dealer, the cute bowtie and the distinct sleeveless black velvet vest were recognizable enough. The little green dealer visor her head, along with the cards and chips, further confirmed the nature of the costume. </p><p>Admittedly, they were needed, because she had neglected a very important part of the outfit. Those vests were designed to be worn with a shirt … and a bra. Absent in both, the voluptuous redhead radiated an erotic energy. </p><p>Her tiny plied skirt hardly helped to blunt her sexiness in a way that would make it acceptable for her husband, yet Mark hid his frustration. </p><p>“Hey, honey. I hope the work is over, because I’m ready for the game night you asked from me,” Tiffany said, with a very sharp focus on the last four words. Mark’s eyes widened, showing that he caught that as well. </p><p>I didn’t need to ask about what happened. Mark probably asked her to flirt with me heavy-handedly, using a game night as an excuse … and, considering she looked more regretful than angry, I guessed he wasn’t particularly careful while asking that. </p><p>Angering a redhead was never a good idea.</p><p>“Actually, we still have some —” Mark started. </p><p>“Nonsense. I told you all that’s needed. I trust you to fix the rest,” I said, not bothering to hide my lecherous gaze as I enjoyed Tiffany’s boundless cleavage. They were kind enough to serve, so I would take it. </p><p>Such initiative would be enough to make Mark happy in any situation where his wife wasn’t dressed as a porno version of a casino dealer, but he swallowed his complaints. Charlie threw an incredulous glance at Mark, realizing exactly what he committed by following Mark’s suggestion. </p><p>I would have pitied him, but he ruined that chance earlier in my office. </p><p>“Honey, why don’t you go and pick the drinks from the kitchen,” Tiffany asked. </p><p>“Let me help,” Charlie said as he stood up, frustrated. I would have tried to interfere under different circumstances, but Charlie wore an expression of frustration and anger. Not exactly in the mood where he could convince Umi that they should leave. </p><p>He would try, but he would come too strong, too frustrated, and it would only make Umi more stubborn. With any luck, he might actually try to browbeat her, thinking that she was still the same old meek girl… </p><p>They went out, while Tiffany started to set the table. </p><p>It was shaping out to be an excellent night. </p>",
