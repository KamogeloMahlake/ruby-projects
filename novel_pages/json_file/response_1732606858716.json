    "content": "<p>“You’re talking a lot for a pathetic god of corpses and garbage,” I shouted back, once again using the Dragon Avatar to speak. </p><p>As far as insults were concerned, it wasn’t exactly the most creative one I could come up with, but it still made him attack me with full force. He was already angry after losing two avatars in a row. Insulting to the basis of his existence pushed his anger even further. </p><p>This time, rather than engaging him directly, I dodged the attack and moved toward the center of his domain. “Let’s see how you feel once I start destroying your avatars as well,” he shouted as he turned toward Seldanna. </p><p>Interesting statement, making me wonder whether he even knew he was facing two gods — supposedly — at the same time, or the Eternals hid that particular nugget of information from him. </p><p>Not exactly impossible. </p><p>I didn’t want him tangling with Seldanna. She was inexperienced enough in using her powers that even with her actual body, I wouldn’t expect her to win against another god on neutral ground. And, in the domain of another god, only as an avatar … it would be lucky if she could last a minute. </p><p>Luckily, I had the perfect bait. “I wonder how you’ll feel when I use the breach to dump your Divine Spark into the Primordial Aether,” I shouted as I flew away on my dragon, hoping that the possibility of losing more than a million sparks was enough to galvanize him. </p><p>After all, he had no idea that his Divine Spark was long gone, purified, and some even turned into stats to empower me further. </p><p>“You dare!” he shouted as he immediately changed his direction and started chasing my dragon avatar, the bait working perfectly. A little predictable, but understandable. A million Divine Spark was an impressive amount, particularly considering it had been absorbed perfectly. If he lost it, even capturing two of our avatars wouldn’t make up for it — as Eternals used a very lopsided exchange ratio when it came to trading Divine Spark. </p><p>I made a show of trying to rush toward the breach that his avatar was trying to close, only to be knocked away with every attempt. However, ultimately, it was just a trick to have an excuse to visit every part of his plane, my exaggerated mana attacks giving me to perfect cover to hide my detection spells. </p><p>Maybe I was a bit paranoid, but I wanted to make sure there was no other Eternal presence that could report some of my more suspicious moves. I had already pushed my luck enough with the secrets I revealed, even pushing my fake identity as an Ancient god to the limit. </p><p>Of course, I might have chosen a more reckless strategy if time was working against us, but that was not the case. With every second, his army got smaller while Seldanna continued to expand our nature reserve, creating a bigger hold for life in the domain. </p><p>At the same time, his reckless attacks drained quite a bit of the necrotic mana that was stored in the Aether dimension … while a few secret wards I implemented there worked hard to turn the rest into nature mana in some warded packets, growing stronger with each minute. </p><p>Ready to go off the moment I confirmed the absence of the Eternals. </p><p>Of course, extending the battle meant giving a chance for the Eternals to return, but on that, I was a bit more confident. I had built a layer of detection ward over the planar border, made of tantric mana to make sure it could resist the ravages of Primordial Aether, ready to alert me for their approach. </p><p>And, in Primordial Aether, I was confident I could take any forces they would send to a relatively distant location like ours during an emergency — as far as that word has any meaning with the crazy dimensions of Primordial Aether. </p><p>Pity that I couldn’t say the same for what they could bring to bear outside the main material plane. </p><p>But that was a concern for the far future. </p><p>For now, I just needed to defeat my first true divine enemy, which was a great achievement even if he was completely lacking in any true tactical sense, which was only partially about my secret abilities. He was too used to corpse-wave tactics to develop a habit of reading the enemy tactics. Worse, he was too panicked by the prospect of losing his Divine Spark to even question why I was spending hours repeating the same trick again and again. </p><p>I doubted that it would be the experience when I faced my next divine opponent. The more I fought against him, the more I started to suspect that his strategic ineptitude was one of the reasons the Eternals supported him. </p><p>After all, an unaware puppet was the best one. </p><p>I might have pitied his situation … but necromancers, especially ones that had committed enough massacres to reach the position of divinity — whether or not with the help from the Eternals immaterial. </p><p>Half a day later, I had managed to scour the plane. I destroyed three wards that belonged to Eternals, though they were empty other than some raw resources and a few basic detection wards, clearly functioning more as listening posts and emergency hideouts. </p><p>More importantly, I was confident that I didn’t miss anything else. </p><p>Without a warning, I teleported toward the bordering spot that was still being ravaged by Primordial Aether, a consequence of his split attention and the weakness of his avatar. Without a warning, I appeared next to the avatar, draining it aggressively. </p><p>[+225,918 Purified Spark]</p><p>At the same time, I trigged all the wards I had buried in the Aether dimension. “Now, Seldanna,” I ordered, and she started channeling all the mana she could to the planar border, rapidly turning its structure from necrotic to nature. </p><p>Naturally, that allowed even more Primordial Aether to invade the plane. </p><p>“Please stop, you’re going to destroy everything,” he shouted. “I surrender.” </p><p>I ignored him, or his sudden attempts to escape right into the center of his domain, creating a new dimensional barrier around him with a far smaller domain. </p><p>Even going as far as completely pulling back from the domain, leaving it suddenly ownerless. And, just like that, the speed at Seldanna assimilated the plane hastened immensely, new forests appearing each second. </p><p>“What a disappointing ending,” I murmured. In his haste to protect himself from what he saw as the inevitable destruction of his plane, he had committed the worst mistake a god could commit. He locked himself in a small domain, surrounded by the domain of another divine. </p><p>Essentially, he put himself in the same position as Helga, but in that case, we had driven by a deep calculation based on Helga’s abilities and the unique location of that domain. </p><p>His was fueled by poor strategy and cowardice. I had to admit, it ruined my mood to even banter with him. Instead, I created a thick ward around his domain, one that made sure that he would stay pinned and couldn’t go anywhere. </p><p>Especially since I didn’t use nature mana, which necrotic mana could fight against in equal grounds; but my unique brand of light mana that was empowered with pseudo-HP, which necrotic mana could fight against about as efficiently as dry paper could fight against fire. </p><p>Another silencing ward to keep his pathetic begging hidden, I turned my attention to the rest of the domain. First, to Seldanna. “You can stop,” I called as her avatar appeared next to me. </p><p>“Really. How about you let me take this plane, and we can find another for your angel,” she said. Worse, it wasn’t a demand, but a request while Seldanna did her best to look innocent and vulnerable, her avatar turning into soft, gentle flowers immediately. </p><p>Having a goddess as a lover was amazing … but also came with complications. Buying gifts, for example, was far more difficult. </p><p>“How about I get you a new plane once I understand how the Eternals linked the planes together,” I offered. Which was an unexpected gift from them. With their sudden departure, they didn’t have the time to take back their artifact, giving me a chance to duplicate it. </p><p>Not easily, I guessed, but much better than trying to come up with a method myself. </p><p>“Deal,” she said, her smile pressed against my cheek and disappeared, showing that, she might have exaggerated her displeasure slightly to earn a promise. </p><p>I had to admit, it was well played. She earned herself a punishment with that trick along with her gift — but I doubted that she would dislike it. </p><p>But, that was for the future. I teleported next to her. “Let’s go,” I said, then escorted her to the nature domain. </p><p>And, escorted an unconscious Mariel back. </p><p>It was time to awaken my cute headmistress. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 65    Charisma: 65</p><p>Precision: 65    Perception: 65</p><p>Agility: 65     Manipulation: 65</p><p>Speed: 65       Intelligence: 86</p><p>Endurance: 98      Wisdom: 65}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 938,885}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Now, grab your ankles and stay like that,” her boss said as he took a step forward, caressing her ass as he admired her. Tara was too weak to admit that out loud, but she loved the way his gaze danced on her body when she was dressed like this. </p><p>It helped her to feel less like an impostor, and more like a true, sophisticated city girl. A city girl who decided not to wear any panties just because she felt like it. </p><p>She grabbed her ankles just like he requested, glad that she didn’t have to fake any kind of distress. Her boss already knew about her powers, so it wouldn’t be surprising for him for her not to show any strain as she followed the tricky request, showing the flexibility of a professional gymnast. </p><p>As for faking some kind of distress to make it more fun for her boss, she ignored that immediately. Not because the idea wasn’t tempting, but because it would be lying to her boss. </p><p>And, she didn’t want to do such a reprehensible thing. </p><p>“Not bad,” he said as he caressed her ass with one hand, his touch enough to feel like her skin was burning, her invulnerability doing nothing to reduce the impact of his touch. Just by his touch, she could feel her heartbeat quickening and her wetness growing … and, when she caught a glimpse of him removing his belt from the mirror, her excitement compounded even further. </p><p>She didn’t do anything to be punished … but there was no harm in some preventative education. </p><p>She tensed and closed her eyes, preparing herself for the hit. It wouldn’t hurt any more than a stinging sensation, but still … however, as she kept her eyes closed, the belt touched somewhere else. </p><p>Right at her ankle before moving to the side to the wrist as well. Just like that, she found herself immobilized and helpless. Well, technically, she could just use her power and save herself from the situation … but that would require her destroying something that belonged to her boss. </p><p>Unacceptable. </p><p>“Let’s pin you in place, to make sure you can’t just change your position, and compromise our testing of your skirt,” he said teasingly even as he tightened her binding even more. On anyone else, it would have been a challenging and claustrophobic situation, a challenging position further enhanced by bonds they couldn’t escape. </p><p>For Tara, it was the reverse. She not only didn’t feel any strain, but also, if she wanted, she could snap that belt into two with next to no effort … leaving only the pleasure she could derive from the situation. </p><p>Her breathing quickened, but that was nothing to with the discomfort. Instead, it was about the way her boss positioned herself behind her, caressing her ass gently, making her wetness gush. She could feel a drop traveling down her leg before it was absorbed by her new stockings. </p><p>An amazing sensation, one that only enhanced as his hands moved to her waist, still under her skirt, dragging it up. “Garter belt looks good on you. We need to buy more,” he said in a casual tone, one that contrasted greatly by his presence behind her, pressing his bulge against her ass. </p><p>Much better than a mere touch.  </p><p>She abandoned herself to the pleasure, enjoying the way he aggressively pushed forward, teasing her. She whimpered. </p><p>And, just like that, a hard spank landed on her ass, the punishment freezing her. “S-sir,” she whispered, aroused and confused at the same time. </p><p>“Don’t forget that we’re in a public location. If you don’t keep your voice down, we might get caught. Do you want to be dragged to a police station dressed like this?” </p><p>With that, she froze, realizing that she had forgotten that important detail. She wanted to answer, but only a desperate whimper left her mouth. </p><p>“Exactly. From there on no making any sound or…” he said, his voice threatening. She wanted to keep her growing excitement at the prospect of more punishment. “Or we stop,” he completed. </p><p>“S-stop,” she whispered unable to keep her voice down. “H-how long?”</p><p>“Oh, don’t worry, just until we return to the bar,” he said, and she felt herself relax … until his next words. “Of course, we still have a lot of shopping to do.” </p><p>She said nothing, just took a breath, and bit her lips, ready to keep herself from moaning, no matter what. She couldn’t wait all day for it … not with the way her body was burning. </p><p>She just needed to stay silent. </p><p>Simple. </p><p>Or, not so simple, she corrected as she heard a rustling sound before he pressed against her core, this time with no fabric to block his warmth. Her hips reached automatically as she did her best to rub against him, desperate to take him in. </p><p>Unfortunately, her bindings made that task harder than it would have been otherwise. He shifted his hips, rocking them in a way that sapped her willpower. She wanted to moan, she wanted to cry, she wanted to beg for more. </p><p>But, somehow, she managed to stay silent even as his hips danced at a steady pace, teasing her entrance without taking an inch more. She bit her lips even harder to keep her voice down … but it was getting harder and harder. </p><p>Not just due to the way he almost invaded her again and again, but by the way he played with her garter belt. Slowly tugging, playing, and teasing, he showed just how much he enjoyed it on her. </p><p>She should certainly buy more the moment she received her first salary. </p><p>However, just as she was starting to lose herself in her shopping plans, her boss changed his pace rapidly. A sudden tightening of his grab was her only answer as he invaded her core mercilessly, and the pleasure blossomed. </p><p>Every inch of her body burned with a sudden explosion, her insides boiling with pleasure. </p><p>Yet, somehow, she managed to keep herself from moaning in pleasure. It was the hardest thing she had ever achieved … making her bite her lips hard enough to actually hurt despite her powers, but she didn’t make any sound other than a soft guttural sound. </p><p>For a moment, she was afraid that it was enough to violate his rule of silence. “Naughty,” he said, confirming that indeed that was the case, but he was merciful enough not to stop. “Now, let’s see if this skirt could handle some heavy-duty work,” he followed as he tightened his grip. </p><p>And, used it as a harness as he invaded her mercilessly, each second pushing her to a next level of pleasure. It was an incredible wave of pleasure, one that gave her a new perspective on everything. She felt herself tighten around his girth as he drilled, doing his best to counter that inclination … and succeeding spectacularly. </p><p>With every hit, her body swayed, and soon, her breasts escaped from the tyranny of the pleasure completely. “You can free yourself from your bindings,” he offered. </p><p>She pushed her arms, and the belt snapped easily under her power. As she tried to rise, he grabbed her hips once more and dragged her to the only seat in the room. He sat down, and pulled her on his lap. </p><p>Right in front of the mirror. With her misaligned clothing, with her distorted face, and with her widened legs that were showing exactly what was going on, it was the most whorish sight she had ever seen. </p><p>It was hard to think that it was her that was in the mirror. </p><p>She closed her eyes, and immediately received a spank. “Open your eyes,” her boss ordered, his whisper enough to send shivers through her body. </p><p>She followed his order and looked at the mirror once again, suppressing her desire to raise her hands to cover her wanton breasts just as she was suppressing her desire to moan desperately. </p><p>Helpless, she watched the pornographic show she had starred in, the reflection not leaving the slightest doubt about the true nature of the show she had on display. She lost herself in the pleasure as she watched her hips move up and down desperately, out of control. </p><p>“I’m about to cum,” he said as he grabbed her hair hard, pulling her head back as he kissed her neck. She didn’t say anything. She didn’t need to. After all, it was not a question, but a statement. </p><p>One that required no action from her. Well, no additional action, she corrected herself as her hips danced wildly, dragging her reward closer and closer … until he twitched inside her, followed by a warm flood that triggered her climax. </p><p>This time, she failed to hold back her moan … but her precious boss foresaw that, and his lips pressed against hers to suppress her voice. </p><p>Once he pulled back, she looked at the mirror, taking a glimpse of herself. A short skirt bunched around her waist to show her stockings and garter belt, a blouse that turned completely transparent due to sweating, and a bra that had pulled too low to be useful … she already looked like a hooker without considering his … thing … was still inside her, throbbing while his seed started to ooze out of her. </p><p>“You will make an excellent secretary,” he whispered. </p><p>A simple compliment, yet it made her feel just as much pleasure as the events prior.</p><p>She smiled. “Thanks, sir.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I arrived back at the store, Tara was looking in the mirror at the deepest corner of the store, wearing a beautiful but conservative pantsuit. </p><p>Too boring. </p><p>I carefully positioned myself to catch the attention of the saleswoman without being noticed by Tara, and shook my head, signaling to her that I wanted something better for her. </p><p>The saleswoman must have guessed that it would be my reaction, as she pulled another blouse and a pencil skirt from the shelf next to her, along with a packed set of underwear. “Your suit is beautiful, but why don’t you try this one,” she suggested. “Just to have some options once your…” </p><p>“Boss,” Tara said, blushing, unaware that she had been subtly interrogated. </p><p>I made a mental note to train her about that kind of trick. It was a habit that was already problematic for a secretary to have … let alone a superpowered bodyguard. </p><p>But, just like the puzzle, it was a move for the future. </p><p>“Good. Why don’t you try it? You don’t even need to leave your dressing cabin,” she said as she led Tara toward the corner one, one that I could slip in without anyone else noticing. </p><p>It seemed that I wasn’t the first business owner who brought my secretary for such meetings. </p><p>Fun. </p><p>“But, how is he going to see me in them if I don’t go out,” she whispered. </p><p>“Well, you can always send a picture of yourself,” she suggested, making Tara blush and fall silent. I had to admit, the saleswoman knew exactly what she was doing. </p><p>She earned herself another tip. She said nothing as she led Tara to the dressing cabin, who locked the door. Twice</p><p>I walked to the saleswoman, who greeted me with a victorious smirk. I passed another hundred. She passed me a master key that every employee had to unlock the cabins from outside. “I need the key back, and try not to make too much noise, or the security has to intervene,” she said. </p><p>I just nodded and walked toward the cabin she occupied, listening to the subtle sound of the movement, wanting to time my approach perfectly. It was a pedestrian way of using a superpower … but it wasn’t like I could use it to throw cars around. </p><p>I carefully unlocked the door once the sound of rustling stopped, and sneaked inside. I locked the door behind me, expecting Tara’s reaction … which didn’t come, as she was busy examining herself in the mirror, fascinated. </p><p>Another point that needed to be trained. Situational awareness. </p><p>I didn’t say anything, watching as she twirled in front of a mirror, wondering when she would notice my presence, but, as we quickly neared half a minute mark, I started to doubt that she could do so without assistance. </p><p>Waiting was not a chore. Certainly not. </p><p>I let my gaze dip down, enjoying the glimpse of her beautiful legs wrapped in white stockings, one that ended up mid-thigh, but connected to the distinct presence of a garter belt. Amazing enough, then as I continued, I caught a glimpse of her pencil skirt, too short to be appropriate for any kind of real business. </p><p>Luckily, my bar had long lost its feature to be a real business. Most of the time, the doors would be closed, and I much rather prefer her that tiny piece rather than anything more boring — but I made a note to buy something more appropriate just in case.’ </p><p>With that done, I continued to climb, taking note of her blouse. White and transparent enough to give a glimpse of her skin, it was even more inappropriate than her skirt even discounting the incredible cleavage that left her bra visible for my gaze. </p><p>Altogether, it was an excellent choice. </p><p>She noticed my presence only when she twirled to check her back on the mirror. However, rather than gasping in fear, she tensed, ready to attack … before she noticed who was the one that was in the room with her, turned into a gasp. </p><p>Still, I made a note not to startle her. </p><p>“S-sir,” she stammered as she suddenly raised her arms to cover her chest, and her legs crossed, like I hadn’t seen her in much less. I said nothing, wondering if she would realize that. Her blush spread quickly, showing that she realized it … but was still somehow challenged more by her sexy clothes than her nudity.</p><p>Luckily, my power allowed her to read her reactions quickly, giving insights into her reaction, probably more accurate than she knew herself. And, now, as I looked at her, I could feel the way her shoulders dropped slightly, suggesting a lack of confidence, like she was just an impostor, trying to look like something she was not. And, along with that, there was a lack of confidence, subconsciously thinking that she wasn’t beautiful enough to be worthy of such clothes. </p><p>It wasn’t hard to connect the dots on top of those impressions. I could easily see that her concerns weren’t just about the revealing state of her dress, but also the sophisticated nature of them — at least from the perspective of a farm girl. </p><p>Growing up on a ranch, she was comfortable in a rundown bar — which didn’t have any nice implications about the general quality of my place, not that I was unaware of it — but she felt out of place in an expensive clothing store, wearing sexy city clothing. </p><p>How fun. </p><p>“Do you need any help with your clothes?” I said as I took a step closer. </p><p>“N-no, sir,” she admitted, before she realized the implication of that suggestion, regret mixing into her expression. </p><p>“Do you want help, then?” I added. As much as teasing her about her reflexive answer was tempting, she was clearly feeling too self-conscious about the situation, and teasing her further wouldn’t have helped. </p><p>She paused for a moment, catching my gaze for a moment, then avoiding it even faster. “Y-yes, sir,” she admitted. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I took a step closer, enjoying the heavenly sight in front of me. I made a gesture, asking for her to twirl. She followed that order immediately, showing that her personal crisis was nowhere near as strong as her desire to obey. </p><p>Beautiful. </p><p>I stood in front of her, examining her beautiful face that dipped down to hide her intense blush, only to make her even cuter. I let the silence rule the room for a while my gaze crawled down, enjoying the depths of her cleavage, giving a glimpse of her areolas, a little pink line peeking from the side, multiplying the sexiness of her fair cleavage. </p><p>I had to admit, now that she was dressed properly, she looked fascinating. At that moment, I was glad for her horrible fashion sense, as otherwise, she never would have made it to my bar. </p><p>My luck might be horrible, but it had its own perks. </p><p>“Now, let’s see if this clothing could handle some heavy-duty work,” I said as I put my hand on her shoulder. “Are you ready?” </p><p>I loved the contradiction she was displaying. She was too shy to speak, yet her enthusiasm was clear in the way she nodded enthusiastically. </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I dragged my hand down, disappearing into her beautiful cleavage while she shivered desperately. </p><p>She dipped her head even lower as I enjoyed her perky breasts. I wanted to watch her expression, so I put my hand under her chin to raise it. The moment I touched, her lips parted in anticipation, turning into an invitation I was helpless to resist. I was planning to deliver a playful lesson about how to be a good secretary…</p><p>But my own lips rebelled against my order, moving forward to land hers, my tongue invading her beautiful mouth. I didn’t miss the hesitant glare she had thrown toward the door, but that tenseness didn’t prevent her from responding to my invasion, turning it into a beautiful dance. </p><p>A beautiful whimper escaped her mouth as my hand started to move lower, compromising her shirt’s already limited capability to keep her breasts hidden. A beautiful sound. </p><p>When I finally pulled back, she was frozen for a second, her wet lips parted, tempting me to push forward, and her nipples peeking free after my touch pushed her bra down — not much, just slightly, but it was enough. </p><p>It took a second for her to realize the state of her top, which added to her blush, but she made no move to fix it despite her constant hesitant glances toward the door. She was uncomfortable about the location, but not enough to actually ignore my implicit orders. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>“Now, it passed the first test, but we need to make sure it’ll hold against the more heavy-duty aspects of the job,” I said, and she trembled. </p><p>“Bend down,” I ordered. </p><p>She did, her already short skirt riding up to reveal a beautiful surprise. She was wearing a garter belt…</p><p>But her panties were absent. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Twenty minutes … It was not exactly a long time for most of the circumstances, but the women who dragged me all around the warehouse no doubt didn’t count our current case as a part of that statement. </p><p>Understandable, considering Carol was still half-naked as she gave ever-revealing poses that pushed her personal sense of shame to the limit and more, wearing just her blazer and her panties, while Nicole had to fight against her jealousy even as she did her best to take an endless chain of photos. </p><p>I was the only one who was enjoying the situation, the amusement of the situation mixing with the erotic pleasure from Carol’s touch as she slowly escalated the erotic nature of the poses. And, escalate, she did. Kisses to the neck, various naughty touches, rubbing my bulge both with her hand and her hips… </p><p>All the while, Nicole took photo after photo, parroting the lines she remembered from our sessions, half of it wildly inaccurate. Luckily, even if she showed occasional signs of suspicion, Carol didn’t know enough about modeling to call Nicole on about it. </p><p>A beautiful dance, one chained by her submissiveness, the other by pride. Still, I expected the situation to end with a whimper. With both girls already reaching their limit, I wasn’t willing to push them too much. </p><p>But then, Nicole suddenly decided to counter-attack. “I think we can stop,” she said, doing her best to hide the defeat in her tone, but failing. Even Carol caught it. </p><p>“Oh, really,” Carol answered. It was all she said, but her smirk said much more. </p><p>A mistake on her part, as that smirk suddenly triggered something in Nicole. “Yeah, it’s clear that you can’t handle anything more … interesting. I don’t have time to waste with a spoiled amateur.” </p><p>Carol stiffened. I didn’t exactly know the reason, but considering the clues I had about her past, I was willing to bet it was the word spoiled. “Oh, why didn’t you say so,” she said, her tone suddenly sharp as she stepped behind me. </p><p>A rustling, followed by something heavy falling to the ground. Considering the limited options I had, it didn’t take a genius to know it was her blazer. “How about now? Exciting enough,” Carol challenged with a poisonous voice as she hugged me from behind, her nipples hard against my back. </p><p>A good attack. Nicole was at the edge of the shattering when I caught her gaze and mouthed her a promise. Play along, and receive a reward. </p><p>Neither her fears nor her jealousy was as strong as her submissiveness. “Barely,” she said, her excessively flat voice easily mistaken as confidence rather than the edge of panic with the camera still hiding her face. </p><p>Behind me, Carol quivered in panic and hid her face behind my shoulder. She paused for a moment, no doubt considering the merits of retreating … but her pride defeated her rationality handily. She slipped her hands under my shirt, riding it up. </p><p>“Better?” she asked as her fingers danced over my chest. </p><p>Nicole said nothing, aware that she couldn’t hold her tone. But, committed to her prideful stance, Carol read that as a dismissal. </p><p>“Raise your arms,” she said. I did, and she pulled off my shirt, leaving both of us topless. She hugged me from behind again, her fingers dancing along my abs. She used her naughty hands to cover up her own panic as she started kissing my neck … which was a temporary solution at best. </p><p>I was confident in my muscles to seduce any woman, let alone one that was as conflicted as Carol. Her tactic of escalating the situation just made it trivial. I wished I could stop and ask her what exactly she was thinking. It would be almost as interesting as her almost-naked body. </p><p>Well, almost as interesting, I corrected as her fingers reached to my belt, fumbling with quite a bit. Either she had the most horrible agility I had ever seen, or she was trying to goad Nicole into stopping her. But, Nicole did not, and Carol found herself committed to that path. </p><p>Her pride and arousal working in concert, she unbuckled my belt and pushed my pants down, leaving my boxers alone to hide my raging erection. </p><p>A task that I was woefully unprepared for, earning me two shocked gasps at once. </p><p>To her credit, Nicole managed to hold herself back despite her jealousy already bubbling like a storm. Her face showed just how close she was to her limit. All it would take was a rough word from Carol to shatter him. </p><p>Carol, on the other hand, was too occupied with my latest reveal to pay attention to Nicole and take advantage of that opportunity, giving me the chance I needed to soothe Nicole, which I was able to do just by holding her gaze until she calmed down. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, don’t tell me you’re going to spend all your time looking,” Nicole said, her tone passably calm as she pushed Carol once more. She didn’t sound quite convincing … but Carol was too far into the mess to care about such details. </p><p>“You’re right,” Carol as she stopped hugging me, and instead stood next to me, finally letting us see her half-naked body, her arm still around my waist. After letting Nicole get a glimpse, she turned to me and pressed her breasts against my arm. “By the way,” she whispered. “You’re going to rent the place, right?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, our test run certainly didn’t discourage me,” I answered, amused by her timing, though I could see that it was more of a desperate attempt to focus on anything other than her own nudity. </p><p>“Good choice. You need to renovate some locations, but—” she started, only to freeze. “Actually, do you have any contractor to handle the place,” she whispered. A suspicious timing, or it would have been if I couldn’t read her expression perfectly. With that, I could easily see that it was actually a last-minute realization rather than a calculated plan to arrange some work for a friend. </p><p>“Have you got someone in mind?” I asked even as I turned toward her, so that not only her breasts were pushing against my chest, but also my barely contained arousal was pressing against her stomach, making her blush furiously. It was a sudden, aggressive change, one that might have scared her off. </p><p>So I pulled it just when she was about to ask me a big favor. Even as my hands landed on her ass, squeezing, she didn’t give any reaction but a blush. “Well, my roommate,” Carol said. It was good that I was mauling her incredibly in-shape ass, as being asked a favor for a boyfriend would have ruined my mood. </p><p>Well, a potential boyfriend, considering just how tense and unfulfilled she was, but still.</p><p>Still, I wasn’t above punishing her. I slipped my hands under her panties, cupping her ass even as I pulled her tighter against my body. “His qualifications?” I asked. </p><p>She blushed, and for a moment, I assumed that it was about my touch. Then, I realized her hesitation kept her lips closed rather than making her wiggle out of my touch. “Well …” she said, hesitant. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, spill,” I said as I squeezed her ass once more. It ruined my attempts to make myself look tame and harmless quite a bit … but she was too focused on what she was about to say to pay attention to that. </p><p>“My roommate is a woman,” she said, and I stopped squeezing her ass, realizing that I had been teasing her unfairly. </p><p>However, true to her personality, she misunderstood it and panicked as I pulled my hands away. Her way of reacting, wrapping her arms around my neck and jumping up, wrapping her legs around. A reflexive mistake, I could read on her face. With our physical state, her reflexes took over, and treated me like a boyfriend whom she was trying to convince for an expensive holiday. </p><p>“I know people don’t trust women contractors and think it’s a man’s job, but believe me, she’s amazing. And, as an interior designer, I can supervise her,” she said, still hanging on my body. </p><p>“Well, do you have any work of hers?” I asked. </p><p>“I have pictures. I just need to go and get my phone from upstairs,” she said, her legs loosening. I grabbed her ass, pinning her in place in the guise of helping her.  </p><p>“Don’t worry, Nicole can go and get it,” I said. </p><p>“Sure,” Nicole said as she dashed toward the door, the reluctance and jealousy she felt for leaving us alone in a room easily overwhelmed by the relief she had to extract herself from the situation without being defeated. </p><p>With that, we were alone. Carol looked at me, her expression shifting as she slowly realized the situation she was in. Mostly naked, wrapped around an equally naked man, alone in a warehouse…</p><p>A situation that wasn’t made any simpler by her intense arousal spreading from her core… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As Carol put her hand on my arm, looking at Nicole challengingly, Nicole was the first one to speak. One that Carol assumed to be victory — a small one, but a victory nonetheless — for a moment, then Nicole delivered her sentence. “A good idea. Why don’t you pose as you wish? I don’t want you to push you into something … you can’t handle,” Nicole said, the pause making it particularly sarcastic. </p><p>It was nowhere near Nicole’s usual way of talking, and I could see just how hesitant she was as she delivered those words. She was clearly mimicking someone in her life, one of her neighborhood bullies, most likely. </p><p>Luckily for her, that hesitance could also be read as mocking, especially for someone like Carol, who was already predisposed to assume Nicole was a typical arrogant model. </p><p>“Oh, as much as I can handle, are you sure you want to risk your boyfriend like this?” Carol said, her smile sharp and smug, though there was a brittleness in her expression as well. I had a feeling that the sudden intensity of her reaction had little to do with Nicole, who suddenly turned into the representation of the challenge she had been going through. </p><p>It took all my control not to explode in laughter. It was rare to see a misunderstanding worthy of a romantic comedy developing in real-time. </p><p>Nicole gave a trembling grin, showing that despite her initial desire to use Carol as some kind of practice was already flailing. Yet, misreading the situation once again, Carol tensed with determination. </p><p>I gave Nicole an encouraging smile, which boosted her courage just enough for her to handle Carol’s next attack. Just in time. </p><p>“As you wish, Miss Model,” Carol said, and turned to me. “Do you mind closing your eyes for a second,” she said, trying her best to ooze seduction. </p><p>Which, unfortunately, wasn’t as effective as she might have thought. Oh, she was certainly beautiful, stunningly so, but pure seduction was something else. Her smile reminded me of a femme fatale on the screen, sharp, exaggerated, and paradoxically tame. </p><p>I had a feeling that I was seeing the result of classical acting training — the perfect hobby for a rich girl. </p><p>That made her far more attractive to my gaze than she otherwise would have been. There was something vulnerable and fragile in her acting, one that spoke to my inclinations perfectly, making both a crack in that vulnerability further and repairing it at the same time. </p><p>Pity that it was the exact opposite of the seduction she was trying to achieve. </p><p>I followed her request and closed my back. I even turned my back, which not only made me look even more shy and submissive, but also hid my uncontrollable smirk. Multitasking for the win. </p><p>“Oh, daring,” Nicole murmured as the rushing of fabric reached my ear, her voice trembling already. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t handle just this much nudity,” Carol answered, the seductive tone in her voice too thick, making it obvious that she was trying to convince herself about that decision, therefore missing Nicole’s hesitation. </p><p>It was like watching two people trying to play poker while blindfolded, not even realizing both were holding uno cards. </p><p>A strangely entertaining disaster … even without the reward that was waiting for me at the end of it. </p><p>“You can open your eyes,” Carol called. </p><p>I followed her request, ready to fake an expression of appreciation regardless of the situation. However, that turned out to be unnecessary. She might not be practiced when it came to being a seductress, but her instincts were impossible to beat. </p><p>She still wore her blazer … which was one of the three pieces of clothing she still had on her. An incredible view, considering the other two pieces in question were her very expensive shoes, and her panties. </p><p>Particularly since the latter was a nice white lacy piece, contrasting with the bright red of her real estate agent. </p><p>“How do I look?” she asked as she leaned forward. </p><p>“A-amazing,” I said, faking a stammer. Nicole looked shocked at my reaction, but when Carol was busy throwing her a smug smile, I winked at her, telling her to play along. </p><p>My confidence seemed to shore up hers. “Come on, miss agent. Show me if you can handle being a model,” Nicole said as she raised her camera. </p><p>“Oh, my pleasure,” Carol said as she looked at me once more before closing the distance in a large step that displayed her naked legs to perfection. </p><p>And, if her confident grin was quivering a bit at the edge, I was gentleman enough not to point it out. Especially when the reward for it to have her stand next to me, the angle giving an even better view of her already exaggerated cleavage. After all, while she had buttoned her blazer … it was still only a deep blazer, with a deep valley in the middle, showing enough of her amazing breasts for me to conclusively decide that they were natural. </p><p>Unaware of the deep examination she was going through, she leaned against me while she turned to Nicole, opened her mouth, and paused. “W-wow, you’re more in shape than I realized,” she muttered. She was beautiful and smart. </p><p>But not very observant. </p><p>“Well, it takes a lot of strength to bring around all that photo equipment,” I said, doing my best to act exaggeratedly hesitant to give her an impression of harmlessness. I wanted her to stay focused on Nicole. </p><p>“Well, it’s working,” she said as she moved even closer, her hips pressing against my side. Luckily, not touch my arousal. </p><p> I didn’t want to scare her yet. </p><p>“Okay, enough yapping. Give me a pose,” Nicole said, her voice pointed. Jealousy in her tone was easy to identify. Not just for me, but also for her target. </p><p>Another mistake … with some interesting dividends for me. </p><p>“As you wish, miss model,” Carol said, encouraged by what she took to be a sign of her victory as she turned to me, and put her hands to my neck, pulling me close enough I could feel her breath. </p><p>Her blush as she took the pose was spectacular. It told me that she was already at her limit, but she was pushing because she felt like Nicole would call it off. A reasonable conclusion considering she had first met us while we were in the midst of our carnal glory. Since Nicole was my lover and she was jealous, she had to admit defeat soon. </p><p>Unfortunately for Carol, while that assumption was perfectly reasonable, it was also incredibly wrong due to a piece of information she misread. Nicole was not the dominant person in this relationship … but a natural submissive. </p><p>Worse, she was a natural submissive who had developed a personal and professional habit of following my commands. The slight shake of my head was enough to dissuade Nicole from stopping. Instead, she just raised her camera to the face to hide her blush and spoke. </p><p>“Come on, that’s enough warmup. Show me something more dynamic. Something interesting,” Nicole spoke instead, doing her best to copy me both in words and in cadence. </p><p>She wasn’t successful enough to hide her jealousy and discomfort, but it was good, as those only encouraged Carol further. “As you wish. You’re the boss,” she said as she grabbed my hand, and brought it to her ass. “Squeeze it a bit, so that it can be clear on the camera,” Carol whispered. </p><p>I did so, feeling the texture of her soft panties and even softer skin on my palm. Carol let out a moan, one that showed a deep sense of pleasure, and perfectly aroused. Far better than her earlier paper-thin seductive pose. </p><p>For a moment, I froze, wondering if she had been playing me all along, but then I realized it wasn’t the case. It lasted only after I managed to take a glance into her eyes, and realized how crazy diluted her eyes were. I would have suspected some chemical interference if she wasn’t with us all along. </p><p>I shuffled my hand slightly, adding a little more pressure, and a moan exploded from her. One that she did her best to make look like a fake, which was enough to trick Nicole, but not me. “Oh, come on, mister. Be careful about those fingers,” she whispered loudly, implying that I had been touching to her wetness to explain it to Nicole. </p><p>Quick thinking. Too bad it was nowhere near enough to hide the truth from me. I recognized the signs easily. She had been going through a long dry spell, and considering her tenseness, she either didn’t like masturbation, or she was one of the unlucky women who didn’t derive enough satisfaction from it. </p><p>A deadly combination with her clearly healthy sexual drive. </p><p>Just like that, the game got even more entertaining. </p><p>“How about this, Miss Model,” Carol said throatily, unaware that I was busy discovering every little secret of her body. “Do you think that’s enough to get a sense of the lighting…” </p><p>Carol looked at Nicole as she said that, once again missing the clue I had mouthed to her side. </p><p>“Oh, we’re just starting, sweetie,” Nicole answered. “We have a dozen rooms to test.” </p><p>With that, Carol tensed in my arms, realizing the dangers of playing games unprepared. Of course, there was nothing that forced her to follow Nicole’s suggestion. </p><p>Well, nothing but her pride… And, for I had a feeling that her pride had already been battered down by the situation that forced her to escape into the middle of nowhere. And, now, she wasn’t ready for any more compromises. </p><p>Not even playing a ridiculous game of dare. </p><p>Or naked dare. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The necrotic god decided to respond conservatively. He continued to attack my avatar directly despite its endless regeneration, while he sent his armies to the forest Seldanna was in the process of creating. </p><p>I didn’t intervene, letting him commit his army there, happy that I could shift my attention to them and steal their divine Spark immediately. Hundreds of demigod-class undead were impressive, but not enough to take down Seldanna’s avatar. </p><p>Though, once they mixed with the zombie army and attacked, I found myself revising that opinion. I had underestimated their effectiveness. The immediate presence of their god meant that their Divine Spark was empowered significantly. </p><p>And, it clearly had a bigger impact than I expected. </p><p>Luckily, Seldanna had already managed to create a huge forest that was strong enough to counter most of their necrotic mana tricks, giving her some kind of home-field advantage, and allowing her to successfully maintain her defense. </p><p>For the moment. </p><p>Her forward progress was stalled, under the focused magical assault of the necromancers, the treants finally started to fall. Just a few at first, but they managed that achievement without sacrificing any of their own critical pieces. </p><p>That caused Seldanna to pull back almost desperately, doing her best to defend every single treant and every inch she had. </p><p>Big mistake. </p><p>I wondered if it was her unfamiliarity with the large-scale warfare that triggered the mistake. However, it was also likely that it was her divine nature as the goddess of nature that was making her prioritize keeping her creation safe. </p><p>Either way, I didn’t intervene, letting her make that mistake. Ultimately, it was a mistake that worked to our benefit in our current situation. It showed the necrotic god that his armies had been making progress, albeit slowly, giving him the confidence that he could be successful as long as he maintained that strategy. </p><p>I would love to face such a static assault. I had many ways of reversing that … I just wanted to find the Eternals first. </p><p>I continued my desperate battle as I kept my attention on my fake angel constructs that scoured the far end of the plane, their light attacks doing wonders to not only destroy any undead they came across — which wasn’t much as almost all of the forces was moved to our side to create an invasion army — but also permanently eradicated the necrotic mana that filled the plane. </p><p>The advantage of light mana over necrotic mana was unbelievable. </p><p>The former didn’t hurt the necrotic god much, but the destruction of the necrotic mana was not a small problem. So, I expected him to send a similar force of liches and death knights to that side to take down the angels at a minimum … though I was hoping for another avatar to deal with them, which would allow me to steal even more spark from him. </p><p>Yet, to my surprise, he neither created an avatar,, nor did he sent any of his army. I failed to understand the reason…</p><p>Until one of my detection wards finally discovered a movement toward the edge of the plane a concealment ward stopped working for a moment, and a man started flying toward the angel. “Stop,” he shouted, easily blocking the automatic attack of the angel using some mind of the artifact-based magical shield. </p><p>At the same time, he decided to speak. “What are you doing! Are your god is willing to throw out the agreement,” he declared. </p><p>His words were interesting enough that I had split my attention to control the nearest construct, even though it meant my dragon avatar fell to an even greater disadvantage. </p><p>As I used the construct to look at the unknown Eternal, I did my best to come to a decision. Should I try and risk capturing their ship, hoping that they didn’t implement enough safety measures, or try to bluff them? </p><p>The former was the more attractive reward, and if hadn’t failed to detect them until their mistake of revealing their presence, I might have chosen to take that risk. But, it was clear that, despite all my improvements, my magical capabilities weren’t enough to unravel all their tricks. </p><p>Bluffing, it was. </p><p>“No, of course not,” I said, speaking through my connection. “It’s just that my exalted god received a better offer.” With that, the construct raised its hand, and cast a focused light spell. </p><p>“You dare to betray us,” the Eternal shouted in anger, his artifact blocking the attack relatively well, but he still flew back. “Do you think that anyone else could face our glorious organization,” he declared. </p><p>At the same time, their ship started to move. Their hiding capabilities were quite impressive … but since I had already detected their location, following the movement was much easier compared to the alternative. </p><p>My construct acted like it didn’t realize that, and focused its attack on the sole eternal, who was safe from the attack. I could feel them getting ready for an attack. Which was not good news. </p><p>Certainly not while I was trying to deal with an actual god in his domain. </p><p>Luckily, my tricks were not over. I used all the constructs to attack him together. His artifact wasn’t strong enough to resist that … but on that side of the plane, there was no mana storm to block teleportation. He teleported right back to his ship. </p><p>At the same time, I followed with another attack, one that was even stronger, cracking the planar border, a storm immediately invading as the plane was invaded by Primordial Aether. </p><p>At the same time, a horrible Primordial Storm under my control hit the ship, pushing it away. Since the ship was designed to resist the primordial aether successfully, it didn’t cause anything more than cosmetic damage … but it pushed it out, out of the protective shadow of the planar border … and just like that, they disappeared into the chaos. </p><p>It would take days for them to return even if they wanted to. </p><p>Of course, that attack was not for free, and it destroyed all but five constructs, the planar border still broken. I wanted to repair it immediately, but even that momentary split was enough to put my dragon avatar at an even greater disadvantage. </p><p>I needed more strength, even if it would make my job harder. </p><p>[All Stats +20]</p><p>[-600,700 Purified Spark]</p><p>[+5 Endurance]</p><p>[+4 Intelligence]</p><p>The capability increase from the wholesome improvement was considerable, allowing me to control my avatar with an even greater efficiency. However, it would still take a while for me to balance the situation enough to repair the border. </p><p>I didn’t want the plane to be destroyed. I needed it to help Mariel. </p><p>However, I was still fearful about using my truly secretive tricks. What if Eternals had another ship. After all, they successfully managed to hide one. However, before I could make that decision … I felt a strong movement of Divine Spark. </p><p>And another avatar appeared right next to the necrotic god. “Do you think I’ll let you destroy my domain!” he cried in anger, his words enhanced my magic. </p><p>I wished I had time to slap my own head. For a moment, I forgot that I wasn’t the only one that wanted to keep the plane intact. From his perspective, the angels were already defeated, and he had the advantage on the other two dimensions. </p><p>Then, it clicked me. Maybe he didn’t even realize Eternals were banished successfully. If he noticed their departure, he might very well assume that they were busy counter-attacking the nature plane while we were focused on the battle here. </p><p>I wanted him to repair the border, but I didn’t want to make it easy. “I’ll destroy it if I can’t own it,” my dragon avatar shouted back, glowing with a threatening amount of mana, looking like a suicide attack. </p><p>Admittedly, it was not too different. The sudden empowerment consumed all of the stored mana I had, and I didn’t have enough purified spark to convert it speedily enough to match him. </p><p>Luckily, I had a nice source of replacement right next to me. I charged toward the new avatar, the empowered dragon strong enough to avoid his panicked attacks. </p><p>And, I devoured his second avatar. </p><p>[+372,421 Purified Spark]</p><p>Not as strong as the first one, but definitely enough for me to recover my mana output. He started creating another avatar … but this time, rather than splitting his attention between attacking my dragon avatar and creating the avatar, he kept his full focus on creating an impenetrable defensive ward around the avatar. </p><p>I charged toward the ward, it bounced me off … and I used that momentum shift to suddenly reverse direction, and slam his lich army from behind, taking down a notable minority of them while he finished conjuring his avatar and teleported it away. </p><p>[+144,021 Purified Spark]</p><p>And, I had another meal in the process. </p><p>I rushed toward his actual body once again once he finished with his task. “You’re pushing your luck,” he shouted, but this time, despite all his anger, his voice was much weaker. </p><p>Losing two avatars wasn’t exactly trivial. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 65    Charisma: 65</p><p>Precision: 65    Perception: 65</p><p>Agility: 65     Manipulation: 65</p><p>Speed: 65       Intelligence: 86</p><p>Endurance: 98      Wisdom: 65}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 712,965}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>The battle of two dragons raged at the dark skies of the dead land, while Seldanna led our invincible treant army with great efficiency, leveraging their inherent advantage over the disposable zombies in great efficiency as she destroyed them. </p><p>Without the liches and death knights to support to army, she was even able to focus on transforming our breach point into a lush, raging forest, though this time, it didn’t look like her usual beautiful, calm forests, but a raging chaotic piece filled with thorns and spikes, looking threatening. </p><p>She flooded the seeds with a shocking amount of mana, putting a drain even to the amount I was able to provide to her momentarily, but I didn’t ask her to stop. It was a strategically dangerous commitment, creating a place for them to strike back. It was not the kind of strategy I would have committed. </p><p>But I didn’t stop her either. If the plane was populated by humans or elves — or even any kind of living being — I might have insisted on maintaining strategic mobility to hit their weak spots and logistic weaknesses, but those concepts didn’t apply to a bunch of unliving that didn’t have any need other than necrotic mana. </p><p>Then, there was the other reason Seldanna had a great advantage. I noticed three liches approaching the battle on top of a bone dragon. With a raging cry of nature mana explosion, I threw the necrotic avatar in that direction. Then followed.  </p><p>[+3,692 Purified Spark]</p><p>And, immediately grabbed and converted the Purified Spark they had. Another small but noticeable jump to my reserves. I didn’t immediately use it to boost my stats, but instead used it to convert Primordial Aether I continuously grabbed from a small breach I maintained, using the new amount to quicken the process even more. </p><p>Focusing on converting the Aether and the Necrotic mana would have been even faster … but that, I didn’t want to commit to. </p><p>Not before I could find the location of the Eternals. The less information they gather, the better. I still didn’t know the full range of their magical capabilities, but I had seen enough to be scared. </p><p>I continued to fight ‘recklessly’ as I threw around the necrotic dragon like a rag doll, to the point of almost pitying the avatar. Even as it desperately drained the ready necrotic mana to empower itself, he was not able to match the endless mana I was channeling. </p><p>Cheating was always fun. </p><p>I moved around, faster and faster, destroying more of his arriving leadership cadre. </p><p>[+3,190 Purified Spark]</p><p>War was a great tragedy, but not when our side was made exclusively of disposable pawns, and our enemies were exclusively undead monstrosities that were best erased from existence. I moved around, preventing the arrival of the stronger casters, while Seldanna continued to destroy the rest of the army and expand the forest even more. </p><p>However, regardless of the ease I was having, I didn’t dare to slow down, continuing my aim to search for the inevitable Eternal base, desperate to find them before the real body of the necrotic god arrived to face me. </p><p>Unfortunately, that, I failed. At one moment, without a warning, I felt the enemy avatar getting stronger. Suddenly, I couldn’t just throw it around while destroying his armies with ease. </p><p>The necrotic god was near, and I was nowhere near destroying him. </p><p>Sigh. </p><p>I turned my gaze toward the horizon, and soon noticed a lich, floating forward, easily mistaken for an ordinary undead if it wasn’t for the suffocating waves of necrotic mana flowing out of him like an endless wave. </p><p>Not an easy enemy. </p><p>It was the time for the contingency, one that I was hoping not to use. I pumped my avatar with as much mana as it could hold for a moment, and let it sink into the ground and turn into a tree for a moment, radiating an explosion of nature mana, trying to trigger plant growth all around the plane while it desperately drew in the mana. </p><p>For a moment, it looked like I was trying to snatch control of the plane from the necrotic god. </p><p>As far as the distractions went, it was spectacular. </p><p>It was a stupid move that was impossible to make. I knew that, and my enemy knew that … but the problem was, he had to understand why I would make such a stupid move despite its apparent uselessness. </p><p>He pulled back along with his avatar, his tendrils of magic extending from a distance. </p><p>I used the opportunity to teleport away, not wanting to waste the time I gained. At best, I barely had a minute. I used my mana-conversion breach to slip out of the plane, and immediately moved to another ward that had been attached to the surface of the plane. </p><p>One that is made of Tantric mana to resist corrosion. Unlike the giant ark bursting through the planar border, it was a secret operation, therefore allowing different attacks. </p><p>I moved around the planar border as quickly as possible, and created another breach, deploying a hundred more constructs to the mixture. </p><p>However, this time, they were not treants, but something I had forged. Essentially, they were empty sets of armors, filled with enough pseudo-HP to make them look like they were full, but without anything to heal, it was useless. </p><p>Ultimately, those suits of armor were wholly ineffective when it came to fighting when considering the amount of effort I had put into them and the mana I had spent in their construction…</p><p>However, still, they were a great distraction for two reasons. First, every suit of armor came with a set of metal wings, each layered with enough illusion spells to trick an actual god — hopefully. </p><p>And, second, each had its own mana storage filled with an incredible amount of Light Mana, which I had carefully converted using Mariel as a conduit. I could have skipped the whole armor fiasco and used the light mana as an explosive ward and be more effective. </p><p>But that wouldn’t have scared the necrotic god just as much. </p><p>The light was devastating against necrotic mana. </p><p>Since I was already back on the plane proper, I just teleported to my fake-avatar. The Aether Dimension was still in an extremely chaotic state, making teleportation impossible for anyone else, but still, it was nothing compared to the true chaos of Primordial Aether. </p><p>I arrived just as the necrotic god realized the whole trick with the tree avatar was nothing but a distraction, and sent his own dragon avatar toward me while he started moving toward the border. Pity that he was too late. </p><p>If he had been just ten seconds faster, he would have destroyed my fake-avatar while it was still in its helpless tree form while it was uselessly trying to spread its reach. Unfortunately, I was in place, and just as he was about to reach me, I made the avatar transform once more, turning into the dragon, maintaining the roots…</p><p>Which suddenly jumped out of the ground and stabbed the necrotic avatar, greedily draining the Divine Spark that created it and passing it into me. </p><p>I had to admit. At that moment, I pitied my opponent. Probably under the ‘kind request’ of the eternal, he had turned every defensive asset into an offensive one for a very dangerous assault, only to be caught completely unprepared, and just as he was about to deliver the counterattack, he was caught in a deadly pincer. </p><p>Which cost him a very expensive avatar, which he didn’t like much considering his cries. </p><p>[+731,931 Purified Spark]</p><p>I wondered what he would think if he knew his Necrotic Spark was not locked behind a ward but devoured. </p><p>Nothing good, I presumed. </p><p>Worse, before he could go to the border to deal with the ‘angels’, my avatar caught with his real body, and attacked. </p><p>I would have loved to say that I destroyed him … but the reality was, it was the opposite. Even with the endless mana, I was channeling to the dragon avatar, the best I could do was to delay him, with every spell of his destroying a chunk of the avatar. </p><p>If it was actually empowered by Divine Spark, those blows would have dispersed that spark, weakening the avatar in quick order. </p><p>But, since I was a cheater, I just continued to pump the avatar with more and more mana, its nature spark core easily converting it into nature mana to regrow its limbs. At the same time, I made sure to move that core repeatedly to avoid the blows… </p><p>Even with that, it was a hopeless battle for that dragon avatar. Eventually, it would fall. </p><p>Unfortunately for my opponent, the keyword was eventually. With Seldanna attacking from one side, and the light constructs attacking from the other, he was rapidly losing his invasion forces, each second costing him another chunk of his forces. </p><p>I kept my attention on the dragon avatar, doing my best to maintain the situation. Whether in terms of weakening his immortal army, or expanding the grasp of nature, we were the ones making progress. </p><p>It was his turn to come up with a solution. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 62</p><p>Endurance: 73      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 797,223}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "title": "Darion's Office 36",
    "content": "<p>Darion was in his janitor's office, resting. Not the most beautiful location, but strangely, he was warming up to the location. It was not the cleanest of the location, but it was silent. </p><p>And, he appreciated the silence. </p><p>His new office was fun, and his new coworkers were just the right mixture of sexy and submissive, with just the right touch of gullibility, but even he needed his rest. </p><p>Not for long, but some. </p><p>Which was why, when he heard the door open, he turned toward there with an annoyed expression, ready to admonish … when he saw someone he didn’t expect. Gina, the rival of his boss and fake girlfriend. </p><p>He was about to kick her out, but he didn’t do so for two reasons. First, he didn’t want to ruin things for his fake girlfriend — especially when the alternative was to make her owe him even more. </p><p>Second, the delicious cleavage Gina had was enough to earn his momentary attention. “I didn’t expect you to find here,” Gina said. “It’s so rude for Mia to use you like a worker for her work. It’s so rude of her.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” Darion said, unable to hold back his smirk as he stood up. “And, I’m guessing you treat your boyfriends better.” </p><p>Her expression twisted. “Nice attempt, but I wouldn’t touch anything second-hand from that whore, not even a man as fine as you,” Gina said, dismissing his words before they could even start landing. If he were being honest, he liked that attitude better…</p><p>But only because he could already smell an opportunity to turn the tables. </p><p>“And, what do I owe the pleasure of your visit, then?” Darion answered. </p><p>“Well, just because I wouldn’t touch you doesn’t mean I can’t make you a fun offer. I need a new head of security in my company, which is a cushy job with little responsibilities. You might be interested in that.” </p><p>Darion smiled wider. “Let me guess. Only if  I can bring Madam Paisley as a customer,” he said.</p><p>She chuckled. “I love working with smart people. Exactly.” </p><p>Darion let his smile widen. “Well, I appreciate the offer, but it wouldn’t work. A new work is nice, but I like my fun. And, it’s hard to match Mia when it comes to that. So, unless you’re volunteering…” </p><p>Gina smiled widely. “Why don’t you come to my club tonight and we can see whether I can entertain you more than Mia,” she said before she turned and left, leaving him alone. </p><p>He had to admit, she knew how to make an exit. </p><p>Now, all he needed to see was whether she knew how to entertain guests as well.</p><p>*** </p><p>Gina was on the piano, playing one of the more challenging pieces, when the door to her club opened, her guest arriving. He walked toward the main scene, but his dismissive glance as Gina played the piano was enough to show her that he didn’t know much about fine arts. </p><p>Not that it surprised Gina. Mia had always been weak to a nice body … and if Gina was being honest, Darion had one of the finest ones she had ever seen. </p><p>“If that’s the entertainment you prepared, I shouldn’t even bother sitting,” Darion said, not bothering to hide his dismissive glance toward her piano. Ironically, Gina appreciated that. She had met with many men who knew exactly as much about classical music, yet somehow believed themselves smart enough that they could hide the fact. </p><p>Gina loved to mock such men until they crumbled. At least, Darion didn’t bother with that nonsense and was confident enough to show his dislike. Of course, she might have reacted differently if it wasn’t for his importance … but then, this was life. </p><p>Never fair. </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about it. This is just the background, the real fun is about to arrive,” she said. And, to her surprise took the clue, and appeared on the door. </p><p>Aisha, her loyal bartender owed her a lot of money, and was willing to work hard to cover that debt. Even if that work was to keep Mia’s boyfriend happy. </p><p>“Your entertainment is here,” Gina said as she gestured, and Darion turned toward her. </p><p>“Much better,” he said. </p><p>“Exactly. Just to look, of course, but if you’re willing to help me—“ Gina started, only for Darion to cut her off. </p><p>“Nonsense,” he said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” Gina replied, unable to keep her frown off her face. </p><p>“Well, you can’t expect me to accept a deal before a test run. Give me a twirl, sweetie,” Darion said. </p><p>Gina frowned, but before she could say anything, Aisha already followed his direction. </p><p>Weak girl. Gina swallowed her words, not willing to weaken her position any further as she saw Darion walk toward her bartender. </p><p>“Now, beautiful, why don’t you show me exactly how you plan to entertain me,” he started. </p><p>“Well, I have a dance prepared—“ Aisha started, only to be cut when Darion grabbed her hair and twisted her. </p><p>“Nonsense. I’m sure a pretty girl like you could come up with a more clever solution.” </p><p>Gina frowned as she watched the show, wondering if she could intervene. But, as he pushed Aisha against the piano, a glance was enough to confirm that Aisha already surrendered, and was enthusiastic about what was about to follow. </p><p>Weak slut. </p><p>“Well, I have a bedroom attached if you want to use it,” Gina answered. </p><p>“Nonsense. I have no intention of your beautiful music,” he said, his expression mocking. “Unless you’re scared, of course,” he followed, and Gina found herself reaching for her phone. </p><p>She wasn’t the kind that would retreat from a challenge. </p><p>Especially if that challenge came from the boyfriend of that whore Mia. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn’t particularly worried about the safety of my bar as I left it. At this point, either the Slasher realized that his henchmen had been robbed, or they had managed to keep their unique misfortune hidden. </p><p>If the latter was the problem, everything was alright. </p><p>If the former was the case, there were three rough possibilities. Our resident villain would buy my bluff and leave me alone, which meant my location was not important. He wouldn’t buy it and decide to attack my bar, which I could watch from the cameras and decide whether to return or sacrifice the bar — which was an easier decision to make with the recent loot. </p><p>Or, he might decide to attack me directly, and in that case, having Tara with me was the much better option. </p><p>I left my bar easily, because currently, it was a nice bait with no value — a fact that won’t continue once I purchased all those bottles by spending a small fortune on it. </p><p>Soon, we arrived at our destination. </p><p>Valley Mall. </p><p>“Isn’t that place a bit … expensive, sir,” she murmured. </p><p>I thought about teasing her about questioning my ideas, but in this case, I decided against it. We were in public … and more importantly, she was right. Located between the city center and the rich suburbs of the northern hills, Valley Mall was the most expensive shopping center in the city … and every single product that was sold here was sold with a hefty markup. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was one of the few places that truly expensive shops dared to settle, because it was under the full-time protection of the New Giant Force Guild, an offshoot of the famous Giant Force that had almost as much influence on the country during its heyday. </p><p>Until it collapsed due to internal arguments. </p><p>The New Giant Force Guild, casually referred to as giants, was one of the weaker groups that split, but still, it was enough to make them the premier guild of our city. They kept the city center safe, and in exchange, the city donated them a small piece of land. </p><p>Which they built the Valley Mall on. As long as a luxury shop was willing to pay the hefty security premium, their security was assured. No casual destruction by a bored villain, and not even shoplifting. </p><p>Not exactly my favorite hangout spot, but it was the only place that had the rare bottles I had wished to have. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said as I led her through the mall, but halfway in, I noticed a nice boutique that had a nice spread of outfits. Some outfits that were worthy of my secretary, and a couple pieces that we could use to cobble together a more distinctive hero outfit for her that could keep her identity secret. </p><p>I doubted it would take long for them to realize Tara was the supposed bodyguard, but that didn’t matter. In about half of the cases, the so-called civilian identity of heroes and villains is just a polite fiction in any case. </p><p>The other half was pretty careful hiding them. </p><p>Luckily, Tara’s powerset was the kind that didn’t really care about their identity except for the polite fiction part. After all, she had super strength and super durability regardless of what she was wearing.</p><p>“Why don’t you go in and try a few dresses while I go and handle the boring part of shopping,” I said to her as I led her into the shop. I planned to leave her immediately, but I decided against it when I noticed the disdainful gaze of one of the saleswomen, clearly about to treat her as a nuisance due to the quality of our clothing. </p><p>Technically, I could let it happen before swooping in to save her … but we were past the need for such a little trick in our beautifully complicated relationship. Instead, I looked at a younger, more hesitant woman, and gestured her to walk, my confident move enough to overwhelm their general distaste. </p><p>“Now, I want you to help my pretty secretary here. Two sets of uniform that would brighten the look in my office, maybe a dress that she could wear to accompany me to business dinners,” I quickly explained even as I pulled a roll of money and passed a hundred dollars to her like it was nothing. “But, if I see her anything less than perfectly happy and pampered, I’ll leave without buying anything. Understood?” I said, then turned away without looking. </p><p>After all, I was able to read her enough to know that, through a combination of crass displays of wealth, I had convinced her that I was a rich man. An upstart rich man, probably, but in such a shop, that was not exactly a problem. </p><p>Though, ironically, my power allowed me to read that my rude attitude did more to sell that idea than the deliberate display of cash. </p><p>Amusing. </p><p>I left immediately — not without throwing a warning glare to the other saleswoman, sharp enough to show I knew exactly what she was thinking — to arrive at my next destination. As much as I treated my departure as a test, I didn’t want to risk it. </p><p>There, things went much better. They were not unused to workers coming to make big purchases, and they were pointedly not curious about all-cash payment of thirty thousand once they realized the general delivery point.</p><p>They asked for a thousand extra for the delivery due to the neighborhood where they were dropping it off. Not exactly something that I wanted to pay…</p><p>But an officer of a high-ranking villain wouldn’t be hauling more than fifty bottles like a common worker, so, to maintain the illusion, I assented. </p><p>With that delivery complete, I walked back to the boutique where I had left Tara, but a glance inside confirmed that she was being assisted by the saleswoman well and she was happy, so I decided to leave her to her shipping for a while more. </p><p>It wouldn’t be amiss to do some shopping for me to reinforce the impression as well. </p><p>Unfortunately, my challenge was a bit tougher than Tara. A woman, even one that suspected to be a superhero, had the luxury of wearing whatever they wanted as long as it looked good. </p><p>For a man, especially one who was trying to give the impression of working toward a mysterious villain, things were a bit complicated. My supposed undercover role allowed me to be understated, but ultimately, there was a difference between understated and cheap.</p><p>Technically, there was a workaround. I could just purchase a nice watch and some nice leather shoes, and I could wear whatever I wanted. </p><p>Unfortunately, nice leather shoes started in five figures … and the less it was said about truly nice watches that could be a statement, the better. </p><p>Luckily, my power allowed me to cheat a bit. I stopped by some stores, and created a small wardrobe of jeans, t-shirts, and stylish but underrated sneakers, my power allowing me to build some combinations that would impress a true fashion expert. </p><p>However, paying five hundred dollars for a simple black t-shirt was certainly annoying. I was going through the money I managed to take with a shocking speed, but I just forced myself to ignore that detail. </p><p>Money wasn’t as important as my safety, and the illusion I was working hard to build was the only thing that could potentially keep us safe. I rather waste money on details that might end up unimportant than the alternative. </p><p>With that, my shopping was complete … or, I thought so until I passed in front of an accessory store, one that was made in the form of the members of the New Gian Force. Various expensive toys and knick-knacks were being sold for a ridiculous markup, with the excuse of supporting the protectors of the city. </p><p>What caught my interest was a little metal puzzle box. I had no idea what, but the tickling of my power was distinctive. </p><p>Even more interestingly, there were fifty of those boxes, and only one tickled my attention. Curious, I walked inside, but I didn’t just grab it, afraid that it was some kind of trick. </p><p>Luckily, that was not my only way of getting that. As I stood near, examining the stuff, one of of the salespeople rushed toward me immediately. “How can I help you, sir,” he said, the bags that filled my hands marking me as a likely buyer. </p><p>“Just a gift to my niece. She’s a sharp little thing, and she’s a big fan of the Giants,” I said. “But she has all the figures, so I’m looking for something different.” </p><p>As I said that, I took a ‘careless’ half a step back, and he followed, which meant when he reached, he grabbed the puzzle box that grabbed my attention in the first place. “How about something like this, sir. It’ll keep her mind sharp and —“ </p><p>“That’ll do, wrap it up,” I said, doing my best to sound disinterested. </p><p>I wanted to see just why it had managed to awaken my interest such intensely. </p><p>But, that was for the future. </p><p>First, I need to make sure her new clothes fit Tara perfectly… </p><p>And could be removed just as easily. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I ignored the desire to let out a distinct cry of frustration as I stepped inside. They were still too close, and getting rid of my stress was not worth damaging the illusion I had managed to build up. </p><p>Fucking useless Tyler, ruining everything due to his sheer presence. Like I didn’t have enough problems with attacking the henchmen of the Slasher, or the drug distribution warehouse that happened to open just a few blocks away. </p><p>Now I had to invent an imaginary villain to support us. </p><p>Even more annoyingly, even when I returned to the bar, I wasn’t able to let out a cry of frustration freely. Not when Tara was already in the main bar area, a tense yet expectant expression on her face. I had to continue looking strong. </p><p>I let out a soft sigh as I continued, letting Tara feel tenser at my silence. I didn’t want to torture her by that, but to enhance her anticipation. I said nothing until I arrived back at the bar, and looked at her. Her beautiful eyes were flickering with fear and anticipation. “You did well,” I said. </p><p>She let out the breath she was holding. “T-thanks, sir,” she said, her breath trembling as it left her mouth. I could see that she had another question on her lips, one with no doubt about the mysterious boss who was supposed to be supporting us. </p><p>I thought about lying to her about that. There were certain advantages to making her believe that … the biggest being the security of the secret. I didn’t fear her revealing the secret deliberately, but an accidental reveal was a different matter. </p><p>She was too naive to resist a subtle interrogator. </p><p>However, in the end, I decided to tell her the truth. The reason was simple. While the risk of revealing the truth was unpalatable, the potential of losing her respect was even more so. What if her devotion was transferred to my non-existent boss. </p><p>No, I had no intention of competing with an imaginary person for the affection of my sexy superhero secretary. “No, it was just a lie I told to keep them away until we can put some security measures in place,” I said. </p><p>She looked insulted at that. It clicked me a second later. She clearly treated the security at the bar as her responsibility already, taking that as an insult. </p><p>“We don’t want them to burn the bar while we’re out for some errand, do we?” I asked, preemptively dismantling that bomb. </p><p>Maybe my powers weren’t as useless as I had first thought. “Now, as much as I wanted to continue where we left off, I have an urgent task for you,” I said as I pulled some cash, then opened my phone to show a simple tiny security camera. They were not particularly high quality, but they didn’t need to be. “Now, I want you to go and purchase fifty of them,” I said, spending two and a half grand immediately, which was more than half of what I had taken from the group that attacked the bar the night before. </p><p>A necessary expense. Luckily, today’s group was kind enough to drop another, larger bag, more than enough to compensate for that particular loss. The weapons they left behind were just a bonus. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said, taking a step too upstairs, to change before leaving. </p><p>“Don’t buy more than five from a store, and don’t show your purchases,” I said. Fifty security cameras at once was a little suspicious. </p><p>I said nothing while she went upstairs and changed. Only after she went far away enough not to hear my little trick, I grabbed the baseball bat I kept as a security tool, and walked to the back of the bar. </p><p>… and started beating the garbage can. “Fuck, fuck, fuck…” I growled with every hit, giving me a chance to focus on the present. I stopped only when my hands started hurting with every hit. </p><p>I returned, looking in the mirror to catch my face, reddened with exertion. “No need to act like a teenager, Jason,” I spoke to myself. “Push your turmoil down, and focus. You’re a man, and you have made a choice.” </p><p>I had made a choice, one that was more or less permanent. I had challenged a villain. Indirectly, maybe, but still a challenge. And, if I suddenly disappeared, they would rightfully assume that it was a pathetic bluff. </p><p>It was the kind of thing that the villains treated as a matter of honor. Worse, he didn’t even need to chase me … he just needed to pay a villain that specialized in such a service, and they would find me … even bringing me back with a nice gift wrap for some extra charge. </p><p>“A choice indeed,” I murmured as I walked to the bar, poured myself a glass of my best whiskey — which, unfortunately, wasn’t that good — and knocked it down in one. </p><p>“Now, onto the more immediate matters,” I said as I turned my attention to the bags they had left, going through them. Four guns, some spare ammo — no blades though, as I didn’t want to directly insult the Slasher by stealing his signature weapon — but more importantly, money. </p><p>A hundred thousand…</p><p>“If only I had this money yesterday,” I murmured as I examined the content, feeling bittersweet. If I had this money the day before, I would have just closed my rundown bar in the middle of nowhere and opened a new one in a better part of the city … but it was far from enough to get away from after insulting a villain with a famously fragile ego. </p><p>I had no option but to stay, and commit deeper to the role. </p><p>First, the bar design. For a moment, I thought about renovating the place, to make it something more fitting to a peripheral business of a leading villain. There were certain advantages to it…</p><p>“No,” I said after considering it for a while. It sounded like a good idea to decorate the place in a fancier way. It would even work … if I had the necessary money. </p><p>Unfortunately, while sixty thousand was a lot of money for me, it was nowhere near building a nice avant-garde bar truly worthy of a leading villain. If I spent all that money on decoration, the only thing I would achieve was to ruin the effect. </p><p>I needed to be more selective. But how… </p><p>I turned my attention to the shelves, particularly the empty top shelf. “Contrast, it is,” I suddenly said as I pulled on a pen and paper, and started to make some calculations … about which extremely expensive bottles I could afford that would make the best impression. </p><p>I immediately skipped the mainstream brands, and instead focused on some of the more unique gin and whiskey brands, with a few rare vodka and tequila brands added for variety, all almost unknown but just enough to have a reputation among the experts, combined with a unique design… at the same time, checking the bar repeatedly to make sure their visual theme fit well with my unique look. </p><p>Some did, while others were a touch gaudier … so I decided to buy a few decanters as well to further highlight the difference. </p><p>Altogether, I could imagine them filling their selves, creating the picture of a bar that was destined to fail. After all, the cheapest bottle I had planned to purchase was three hundred dollars. Even without adding in some of the overhead and other costs, I needed to sell a glass at least twenty just to break even at the cost. </p><p>Add in those and taxes, and even fifty would barely break even. A challenge for all but the most expensive bars exclusive for the super-rich, and that was for the cheapest. </p><p>Some, I had to pay two hundred or more. </p><p>Worse, my bottles were deliberately chosen from brands that only the real enthusiasts would know about … and they often preferred to drink at their own homes. </p><p>No, even though I planned to spend thirty thousand dollars buying those bottles, I knew that it would fail spectacularly, but it didn’t matter as long as I could sell the impression I wanted to create. </p><p>I was about to finish my list when Tara arrived, carrying two bags filled with the security cameras I asked for, each low quality and battery-powered, but most importantly, small enough to be hidden around the street. </p><p>Exactly what I needed. </p><p>“Very good,” I said, even the bare compliment enough to put a smile on her face. “Now, I’m going to set these around, then we have another shopping trip to complete,” I said. </p><p>“T-together,” she whispered, doing her best to keep her excitement hidden — and failing miserably. </p><p>“Yes, we have some bottles to purchase,” I said, and her smile slipped away. “And, since we’re out, maybe we can finally pick you that uniform,” I added, and it returned even brighter. “Just go and freshen up while I handle setting these up,” I said. </p><p>“Show me how good you are, my power,” I murmured as I walked back and forth across the street, occasionally placing the camera in a nook that I was confident would stay hidden, and only when the street was empty. </p><p>With that, I soon placed fifty cameras, half of them on my street, the other half spread along the streets that surrounded me. I knew that I couldn’t cover the whole street without having any blind spots, so I used my power to identify the best spots people would use to approach while being sneaky, and focused on those. </p><p>After the incredible benefits I had ended through the encounter with Tara, I was more willing to trust my power. It might not be fancy…</p><p>But it was more useful than I had initially given credit to… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Why don’t you go to your girlfriend while I go and make a few arrangements,” I said to Jenny. </p><p>“Why?” she asked, but I just gave her a pointed glare, and she walked away, leaving me in the corridor to make some arrangements. </p><p>Dorothy’s enthusiasm suggested to me that she had no idea how a strip club actually worked, and I had no doubt that, if left alone, she would just go sit in front of the main stage. Which was bad enough under normal circumstances, but I had no intention of chasing away a bunch of horny idiots who would try their luck with the only free ladies in the club. </p><p>Worse, the strip club staff wasn’t really equipped to measure and treat her for her spending capabilities, for one simple reason. The personnel was not really familiar with the female clientele enough to quickly assess her clothing and put a rough price tag. Three of them looked like a bored bachelorette party that decided to visit a normal strip club rather than a male one to spice up their night … often meant little to no spending. </p><p>My situation was different. My clothing was significantly cheaper than what she had been wearing, but I ‘carelessly’ lifted my hand near a waitress, letting her get a good glimpse of it, letting her realize that it was not a fake. </p><p>A five-figure watch was a good indicator of spending potential, especially when it fit well with my business casual clothing, signaling that I had other, more formal pieces in my collection. Luckily, the place was high-class enough to care about such stuff. </p><p>She immediately gave a signal, and a manager — a sexy woman in her thirties who wore too much makeup for my taste — walked toward me quickly. </p><p>“Welcome to our establishment, sir. How can I help you,” she said. </p><p>I sighed as I pulled out my wallet, and pulled a nice bundle of cash, while also flashing my platinum credit card. “I want your best room, preferably with some soundproofing. Make sure to send your best dancers, and say them to keep the brunette happy above all others. Virgin cocktails only, but make sure they don’t mention it, or you’ll say goodbye to your tip,” I said, choosing to give her an explicit warning. </p><p>Ordinarily, warnings about holding back the tip were a good way to get the worst experience possible, but not when accompanied by a preemptive tip as well. </p><p>Together, they told my situation much better than words could. I was about to entertain an important guest, and no mistakes were allowed. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said, her flirty attitude gone and replaced with professionalism, with just a hint of surprise. After all, while the ordinary customers generated a steady cash flow, there were two kinds of customers that generated real profit for such places. Young athletes with too much money and willing to show off, and entertainment aspect of the business side. </p><p>The fact that our client was a young woman was just a small detail, easily ignored. </p><p>With those orders delivered, I went to catch up with the girls, who, as I predicted, moved toward the main stage, uncaring of the hungry glares they awakened despite the strippers. I could already see five different men trying to talk with the bartender to send some drinks and try their luck. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t misread the professionalism of the manager, and soon, a sexy waitress arrived at our side. “Please, this way, sir,” she said as she started walking in front of us, our hips swaying. </p><p>Dorothy’s eyes were locked on her hips for a moment, but her expression was not desire but jealousy. It didn’t surprise me, as I was able to read her lack of attraction to her own gender quickly, but it would have made the night much easier if I could just call a nice blonde — or two — to keep her distracted all night. </p><p>“Wow, are all strip clubs this nice,” Dorothy said as she entered the room, though her expression was more disappointed than excited about that. “I thought they were supposed to be seedier.” </p><p>“Sorry about that, but I’m an old man, and I like my comfort,” I said, happy to throw that as an excuse rather than trying to deal with the risks of a seedy club — especially the ones that were attended by real criminals and not just rich kids that think themselves as dangerous. </p><p>I had no intention of calling a favor from one of my less-reputable friends to resolve the inevitable crisis that would follow. </p><p>She looked disappointed, but luckily, not enough to push for her luck as I sat on the small couch in the corner. I didn’t like the way Dorothy was getting too touchy-feely, and it was better to put some distance without looking like it. </p><p>I gestured for Natalie to take the seat in the middle, leaving the couch on the one at the right for Dorothy. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was no single chair, as each was designed to allow at least three people — making sure the dancers had their range of movement during the lap dance, or accompanying the visitors with a drink. </p><p>Unfortunately, it left me with an unwelcome challenge when Dorothy chose to ignore that seat arrangement and sat next to me. </p><p>Which was something I was afraid of, but I hoped it wouldn’t be the case. Of course, I had thought to ask Natalie and Jenny to sit with me, which would have filled the couch … but would give the trick away, making it pointless. </p><p>The whole point was to keep her happy without creating some unnecessary entanglements, a fact that started to get harder and harder as the night progressed. </p><p>Admittedly, it was my fault. I treated her in the usual manner I dealt with my bosses and important clients. And, lost in my usual habits of managing the upper management with nonsense, I forget to factor in a very important fact. </p><p>That I was catering to a young, impressionable woman, not too different than Umi, and somehow, she misunderstood the whole point. </p><p>Ordinarily, it wouldn’t be a problem. She wouldn’t be the first twenty-something that entertained me for a few nights … but her position made it very difficult. </p><p>Worse, she was a spoiled billionaire, and I had no idea how she would react to even a mild rejection — and I wasn’t willing to test that unless it turned too vital. </p><p>Hopefully, the dancers would be enough to distract her. </p><p>Before she could start talking, the door opened, and two entered. A waitress, carrying a large tray filled with a nice spread of cocktails and shots, each colorful. Accompanying her was a sexy pink-haired dancer with an ass to die for, dressed as a police officer. Clearly one of the top earners, the perfect sway of her hips to show her incredible skill. </p><p>I was familiar with strippers as much as I was familiar with my scotch. </p><p>Benefits of entering the world of business in the late eighties. </p><p>Dorothy reached for the drink, but I was even faster, taking two shots quickly, making sure that they had no alcohol as I ordered. </p><p>It was better to be safe than sorry. </p><p>“First time in the strip club,” I said to Dorothy while Jenny talked with the waitress, no doubt asking for a virgin cocktail, not wanting her to see that communication. </p><p>The waitress looked at me, and I nodded to her, telling her that it was okay to share the content details with Jenny. </p><p>“Yes, it’s so exciting,” Dorothy said right after she took a shot as well, which I would have appreciated more without her hand landing on my thigh ‘accidentally’. </p><p>Admittedly, my annoyance was strictly intellectual. On a more primal level, I was enjoying the attention she was showing. It was an amusing feeling to be wooed so directly by a sexy young woman. </p><p>Meanwhile, Jenny looked at me questioningly about the cocktails, and I gestured to Dorothy, using a moment she chugged another shot aggressively to nod toward her, signaling to them that I was trying to keep Dorothy as sober as possible. </p><p>Once again glad that they were smart enough to play along with just a clue. Jenny deserved a reward, and Natalie…</p><p>Well, she managed to earn back enough credit to make her punishment a fun one. </p><p>Meanwhile, our pink-haired dancer started to move freely, a lean forward giving us a deep view of her cleavage. To my surprise, despite her insistence on dragging us to a strip club, Dorothy reacted to the view with a surprising blush … showing that she was not exactly ready for it. </p><p>Good, I thought even as I caught her gaze and smiled. “It’s customary to watch the dancer, or they’ll feel neglected,” I said, goading her.</p><p>“R-right,” she stammered, and followed my suggestion, but not before she took another shot, unaware that she wouldn’t find the courage she expected at the bottom of those drinks. </p><p>Soon, she would overwhelmed with her shyness, use her meeting tomorrow as an excuse, and leave. </p><p>It was a foolproof plan. </p><p>But then … why was I feeling like I had forgotten something really important… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Corporate retreats had certain times that they could be fun — my adventures with Umi were the evidence of that — unfortunately, that concept of fun didn’t extend to the extended event dinners, where most of the upper management had to go and brag about how successful the company was and how amazingly generous the company was to share that opportunity with people like them… </p><p>Unfortunately, as one of those members of upper management, that included me as well. </p><p>Ordinarily, I might have found a way to skip it, but when the heiress of the company suddenly decided to crash the party, it was not exactly the best strategy. So, I went there, putting on my best fake-enthusiastic face as I bragged about the great things we achieved, and promised everything short of another moon landing for the next year before I took my seat. </p><p>Face time with the owners was never to be missed. </p><p>After all, the truth of the upper management was like being a magician. There were a lot of tricks, smokes and mirrors, and skill, but the biggest asset was to have a willing audience, ready to engage with the nonsense of the management. </p><p>Amusingly, it didn’t matter if they were just lapping whatever I told, or trying to disprove it. A magician’s best friend was the people who tried to unravel his tricks while watching his show, allowing the misdirection to happen. </p><p>Hence, I did my best to look affable and wise for the daughter of the owner — an old owner who would eventually end up in the dirt, leaving the company to her. </p><p>I didn’t expect to be too successful. </p><p>“… it’s a fascinating breakdown of the five forces. What a novel way to approach market analysis,” Dorothy said as she took another sip of her wine, her voice a touch too cheerful, showing that she was tipsy and not drunk. </p><p>Which, annoyingly, made her enthusiasm toward the business theory even more unbearable. She was just like every graduate that had just left the business school, thinking that they had suddenly learned the true meaning of success…</p><p>No question why most of them ended up doing nothing worthwhile as a part of huge internationals rather than building their own companies and getting rich. </p><p>I didn’t tell her that. Instead, I had responded to her with all the bullshit I had learned after a lifetime of working with management consultants, salespeople, and other legal conmen, and she ate that nonsense up. </p><p>She was an overeager fit brunette, the kind that I enjoyed seducing and breaking down — Umi being a great example — but unfortunately, her identity made her too much of a troubling target. </p><p>There was something as too much risk, so I played along, even sending a warning glare to a waiter and sending him away when he came to replenish the wine. </p><p>Unfortunately, the waiter was incompetent enough to be seen on his way to retreat. “Another bottle,” Dorothy called, which he brought despite my warning gesture, costing himself a huge tip. </p><p>When her speech ended, I caught Natalie’s gaze and called her to the table, accompanied by her beautiful long-term girlfriend. </p><p>Who had carried a little gift from me? </p><p>They were a good way to distract Dorothy while I extracted myself from the situation. </p><p>“Oh, lady of the hour is here,” Dorothy said as she poured a glass of wine to her, and was about to pour one to Jenny, only to be stopped with a gesture. “Sorry, I forgot about pregnancy,” Dorothy said with a blush.  </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s easy to forget when looking at her,” I said, smiling softly as I gave an exaggerated look of appreciation … though I didn’t need to fake it. Wearing a sexy green dress that was just loose enough to cover up the tiny bump she was developing, Jenny looked incredible, especially with her cleavage displaying just the perfect amount of her pregnancy breasts to attain a tasteful sexiness. </p><p>“Thanks, you’re always so sweet … when you’re not being sexy,” Jenny said as she leaned down and kissed me on the lips, too long to be a playful joke, no doubt encouraged by the location of the table that allowed us to stay hidden from the crowd due to some clever placement. </p><p>Natalie flinched, understandably so as she received a pointed gaze from me. One that lasted only for a moment, but conveyed a long punishment. </p><p>She clearly forgot to prepare Jenny about the identity of Dorothy. </p><p>A huge strategic mistake, one that could ruin all the work I had been putting into the situation. I couldn’t look like a degenerate who was having an affair with the girlfriend of my direct manager. </p><p>Being one was not the problem. </p><p>I just couldn’t look like it. </p><p>I threw another warning glare to Natalie, one that suggested her solve that immediately. Unfortunately, Dorothy’s angry blush suggested she wanted to talk that immediately. </p><p>I decided to preempt that. “Thank you for being such a loving person, Jenny,” I said even as I turned my head in a way Dorothy couldn’t see, and mouthed her to play along. Luckily, while she could be too trusting at times — a fact that both Natalie and I used to our benefit more than once — she was still smart. </p><p>Certainly smart enough to know that I wouldn’t look alarmed for nothing. </p><p>Then, before the tipsy heiress of the company I worked for could explode, I made a point of leaning down to kiss her belly. “It makes me proud to be the sperm donor of the beautiful baby you will raise together. And it’s beautiful that you want to keep me included in the baby’s life and make them feel loved by a father as well as two mothers,” I said. </p><p>Jenny’s eyes widened, not by love, but surprise as she turned to look at Dorothy. She knew me well enough that I hated acting like this … and only someone really important could make me act like this. </p><p>“Oh, I didn’t know that. Such a beautiful way of building a family. How beautiful,” Dorothy said, her tipsiness working to our benefit. “You’re such a nice man for making such a sacrifice, Nathan,” she added as she put her hand on my shoulder. </p><p>“Please keep it a secret. We don’t want the rest of the company to know. You know how closed-minded and bigoted people could be,” I said, with absolutely no problem misleading her about the nature of my fears. </p><p>Whatever it took to keep her from suddenly digging around morality clauses. I trusted my contract to hold, because ultimately, it was something that was pushed by a penny-pinching CEO. She wouldn’t escalate the situation that would result in a lengthy legal battle that would cost the company ten times the money. </p><p>That didn’t apply to Dorothy. A few extra million in legal costs wouldn’t matter to her. </p><p>Rich and idealistic was a dangerous combination. </p><p>Luckily, she was also determined to prove herself as progressive, making her easily swallow the situation rather than poking it too much, like why Jenny was giving open-mouthed kisses to their sperm donor in the middle of a company event. </p><p>I sat back, and Natalie managed to whisper a few details while disguising it as flirting, and we went back to the safer topics. Since I had my scotch, I couldn’t drink wine without being suspicious, and Jenny was pregnant, so the task of keeping Dorothy sober for her flight fell on Natalie, making sure to drink most of the bottle. </p><p>“Maybe we should call it a night,” I said as I looked at Dorothy, remembering that she had mentioned something about a flight. “You have your flight, right?” </p><p>“Oh, you remembered,” Dorothy answered, her slightly smug smile suggesting she had misread the nature of my understanding.  Worse, she put her hand on my arm playfully, flirting a little. She had been shy at first, but as the night progressed, it continued to change. “But don’t worry, I canceled the flight and called for my private plane. I can stay a while more.” </p><p>“How fascinating. I was afraid that I had to cut our discussion short,” I said, keeping my expression straight, and suppressing my annoyance about the extension.</p><p>I might have had a lot of practice playing to the veneer of the rich and the incompetent, but Dorothy was just young and enthusiastic enough to make it a real chore. Worse, getting her drunk and letting her loose in a strip club was not an available hospitality strategy. </p><p>Another hour, and most of the employees were gone, leaving our concealed table the only one while Dorothy did her best to flirt with me without being too obvious. Luckily, at some point, Jenny decided to keep me entertained by playing footsie. And, as a pilates and yoga trainer, she knew exactly how to use her feet to the best effect as she rubbed my bulge. </p><p>“I can’t believe how amazing it is talking with you. Most of the board is filled with stuffy old white men, who think they always deserve the best. They are so greedy and sexist, not to mention incompetent and boring,” Dorothy complained, unwittingly targeting me. Lucky, I thought that description pretty accurately described me — except the incompetent and boring part, of course. </p><p>Worse, she wasn’t drunk, just excited. We nodded, hoping that she would end the night. </p><p>“You know what, follow me,” she suddenly said and stood up, walking away with all the confidence a young entitled woman could exude, not even bothering to ask about our opinion. Natalie followed immediately, while I acted gentlemanly and helped Jenny to stand up.  </p><p>“We can probably excuse your disappearance,” I whispered to Jenny. </p><p>She shook her head. “No, I rather follow her. And, we can always bail later using it as an excuse,” Jenny said. </p><p>“You’re the best,” I said, cupping her ass as I kissed her. </p><p>“And you’re so bad. Never missing an opportunity to cup a feel,” she said, but her giggle showed that she didn’t mind. </p><p>We caught up with them in the corridor and followed Dorothy … until she stood at the entrance of a strip club. “Let’s end the night just like those stuffy old men,” she said as she walked inside. </p><p>Helpless, we followed. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Wow, this is…” Seldanna’s avatar gasped as she took the view in. </p><p>Her shock was understandable. The plane was filled with undead as far as the eye could see. I had often referred to the undead as endless, but only now, I realized just how inadequate that description was. I hadn’t dared to explore the plane directly, afraid of being caught and ruining the surprise. </p><p>Looking at their numbers, I was glad that I didn’t try to go with the alternative of letting the planes collide and defend the invasion. With those numbers, I would have had to pull all the stops to have a hope of defeating them, serving my secrets to Eternals on a plate while also dealing with devastation that would have been far deeper than the previous undead invasion. </p><p>Sometimes, fortune really favored the brave. </p><p>“Do you think we can win,” Seldanna asked. </p><p>“Probably. And it’s not like it matters even if we lose,” I answered with a shrug. I might have warned her about army morale and being confident, but that was not exactly a concern while leading an army of wooden constructs. “You’re only here as an avatar, and I’m confident that I can escape with most of our Divine Spark. At a minimum, we would destroy a majority of their army.” </p><p>As I said that, the Ark finally landed on the ground with a devastating crash, the collusion enough to destroy the zombies in its immediate surroundings. Then, the wards that were holding back millions of nature mana cracked, creating a thick wave to collide against the suffocating necrotic mana — enough that, if I had landed on this plane just after my accidental exile, I probably would have died in seconds.</p><p>How much difference does a few months make, I thought even as I watched ten thousand wooden giants leave the Ark along with the mana wave, attacking the undead army before they could react, each greedily pulling the surrounding necrotic mana to convert into nature mana. </p><p>After all, they were essentially a singular unit. Another god forest that was connected by fully melded Divine Spark, giving them an incredible efficiency advantage. I even made sure to give them a very old look, making them look like an ancient legion my fake personality had created long ago. </p><p>I wanted to intimidate the Eternals, not send them to send to a blind panic. And, while an intimidating wooden giant army that a nature god could wield as a weapon was scary, it was nowhere near scary as a god that could create such an army once a month. </p><p>Making them believe that the former was the case was to my benefit … especially considering my other trick would make them panic enough — preferably somewhere away from here.</p><p>“Impressive, isn’t it,” I commented while I controlled the treant army to destroy the undead army with shocking efficiency. Seldanna just nodded, fascinated by the speed the endless legion dwindled. </p><p>Admittedly, while it was an impressive sight, the achievement of destroying the first section of the army was hardly a challenge. Mostly because none of the army in front of us actually had Divine Spark in them to counter the spells I had been constantly casting through the treants — their nature making it very easy to channel the same spell through all of them at the same time. </p><p>It was the benefit of an ambush. There were no death knights or liches to counter my spells to give a fighting chance to the zombies, and there were no skeletal dragons in the mix to tussle directly with the treants. I had no doubt that they had such members, but they were probably somewhere nearer to the center. </p><p>After all, why bother commanding an army that was happy enough to just wait without doing anything. Add in the fact that zombies were best when their numbers could spread along a huge line endlessly to hunt the peasants and strain the supply lines rather than fighting against elite forces. </p><p>Especially elite forces like ours that had no mind to be intimidated, and no muscles to get tired. </p><p>Worse, we had one more decisive advantage. The sudden clash of two huge waves of opposing mana was overwhelming enough to extend into the connection between the material and the Aether. Unless they were to lose the majority of their commanders to the violent Aether waves, they couldn’t just teleport nearby, leaving only an ordinary method. </p><p>At a distance, I noticed a bone dragon, mounted by a lich. My dragon construct made a gesture, and a giant bolt of nature mana flew toward it, obliterating it with one hit.</p><p>Leaving a lingering cloud of Necrotic Spark behind.  </p><p>“My opponent is about to battle is about to get fun. Take over the army,” I said to Seldanna. </p><p>“Are you sure you want to take that directly? Maybe I should be the one. I’m just an avatar—“ she said as she watched that mist created by Necrotic Spark growing wildly, but I silenced her with a gesture. </p><p>“No, we talked about this, take over the treants,” I ordered. She sighed as she jumped down, floating on top of the biggest one. At the same time, the army paused for a second, giving the zombies a chance to counter-attack. It would have been devastating if our army had any physical weakness… </p><p>But they didn’t, so it only meant a monetary dip in their destruction. </p><p>She didn’t have my tactical acumen, but she was better at using Nature Spark as a conduit. She was not as good at casting offensive magic, but she was far better at cleansing the land and creating a thick forest that could support the battle, so the combat efficiency of the treants stayed roughly the same, just with a more defensive focus than offensive. </p><p>Pity she was only there as an avatar and this wasn’t her Divine Domain. I would have loved to see just how strong she was when she truly cut loose. </p><p>I still could have watched her for hours … but, unfortunately, I had something else to pay attention to. </p><p>My opponent. </p><p>I rushed forward on my dragon, though I let a layer of wood cover me, hiding my real body to make him believe I was here as a dragon avatar. </p><p>He had already managed to push enough Divine Spark to create an avatar before I could arrive, which was a part of my plan. After all, it was far easier to steal from his Avatar than his real body — which was doubtlessly rushing forward as well. </p><p>“You dare invade my domain!” the necrotic god shouted, his voice exploding with a wave of necrotic mana, every undead that it touched empowered significantly. And, if we had an ordinary army, most of it would have been already dead with that one spell. </p><p>Enough to show that, fighting a god in his domain was no joke. If it wasn’t for the other part of my plan, I would have been already planning to escape after stealing as much as Divine Spark to turn it into deadly guerrilla warfare even with my advantage. </p><p>Instead, I responded in kind. “Do you think I would let you invade my Domain without a consequence, you upstart dog!” my dragon shouted back, while I used it to pull the same trick. </p><p>The last time I had used that trick, it had left me damaged and injured, my body unable to handle the intensity. Luckily, since that time, my Endurance had increased several times, making that a momentary discomfort even as I channeled almost a million mana without a ward to assist me. </p><p>It destroyed another chunk of his army while countering his trick. “You dare challenge me!” he shouted as he cast a spell, and the destroyed zombies started floating up and merging, soon turning into a huge dragon, even bigger than mine. </p><p>Since I was playing the role of a narcissistic god, I decided to act true to that personality, and channeled mana into the dragon avatar, making it grow even bigger, using the nature mana to its best advantage. </p><p>However, just because I was acting like a narcissistic moron didn’t mean I had to be one. I used the incredible mana flare to conceal several other spells, the most important being a subtle detection ward to detect mana types, one that I cast into the Aether dimension to make its detection even more impossible. </p><p>Searching for anything other than necrotic. </p><p>I wanted to find out if there was an Eternal base here, one that could be conveniently destroyed during the battle, with all the information conveniently getting lost in the explosion. </p><p>However, even with my abilities, casting a detection ward that would search a whole planar fragment was not an instant task, especially when I was trying to keep its existence hidden. </p><p>I let my dragon rush toward the undead one, and they started the most pointless melee battle of all time, endlessly regenerating wood against endlessly recovering undead flesh. </p><p>Luckily, I had my complicated magic to keep me entertained… </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 62</p><p>Endurance: 73      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 58,410}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“That bastards. To think that they are about to attack my domain...” Seldanna started before her words turned into a chain of curses, some I had never heard before. </p><p>I didn’t blame her. Realizing that she was just weeks away from a deadly invasion was a nasty realization. </p><p>Pity it was just an avatar of hers and not her real body, preventing me from helping her stress in a more direct manner. We had spent almost a full day together without stopping, but it had been barely enough to quench our thirst. </p><p>Right now, we were floating in the Primordial Aether, safe in the wards I had created while we observed the Eternals’ invasion plan. </p><p>“You have to admit, they are not playing around,” I said as I observed the plane in the distance, only visible due to my Tantric spell creating a viewport. “The moment they realized they have to deal with a god, they brought one of their own. And, this time, they are not bothering with an avatar, but attacking with full force.  And, to make it more interesting, even if the surprise attack failed, there’s no evidence linking them to the attack, giving them plausible deniability. They have perfected their art.” </p><p>“Do forgive me if I don’t feel impressed by an attack that was about to be launched into my land,” Seldanna said, her voice thick with anger. </p><p>She was the most furious I had ever seen, suggesting that there were some unexpected side effects to creating a Divine Domain. Though, maybe I should have expected it. The tighter she connected to her domain, the more it turned into a part of her existence. </p><p>Meaning, the upcoming invasion was a highly personal attack. I had no doubt that, if I suggested her to let that attack happen as a part of a complicated plan, she would have fought against it very intensely. </p><p>Luckily, that was mostly theoretical. I had no intention of taking the risk of letting a god with more practical experience step into her domain. </p><p>“Don’t worry, we have enough time to deliver a lot of attacks, especially with my ability to freely interject with the area,” I said.</p><p>She looked at me, looking considerably more relaxed. “Yes, you can just attack from outside until you can break the planar border, and the Primordial Aether will do the rest.” </p><p>“No, that won’t work,” I countered. </p><p>“Why?” she asked, frustrated. “It looks perfectly doable.” </p><p>“Well, let me correct it like this. We can do it, but why should we waste such a golden opportunity,” I said. “I need to find a planar fragment for Mariel to fix her current situation, and the Eternals were kind enough to bring one to us, even showing me the best way to link the two planes together.” </p><p>“That’s … ambitious,” she said, though her tone made it clear that she wasn’t happy about that solution. A part of it was her concern for her Domain, but I had been juggling a complicated relationship long enough to catch the hint of jealousy not too far away from the surface. </p><p>“Ambitious, true. Especially linking two domains together without making them merge or drift away. I probably have to come and check every couple weeks for a long while to make sure everything was in order.” </p><p>Just like that, Seldanna’s distaste disappeared at the prospect of more visits. “How exactly do you think this long while is,” she asked, trying to sound casual. </p><p>“Probably years,” I said, doing my best to hide my smirk. “Maybe you’re right and I should just break the planar border —“ </p><p>“No, you’re right. It’s an opportunity not to be missed,” Seldanna said, her panic clear despite her avatar making it much easier to hide. </p><p>She was cute enough to tempt me to teleport back and show her just how much I missed her, but I suppressed that desire temporarily. </p><p>Unfortunately, we still had serious issues to talk about. “It’s not going to be simple. We need to work hard to create a counterforce to distract them.” </p><p>“Not elves, right,” she countered. “The war had damaged their numbers badly enough that they need decades to even start to recover from their losses.” </p><p>“No,” I said with a shake of my head, my smile wide. “Only the idiot and the desperate try to invade the domain of undead with living beings… And, we’re not desperate.” </p><p>“You want to use treants,” she gasped. </p><p>“Exactly. That, and I’m almost sure I could fashion some kind of breach using the God Forest… Then, just as they pit all their forces to block the invasion of the treants…” I said. </p><p>“Then, what?” she asked, excited. </p><p>I gave her a naughty smile. “Well, that’s a surprise. A man needs to have a few to continue impressing a sexy goddess of nature….” I answered as I changed the direction. We had a lot of work to do, and maybe a few more rewards in the process. </p><p>***</p><p>“Fascinating,” Seldanna said as she looked at the army of treants that spread in front of us. Ten thousand trees, each filled with endless waves of Nature mana we created through a combination of my purification and Seldanna’s conversion. </p><p>A trick that I only dared to pull after checking the whole plain carefully so as not to alert the Eternals. However, compared to the previous times, I was less careful. </p><p>Ironically, it was their invasion method that led to it. Clearly, once rejected, their methods were more heavy-handed than I expected. I had no doubt that, even if they didn’t catch anything suspicious, the failure of their invasion would give them enough reason to escalate. </p><p>At this point, them getting suspicious about my abilities — well, the abilities of the ancient nature god — would actually be helpful to keep them behind. </p><p>And, even if that failed, we still had my other surprise to distract them. </p><p>“Are you ready,” I said as I looked at Seldanna. She nodded, and with a wave of her hand, another treant bloomed. It was smaller than the others, barely twenty feet tall rather than five hundred, and made of flowers rather than wood. </p><p>I said nothing about the shape. The avatar was throbbing with Divine Spark. Those flowers didn’t need thorns to be dangerous. </p><p>Then, I waved my hand, and another avatar — a fake one in my case — grew with a shocking speed. A wooden dragon, with a five hundred feet wingspan, almost a thousand feet long from head to tail. </p><p>An avatar worthy of my fake personality. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said as I stepped on the dragon, and Seldanna’s avatar followed. I used the dragon as a focus to cast another spell. This time, another movement appeared, and a huge ark appeared, enough to hold this impressive army. </p><p>Even with our combined abilities, it took two full days for us to create it. The size was not a problem, but the fact that it had to hold against the ravages of the Primordial Aether, even for a moment, was something else. </p><p>Especially since I couldn’t just cheat by using Tantric and alerting everyone in the process. </p><p>The ark started to fly, leaving Seldanna’s real body behind. Through her avatar, Seldanna cast a spell, and the planar border parted open just enough for the ark to move out, showing the extent of the control Seldanna was exerting on the fragment. </p><p>Just like that, we were floating in the Primordial Aether. I pushed the Ark to go at maximum speed, each second melting the surface of the Ark. I watched the artifact that the Eternals had been using to connect two planes to see if they would notice such a big commotion. </p><p>It didn’t seem like they did, but even if they did, it wouldn’t matter. I could feel that the planar fragments were already close enough to exert some kind of magical pull on each other. </p><p>The Ark cut through Primordial Aether, each second further breaking the defensive structure. “Do you think we’ll be able to reach the other side safely,” Seldanna asked. </p><p>It was not a bad question. Made purely from Nature mana, I doubted the Ark could last another minute. And, even if Primordial Aether behaved somewhat normal near planar bodies, there was no guarantee that a sudden chaotic wave wouldn’t have extended the distance by a few minutes … or hours. </p><p>“Don’t worry. I can always cheat,” I reminded her. </p><p>“Good,” she said even as her avatar reached and squeezed my hand. </p><p>Then, we hit the planar border of the undead Domain. </p><p>The moment the contact occurred, I felt the mana at the planar border shift and solidify. The speed at the border transformed was incredible. The mana pushed against the Ark. It wasn’t as destructive as Primordial Aether, but it didn’t need to be. All they needed was to keep us out for a minute, and the environment would do the rest. </p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t have the time. It might have been different if they expected a counter-attack, but they did not. The Ark had already rammed through the border before they could start reacting, costing them precious moments. </p><p>We pushed through the border, and entered the plane. </p><p>Into the domain of a true necrotic god. </p><p>The easy part was over. </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 62</p><p>Endurance: 73      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 58,410}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>Mia was not an easy woman to surprise. After all, she was a self-actualized woman who managed to build an incredible business that was rapidly becoming one of the most successful agencies in the state, not to mention beautiful and confident. </p><p>But, she felt that she had lost some of her famous control since she had decided to pull a pretty incredible prank to trick Madam Paisley about the process. All she needed was to claim Darion was her boyfriend, and let her have some fun. </p><p>And, it wasn’t like she was doing a disservice to Darion. Along with the money she planned to offer to him to play along, the situation also offered quite a bit of fun. She might have a taste for domination, but that didn’t change the fact that Madam Paisley was still drop-dead gorgeous. </p><p>Things had worked excellently during the sea show. Of course, Mia didn’t dare to get closer, and when she stopped swimming, Madam Paisley was already gone. But she got the deal, meaning she was satisfied. </p><p>If she was being honest, Mia liked the idea of Darion being dominated. It was a good revenge after the price he demanded. A price that was fun for her to pay … but that didn’t change the fact that it was humiliating. </p><p>However, her ability to stay calm was destroyed handily when the bathroom door opened, revealing Darion and Paisley, naked and hugging. It wasn’t their pornographic state that surprised Mia. It was what she assumed was happening when Darion followed her. The fact that they were using the staff bathroom was a bit confusing, but understandable from the perspective of looking for a private spot. </p><p>What truly surprised Mia was the nature of their state. Darion hugged Madam Paisley from behind, drilling repeatedly with a smirk on his face, while Madam Paisley wore an expression of pleasure of shame, one that implied that she had lost all control. </p><p>Mia could read that expression. It was the same expression Mia had after Darion left her office after their deal… </p><p>“Hi, honey. You don’t mind, do you?” Darion said, breaking the silence … well, silence if she discounted Paisley’s desperate moans. </p><p>“I … mind,” Mia said, stammering uncharacteristically. But, seeing Madam Paisley, the woman who left her mark on the business world was surprising. </p><p>“Of course. You’re my girlfriend, after all. It’s normal for you to be weak enough not to watch it, even if you’re the one who traded me away. Don’t you think so, Madam Paisley,” he said, his voice mocking. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she moaned, avoiding Mia’s gaze. </p><p>Mia would have left, but being called weak annoyed her … especially right after that whore Gina claimed the same. She said nothing, but caught his gaze, showing that she had no intention of leaving. </p><p>Also, if she were being honest to herself, watching Paisley being dominated even worse than herself felt good. </p><p>“Excellent, but let’s make you fit in,” Darion said. </p><p>“What—“ Mia said, but before she could even finish it, he reached and pulled her dress down. “Hey,” she continued. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie. You don’t want Madam Paisley to feel self-conscious, do you?” Darion said, like that was even a possibility with the way he was invading her from behind. Mia knew very well how effective it was to forget everything. </p><p>Mia looked at the mirror, realizing that she was in an incredibly disadvantageous position. Not physically, but mentally. If she were to have any hope of controlling the warped deal between them, getting away was the better idea. But staying had its benefits as well…</p><p>She turned her back, but before she could make a decision, Paisley coughed. A cough that sounded suspiciously like a coward. </p><p>“Of course, I’ll stay,” Mia said as she pushed her dress down. Paisley must have been dreaming if she thought she was still intimidating in her current state. “Now, let me help,” she said as she moved in front of Paisley’s naked body, ready to help. </p><p>Darion lifted Paisley’s leg, giving Mia even better access as she slid underneath, using both her tongue and her finger aggressively to trigger her moans, their desperate nature making her feel even more incredible. </p><p>“Come on, Paisley. Mia did the generous thing and shared with me. Why don’t you pay her back,” he said. </p><p>Mia stood up, and Paisley started licking her nipples, making her moan in desire. Paisley certainly knew how to use her tongue… With that, Mia abandoned herself to pleasure, cycling between poses, their pleasure lasting for almost an hour. </p><p>She was just glad that they weren’t caught.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Even as Tara dashed upstairs and I started walking toward the door to open it before they broke it down, I couldn’t help but wonder whether they actually had a secret camera installed. </p><p>It was hard to explain their horrible timing otherwise. </p><p>I ignored my initial reflex of ignoring the situation and calling Tara back for the celebration of my invention. It wasn’t the first cocktail I invented, but the others barely deserved the name compared to that one. Sweet and sharp, with a lot of hidden depth that turned the sharpness into velvety obedience, the secretary was a cocktail that reflected Tara perfectly. </p><p>Too bad our celebration was interrupted. </p><p>As I walked toward the door, I wondered about who was my surprise rude guests. My first guess was the men of the Slasher, here for revenge for the last night … but I dismissed that soon. It might still be his men, but if they were here for revenge, they would have broken the door, or torched the place directly. </p><p>Knocking the door insistently was rude, not murderous. </p><p>I shifted the gun to the side slightly, safely hidden outside their view, but ready to be pulled in case of a threatening move. With Tara ready to intervene the moment I called, I shouldn’t be under too much risk, but that didn’t make extra safety measures a bad idea. </p><p>When I opened the door, I barely held back from cursing. It was four goons, wearing the colors of the Slasher, which would have been bad enough. </p><p>But I recognized two of them. One of the three was one of the goons from the night before, looking at me suspiciously enough to suggest that he remembered coming to my bar … but confused enough to suggest he had trouble putting the details together. </p><p>I wondered whether the blow to the head or the alcohol did the trick. </p><p>Worse, he wasn’t the one that made me feel alarmed when I noticed him. </p><p>“Oh, Jason, long time no see,” said the other one I had recognized. </p><p>Tyler, arguably the most annoying person I had ever met, his natural bullying tendencies were only weaker by his cowardice. He was a waiter at one of the bars I had occasionally worked. Saying that we were not on good terms would be an exaggeration. As a cowardly bully, he was quick to realize messing with me wouldn’t help. </p><p>Instead, he tried to befriend me, which was, unfortunately, almost as annoying as being a target of his bullying. </p><p>However, as he stood in front of me, the sycophant expression he often wore in front of me was nowhere to be seen, replaced by one that he no doubt thought as sharp and domineering like a bloodied assassin, but it reminded me of a playground bully. </p><p>Even the source of his sudden confidence was clear. A ceremonial knife that was hanging on his belt, was designed as a simplified version of the blade that the Slasher famously used. </p><p>Marking him as a unit leader. The blade was brand new, and adding in the fact that he was touching it repeatedly, it implied that his promotion was very recent. </p><p>He was likely promoted because of the losses the Slasher received during his retreat, and I further suspected one of the higher-ranking lieutenants promoted him because he was easy to control. Unfortunately, Tyler lacked the understanding of such nuances, and looked at me proudly like I was just a bug. </p><p>“Yes, Tyler, long time no see,” I repeated, giving a cool, calculated response, showing that I had no intention of pulling back. </p><p>Tyler flinched a bit, looking around as if to make sure I was alone before he looked at me again, his beady eyes looked at me even more sharply. </p><p>I hated doing so, but that was the only thing I could do. If it was someone else, I was willing to play the obedient bar owner, acting warm and welcoming, maybe plying them with drinks to keep them entertained. </p><p>Unfortunately, it wouldn’t work with Tyler. He was the kind of bully who didn’t know when to stop, and with his new position, he would push too much, to the point of humiliation to pay for my past disrespect. </p><p>It was unpalatable, but if it wasn’t for one important detail, I might have considered that. </p><p>Tara, watching the situation from upstairs. She was a submissive girl whose attraction was more about my facade than any real loyalty. Maybe it would be different in the future, but for the moment, she was the good girl who had just started to ride behind the bike of the school’s bad boy. </p><p>She would have accepted me getting beaten and defeated — especially against four — but the same didn’t work for bowing and scraping. </p><p>It was hard to respect a sycophant. </p><p>So, I leaned against the bar, making no move to bring them any drinks, or even show them seats. I might have spat on Tyler’s face before his new position, and he would have gotten less angry. The other two goon was not too different either. </p><p>Only the unfortunate repeat visitor had an expression, but the others missed it. </p><p>“I see you have finally found a place that truly reflects your abilities as a bartender,” he said, snickering like he had just delivered an amazing joke. It earned two fake laughs from the goons, the kind that employees delivered when their boss made a joke regardless of the humor of the sentence. </p><p>“Clever as always, Tyler,“ I said, my deadpan voice leaving absolutely no doubt about the disrespect in my tone. </p><p>“Oh, really,” he growled, trying to sound threatening even as he gestured to his goons, and they took a step forward. </p><p>I hated that pushing a physical confrontation was the best solution I was able to come up with. Unfortunately, the appearance of an old acquaintance ruined every single tentative plan I had. </p><p>“Really. Maybe you should try a career as a true villain. Laughman. Plug your ears, or you’ll piss your pants.” </p><p>“It’s good that living in squalor didn’t cure your arrogance, Jason,” he said, trying to keep calm, but halfway in, it turned into a growl that would have been threatening if it had come from someone else. “I always hated you turning your nose at me like you are better than me. It’ll be fun to stomp that out.” He turned to one of his goons, and gave an order. “Start breaking chairs.” </p><p>Amusingly, he chose the one that had been doing his best to stay out, which meant he chose the one that had attacked the bar the last night. He didn’t move, his expression conflicted. “I see that you’re as useless as always,” I said. </p><p>He turned to his goon. “What are you waiting for!” Tyler growled. </p><p>He said nothing. “Why don’t you ask him what had happened when he tried to break in before,” I told him, making the goon look at me in shock. </p><p>“T-that happened?” the goon asked me, hesitant. </p><p>Tyler missed the undertone and gestured to one of the others. “You, start breaking—“ he started, turning his back to me. </p><p>I really didn’t want to do what I was about to do. I had been hoping that Tyler, despite his stupidity, would realize that there was something wrong with the reaction of the goon. Or the goon would be smart enough to say something. </p><p>What could one expect from the men who thought that not only being henchmen was a good career choice, but was also stupid enough to join one of the weakest villains. </p><p>I pulled a gun and fired, aiming right between his feet, the bullet buried into the floor. He jumped in fear, while the goons retreated as well. A horrible choice. I wasn’t a combat expert, but even I knew that locked between four, and turning into a melee was their biggest advantage. </p><p>It seemed that the Slasher’s henchmen situation was even worse than I had assumed. </p><p>“Touch that gun, and you collect your brain from the floor,” I said. </p><p>“You’re crazy,” Tyler gasped, too shocked to hold his tongue. “Do you know what the Slasher will do to you for challenging him,” he said. </p><p>I corrected my thoughts once more. Apparently, it wasn’t shock that kept his tongue going, but the confidence he had for his boss. A stupid call, as even if I pulled the gun due to sheer reflex, once threatened by a villain famous for his violent retaliations, the best thing would be to kill them and run away. </p><p>One of the goons realized that, his expression turning into abject terror, tensing for a suicide rush before I killed them. I caught his gaze and shook my head with a sharp smile even as I pulled out my phone with my empty hand. </p><p>“It’s your lucky day, boys. Your stupid leader didn’t get you all killed,” I said as I typed a quick message to Tara. “Leave your weapons and your money, and you can leave.” They quickly put everything on the floor, except Tyler who still had a small bag in hand. “That as well,” I said as I shook my gun threateningly. </p><p>“You can’t be serious, this is the money we collected for the boss,” he said. </p><p>“I am. Now, you can treat it as a tribute he paid to my boss,” I said. “After all, we were here first.” </p><p>“What do you—“ he started, before it was interrupted by a horrible screeching sound. He dropped his bag in fear.</p><p>“Let’s go and see what it was,” I said as I herded them out. Outside, they gasped in shock. The street was empty other than their car. “Nice convertible,” I chuckled even as I looked at the hood, violently ripped by Tara — who was already back in her room, watching the situation from the window, peeking from the curtain. </p><p>“You — how,” Tyler gasped. </p><p>“You’re not the only one that works for a villain, and unlike yours, mine was kind enough to assign me a proper bodyguard,” I said. “Now, I would prefer if you don’t mention this event to your boss. We want to stay hidden, and getting rid of an annoying fly would bring us too much attention.” Then, I paused as I looked at the discarded hood. “But, feel free to try us if you think your bones are stronger than your car.” </p><p>With that, I turned and walked back into the bar. </p><p>Wishing that I was halfway as confident as I was trying to look. </p>",

    "content": "<p>For all her power, Tara was unable to suppress her trembles as she stood in front of her boss. </p><p>Trembling of excitement…</p><p>For a while, he said as he examined her from the other side, the bar adding to the sense of authority he was radiating once he grabbed a couple of bottles and some fresh produce to mix a cocktail skillfully without even looking at the blade once, making her even more excited. </p><p>It wasn’t the threat of the blade, which was less threatening than a toothpick had been before her awakening, but the utter confidence he was radiating as he worked. </p><p>He was in total control, just like he was in the bedroom, and that drove her crazy even more than his skillful fingers and his handsome face… </p><p>“We really need to go shopping soon. Those scraps are hardly enough to highlight your incredible beauty,” he said, making her blush. Even though it was technically an insult to her outfit, she didn’t care much about that. She knew that she dressed poorly — growing up in a ranch was hardly something that gave her a great fashion sense, and her lack of money didn’t help — so she chose to focus on the important part. </p><p>That she had an incredible beauty. </p><p>“Now, let’s get rid of that ugly stuff,” he said, and her blush covered her whole body. She wanted to look at the door once more, to make sure it was properly shut, but under his sharp gaze, she found that very difficult to achieve. It was a silent order to just follow his request. </p><p>Her body reacted in autopilot assassin she reached to her back, unhooking her bra to let it fall on the floor like her other pieces. It wasn’t the first time he saw her breasts, but she was still able to see excitement added to his sharp gaze, which was far better than any compliment. </p><p>She pushed her panties down as well, once again standing in front of him, naked. “Inspiring,” he said, his soft tone enough to send shivers through her body. She managed to keep down a whimper, but only through sheer force of will. </p><p>As he worked on a cocktail, she said nothing, letting him enjoy her nudity without restriction. </p><p>It was hard to stand naked like that. A part of her wanted her to raise her arms to cover her body, gaining at least a part of her modesty back. </p><p>A bigger part of her wanted her to destroy the bar with a kick to close the distance and beg him to start working on her beautiful body. </p><p>She ignored both, standing obediently as he worked, though that didn’t prevent her from swallowing hard repeatedly in an effort to maintain her semblance of control. Of all the process, he spoke only once more, and that was to order her to not avoid his gaze. </p><p>It was even harder than the nudity. His gaze was hard to resist. His brown eyes had a way of giving the impression that he was not only looking at her eyes but also at her soul, like it was impossible to hide anything from him. Being exposed like that was harder than being exposed physically. </p><p>She loved it … but only because it was her boss. </p><p>“And, finished,” he said after he added some spice to the cocktail and stirred shortly. “Come here and taste my newest invention.” </p><p>With his order, she walked slowly around the bar, doing her best to walk just like he had taught her, ignoring her desire to run desperately — or worse, jump over the bar. She was his secretary. She needed to be calm and collected. </p><p>Though, his small smirk, dark, seductive, and amused at the same time, told her that he knew exactly what she was thinking. That she was just a farm girl who was trying to imitate poise and grace. Of course, once her doubts started to speak, the louder, darker voices joined in. </p><p>Voices that told her that she was worthless. That he would soon get bored of her and kick her out. That he would find a better secretary and demote her…</p><p>Then, he spoke. “You’re mine.” </p><p>She trembled as those two words hit her, her doubts disappearing as quickly as they appeared. Those words were not a request, or even an invitation. It was just a statement of fact, one that told her that she had no choice on the matter, that he would never let her go. </p><p>She loved it. </p><p>She stood in front of him, raising her head to catch her gaze. “Now, better,” he said as he pushed the glass toward her. “Taste it. Take a sip,” </p><p>She followed his order without even blinking. She was never a fan of alcohol, the sharp and bitter taste tickling her tongue annoyingly. She drank even less after her powers since it was near impossible to get even tipsy, let alone drunk.</p><p>But, it was an order from her boss, so she followed it. Her slight discomfort was not important. </p><p>Then, she took a sip. </p><p>And, a unique aroma exploded on her tongue. Her eyes widened even as she processed a taste she had never experienced before, the acidic sharpness of fruits mixing with the alcohol, creating that would have been overbearing if it wasn’t for the subtle tingling of several spices somehow connecting two tastes. </p><p>It was the most delicious thing she had ever tasted. </p><p>She found herself lost in another conflict.  She wanted to raise the glass and slam it back at once, draining it immediately. </p><p>She also wanted to take the smallest sip possible, savoring the taste forever. </p><p>Ultimately, she did none of them, and just put the glass down. He ordered her to take a sip, so she took a sip. </p><p>“I see that you enjoyed it,” he said. </p><p>“Delicious,” she said as she nodded shyly. </p><p>“Hmm, interesting,” he said. “Maybe I should take a taste as well,” he said, his tone surprisingly tingly as he said that. </p><p>She was surprised when he suddenly pushed her against the counter until she was lying on her back, though that mystery was resolved quickly. He poured some into her bellybutton before slowly sipping it, his lips leaving a tingling sensation on her belly. </p><p>“Hmm, delicious indeed,” he said, then smiled. “And, I already have a name for it.” </p><p>“W-what’s the name, sir?” she asked helplessly as she trembled. </p><p>“Do you want to guess?” he asked. She shook her head. She didn’t want to guess. “Very well. It’s the secretary, named after my Muse.” </p><p>Earlier, his lips made her belly tingly. But, his words made her whole body tingly. An invention that was named after her, one that belonged only to her. </p><p>The greatest gift she had ever received. </p><p>“Let’s give you another sip,” he said. </p><p>If it wasn’t for her ingrained obedience, she would have protested intensely. The cocktail was amazing. On that, there was no doubt, but she needed something else at this moment. </p><p>And she needed desperately. </p><p>Then, a moment later, she realized that she had nothing to worry about, as rather than bringing the glass to her lips, he took a sip himself. Then, rather than swallowing, he leaned over her. </p><p>She gulped. Even if she was stupid enough to miss the meaning of his actions, there was no mistaking the light in his eyes. He was about the feed her the best way possible. Her heart danced wildly as he pressed his lips against hers, making her tremble excitedly and in desperation. </p><p>His lips landed on hers, teaching her that there were things that were even more delicious than the earlier taste. Such as, the same cocktail, accompanied by the precious tongue of her boss, the dance of her tongues allowing the taste to infuse her tongue even more.</p><p>It was a delicious taste that lingered on her tongue persistently while he continued to hover above her, the height difference and the position enhancing the sensation of being domineered even further. </p><p>The fact that she didn’t have any clothing to shield her even nominally didn’t help any as his lips continued to dance over hers, driving her deeper and deeper into the land of pleasure. She was about to lose any sense of control until —</p><p>Her beautiful haze was destroyed by a loud, insistent knock on the door. They weren’t trying to break the door … but they weren’t trying to break it either. </p><p>She suddenly felt angry, wanting to go and teach them the risks of being rude. Unfortunately, she wasn’t dressed appropriately. She looked at her boss, hoping that he would order her to dress and deal with them. </p><p>However, when she caught his expression, she realized that the issue might not be as simple as she thought. His expression was sharp and tense, signaling that it was not just a random thug. </p><p>“Go upstairs and change. Jeans, a jacket, and make sure to wear that mask,” he ordered, his voice sharper than ever, without any hint of levity. “And, unless I call for you, don’t intervene.” </p><p>She immediately followed his order, stopping only to pick up her discarded clothes before she dashed upstairs. </p><p>It was work time. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“And, this is the third floor, mostly used as offices and other comfortable features,” Carol said as she gestured elegantly, doing her best to replicate a seasoned real estate agent. Admittedly, the way she walked us around was certainly believable. </p><p>I suspected she had a lot of practice, though more likely showing the guests around her own house rather than making random trips around. </p><p>“A bit boring, isn’t it,” Nicole said, making Carol look frustrated. Not that I blamed her, as I lost count of the times Nicole found a fault in what Carol showed around. Carol didn’t say anything. First, as a real estate agent, antagonizing the customer was never a good idea. More importantly, Carol clearly assumed that Nicole was a spoiled model, acting like spoiled models do whenever they weren’t hanging around with rich people. </p><p>That was wildly inaccurate, of course. Not that the models didn’t act spoiled, but the way they acted out was often far more annoying. </p><p>Constant hunger didn’t work well with the nerves. </p><p>Nicole, on the other hand, reminded me more of a hard-to-please teacher going through the project of a student she didn’t particularly like. A personality that fitted her unique brand of beauty far more. She certainly had the assets to look like a teacher who tortured every teenage student with her sheer presence.</p><p>Maybe I should have a private shoot dressing her as a teacher. It would be fun. </p><p>“It’s better to be boring. It means we can we don’t have to work hard to decide what to keep and what to give away. We will just renovate the place completely.” </p><p>“Makes sense,” Nicole said, though as I set up the light, she walked forward without my prompting, and gave me several sexy poses. They were helpful for me to better understand the lighting of the rooms, but Nicole pushed far more intensely than necessary. </p><p>Another tool to further annoy Carol. </p><p>For such a calm and kind woman, she could be surprisingly vindictive when she found the opportunity to strike back — albeit, I knew that was only happening because I was with her. She lacked the personality to push her like this alone. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>Finding a new studio was important, and I shouldn’t have let things go that far, I really shouldn’t. But I couldn’t help. </p><p>Watching Nicole like that was too entertaining. </p><p>“And, that was the last room,” Carol said. “What do you think?” </p><p>“I don’t know, it feels too much work. There’s a lot of renovations required. Do we have time to do so?” </p><p>I smiled, ready to intervene. As much as I wanted her to see her act out a bit, I had no intention of turning down the warehouse. It looked rough, but the building itself was strong and clean. The building was ugly, extremely so, but that was not exactly a problem with all the shoots happening in sets. </p><p>“It’s not a problem. I can handle the renovation myself,” Carol offered. </p><p>“Really,” Nicole said, not bothering to hide her dismissive glare. “You?” </p><p>“Y-yeah, I have an undergraduate in interior design, and my roommate is a contractor. Together, we can renovate this place far better than any design company … and for cheaper,” she offered. </p><p>Nicole seemed ready to reject, but I caught her gaze and subtly shook my head. It might be fun to tease her relentlessly, but we needed a team quickly, and I was willing to test her. </p><p>Whatever the reason, everything about her told me that she was desperate for work, and such people would often do better work than the alternative. More importantly, there was no pesky infrastructure work to be done, meaning her tastes as a rich person would surely be useful. </p><p>And, if I were being honest, I was also curious about her circumstances, and it might allow me to dig a bit more. </p><p>“Maybe,” Nicole said as she looked at her. “But do you even know what kind of unique needs for a photo studio. Why shouldn’t we hire an expert.” </p><p>Not a bad point, but unfortunately, we weren’t in New York or LA, and finding a contractor expert on building sets was impossible. Yet, before I could say anything, Carol answered. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I have done some modeling. I’m not a complete newbie.” </p><p>“Prove it,” Nicole said, which was surprising enough, then she turned to me. “Give me the camera,” she asked. </p><p>I passed to her without worry. First, because she wasn’t Penny, therefore I wasn’t afraid of her dropping it immediately. Also, even if she did, it didn’t matter. Our next destination was an electronic shop in the nearest decently large city to buy a complete set of new equipment. </p><p>With money finally flowing, I needed some real equipment. </p><p>“Now, give me a simple pose, relax your shoulders,” Nicole ordered, doing her best to sound confident and commanding. </p><p>She was clearly trying to copy my attitude. Unfortunately, it didn’t work on her as well as she had hoped. It looked too fake. </p><p>Carol clearly didn’t miss that, or the fact that I was the real decision-maker. She followed Nicole’s command and posed. </p><p>To my surprise, it was not half bad. I watched from the side as Nicole gave a few more orders — mostly parroting the kind of commands I used during her shoots regardless of their fitting — and Carol followed those with a smoothness that surprised me. </p><p>It makes me wonder exactly how good she would be in a proper set. </p><p>However, I didn’t make an immediate offer. I could simply observe her during the renovation. </p><p>I said nothing, more than willing to waste some time to keep Nicole happy. Unfortunately for her, Carol didn’t share that opinion. More importantly, she was clearly sharp enough to catch that I was mostly indulging Nicole during the whole process. </p><p>Meaning, she could strike back. </p><p>It started with a naughty smile as she got rid of her strikingly bright blazer, leaving only her blouse, which fit her well despite the signs of fraying at the edge. However, even when she leaned forward to enhance her cleavage, Nicole didn’t realize she was being played. </p><p>Only when she reached and pulled her bra through her cleavage, Nicole realized it might not be the best way to take revenge. Carol caught that, her instincts were clearly sharp from all the position jockeying the rich people committed as a lifestyle, attacked to prevent Nicole from preventing that. “You don’t mind that, do you, miss model? I know you need to have various outfits to better understand the behavior of the light.” </p><p>It was not necessary, but Nicole didn’t know that. “Y-yeah, of course,” she said, moving around with the camera, her movement displaying her beautiful legs perfectly. “Go ahead.” </p><p>“Perfect,” Carol said as she turned her back, and pulled off her shirt with one smooth move, showing her naked back to us. I had to admit, she looked absolutely beautiful. Enough that, with the competency she had been displaying, I marked her with another potential model. </p><p>Nicole realized things were going too far in a number of ways. When she made Carol pose, she was hoping to hold the upper hand, thinking that she would effortlessly find the same balance I managed to conjure. </p><p>Big mistake. </p><p>A bigger mistake was not saying anything when Carol put on her red blazer once again without saying anything, assuming that it would be enough. </p><p>It wasn’t.</p><p>When Carol turned toward us, her blazer was barely able to cover her areolas. “What do you think? An interesting picture, right?” she asked. </p><p>“Y-yeah,” Nicole blushed, realizing that she was losing control. And, lost in her thoughts, she missed the smug, confident grin she shared with me. However, it wasn’t the kind of grin that shared amusement, but one that conveyed superiority. </p><p>A part of it was clearly her rich personal habits, which were clearly not that far back. But, the moment she hit me with that grin, I realized that she had misunderstood my interactions with Nicole. I had been playing along with her demands to foster a little aggression. </p><p>Carol clearly assumed that it was because I had a weaker personality. </p><p>How interesting. </p><p>Then, something even more amusing happened. She started walking toward me, her steps making her blazer shift a bit to give a glimpse of her areolas. When she reached for me, she grabbed my hand and dragged me to the center of the room. “Having two people creating shadows is a much better way to assess the lighting of a room,” she said as she turned to Nicole, not even asking for my opinion. </p><p>Nicole looked at me, but I shook my head subtly, telling her not to intervene and just play along. A flash of jealousy passed through her face, but Nicole was far too submissive for that to prevent her from obeying. </p><p>Carol assumed it was her desire to win that kept her going. A dangerous assumption. </p><p>I wasn’t going to intervene in their little fight for power … but since Carol decided to involve me… </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>As I faced my System’s request for my Intent, I decided that breaking into a public library was an acceptable risk when compared to twiddling my thumbs, and waiting for an opportunity. Hopefully, with a computer, I would be able to solve that problem quickly… </p><p>Luckily, while the System had indicated some damage, there was no drop when it came to my abilities, and breaking into a library was far easier than escaping from a military zone. A little parkour climb, a little lock picking, and I was looking at a public computer, excited to go to the internet. </p><p>Only to freeze in shock. </p><p>The internet was gone. </p><p>Well, not entirely gone, just significantly limited. There was no social media, no easily streamable movies, and nothing that required a lot of bandwidth. The news sites were still accessible but they were far more barebones…</p><p>The reason for it wasn’t hard to discover. There were several news that were talking about attacks on the fiber underground cables that handled most of the information flow. </p><p>“That’s not good,” I growled, realizing that, with the social media gone, I had lost my biggest tool to quickly farm Intent. </p><p>Still, poking around the news sites was an option; or at least, that was what I thought as I started to check the internet protocols that managed the security, only to find them completely changed. </p><p>They were far more secure, and far easier to track. With my Divine Mind working at full speed, I processed the implications of those changes, and realized that hacking had turned into a near impossibility. </p><p>The implications were dangerous but understandable. In a world where people could turn attention and worship into magical power, the internet and social media have been dangerous weapons. </p><p>Someone had removed that weapon from the table, using terrorism as an excuse. </p><p>Of course, understandably didn’t mean acceptable. It ruined my whole plan. </p><p>I tried my best to go through all readily available information on the new state, trying to understand what I could do. Unfortunately, they had been very careful. Even the simplest bread and butter of the digital world, the mass spam email, had been blocked due to the protocol changes.</p><p>“I need to find a different path,” I murmured, soon coming to my first, and probably the most important dilemma. </p><p>Should I ditch my identity and create a new one, or find a way to explain my long absence. </p><p>Ditching my identity and creating a new one, maybe as a very active hero was tempting … on the surface. After all, the path was clear. Save a few kittens, pose a few times for local news, and that was it.</p><p>Unfortunately, while the world of heroes looked wild and uncontrolled, with all the information I had, I knew better. It was clear that some secret organizations like the Ancient Brotherhood or some other entities that knew about the return of the magic had been preparing for a long time. </p><p>Assuming they wouldn’t react to the sudden appearance of a new hero was a risky proposition. </p><p>Which brought me back to my real identity, which was surprisingly viable. Especially since at least two organizations knew about the existence of my abilities — very limitedly — and yet didn’t do anything other than one aborted attempt to kidnap me. </p><p>Add in my local celebrity status that could help me to get some exposure which could give me an advantage, showing myself looked like the better option. More importantly, even if my local celebrity status was forgotten, I could pull many more tricks if I wasn’t completely trying to my identity. </p><p>Of course, it was risky, but no more riskier than trying to hide my identity. Without the System’s urgent request of Intent for maintenance, I might have measured the risks of the two situations differently. In that case, staying hidden while I worked slowly and steadily would have been the better option. </p><p>But there was no point in thinking in hypotheticals. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case, and I had nothing to change that fact. </p><p>At least, I could always try to escape if that didn’t work. </p><p>“Now, let’s go find a reason for disappearing for years,” I said as I poked around the city map, registering the changes while I tried to find a good reason. “Why ignore the classics,” I murmured as my gaze fell on a certain building. </p><p>A hospital. </p><p>I left the library behind even as I tried to decide the best way to explain such a situation. Staying in a coma for years was a nice, convincing story for the public. The secret organizations might poke a bit more about that, but considering they treated me as mostly inconsequential even then, I hoped that I wouldn’t be important enough to get on their radar. </p><p>Of course, that required to have a good story — which could be created by some hacking. </p><p>Not through the internet, as that path was frustratingly blocked, but luckily, the computers were still in use, and that meant I could still go and create some physical reports. </p><p>My first target was an empty apartment that I could break into easily. A quick shower and a change of clothes later, I was moving through the dark streets far more confidently, wearing a baseball cap to keep my face hidden from the security cameras. </p><p>Then, I went to the biggest hospital in the city, which was, unfortunately, far more crowded than I would have preferred, the corridors were filled with nurses and doctors, even the record room and archive, making sneaking in a challenge. </p><p>My first objective was the digital records, which was easy. I changed into a patient gown and put on a mask before I started walking around, searching for a computer. </p><p>Any computer. Internet security might have changed radically, but ironically, that made the network security for linked computers even weaker. Some of the security issues were truly glaring. Remotely accessing the computer of a doctor was easy. </p><p>I started reading through the files of the coma patients, and at the same time, I wrote an extended story for myself, one that said that I had been discovered during the terrorist attack, near the stadium, but with serious head trauma. Then, I was transported to a hospital — a different one —  with a request for identification … one that had never received a response from the police despite five different requests with no follow-up. </p><p>Of course, adjusting the digital timestamps on those reports was the true challenge, but luckily, the lapsing security measures made it very easy. Twenty minutes later, I was the proud owner of a credible fake history. </p><p>Admittedly, it was very close to the truth with one exception. I was not buried under rubble in a military-restricted zone. </p><p>A little more poking around, and soon, I had a convincing story that could trick anyone unless they really went deep. Unfortunately, that was not something I could solve. All they would need to do was to send a private investigator to talk with one of the doctors on the report, and would know the truth. </p><p>Still, it should be enough for my purposes. With the world in its current state, it should be enough. If it didn’t work I might try to reach Thad or Arthur depending on the situation … but hopefully, it wouldn’t be necessary. </p><p>I rather not rely on anyone else. My System was already giving me all the unpredictability I was willing to handle and more. </p><p>After that was complete, I created a few new reports, including one transfer report that showed a nameless patient just being admitted and waiting for a room assignment. With that done, I created a detailed paper record as well, but kept that with me rather than trying to sneak it to the archive. </p><p>Then, I added one last spike that temporarily disabled the cameras that were observing the cameras that were keeping corridors I planned to use under observation, and then moved there. Avoiding the gazes of the nurses while I stole a small bracelet was easy. I filled that with my patient number, and hung the paper chart that showed my supposed situation to the head of my bed. </p><p>And lay on the bed, seemingly unconscious. </p><p>A minute later, a nurse arrived at my side. “Huh, was there a patient there,” she murmured, but after checking my chart, she shrugged and took a step away, clearly too exhausted to actually care about the situation. </p><p>Just like that, the first step of my plan was complete. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I didn’t miss this mess,” I murmured as I found myself floating in the Primordial Aether, the main material plane under me, about to disappear the moment I stepped out of its range and found myself in the chaotic flow of the rest, Mariel safely with me in the ward. </p><p>I said nothing else as I waited until the first beacon was launched. The magical location was clear. More importantly, the Eternals didn’t suddenly come rushing, allowing me to mark it as a tentative success. With that, I let the chaos of the Primordial Aether drag me away…</p><p>Luckily, it wouldn’t last for months, unlike my boring, extended swim through Primordial Aether while I hung onto the Eternal ship. </p><p>I had a permanent, unbreakable connection with Seldanna. It wouldn’t have been enough to find her location in the Primordial Aether despite the strength of our connection if that was all. But, Seldanna was fully merged with her plane as well. </p><p>And, that was much easier to locate. </p><p>That, along with Seldanna’s ability to send me some rudimentary messages through our connection — enough to denote an alarm — I was able to leave her alone for months without being bothered. All the while, the only interesting thing was the Eternals skipping the date I had given to them while disguised as the ancient god of nature, despite the explicit threat of not dealing with them anymore if they skipped it. </p><p>Lucky. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t stupid enough to miss the fact that their lack of communication had some dangerous implications, but considering the number of issues I was trying to address, I was willing to exchange long-term dangers with short-term calm. </p><p>Not exactly the healthiest of decision-making, but the best I could do under the circumstances. </p><p>It was a pity that I couldn’t use the same trick to find Helga, and therefore the material plane. The darkness wards we used to hide her from the System had that inconvenient side effect. </p><p>Thinking of Helga, I reached for the Knowledge Spark I took from her, trying to use it to solve a magical problem. Unfortunately, while it helped, its help was far less sublime without her presence. It still helped somewhat, but its advantages overlapped with Intelligence too much to measure accurately. </p><p>Of course, Primordial Aether was complicated and treacherous enough that even with a strong beacon, it still took two days for me to reach my destination. Far better than the months the earlier trip had consumed. </p><p>The only trouble, was that wasn’t exactly an indicator of how long the next trip would take. It could take half a day, or half a month depending on pure luck. Well, maybe not luck, but I lacked a more detailed understanding of Primordial Aether. </p><p>And, teleporting was certainly not feasible unless I wanted to end up in pieces. </p><p>I wanted to stop by Seldanna first and talk more in detail and share the developments. We had a lot of strategic details to consider, both in terms of the past, and in terms of invading another plane and its potential to trigger the undead forces into other actions … but also, more simply, I missed her. </p><p>It had been months. </p><p>However, those plans disappeared the moment I arrived at the edge of her plane … and met with a nasty surprise. There was another plane orbiting hers. It was a smaller plane, one that was radiating necrotic mana. </p><p>Worse, the sudden orbit was clearly not a coincidence. There was some kind of magical ship between the two planes, one that was almost ten times larger than the trade ship I had been a part of, using some kind of thick magical connection to create a resonance between the two planes, pulling those two closer. </p><p>It was a complicated process, one that used a lot of mana and time, clearly going on for months and required at least another month to complete … but it was surprisingly sneaky. After all, the ability to travel through the Primordial Aether was shockingly rare. </p><p>I was glad that it didn’t require an immediate reaction. I bypassed the planar border easily — reminding my explosive entrance the first time, thrown out violently. </p><p>The moment I entered, I made sure that my surroundings were empty, and then I flared my mana. Immediately, a response appeared, and the plants around me started to grow, the flowers bloomed and floated before coalescing into a familiar figure. </p><p>“I missed you,” she said. </p><p>“Good, I’ll be waiting for you, come here,” I said. Her avatar looked confused, clearly not expecting me to stay near the border, but she trusted me enough to dispel her avatar and start traveling directly. </p><p>She didn’t have the ability to teleport. Luckily, that was not a problem. With a wave of my hand, I created a gate for her to step through, finding her location even easier. </p><p>“You’re here,” she gasped as she jumped into my arms. </p><p>“My beautiful goddess,” I said even as the most amazing flower smell filled my whole being. Coming from her, but also from the environment. And, it wasn’t even a spell or a conscious effort. No, nature itself was reacting to her presence, the plants doing their best to impress her. </p><p>A nature goddess indeed. No wonder my Endurance was continuously improving. She was far more aligned with her Divine identity, no doubt a benefit of assimilating the memory scraps and melding further with her Spark. </p><p>Before I could say anything else, I felt her lips over mine, which tasted all the beautiful fruits at once. It was the best way to be silenced. </p><p>We had a lot of things to talk about, but as I felt her dress, made of flowers and leaves, melt under my touch and reveal her perfect body, I decided that those things could wait a few minutes. </p><p>Then, I felt her rip off my shirt with a shocking passion while her legs wrapped around my waist, and corrected.</p><p>A few hours … half a day at most. </p><p>It didn’t matter much, especially since Mariel was in a stable condition and no urgent event was knocking on my door. Her hips danced, reminding me of her passion, while I shifted my lips to her neck. “Oh, I missed this,” she moaned, while I groaned appreciatively. </p><p>Not to mention, it wasn’t exactly a waste of time. As we kissed, my mana merged with hers … and through her, I could feel the whole plane as a singular entity. </p><p>There, Intelligence showed its biggest benefit. Even as I enjoyed the kiss — and more — to the fullest, I was able to analyze her connection with the plane. A quick burst of mana allowed her to completely merge with the Divine Spark that had been generated in my absence, giving a nice boost to her. Of course, that meant that the empowering fruits the elves were hoping to receive would be delayed a few months. </p><p>But, considering their long lives, such a sacrifice should be an acceptable compromise. “T-that feel great,” Seldanna moaned. “It’s like a headache I didn’t know existed disappeared.” Made sense. More established Gods probably had ways to get rid of the spark they couldn’t merge easily, but Seldanna had yet to develop such a technique. </p><p>Meaning her Divine Entity could get polluted relatively easily. Not in a few weeks or months, but years would certainly be a problem. </p><p>Luckily, I was there to help.   </p><p>“Good for you,” I said as I let my lips drag down, capturing her nipple, and turning her appreciation into another moan. “Now, it’s time to pay the price.” With that, I pushed her down, the grass turning into a thick, comfortable bed before she could even touch the ground. “Now, it’s time to pay the price.” </p><p>Then, I skipped the foreplay completely and slipped inside her. I would have loved to extend it a bit more, but I wanted to reward her for her first time. After all, she had waited for my return patiently for months, when she could easily create a fake emergency to call me while using the Eternals as an excuse. </p><p>“Good goddess,” I said, unable to prevent the humor in my tone completely as I slipped inside. She looked at me in playful anger, but that died quickly as my hips started to move, invading her core just as decisively as my mana invaded her soul. </p><p>She readily accepted both. </p><p>“A good way to apologize for your long absence,” she said, all she could say before a moan exploded, filling the opening along with an instinctive flare of mana. And, just like that, the meadow turned into a wild forest, the trees growing tens of feet in less than a second. </p><p>Making me wonder just how nature would react to her orgasm. Luckily, from the way she clenched around me, I doubted that it would take too long to understand. </p><p>“Do you want it fast, or slow?” I asked despite guessing the answer. </p><p>While she tried to catch her breath to answer, I cupped her breasts, enjoying her moan even as I made it harder for her to answer.</p><p>“J-jerk,” she managed to stammer once I squeezed her nipple, her moan majestic and sexy at the same time. “H-hard,” she added. </p><p>I thought about teasing her, but her begging expression was enough to earn my mercy. “Hard, it is,” I declared as I pushed forward… </p><p>Her cries echoed across the planar fragment… or, at least, that was how it felt.</p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 62</p><p>Endurance: 73      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 58410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>I wanted to punish the crown prince for daring to capture my sexy angel. I even have several ways to deliver such punishment. But, as I dug a tunnel underneath the capital — easily bypassing the magical defenses built to prevent such a problem — to bring her to the safehouse I had established for emergencies, unable to teleport due to her dangerous state, I ignored that desire. </p><p>At this point, revenge wasn’t as important as making sure her problems wouldn’t suddenly explode. The prince was not someone that I would have trouble reaching. I could take him down any time.  </p><p>My focus was on making sure Mariel was safe. </p><p>Even as I created a tunnel to allow a secondary access point to my safe house, I did my best to avoid touching Mariel with my mana, afraid of somehow breaking the fragile balance between the Light and Darkness Sparks. </p><p>Usually, even the mana of different natures didn’t play well together, let alone the Sparks, and I didn’t know why Light and Darkness were the exceptions to that. </p><p>Not that it was the first time I had noticed that. Mariel had been using their opposing nature to keep her own ill-advised step into Divinity in check, preventing her Light spark from burning her body. </p><p>However, I didn’t dare to do anything until I could drag her into the center of the base and activate all the wards. Not just the defensive wards, but dozens and dozens of wards, some arcane while others relied mostly on tantric mana. </p><p>Designed especially to address the Divine Spark-related problems. After seeing Helga’s situation, I expected the others to experience similar problems, and was prepared for the worst. </p><p>Well, what I expected to be the worst. It seemed that I had to revise that estimation downward significantly. I used the wards to carefully examine her situation, trying to come up with a diagnosis. </p><p>There was good news. Well, one of them. </p><p>Against all odds, her situation was stable. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was the extent of what could be termed as good news. I had been hoping to just remove Darkness Spark from her, which would leave her only with her Light Spark. Unfortunately, the two Sparks were even more intertwined than I expected — or even thought to be possible. </p><p>Worse, the Sparks had already mixed with her body, enough to complete her first step into the Godhood, which took the removal of the Divine Spark from her off the table. Divine Spark was not like a mana, and an external source of power that could be added and removed without consequence. </p><p>Divine Spark bonded with the carrier on a fundamental, existential level, requiring a mental alignment while changing the physical parts subtly. It was still possible to reverse it when the bonding process was on the level of Chosen or Demigod, but once the vessel reached Godhood, the issue was far more troubling. </p><p>Worse, I didn’t even know where the changes made of the Divine Spark started and where Mariel’s angel nature ended. After all, she was the only angel I met under non-combat circumstances, and she was already juggling the two opposing Divine Sparks desperately then. </p><p>Making a judgment call about it was difficult. </p><p>I needed someone to help me brainstorm. After casting a few spells to make sure the base was secure and no one was following me, I teleported to Helga — finding it annoying that teleporting her back was equally impossible due to the way she bonded to her domain. </p><p>How frustrating. No wonder gods used avatars often. Unfortunately, the only method we know was too expensive in terms of Divine Spark for Helga to afford — not to mention the disadvantages of using such a method on System space. </p><p>“Still, it’s a good thing that you have found her, right?” Helga said. </p><p>“Certainly better than the alternative,” I answered. “Still, that doesn’t solve our problem. Any ideas?” </p><p>Helga stopped for a second, her beautiful face creased with a frown. Then, she spoke. “How far are you on forging those beacons,” she said. </p><p>I sighed. “So, you have the same idea as me. I was hoping that you would come up with something else.” </p><p>“Maybe if you give me two years and unlimited access to literature on Divine Sparks that the Eternals had collected, but without it, I lack the basis to make any kind of progress on the topic,” she explained. </p><p>I nodded, understanding where she was coming from. Even with all my advantages interacting with Divine Spark, my understanding was very limited, and my approach was blunt. For example, I strongly doubted that copying the draconic method of reinforcing my body with Purified Spark was hardly the most efficient method of strengthening myself … but it was the only method I had. </p><p>In that vein, Helga’s hands were tied as well — and not the fun way. </p><p>Of course, that left another problem, which led to the reason for Helga’s question. I needed to find an unoccupied plane for Mariel to complete her Apotheosis. The trick we used for Helga was beautiful and elegant … but ultimately, it was only possible due to her exceptionally unorthodox Divine Nature, making such a small location viable. </p><p>Using the same trick would waste Mariel’s potential. Assuming that was possible in the first place. </p><p>“Do you think that we could use the same trick we used here for Mariel as an emergency,” I asked. I already guessed the answer, but I wanted to be sure. </p><p>Helga thought about it a bit, then shrugged in defeat. “No, not even if you’re willing to sacrifice the potential. The whole point of my domain is the Darkness Ward hiding me from the System. Mariel has both the Light and the Darkness, either could easily break the ward while she goes through the merging process. And, the less we talk about the potential combination issues, the better.” </p><p>“I see,” I admitted with a soft sigh even as I started walking, and she accompanied me silently. We went toward the forge I had built there. </p><p>The forge wasn’t as big as the one I had in the capital, but since I could use my magic without limit here, it was far more advanced.  </p><p>“What’s your plan?” Helga asked, subdued as she helped me to create a batch of beacons that would hopefully allow me to return faster than my previous attempt. </p><p>“Nothing complicated,” I said, feeling frustrated as well. The last thing I wanted was to leave the main material plane now that everything was in order once again. Unfortunately, that was inevitable. “I’m going to go and do my best to find an unoccupied plane.” </p><p>“And, do you think that’s doable?” Helga asked, realizing the problem. </p><p>“Likely not. So I would probably use Mariel’s light spark as cover to invade one of the weaker undead planes and hope that it would take a while for the Eternals to realize the change.” </p><p>“Not exactly a plan, is it?” Helga said, and I shrugged. Sometimes, that was the best one could do. “How about the beacons?” she asked. </p><p>“That’s a bigger problem. In their current state, they won’t last more than a few minutes unless I embed Tantric Spark in them…” </p><p>“And, that would create too big of a risk of discovery,” she said. </p><p>“Exactly, so I’ll probably create a web of teleportation that allows you to eject those to the Primordial Aether. I’ll also create a pattern that’ll send them out periodically, and I’ll do my best to return in a week or two. But predicting that it’s hard, and I want you to send them out with full power if you face an emergency,” I said. “I don’t want you to take unnecessary risks.” </p><p>She looked frustrated about the need, but luckily, she wasn’t like the others, who might have taken such a thing personally. </p><p>With that, we spent the rest of the day filled with magical research and construction — interrupted by a few quickies. I did my best to perfect the beacon deployment system, which was frustrating as I was struggling to create some kind of magical message that I could detect from a great distance, but at the same time, it needed to avoid the attention of the Eternals. </p><p>But, after some struggle, I managed to create something that I hoped to work, one that relied on creating a very complicated mana flare instead of a better message, one that could easily be written off as background noise by anyone who wasn’t looking for it. </p><p>Hopefully, it would help. At the same time, Helga finished creating a complicated ward that used Light and Darkness mana, balanced by tantric, one that would keep Mariel stable through the chain of teleportations. </p><p>Hopefully. </p><p>“Be careful,” Helga said after placing another kiss on my lips. </p><p>“You too. And, don’t do anything to reveal your location even if you receive a message from others. Just send the signal we arranged, and I’ll return. We can’t risk them baiting you.” </p><p>“Don’t worry too much,” she said with a wet chuckle. I kissed her one last time, and teleported to the capital. Luckily, the prince’s intervention gave a good reason for the disappearance of the master blacksmith. Still, I left a few letters for the apprentices, writing them like I had prepared beforehand. </p><p>Additionally, I had left several messages that could only be read by the girls, using our shared experience as a clue. The messages didn’t say anything other than wait near the capital, in case someone else understood it. </p><p>Then, I teleported to my real destination. </p><p>To Mariel. </p><p>For a moment, I said nothing, examining her beautiful visage and her marred wings. “You’re such a source of trouble,” I said with a chuckle as I started to build the ward Helga had designed around her. “You’re lucky that you’re so pretty. Because you’re the most troublesome one,” I said with a mocking sigh.” </p><p>Then, I grabbed her and teleported away. </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 62</p><p>Endurance: 73      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 58410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Why the hell you drag me here?” said a familiar voice. Mia, Paisley recognized, cursing the fact that it was her. </p><p>She didn’t want to be seen by Mia. Not because she was naked. If that had been a concern, she wouldn’t have invited her to that private beach party. On the contrary, she loved rubbing her victories in. </p><p>However, she didn’t want to show her defeat, especially not when she had an audience. </p><p>She had a reputation to protect.</p><p>“Someone’s getting tense,” Darion whispered to her ear. “Do you want a massage?” </p><p>Paisley opened her mouth, ready to answer negatively, but as his hand started moving on her body, she held it back. His attitude made it clear that he had no intention of listening to her, so why should she bother with it. </p><p>She just stayed silent as his hands explored her body, listening to the discussion. </p><p>“I dragged you here because we can’t risk going to the other bathroom. It’s clear what’s going on,” Gina said.  </p><p>“What’s going on?” Mia asked, sounding determined. </p><p>“You’re selling out your pride, that’s why. I expected better out of my rival than giving out her boyfriend as a party favor. You know she chews out men and spits them out. Do you want a wreck as a boyfriend, or are you planning to dump him once she’s finished?” </p><p>As she listened to the discussion, Paisley couldn’t help but feel relaxed a bit. It was bad that she had lost control, but at least, her reputation was still intact. Maybe, if she could turn the tables — </p><p>“Oh, sweetie. You should know no man loves being neglected,” he whispered as he pushed her against the bathroom wall and grabbed her panties. </p><p>As she felt his fingers around her hips, she adjusted her thoughts. It was probably impossible for her to take control of him, but at least, she could hide the truth. </p><p>Certainly that, she added as he pushed her down, her naked knees pressing to the floor as she found herself in an extremely disadvantageous position. Not only she would serve him like a submissive, but also she had to be careful about not making any sound.</p><p>She could do it. </p><p>She had to do it. </p><p>Her reputation depended on it. </p><p>As his monster-filled her mouth, their unaware guests continued to talk. “I don’t appreciate such claims. I’m not pimping out my boyfriend.” </p><p>“Oh, so you’re saying it’s just incompetence. You haven’t sold him out, but he just wandered away. Do you ever hear yourself…” </p><p>“You’re just jealous because I got a deal despite all the trouble you went with hosting a private event…” </p><p>Paisley would have loved that argument, but at the moment, it felt mocking. It was supposed to show her strength, not work as an unintended mocking while she did her best not to gag on his monster cock like a back alley whore. </p><p>His cock tasted defeat … and the worst thing, she loved it. </p><p>“It’s so amusing to listen to them, right?” he whispered as if it was nothing more important than the weather. Not only he was dominating her, but also he was doing it with shocking ease. </p><p>She needed to find a way to get back the upper hand.  </p><p>“You’re speaking nonsense. I haven’t lost yet,” Gina shouted, which would have been enough to hold Paisley’s attention fully under different circumstances, but she was too busy keeping herself from moaning as he invaded her pussy once more to enjoy that outrage more than a second. </p><p>“Come on, honey, you can moan. I’m sure they will understand a sexy little thing like you can’t resist pleasure for so long.” </p><p>“Go to hell,” Paisley with all the anger she managed to gather … which, admittedly, was not much. Worse, her hips rose slightly in rebellion, allowing him even better access. </p><p>As if her loss required any other evidence. </p><p>Then, Gina started speaking even louder. “Maybe I should have a go with him as well if you’re so freely giving him around. It wouldn’t be anything much for your good college friend, right?” Gina said.</p><p>“Why, so that you can steal another boyfriend. Whore,” Mia shouted back, signaling that there was an even bigger acrimony between them than Paisley had guessed. In any other situation, she would have loved to know that, going as far as inviting Gina for a threesome and sharing the pictures with Mia. </p><p>Poking old wounds was fun. </p><p>Unfortunately, with Darion, any such attempt would end up predictably. </p><p>“S-slow down,” she begged, doing her best to keep her voice down, but failing. She was glad that the bathroom wasn’t very well isolated, and the music from the main hall blocked the sound … well, somewhat. She was still restricted to panting and soft gasps. Anything else would be caught. </p><p>“No, you wanted to borrow me, you borrow full experience. I don’t think my dear girlfriend could afford bad reviews from you…” </p><p>With that, Paisley abandoned herself to pleasure, hoping that they would go away soon so that she could enjoy her submission properly. </p><p>“I’ll see you around, my dear friend. And say hi to Darion from me. I want to get to know him better.” </p><p>“Bitch. It’ll be a cold day in hell when I trust you with a boyfriend.”</p><p>Paisley felt happy when she heard the door opening, but her hopes were distinguished when she heard running water. </p><p>Mia stayed. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>She did her best to keep her voice down, hoping that she would go away soon. Just another minute. </p><p>Then, Darion showed that he had other ideas. “Let’s go say hi to my dear lover,” he said, and opened the door. </p><p>“M-Madam Paisley,” she stammered in shock. </p><p>Paisley felt happy. At least, Mia failed to understand the exact nature of their fun. “F-feel free to leave or stay,” Paisley said, doing her best to sound smug and victorious, hoping that, after their discussion, it would be enough to make Mia retreat. </p><p>Then, her hopes were dashed by a single word, coming from behind her. “Stay.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>My mind was still on the sudden appearance of a drug distribution center near my bar, weighing advantages and disadvantages when I arrived at the bar and unlocked the door. </p><p>If there was one benefit of the absence of a bus service, it helped me consider the advantages and disadvantages of opening the bar tonight versus delaying it a few more days. Of course, the best option was to move to a safer part of the city … but I wouldn’t have been in this situation if I had the money to do so. </p><p>However, my mood changed when I entered the bar. “Wow,” I muttered. For a moment, I was sure that I was in the wrong place. After all, neither the layers of dirt, nor the smell was there. </p><p>The reason was clear. Tara was at a corner, lifting one of the tables with one hand while holding a mop with the other, destroying the last specks of dirt. </p><p>It seemed that I had underestimated her efficiency. With no need to keep her strength hidden, she went through the place with a shocking efficiency, literally transforming the place. </p><p>Such a thing deserved a reward … or a punishment, I corrected as I noticed the subtle shift in her attitude. The subtle shift in her posture showed that she had noticed my arrival, but rather than turning to greet me, she kept cleaning, acting unaware of my arrival. </p><p>Her intention was clear with the subtle change she had made. She leaned forward as if she was trying to reach a corner, but rather than kneeling, she bent forward enough for her modest skirt to ride up. </p><p>Rather transparent, but it made it even more amusing. I barely held back a laugh as I walked toward her, amused by the way she tensed with each step, yet somehow believing that she had managed to hide that from me. </p><p>That only stopped when I put my hand on her waist. She turned to look toward me as she started to lower the table, my touch enough to send her blush overdrive. “Did I tell you to stop cleaning?” I said. </p><p>“N-no, sir,” she answered immediately, her blush spectacularly beautiful, and raised the table once more like it weighed absolutely nothing. </p><p>“Better,” I said even as I let my hand drift lower, cupping her ass, doing my best to play the role of the sleazy boss. Admittedly, it was not inaccurate, even with her intense enjoyment. “I see that you have made nice progress with the cleaning. If you work hard, we can even start serving customers tonight,” I commented. </p><p>“Whatever you think better, sir,” she responded, trying to sound normal … but it was a challenge with the way I cupped her ass. Her skirt was thick, but not enough to block my aggressive grab. She continued mopping the floor like nothing had happened. </p><p>“Good, we need to make sure everything is in order before we open,” I said. “A mistake, and you get punished,” I added, enjoying the way she shivered in excitement. I was curious whether she would immediately make a mistake with the promise of a punishment. </p><p>Her expression was easy to read, showing to me that she was thinking exactly that. I chuckled as I watched her expression shift between temptation and determination … finally settled on the latter. </p><p>Even with the enjoyment she would derive from the punishment, she clearly cared about following my orders more. </p><p>How fascinating. </p><p>Of course, such determination might have been made easier by the fact I was squeezing her ass aggressively, suggesting to her that the obedience came with its own unique benefits under the circumstances…</p><p>But why should I care for such details when I could just watch the way her arm trembled. Not due to exhaustion … as it had been the case, it wouldn’t have been perfectly timed with the touch of my finger to her naked skin. </p><p>“Careful,” I warned with a throaty tone as I caressed her inner thigh, her shivers intensifying enough to make me take a step. A part of it was the temptation to stand right behind her to make the situation more entertaining…</p><p>But I had to admit, another part of it was not trusting her to keep her grip on the table. </p><p>Yet, despite the potential risks, I didn’t ask her to put the table down, a nice source of excitement for me while I tested her limits … more to see if she lost control of her strength to be distracted than anything else. </p><p>I rather prefer her shattering a table rather than my shoulder. </p><p>Risks of dealing with a super intimately. </p><p>Still, even as I slowly climbed up on her inner thigh, I couldn’t help but wonder that she managed to stay untouched and unfulfilled for long. Probably a combination of growing up in a distant ranch, her extremely understated way of dressing that hid her beauty, and her powers further scaring her from taking initiative. </p><p>“You’re a surprisingly good secretary,” I said, referring to her most recent promotion. I barely held back a chuckle as her blush spread even further, showing just how unaccustomed she was to receive any compliment. </p><p>And I was just enough of a bastard to take advantage of that. </p><p>I said nothing else, enjoying her reactions as I slowly caressed her inner thighs. She was already inexperienced enough to reach explosively to an inept touch … and mine was nowhere near deserving of such a title. </p><p>Add in the unique advantage my power granted, and it turned into a truly unfair affair. I was able to discover several spots along the path of her inner thigh that she was unaware of. I knew that, as the shocked nature of her whimpers whenever I discovered a new trick or a spot was truly spectacular. </p><p>It was like playing a beautiful new instrument … for a symphony that only I could listen. </p><p>To her credit, she did her best to ignore the resulting pleasure and focused on her mopping, still holding the table high. Though, not without some sacrifices, as the determined, steady movements of her mop soon turned into a monotone back and forth, her eyes staying close too long for her to notice that.  </p><p>Not that I blamed her, as the intensity of arousal was evident. Not just on her barely-suppressed moans, but also by the wetness I felt whenever my fingers trailed up and touched the edge of her panties. </p><p>She managed to resist my touch for almost five minutes, which might as well be an eternity … until the pleasure got simply too much. A clattering sound reached my ears … luckily, it was the mop and not the table, the latter she barely managed to hold on. </p><p>“Oh, what a clumsy secretary you are,” I commented as she barely managed to place the table back on the floor without letting it fall, then leaned against the same table to resist her trembling. </p><p>“I … I’m s-sorry, sir,” she said, the most she could say as her body trembled badly. It wasn’t as bad as the previous night when I bent her over my desk, but it wasn’t too far away either.</p><p>“Do you think being sorry would protect you from your punishment?” I said, but the moment I said that, I started walking behind the bar. </p><p>I had already christened the office and my room upstairs … now, it was time to apply to the same treatment to the bar. </p><p>“Of course not, sir,” she said, her tone excited at first, but fading toward the end when she noticed that I had walked behind the bar. </p><p>“Come here,” I ordered. She followed that order, but only after a momentary glance toward the door and the windows, both appropriately closed. She was clearly sensitive to being seen by others even when being punished. </p><p>Something I should remember in the future. Both not to push her too much … and in case she actually made a mistake that needed to be punished rather than the playful version she was currently receiving. </p><p>But, since the place was appropriately sealed, there was no harm in pushing her a bit. “You’re overdressed,” I commented. </p><p>Another shiver, but her fingers were already on the buttons of her shirt, opening them one by one to create an incredible cleavage.  She managed to remove her shirt halfway in, and left it on one of the tables. Pity her bra was another boring and ugly piece that detracted from her beauty rather than to add on it. </p><p>She took another step forward, her steps alluring just like I had taught her before despite her excitement, each step making her hips sway. Naturally, her skirt kept the most interesting aspects of that particular issue hidden, but that </p><p>Then, she paused as she unzipped her skirt, and let it fall to the ground, removing that particular impediment as she continued her approach. </p><p>For all its challenges, owning a bar had its advantages… </p>",

    "content": "<p>If I had any doubts about hiring Tara, they would have dispelled permanently as I woke up. She woke up before me. I barely remembered her leaving and coming back before going for a shower, and I remembered her bringing a suitcase with her. </p><p>Clearly, she went to her motel to move in permanently. Good for her to follow my order first thing in the morning. I could have woken up and joined her in the shower … but no matter how tempting the idea was, I chose to sleep more. </p><p>The last night had been exhausting in many ways, and I deserved an extra hour of sleep. Maybe two…</p><p>Unfortunately, Tara decided to take her role as my secretary seriously and woke me up. Fortunately, she had chosen a better method than shouting or poking me. Much better. </p><p>I woke up again to the warmth wrapping around my girth, and the moment I opened my eyes, I met with the beautiful view of her hair spilling against my stomach while she leaned over my midsection, wearing nothing but a towel, which turned increasingly useless as she moved up and down, her movement loosening it. </p><p>The best alarm clock imaginable. </p><p>I said nothing to signal her that I had woken up, enjoying the service. Her hair kept her face mostly covered, but whenever it moved slightly, it gave me a beautiful glimpse to enjoy. Her beauty was already beautiful, but the truly striking part was her smile, growing more and more intense as she worked along my length, showing me just how much she enjoyed it. </p><p>I never saw such an intense smile in any of my bed partners. It impressed and scared me at the same time with the promise it conveyed. I couldn’t help but imagine how she might have reacted if I tried to send her away. Even with my power, it was hard to guess… </p><p>Luckily, it was just an idle, theoretical question. Beautiful, sexy, obedient, and to top it all, with a very convenient power set. </p><p>I wasn’t stupid enough to turn away the best thing that happened to me since I had the misfortune of awakening my own powers. Or, considering my life, maybe my whole life. </p><p>Of course, I could have done with the confrontation with the henchmen of the Slasher, but even that was hardly her fault. They attacked, and I responded. She was just there to bail me out of a very painful stabbing injury. </p><p>As she pushed herself deep enough for me to feel the entrance of her throat, giving me another jolt of pleasure, I abandoned those pointless thoughts and focused on the present. She was clearly inexperienced, but she was proving to be an excellent student with the courage to push her limits while serving me. </p><p>It was nice to watch her slowly develop and improve as she explored her sexuality.  </p><p>Soon, she rose up, but that didn’t mean the pleasure was over. She wrapped her beautiful fingers around the base, moving up and down with a steady rhythm. Only problem. A bit tight. “Try to loosen your fingers a bit, my dear secretary,” I said. </p><p>“Y-you’re awake, sir,” she stammered, looking shocked. </p><p>I chuckled, entertained by her naivety. As if someone could actually sleep through the dance of her lips. “I am,” I said, and she made a move to pull back. I reached and grabbed her arm. “Did I tell you to stop?” I added. </p><p>Her eyes widened as my words hit her, but it was more of a mark of pleasure, tinged with just a touch of panic to add some spice. I didn’t need my powers to understand the depth of the desire that was awakened by my indirect order. </p><p>Her submissiveness was like a beautiful poem. </p><p>She grabbed my legs as she lowered herself, taking me into her mouth without the slightest delay, my length disappearing into her pretty mouth, even invading her throat. This time, I didn’t bother to keep down my moan, more than happy to show her she was working well. </p><p>After all, how could she improve if she didn’t know what she was doing well? </p><p>As the pleasure built up, I didn’t bother keeping myself back, and soon, exploded into her mouth. As much as I wanted to enjoy the feeling, I had a lot of work to bring the bar to a working state. </p><p>More importantly, I needed to go and see if I had a supervillain following me. </p><p>“Make sure to clean everything to perfection,” I said as she was busy swallowing my seed, and after caressing her cheek for one last time, I stood up and went for a shower. </p><p>Ignoring the desire to invite her into the shower had been another challenge … but I managed that. </p><p>I had a lot of work to do. </p><p>*** *** ***</p><p>I failed to suppress my desire to curse endlessly as I walked through the empty streets, pulling my hat lower. It was hard to do, when I had to walk for half an hour rather than taking a bus … but the major — or more likely, one of his underlings — decided to temporarily stop the bus service to my neighborhood.  </p><p>The official explanation said that it was due to a technical problem and that it would be continued soon, but I doubted if anyone believed it. </p><p>They just didn’t want to send any asset to the part of the city that had been just taken over by a new villain and give him an easy target to take hostage. </p><p>Of course, that would mean the Slasher would be targeting the residents to refill his coffers, straining the economy of the area even further. </p><p>It wasn’t exactly good news for me. The chances of success for my bar were already troubling without an effective economic embargo. The only positive thing was the money I managed to take from the henchmen, which should be able to keep me afloat for a few weeks. </p><p>And, if I could get a few customers in the process, even better. </p><p>Of course, that money hadn’t been free. It was the reason I was wearing a cap. If the unlikely thing happened and I met one of them, I wanted to stay hidden.  </p><p>It was also the reason for the gun in my belt. The worst case. </p><p>Ordinarily, the worst case would have been them attacking the bar while I was away and burning the place down, but I didn’t expect to happen. </p><p>For that, they needed to be stupid enough to reveal what had happened rather than taking the excuse I had granted to them with the alcohol trick, and then they needed to be brave enough to go and challenge a super with enhanced strength. </p><p>I had left Tara with express instructions. Keep the doors closed, and if anyone barges in, put on her mask and the thickest clothes she had before beating them visibly. The only exception was the Slasher. If he was the one who visited, Tara was under strict orders to abandon the bar and meet with me. </p><p>I cared about the bar, but not enough to pit Tara against an experienced villain. </p><p>“Fucking villains and their entitlement,” I murmured as I noticed a young man drawing the Slasher’s symbol on the wall — a bloodied knife — to mark the territory. I continued, shifting the bags in my hand — which had some new plates and glasses — expecting the streets to be empty. </p><p>However, as I moved forward, that changed. A few streets away from my bar, one of the warehouses had been seeing a lot of movement, with crates after crates being unloaded. The crates were marked as fresh produce … but I didn’t need my superpowers to realize they didn’t look like people who might care about fresh produce. </p><p>Unless their hands were trembling with the excitement of getting some oranges, and they were sweating desperately because they missed the taste of the apples. </p><p>A drug distribution center, just three blocks away from my bar. Like my job wasn’t challenging enough. </p><p>The worst thing, they didn’t even truly bother to conceal what they were trying to do, confident that the police wouldn’t take a step into the area now that it was under the direct control of a villain. </p><p>Not that I blamed them. Ultimately, the police had next to no power when it came to fighting against the crime. They were severely outclassed by the villains … and to make things even worse, they were legally prevented from employing heroes, or even cooperating. </p><p>To be fair, it was not a rule that came for no reason, but it didn’t change the fact that the independent guilds were far more important to protect safety than the government. </p><p>And, there was no chance for the guilds to come here to solve something as pedestrian as drugs. </p><p>No, we were on our own. </p><p>“Well, hopefully, it’s the kind of drugs that make people thirsty,” I murmured. The existence of such a place was dangerous. </p><p>But that didn’t change the fact that it solved my biggest problem. The lack of customers. </p><p>“It could have been worse,” I murmured as I walked away, ignoring the suspicious glares of the guards around the warehouse. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I stepped out of the car, I used the opportunity to take stock of the woman, who was most likely the agent who was about to show me the location. </p><p>The first thing that I noticed, was her hair. Platinum blonde, though under the midday sun, it almost looked white. It was cut to a medium length, barely reaching her shoulders, but with a sharp edge that highlighted the aura of professionalism she was trying to radiate. </p><p>She was a beautiful woman, despite the expression of distaste on her face that looked like she had just swallowed a lemon, or smelled something unpleasant. “When I told you to leave, I meant you to leave with your car,” she said with a sharp, dismissive tone as she raised her well-manicured fingers, making a show of checking them. “Unless, of course, you don’t have the money for the gas as well. It wouldn’t be shocking considering you can’t afford to a motel for your whore.” </p><p>I just smirked at her insults. Her catty attitude would have been annoying, but I had spent a lot of time with professional fashion models. Their narcissism and their constant crisis of identity drove them to constantly cut down everyone around them. Add in the constant hunger, it felt like being locked in a bunch of rabid cats. </p><p>In comparison, the insults from the woman revealed more about her than the insults affecting me. Especially when combined with some of the other details. </p><p>The shoes she was wearing were properly expensive — the kind that required not only five figures but also a waiting list. More importantly, they were real and not fake … but they were from a year ago. Similarly, her small handbag was expensive, but outdated. </p><p>Interesting, as there were other, more timeless bag designs that she could have purchased if she was trying to splurge on one good handbag to brag about her success as a salesperson. </p><p>Interested in that, I started examining the rest of her clothing. The blouse was equally expensive and silk, but there were some signs of fraying. The skirt was in a similar condition. Her manicure and haircut were good … but not the kind of good that required thousands of dollars per appointment. </p><p>Add in a posh accent that suggested at least some of her education happened overseas, and I reached a fun conclusion. </p><p>My real estate agent was a proper rich person — not the second car rich, but private plane rich — before she had ended up in dire straights. And, she was too young — my guess, twenty-two — to lose it herself. </p><p>So, either daddy cut her off, or he went bankrupt. Considering she was trying to sell houses in the middle of nowhere, likely the second. </p><p>“Hey, I’m talking to you,” she repeated when I just smirked at her rather than answering. “Leave, or I call the police. You can push your car if you can’t afford gas.” </p><p>I thought about revealing my conclusions about her current state, but I kept them back. Not because of any kind of mercy … but teasing her slowly was more fun. </p><p>Especially if she was as desperate to close the deal as I thought… </p><p>“I’m sorry, but it won’t be possible,” I said with a shrug, watching as her expression shifted. At first, it was pure anger, like it was incomprehensible for the world to not work the way she expected … but she managed to hide it soon. </p><p>Her old rich-person habits, I recognized. </p><p>How entertaining. </p><p>“And why would that be?” she asked. </p><p>“Because I have an appointment here with my realtor,” I said, then smirked. “And, unless I’m entirely mistaken, you’re her. Carol, right? You’re ruder than I expected.” </p><p>It was fun to watch her expression cycling between anger and shock. “You don’t look like someone that would rent a warehouse,” she commented, clearly trying to find a way to take back her earlier insults but failing. </p><p>It was the right decision to tease her. </p><p>I didn’t answer immediately but opened the door and reached the backseat, pulled out my camera, my lens kit, and a couple of reflectors, enough to mark me as a professional photographer. “You’re right, I don’t need a warehouse,” I said. “What I need is a nice, avant-garde space that I could turn into a giant photo studio as long as I’m happy with the place.” </p><p>“I see, how fascinating,” she said, her eyes brightening as she smelled an urgent sale. She must have really needed the sale. I looked around, and saw her car parked quite a bit away from the building. </p><p>Not accidentally, as it was a rust-bucket that needed a miracle to move around, enough to destroy her carefully cultivated looks of professionalism. </p><p>She was clearly struggling. Not a surprise, as from the looks, she joined the real estate agency recently … and considering she had the task of renting a huge warehouse that was near impossible to move, she wasn’t exactly favored. </p><p>The potential commission was important. </p><p>“So, you’re an artist, Stephen. How fascinating,” she said. To my shock, she was halfway honest. “You must be really successful to build such an ambitious studio.” </p><p>I shrugged, deliberately casual. “Nothing much, just a few pictures in some places, but I’m bored of commercial work,” I said, acting deliberately dismissive, not even giving her the name of the places I worked with. </p><p>Instead, I walked around my car, acting like I didn’t see her desperately typing on her phone. She already had my name from the application, and now that she knew my work, finding my work wasn’t that difficult. </p><p>My work had been featured in some of the best magazines. And, since the reason for my exile wasn’t available online, she jumped to the very reasonable conclusion that I was the one who abandoned the high fashion world for my own work. </p><p>The amount of money I was ready to pay just to rent a huge workspace further confirmed her conclusion. </p><p>Was that a mean way to start taking revenge? Maybe. </p><p>Certainly not when I compared it to how I planned to continue. </p><p>After all, her insults might have been amusing, but that didn’t free her from the risk of retaliation. </p><p>Acting unaware of what was going on, I opened Nicole’s door. “Now, my dear model, are you ready to walk,” I said. </p><p>“No,” she whispered, soft enough that our prospective agent didn’t hear. “S-she saw me…” </p><p>“In your underwear. Nothing to be ashamed of, not with your assets,” I said. “Think of her as a practice for your neighbors. It’s a good chance to strut around and get confident. You’ll never see her again, and since she’s working to close the deal, she has to play nice.” </p><p>As we talked, Carol was busy going through her phone, no doubt trying to familiarize herself with my work to better sell the place. However, I could see the growing fascination. </p><p>It wasn’t too surprising. She had been rich before, and if there was one thing money didn’t automatically trump over, it was fame, making my proximity to fame somewhat respectable in her eyes even without her clear fall from fame. </p><p>Add in her very fall from grace … and her fascinated expression was even more impressive. While Nicole tried to come up with an answer, I quickly checked my phone as well, but I failed to find any. </p><p>Which implied a scandal, impressive enough that she had to change her name and retreat to a no-name town. </p><p>Interesting, but when Nicole finally spoke, I turned my attention fully to her. “I … I don’t know,” Nicole whispered, sounding indecisive.” </p><p>“Okay, tough love time,” I answer as I lean down even closer. “It’s your indecisive attitude that makes your stupid neighbors think that they can bully you. You need to be more decisive if you don’t want to be bullied. Come on, show me how can you be when you’re determined. It’s the perfect opportunity,” I whispered. </p><p>Luckily, while she might find treating others aggressively challenging, due to her submissive streak, she found ignoring my words as an even bigger challenge. As my words hit her, her expression solidified. “You’re right,” she whispered. </p><p>“Good, now, come out and introduce yourself. And, don’t forget. You’re my best model. You’re confident. Nothing can harm you. And, you’re much sexier than that snotty blonde.” </p><p>“Y-you’re right,” she said as she stepped out of the car, a soft wind making her dress dance right on time to make her exit a cinematic moment. At that moment, no one would try to argue if she introduced herself as a model. </p><p>Of course, we could have done it without her stammer … but, baby steps. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Five minutes later, I was looking at Nicole, reminding myself that we needed to attend an important meeting, and a detour was unacceptable. However, sticking to that determination was difficult. </p><p>She wore a beautiful sundress and fixed her hair into a messy ponytail, a combination that would have looked innocent on another woman with … less generous proportions. Her amazing breasts turned the cleavage into something of wonder, her hips challenging the capability of the skirt portion, each step enough to make my heart flutter. </p><p>“You look beautiful,” I said, her blush tempting me to check her lingerie choices, but I suppressed that desire. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured, her gaze dipping down, still shy despite everything we had done. </p><p>I had to repeat the phrase of ‘business first, pleasure later,’ in my mind to ignore the temptation. And, only because getting a new studio as soon as possible was very important. I kept my gaze straight soon her face to not to be tempted. “Let’s go,” I said as I went out. </p><p>I was glad that I didn’t bother removing my equipment from my car, allowing me to skip the tedious step of piling the car. Even better, we were too exhausted on the way back to do anything fun … so I didn’t need to deal with the thick smell of sex. </p><p>Naturally, I didn’t promise Nicole anything even close to exclusivity, but there was a difference between that and just annoying her with the aftermath unnecessarily. </p><p>“It looks … complicated,” she said as she looked at the back seat, which was piled with my equipment and the costumes. </p><p>“Yeah, the shoot was more complicated than we expected, but it worked well,” I said, then paused, trying to remember whether she knew that shoot was with Nancy. I failed to remember, but I ignored it. If she knew that, she would have tried to talk about it. </p><p>“Ladies first,” I said as I opened the passenger seat, gesturing for her to step inside. She followed that, smiling happily … which turned into a blush as she noticed two of her neighbors whispering pointedly as they looked toward us. “Ignore them, they are just jealous of your beauty,” I said as I closed the door and took the driver’s seat. </p><p>I earned a grateful smile in response to my easement. </p><p>With that, we drove away, the expression of the neighbors ranging between jealous and excited. “They are so jealous of you,” I said as we left the street behind. </p><p>“I … I don’t know,” Nicole murmured, saying nothing else. Clearly, in her hurry to get dressed, she had forgotten to consider the reaction of her neighbors, and she was worrying about it after the fact. </p><p>As a kind houseguest, it was my mission to keep her relaxed. I put my hand on her leg, caressing it gently. “S-Stephen,” she gasped, shocked by my touch. “Y-you’re driving!” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. I’m just resting my hand. It’s not dangerous,” I said as I squeezed her thigh, enjoying her resulting moan. However, even that only kept her distracted for a minute, and worry returned to her face. </p><p>I started driving faster, hoping to arrive at the location with some time to spare. Though, it showed just how concerned Nicole was with the reaction of her neighbors that she didn’t even comment on my driving. </p><p>We arrived at our destination with ten minutes to spare. Just enough to have a talk. </p><p>As I pressed the brakes, she looked even more distraught. When we stopped, she reached for the door, but I locked the door. “We need to talk,” I said. </p><p>“A-about what,” Nicole said, avoiding my gaze. </p><p>“Look at me,” I ordered. She followed my command, but I could see tears gathering. “Now, tell me, what’s going on.” </p><p>“I … I don’t know,” Nicole answered. “I thought that… I… It’s absurd… Please ignore me.”</p><p>“No, look at me in the eyes,” I ordered as I gently cupped her cheek. “It’s about the neighbors, right?” </p><p>“Y-yes,” she stammered. “I’m sorry. They are a nosy bunch, always commenting on my clothing.” </p><p>“Is this the reason why you only go out with those horrible sweatpants?” I asked. </p><p>She nodded. “I thought that, after all those photoshoots, it would be different. This time, I could ignore their whispers, but it didn’t work. I’m still weak.”</p><p>“Nonsense. You’re an amazing, sexy woman. You’re certainly not weak.” </p><p>“Then, why all it took was a few whispers for me to break down despite everything we had done. I thought that I was finally ready. I was finally strong enough.” </p><p>She looked ready to cry, so I decided to distract her from that in the easiest way possible. I leaned forward and captured her lips in a searing kiss, my tongue invading her mouth. The short yet explosive burst was enough to do what my earlier touches failed. </p><p>When I pulled back, she was dazed, her tears nowhere to be seen. </p><p>“Oh, my cute landlady. You have nothing to worry about, or feel sorry. You’re an incredible woman. Just because you’re a bit self-conscious doesn’t change that.” Then, I smirked. “And, I can help you solve it if you want.” </p><p>“Really, you would do that?” she gasped, excited. “How?” </p><p>“Very simple, practice.” Her eyes widened at that, realizing where I would be driving the discussion. Unfortunately, she didn’t have the time to answer as I leaned forward, capturing her lips in a searing kiss. At the same time, I hooked my fingers to the strap, slowly pulling it to the side. </p><p>She tensed at first, but that passed quickly as our tongues battled, not reacting as it slipped down, revealing even more of her cleavage. I repeated the same thing on the other side, and when I pulled back, her cleavage was far more impressive. </p><p>“N-not that I’m complaining,” she whispered. “But, how exactly is this going to help?” </p><p>“Simple,” I said as I put my hand on her leg, and let it climb higher, distracting her for the next part of the fun. “We’re in a parking lot where anyone could walk in. If you can handle the risk of getting caught, half-naked, you can learn to ignore the gazes of a bunch of busy-bodies.” </p><p>Her eyes widened. “T-this is absurd,” she gasped. </p><p>Technically, she was not wrong. I had no idea whether that would help … but trying would certainly distract her from her gloom. And, even if it was completely useless, it wasn’t like undressing her was a chore. “How do you know it’s absurd,” I said as leaned forward once more, this time clamping on her neck, teasing the spots that would drive her crazy — discovered during our earlier adventures.</p><p>“M-maybe,” she whispered, which was all she was able to say as my lips traveled down. “But, what if we get caught.” </p><p>“That’s the part of the risk. You can’t defeat your demons without taking a bit of risk. You need to work hard to gain your confidence.” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she whispered as her dress slipped down more, finally revealing a mystery. Her underwear. </p><p>She had chosen a surprisingly daring piece. A strapless bra, one that was more of a band than actual support — not that her miraculous body needed much despite her size — barely reaching to her nipples. Add in its lacy, slightly transparent structure, and it turned into a delicious show. </p><p>“How can you feel self-conscious while wearing that amazing piece, I have no idea,” I said as I dragged my lips along her neck. She managed to keep her shivers down until I reached her collarbone, and turned into a moan once I reached her cleavage, my tongue dancing down. </p><p>“Now, I want you to imagine one of those neighbors at the door. What would they think?” </p><p>“They would say that I’m a tease and a slut that’s working hard to seduce their husbands,” Nicole answered, but the moment she finished, she let out a gasp. The reason, was my hand tightening around her leg enough to give her a teasing dose of pain. </p><p>“Was that my question?” I asked. </p><p>“Y-yes—“ she started, which turned into another moan. “No, you asked what they would think, not what they would say.” </p><p>“Exactly. And what would they think?” </p><p>“I … I don’t know,” she answered. </p><p>“I’ll tell you,” I countered, even as I replaced my mouth on her cleavage with my free hand, squeezing gently while my other hand moved higher and higher, riding up her skirt as well, enough to get a glimpse of her matching thong. </p><p>“They will be thinking just how inferior they were to their sexy neighbor Nicole. That no matter how much they go to the gym and starve themselves, they could never be as sexy as you. And, rather than surrendering to that realization, they would rather attack you ceaselessly to break you.” </p><p>Nicole moaned in satisfaction as my fingers danced on her body, but even more importantly, I could feel her cloud of despair disappearing. </p><p>She must have really trusted me if my words were that effective. A heavy responsibility. </p><p>Luckily, I had no intention of abandoning her … why would I, when—</p><p>Unfortunately, those thoughts were disrupted by a knock on the window. “Hey, this is a private property. Go away or I call the police,” a female voice said. </p><p>I turned, only to see a figure wearing a serious business suit, the reddish blazer too distinct to be anyone other than a real estate agent. Probably mine. </p><p>“No need to panic, just fix yourself while I talk with her,” I said to Nicole, who was busy blushing. She just nodded, and I reached the door. </p>",

    "content": "<p>To my surprise, the guild leader didn’t stay at the outpost. </p><p>Instead, he went to the vault, and placed the spear into the vault. No, not the spear, I corrected myself as I used the vault wards to check the integrity of the weapon, and realized that it was a replica. </p><p>Amusingly, it was the same replica I had used to trick the spies of the second prince. An amusing trickery, but it didn’t answer why he was in such a hurry. Especially since he disguised himself as a guard once he went to his room before leaving the complex. </p><p>Interesting. </p><p>Luckily, my luxurious cell might as well be a private palace at this point, as I teleported away easily without alerting any of the guards, and started following them. </p><p>The guild leader, disguised as one of the guards, left the complex in a great hurry, escorted only by two others. And, to my surprise, he met with another spy, accompanying him into another hidden location near the capital. </p><p>This new hidden location was defended even stronger than the previous location. For a moment, I thought that I wouldn’t be able to sneak inside … but a slight examination changed my mind. It was easy to slip in … because most of the wards were actually targeted inward. </p><p>They were trying to keep someone prisoner. Someone strong, it seemed. Most of the wards were actually dedicated to internal defenses, and the rest were dedicated to keeping the location secret. It might even be useful … if a very excited guild leader didn’t lead me directly there. </p><p>I had some suspicions about who might be inside the place, a suspicion that was enough to anger me, but I didn’t explode. I needed to make sure first. </p><p>The misaligned defenses didn’t even slow me down as I entered the complex, quickly disguising myself as a servant to follow my target closely. He entered a room, and I stayed outside, using magic to eavesdrop. </p><p>“The spear is here, my prince,” he said as he knelt. I wasn’t able to see them, but the way his knee hit the ground was rather distinct. “You can use it to steal some of her Divine Essence and use it to bargain with the Eternals. I’m sure they will be happy to accept such an exalted person as a part of them. And, with their help, your ascension will be guaranteed.” </p><p>“Oh, interesting,” the prince said. “You seem to be rather enthusiastic about giving such an opportunity to me. I would have expected you to take it for yourself,” he said. “It’s not exactly something I expected from one of the leaders of the guild. Your organization had always been rather protective about your independence.”  </p><p>“Not at all, my prince. You’re the next in line to the throne, and you have the necessary vision to finally stop the constant collapse of the Empire. The support of the Eternals is just insurance.” </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed. The words of the guild leader implied that he was the crown prince. </p><p>Meaning, he managed to trick both the second and the fourth prince in the process of their operation and ended up with the spear. </p><p>“Good, and I’m sure that, as the next Emperor, I couldn’t leave anyone that knows about such an important secret,” he said. </p><p>“Wait—“ the guild leader gasped, shocked, but that was all he was able to say before the prince activated the wards he had arranged beforehand. Similar to my initial imprisonment, but actually used to deliver a hit without a warning rather than used as a threat. </p><p>His sole words turned into wordless cries. His level was high, and as a blacksmith, his physical stats were nothing to scoff at. The combination resulted in a high HP … unfortunately, that only extended his suffering. </p><p>It took a minute for him to end up dead. At a distance, his guards experienced the exact same end. </p><p>I made no motion to save them, just used the opportunity to hide better. </p><p>“Are you sure that was wise, my prince? What if the spear he brought is fake?” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter. If it’s fake, the real one has to be hidden in the other hideout. There’s no chance that he changed it halfway. He wouldn’t be stupid enough to trust such a treasure to another guild member. If it’s fake, it would be in the hidden base of my brother, and we will just use our forces to raid.” He took a deep breath. “Not exactly what I prefer. It would mean revealing my hand, but better than the alternative.” </p><p>“What about the Emperor. What if he decides that it violates the limits he had set.” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter. My father is a dead man walking. He barely had weeks remaining. And, he won’t take such a risk close to the ultimate date. Certainly not to protect my most useless brother. Just make sure that he’s nowhere near the hidden base while you launch the assault.” </p><p>“Hopefully, it won’t be necessary, my prince,” he said. </p><p>“Hopefully,” the crown prince answered. Soon, the door opened and he entered to the corridor, giving me the first glimpse of him. He was tall and broad-shouldered, creating an imposing sight. Wearing armor and a crown, he made an imposing sight. </p><p>Charismatic and competent, he made an imposing sight. He would make a good emperor … assuming that this facility was not built to host one of the few people I really cared about. </p><p>If that’s the case, I doubted that he would enjoy a long reign — or even last until the demise of his father. </p><p>Sneaking into the inner parts of the prison would have been challenging if the prince hadn’t removed every detection ward in place. Hidden behind an illusion, I followed him. Illusions were hardly foolproof, but luckily, the prince felt no need to check his surroundings. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t exactly betting my life on the prince’s carelessness. Unlike the guild leader who had just met with his demise, I wasn’t lacking in magical abilities. I could take down the whole hidden base if needed. </p><p>It wouldn’t be silent, and it would reveal more than I wanted … but facing the possibility of saving one of my girls, was an acceptable risk.</p><p>After we passed another ward, we arrived at a huge location. At the center, there was an unconscious angel. </p><p>A familiar face. </p><p>Mariel. </p><p>My dear headmistress. </p><p>However, even as I looked at her, I could see that things were not exactly well. Her wings. Instead of pure white, her wings were filled with a mismatching crisscross of black lines. </p><p>Darkness Spark. </p><p>Well, it explained where the Darkness Spark that was used to power her unique wards had gone. </p><p>My first instinct was to just rush forward and take down the prince and save her. However, I held back. It looked bad, but she had managed to resist whatever that was going on for months. Keeping a few more minutes to see what was going on was even easier. </p><p>I waited passively, with one exception. I cast a small spell, one that would have struggled to light a candle. However, targeted one of the traps I had built into the spear, breaking one of its vital parts, and turning it into an ornament. </p><p>Despite the tenseness of the situation, watching the expression of the prince as he approached Mariel. It started confident, almost smug, but as he stayed close nothing happened, It first melted into surprise, then shame. </p><p>“It seems that our partner was craftier than I had given him credit for,” he said as he looked at his loyal retainer, and in his eyes, I could see murder. The retainer kept his eyes down, loyal to a fault. </p><p>Our future emperor clearly had a fragile ego. </p><p>He stayed silent for a few seconds before giving the order. “Activate our kill teams. I want that base burnt to the ground, and the real spear with me. I need this spear. I can’t give up her without stealing some of her Divine Spark.” </p><p>Ironically, I might have saved his life by intervening. Even without examining, I could see that Darkness and Light Sparks were currently on a weird balance on her body, a situation that was only possible due to the opposing nature of those sparks and centuries she had used Darkness Spark to keep her Light Spark in control. </p><p>If the crown prince managed to do what he wished and started poking around, it had the chance to destroy the fragile balance of the opposing Sparks. </p><p>The prince started walking away. At the same time, I cast an illusion that would take Mariel’s place, adding a few new wards to fake her presence in the many detection wards. With the most important wards temporarily turned down to enable the prince to approach, my job was easier. </p><p>Soon, I was out, Mariel with me. </p><p>As much as I wanted to return and teach the crown prince a lesson about trying to target my people, Mariel’s safety was more important. After wrapping her with a layer of protective mana, I started flying toward the capital. </p><p>I had two reasons for not teleporting to Helga’s domain. I didn’t know how being in another Divine Domain would play with her situation… And I didn’t know how teleportation affected her state. Going to a place where I could fly in short order was the logical choice. </p><p>The next step, a medical examination… And, if everything was well, playing the doctor game…</p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 62</p><p>Endurance: 73      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 58410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>On the sixth day of my — extremely unsuccessful — imprisonment, the men of the second prince finally made a move. They were patient … a bit too much, even, as it was two days since I agreed to the offer of the guild leader and started working on repairing the spear. </p><p>Well, to be more accurate, I was looking like I was trying to repair. With my full abilities and previous experience, it would take minutes for me to properly repair it, and a few days to improve the design significantly. </p><p>Storing Divine Spark was kind of my expertise at this point. </p><p>The spy approached me just as I walked out to a garden, enjoying the grass under my feet — an arrangement to reward me for my cooperation. He was wearing a black and gray uniform, dressed as a guard without a rank. </p><p>“We meet again,” he said. </p><p>“Yes, and I can’t say that I’m happy with it,” I answered, looking dissatisfied. “You were supposed to be here when I arrived to help me, but instead, I ended up imprisoned. I can’t say I’m happy with the cooperation abilities of the crown prince.”  </p><p>“Oh, I can just go and leave you to the mercy of the fourth prince if that’s what you wish,” he said,  threatening me directly.</p><p>Ordinarily, it was not an attitude I would appreciate. However, his smugness was more promising than annoying. Such a confrontational attitude implied that they were feeling the pressure. “Wait,” I said, pushing an appropriate amount of panic to my tone. “Just because you failed once doesn’t mean I want to kick you out.” </p><p>“As you wish,” he said, nodding with a slight smile, avoiding to mention my sharp twist. “We are ready to act if you’re ready to act.” </p><p>“When?” I asked. </p><p>“Whenever you think you can bring us the spear. We couldn’t enter the inner sanctum, but we managed to take control of the perimeter defenses. We can use the opportunity to get away the moment you’re ready.” </p><p>I nodded. “Tonight,” I said with a determined tone. “I’m bored of being a prisoner, and I want to escape.” </p><p>“Are you sure you can take the spear,” he said. “What if they notice the absence of the spear before you can leave the inner sanctum. You wouldn’t want to anger the crown prince with such a great mistake.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, I already forgot a replica,” I said as I reached into my pocket and passed a spearhead to him.  “I just need to craft a broken handle and switch it. They are not even searching for me.” </p><p>He looked suspicious. “How did you manage to forge it. I doubt they have given you a personal forge.” </p><p>“Of course not. I just said that I needed to forge a copy of the weapon several times in order to get a better sense of its construction. Stealing one of the copies while melting the rest was easy.” </p><p>“Not bad,” the spy said. “Too bad you don’t have appropriate skills. You would have made an incredible work partner.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I’m glad with my skills. I don’t want to be a snake,” I said, delivering one last insult as he walked away. Ordinarily, I wouldn’t have done so, as angering the people I was supposed to be relying on. </p><p>Luckily, I had no intention of cooperating with them. Not because of what I suspected to be their intentional information leakage that removed any possibility of working together with the fourth prince. That was easy to ignore, as betrayal from the people I didn’t trust in the first place was meaningless. </p><p>No, I wanted to get rid of him to look more committed to the path the guild leader had created for me. </p><p>So, as I went back to the forging room, I found him. “I just had a little birdie that came to me with an offer,” I said. “My freedom, in exchange for the spear.”</p><p>“That’s interesting,” he said as he glanced at me, raising his head from the repair plans he had been examining. They were mostly drawn by me, and I made sure to keep those plans workable, but ultimately too complex to be really practical, with several weaknesses. </p><p>It might be something I could create easily, but no need to empower my enemies any more than necessary. </p><p>“Interesting how?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, it’s an opportunity to get free. I thought that you would take it rather than trust our offer.” </p><p>I shrugged. “It’s not that I trust you, but I trust a bunch of spies with a very convenient offer even less. Add in the high chance of failure,” I added, letting my words linger. </p><p>He tossed his head back and laughed. “And, what do you have planned.” </p><p>“I plan nothing,” I said as I pulled a spearhead from my pocket. “Just find an agent to disguise as me and pass it to them, use their movements to clean their operation. I’ll be in the forge, where it’s safe.” </p><p>“And how do you know whether this place is safe?” he asked. </p><p>“If it wasn’t, they wouldn’t have bothered with me and would have stolen the spear directly,” I said. It was not as simple as I implied, but it was still logical enough to avoid suspicion. “Now, do you want to continue working, or do you want to chat,” I said as I returned to work.</p><p>He took a step back, surprised at my outburst. For a moment, he stood still uncertain of how to reply. “It’s good to see you so enthusiastic about it,” he said. </p><p>“Of course. I think we can finish it in a few days if we work hard. Maybe even tonight if can come up with a breakthrough. I don’t have time to waste with political nonsense,” I said, once again relying on the supposed passion of a legendary blacksmith. </p><p>He stared at me for a while before he shook his head, no doubt underestimating me even further after my ‘simple’ explanation. “I just need to arrange the plan,” he said as he walked away, leaving me alone. </p><p>I acted like I was focused on my work, even as I subtly cast several spells, preparing for the next stage. I wanted to use the upcoming battle to expand my control over the wards. Admittedly, it was not one of the main reasons for the plan, but just a side benefit. </p><p>Mostly because I couldn’t plan for it. Most of the places were not like my prison cell, with little active supervision. The other locations had several mages constantly maintaining the wards, making infiltration a troubling challenge. </p><p>This was particularly true for the forging room. </p><p>I hoped the upcoming battle created enough commotion to allow me to sneak inside. The spy looked desperate enough … and if he failed, it was not exactly a problem either. </p><p>The guild leader returned not too long after, and we started working. Soon, I grabbed several monster parts, and started forging them into one big entity. “… I don’t think it’ll work like this. You’ll overload the nodes,” he said. </p><p>“Trust me,” I answered as I continued to slam my hammer. He was used to my sudden bouts of inspiration, so he let that slide, unaware the only reason I was going through a dangerous explosive process was to fill the room with excess mana. </p><p>Preparing for the commotion. </p><p>With my mana in place, even if the battle was less damaging than I predicted, I should be able to make some progress. </p><p>I lost myself in my pretend work, working more and more fervor, looking lost in my beats … and soon, a sudden flicker hit the wards. </p><p>The battle started. I used the mana I had already spread into the room into the ward, using the lack of attention from the mages responsible for the operation. Their attention had turned to the perimeter, while I slowly sneaked into the core of the wards, slowly adding my own layers to the structure, betting on the fact that they were not created by the others. </p><p>It was a challenging affair … until the spies of the second prince surprised me by triggering several explosions throughout the facility. Mostly outer structure, but enough to earn the focus of the other mages almost immediately. </p><p>And, as a result, their attention slipped. Not one to miss such opportunities, I let my mana spread, infecting the wards like a particularly aggressive disease. With that, I had the keys to the defense. I didn’t use them other than watching the agents of the second prince being mowed down like grass, helpless to resist. </p><p>It was fun to watch my enemies being killed by my other enemies. It was efficient. </p><p>I ignored that as I continued forging. With the wards under my control, there was no point in delaying the work. Toward midnight, I slammed my hammer on the spear for one last time. “Finally complete,” I said as I pulled back. </p><p>“Fascinating,” the guild leader said, his greed almost physical as he wrapped his hands around the broken handle. At that moment, his greed-fueled his jealously further, and in real-time, I could see him coming to a decision. </p><p>He just didn’t give that order immediately. “Amazing work,” he said. “You should go rest. We have a week to prepare before the representative from that mysterious organization arrives.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said, using my apparent exhaustion as a reason to miss the obviousness of his lie. </p><p>Yet, even as the guards escorted me to my room, I continued observing him through the wards. He was rather purposeful as he dashed away. </p><p>I wondered exactly what he was planning to do with that spear. </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 62</p><p>Endurance: 73      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 58410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>Paisley escaped the bathroom, hoping to wash her face. She was not running away from Darion … certainly not. She was the dominant one. She was not a teenager who would get scared just because of a momentary loss of control. </p><p>Not anymore. No, that was in the past. Now, she was strong. She was in control. And no man could change that…</p><p>No matter how skilled he was on the bed … or on other surfaces. </p><p>As for why she used the staff bathroom rather than the customer one … she refused to answer that, even in her own mind. </p><p>“Oh, someone looks distracted.” </p><p>That was the sound that distracted her from her musings. She turned, only to see him looking at her. “W-what are you doing here?” she asked, hating herself for the slight stammer. She was a strong woman. That was not acceptable. </p><p>“You look distressed, so I came to check if you’re alright,” he answered, but his smirk told a different story. He was clearly aware of the reason for her immediate retreat and came here to tease her. </p><p>And maybe for more. </p><p>She hated her own body for getting heated at the thought. </p><p>“I just needed to wash my face. You can leave,” she said as she leaned against the sink, trying to send him away. “I don’t need to bother you with it.” </p><p>His smirk widened. “Oh, don’t worry. It’s not a bother. Not even the slightest. I have always been very helpful when ladies were in peril. Especially sexy ones like you.” </p><p>She rolled her eyes at his self-aggrandizing statement, though she had to admit, it was working. It wouldn’t have worked without the memories of their previous time … but then, he seemed to be very much aware of that fact considering she kept herself back until that time. </p><p>It was much harder to dismiss when when they were built like Adonis … not to mention what he was packing. </p><p>“I’m not in peril. You can go,” she said.</p><p>“Oh, there, we disagree. You’re clearly in need, but you’re too obsessed with your pride to admit that.” </p><p>“And what would you do if I insist on not admitting,” she answered, doing her best to sound determined rather than flirty.</p><p>And failed spectacularly. </p><p>“Well, I’ll attempt to make you admit it, using any means necessary. It’s what being a man requires.”</p><p>The undertone of his voice was not lost on her, while her body jolted in excitement. Her traitor body. She wanted to say something else, but before she could say anything else, he took a step forward, his lips sealing hers. </p><p>It didn’t help when he somehow managed to shrug his shirt off while delivering that searing kiss. The sight of his defined muscles made it much harder for her to resist the call. But she would … she was determined. </p><p>She was the famous Madam Paisley, not a toy for a man. </p><p>She repeated that as he treated her body like a toy that weighed nothing, easily reversing her. Unbalanced, her hands slammed against the wall, while his hands landed on her waist, his grip hard enough to awaken memories. </p><p>It felt amazing. </p><p>“I-it doesn’t feel good. You can stop,” she said, which would have been more convincing if it wasn’t for her trembling voice. </p><p>“That’s not fair. You should give me a fighting chance to prove myself. After all, that’s what you do, right. Using the boyfriends of your business partners to underline your superiority. It’s only fair I fight for my dear girlfriend.” </p><p>“You can’t just remove it. It’s a romper,” she said. “It doesn’t come off easily.” </p><p>Which was a mistake. “That sounds like a challenge,” he whispered, then pulled, the fragile fabric easily destroyed with his strength. “A challenge that you lost.” </p><p>She would have answered, but she was busy processing his shaft pressing against her ass, her panties far less effective to reduce the impact. </p><p>“Now, let’s make things more fun,” he followed as he lifted her, easily lifting her, once again making her feel powerless. She would have liked to complain … but she was busy moaning. </p><p>She realized that, once again, she was in over her head. Unfortunately, she had no one to blame but herself. Her hobby finally caught up with her, making her get hot and heavy. </p><p>“Do you think I can’t remove your bra as well?” he asked. </p><p>“No!” she gasped immediately, aware that she couldn’t afford to lose another item of clothing. He put her on the floor as he pulled it free, but then grabbed her arms to force her to reveal her whole body while still grinding against her. </p><p>“You look amazing … for a woman of your age,” he said. </p><p>She hated that the backhanded compliment somehow worked even better to heat up her body. She was losing control … completely. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she managed to say.</p><p>“You need to work for it,” he said, and a moment later, she found herself being kissed once more. She was not used to being kissed like this, aggressive and hungry, and his fingers didn’t make things any easier. </p><p>“T-that was…” she started, but a distinct sound of clicking grabbed her attention. “Someone is here,” she whispered, very much aware that she didn’t have the time to dress, or anything intact to wear. “We need to hide.” </p><p>“You’re right, let’s hide,” he said. For a moment, she felt relaxed, seeing that he wanted to act rationally. </p><p>That only lasted a second, until he kicked her clothes under a sink before dragging her into one of the cubicles with one last whisper. “Of course, that doesn’t mean we have to stop, does it…”</p>",

    "content": "<p> Even as I stood up to position myself behind Tara, grabbing her hips softly, I couldn’t help but feel shocked. Every time I pushed her, my power-assisted reading was suggesting me to push her even more. </p><p>Many times, I questioned that read, but as I positioned myself behind her and grabbed her hips, it was yet to be wrong. And, now, there was only one step remaining. “Are you ready for the final step of our celebration,” I asked. </p><p>She just moaned rather than asking me to stop, or ripping off the belt that still kept her arms together, so I decided to take that as a positive answer. </p><p>I shifted a bit as I moved his cock forward, almost losing myself as I slid it between her cheeks, giving her one last chance to retreat. She moaned again. </p><p>Enough chances, I decided. My cock was hard as steel already, begging for me to stop playing and start working. </p><p>I pushed, finally enjoying her tightness properly, while she moaned, her body still trembling with her previous climax. Admittedly, as I started moving, I wasn’t too far from it. It was only sheer willpower that prevented me from exploding. </p><p>I didn’t want to climax before I brought her to another one. Another way to set my dominance — even if it was difficult for me. </p><p>Being the boss was not easy. </p><p>I clenched my teeth in an effort to control myself even as I pushed halfway in, her moans filling the office. Initially, I hated the old furniture and the dusty room, but I could see my attitude changing if I continued to accumulate such amazing memories. </p><p>I leaned forward, putting my weight into my pushes even as I cupped her breasts, my clutching fingers reshaping their perfection from the side. </p><p>Her hips gyrated in response, pushing me dangerously close to climaxing, but I let her do so. I wanted her to act like that more, not less, and admonishing her about it might have bounced back badly. </p><p>Her head turned slightly as she tried to settle into a comfortable position, her beautiful face contorted with pleasure. Her eyes were closed, her mouth half opened as she continued to moan, showing just how much she loved this particular aspect of her new role. </p><p>Though, along with her pleasure, there was a certain calm in her expression. I loved the pleasure, but calm, I wanted to destroy. So, I pushed forward with a sudden recklessness, invading her core fully. </p><p>Her eyes jerked open in shock. “Don’t tell me you can’t handle it,” I said with a chuckle, spanking her as I said that. She moaned, yet her head rose slightly and shook, confirming that she had no intention of stopping. </p><p>Not that it came as a surprise. </p><p>I tightened my grip on her hips before I started moving even more aggressively, earning a chain of moans. Her hips jerked helplessly while her expression changed, her eyelids half-closed, her mouth open even wider. </p><p>Her hips moved and rotated a I disappeared completely inside her, the sound of rhythmic slapping filling the room, steadily picking up speed. The only problem, moving at that speed was making the situation much harder to resist. </p><p>I slowed down slightly, trying to catch my breath — cursing the fact that my powers didn’t include endurance — when she chose to suddenly rebel.</p><p>Well, the best way possible, pushing her whole body back as she impaled herself on my hard cock. Clearly, she had no intention of stopping, and I would be a poor dom if I let her finish by herself. At the risk of my self-assigned game, I grabbed the belt — that was still around her hands — tighter, using it as leverage as I invaded her core. </p><p>No longer in control of myself, I sighed as I matched her movement, responding to her pushes with thrusts of my own.</p><p>One thing was clear. Tara was the greatest hire I could ever make as a new business … and I had no idea how I could surpass that. </p><p>*** </p><p>Tara couldn’t believe the intensity of the feelings she was feeling. She had already thought herself to be enjoying the greatest pleasure ever as she desperately used his fingers as a masturbation aid. But, however great that feeling, it was impossible to compare to what she was feeling. </p><p>Her first time was supposed to be painful and uncomfortable. It was what the magazines said, confirmed by a few people she was close enough to talk to. Yet, there was no pain — well, nothing she couldn’t handle — and supposed discomfort was easily surpassed by the waves of pleasure that spread through her with each push. </p><p>The pleasure that defied reason. Even as he moved desperately, she felt herself wanting more, doing her best to push herself to meet his pushes. </p><p>“What an eager secretary,” he said, his dark tone as arousing as his spank. Feeling shy, she tried to suppress her moans, but she was unsuccessful. Her body was betraying her as the pleasure invaded her. “Do you want more?” </p><p>“Y-yes, sir,” she said, her focus still on the way her core was stretching wide as he repeatedly invaded her. “P-please, faster.” </p><p>“Such a needy little secretary,” he said, picking even more speed, her core expanding with his invasion, overwhelmed with pleasure. It was good that his hands were on her hips, because his touch was the only thing that allowed her to maintain a hint of control. </p><p>Lost in pure carnal pleasure, she was not able to say anything as she felt her body clench once more, giving her another climax. She barely registered his pull, followed by a soft rain on her back. “Congratulations, you’re hired,” he said as he finally unwrapped her hands. </p><p>She lay on the desk, unable to move as her legs softened. Even as he fixed his clothing, she said nothing, and continued to lay, breathing hard. </p><p>“Are you going to stay here for all night,” he said. </p><p>Tara felt herself blush once again, this time for a different reason. “I … I don’t think I can walk,” she whispered. </p><p>“Such a needy little secretary,” he repeated, chuckling. Before she could answer, he hugged her, and she found herself in a bridal hold. “Let’s bring you to shower, then,” he said. </p><p>“T-thank you, sir,” she whispered as she hugged him, enjoying his warmth. It was different than the previous carnal rush … but no less amazing. “It feels … good.” </p><p>“Nice to hear, sweetie,” he whispered, his voice enough to send shivers across her body. “I don’t need much from you. Just loyalty and obedience. Tell me, can you do it?” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she whispered, burying her face against his chest, once again listening to his heartbeat. “I can do that.” </p><p>He said nothing else, but he hugged her tighter. It was all she needed. As they arrived at the shower, she stepped once again, ready for a shower. She expected to take the shower alone … but said nothing when he got rid of his clothes rapidly and followed. </p><p>She blushed even as he turned a satisfied smirk toward her. “You look exhausted. I should help you,” he said, not bothering to hide his amusement.</p><p>“I-it’s not necessary, sir,” she whispered, feeling self-conscious. It was not proper for him to help her. Even if … even… </p><p>Her thoughts flew away as he turned on the water. The warm dance of water was amazing, but not as amazing as his hands dancing on her body once more. He positioned himself so that she was trapped between his body and the wall with no route to escape except through him. </p><p>And, that route was impossible for her to take. She couldn’t push him back. </p><p>“I insist,” he said as he crouched down and grabbed a loofah, pressing it against her ankle, gently rubbing her legs as he climbed upward. She froze, feeling self-conscious even as he slowly moved up, covering her skin with soap. </p><p>She couldn’t help but whimper as he climbed up, focusing on her thighs. Yet, it wasn’t the earlier explosive pleasure. It was more of a gentle exhaustion, one that mixed with a sense of security. </p><p>She closed her eyes, trying to calm down for a moment, and…</p><p>***</p><p>“Well, that was not what I expected a shared shower to be,” I chuckled as finally turned off the water and used a towel to gently dry her off, doing my best not to awaken her. I could have felt annoyed as she fell asleep, but I decided to let it slide. </p><p>Even without considering the effects of a warm shower, she had a tough day. Her interview, her intense work as a cleaner, her first accidental debut as a superhero…</p><p>Losing her virginity. </p><p>No, she certainly deserved her rest. I helped her to wear one of my shirts, yet somehow she continued to sleep. </p><p>Maybe it was the effect of the exhaustion, but she was certainly a heavy sleeper. </p><p>It would be fun to share a room with her, I decided even as I lay her down on the mattress, squeezed next to her, waiting for sleep to take me. </p><p>I doubted I would wait for long after the day I had. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Tara did nothing to resist as her new boss pushed her down. </p><p>It wasn’t the lack of leverage that stopped her … as with her powers, that was certainly not a problem. She just needed to tap into her strength and stretch her neck, and it would have solved it. </p><p>Likely breaking his arm in the process, a fact that he was very much aware of after her accidental reveal. </p><p>She did nothing … because, much to her shame, she liked it. </p><p>No, she loved it, accepting the treatment of being treated roughly, not even letting her take a breather. </p><p>“Beautiful work,” he whispered as her nose touched his skin, the compliment giving her even more pleasure than the treatment. </p><p>She still couldn’t believe that he didn’t send her off. She might be shy, but she was not stupid, and she knew the safest thing was to kick her out and send her identity to the villain whose henchmen attacked the bar. Yet, he stood by her, accepting her. </p><p>Something even her family wouldn’t have done if they knew the truth. She had watched her childhood friend get kicked out of her home because she had powers. </p><p>Yet, her new boss accepted her … wholeheartedly. Compared to that, the way he used her body was nothing. </p><p>Well, not nothing, she corrected herself, a blush of shame mixing the redness that was already covering her body. It was another positive aspect of the situation. </p><p>She had never done more than a few kisses before … no matter what she wanted. She lacked the courage to push for it, but enjoying it as her new boss ordered her to was much better. His hands landed on her breasts, mauling them aggressively, but the pain just enhanced her pleasure further. </p><p>That meant he stopped pushing down her head, but she was a good secretary, and a good secretary only needs to be shown once. She grabbed his legs as she pushed herself down, taking him deep into her throat again and again, his moans of pleasure as thrilling as his orders. </p><p>Up and down, repeatedly, as she did her best to make him cum. “That’s enough,” he suddenly called, and for a moment, she thought that she had made a mistake. As she pulled back, she was ready to apologize, but as she met his eyes, he was already patting his lap. </p><p>“Come here,” he ordered. “Let’s work on your other secretarial skills, like a lapdance.” </p><p>“Yes sir,” she whispered, the demeaning way he talked about her future tasks driving her pleasure even higher. She parted her legs and sat down, properly mounting his lap, his shaft squeezed between their bodies. </p><p>More forward than she thought herself to be capable, but his soft smile was enough to encourage her. “Very good,” he said as he grabbed her ass and pulled her closer, increasing the sensation even further. “Now, move your ass.” </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she said, following his request even as his hands climbed up, caressing along her spine. Somehow, the gentle and innocent touch drove her even crazier than the earlier treatment of her breasts. </p><p>She failed to control her face as the unexpected pleasure flooded her body, making her moan and tremble. Her eyes closed as she tried to process the foreign sensation, giving her a chance to recover. </p><p>Her new boss didn’t agree, as he used that chance to lean forward to start kissing her neck. They were short, almost fleeting, yet somehow searing her skin. </p><p>Well, she wasn’t complaining, even if they left her surprisingly short of breath as he slowly moved down to her collarbones. </p><p>“Don’t forget to move your hips,” he warned, underlining his words with a spank. She gasped, the sudden pain making her pleasure even more pronounced. </p><p>She moved back reflexively, only to stop immediately as his hand landed on the small of her back, enough to remind her about her situation. As his lips landed on her collarbones, she lost her ability to modulate her voice completely, her moans filling the room. </p><p>His hand slipping down once again to maul and caress her plump ass with a renewed aggressiveness certainly helped. Her hips started to move faster and faster, enjoying the way she pressed against her stomach.</p><p>She wanted to do even more things … but even at such a moment, she lacked the courage to move forward without his explicit permission. She abandoned herself to his touch. </p><p>His touch had suddenly dipped down to her wetness, caressing her cilt. The pleasure jolted her as she moved, but his hand stayed in place, caressing gently to show it was not an accident. Nowhere near one, even… </p><p>Her hips moved outside her control, but luckily, he managed to loosen his grip before she moved. Good timing. She wanted to say something about the possible danger, but one of his hands slipped back to her ass, stabilizing her movement, while the other continued to tease her wetness. </p><p>Incredible, but not as incredible as what followed. Before she could even get used to the amazing feeling, he slipped a finger inside, teaching her a new meaning of pleasure. She was having trouble believing that such a pleasure was possible. </p><p>Unable to contain herself, her hips started to move, allowing his finger to do even more work with less effort. She only stopped when his hand froze, afraid something was wrong. Yet, he was smiling. “Continue fucking yourself with my hand,” he ordered. </p><p>The sudden crass words hit her differently, but in the end, they were all kindling to her out-of-control arousal, filling her body to the next stage.</p><p>She moved back and forth with a growing desire and desperation, his finger enough to drive her crazy. Her pleasure rose higher and higher as she abandoned herself to the pleasure she was feeling.</p><p>“Now, give me a kiss, but don’t stop,” he ordered. She was more than happy to follow that order, leaning forward until her breasts were rubbing against his chest. He kept kissing her again and again while her hips danced … barely registering when he added a second finger. </p><p>She was aware that it was the last opportunity for her to pull back if she wanted to stop … but she didn’t want that. It was simply incomprehensible. </p><p>She moaned again and again, lost in pleasure … lost enough that she didn’t register the absence of his hand that had been on her ass earlier … until he managed to lead her hands to her back and wrapped them around her wrists. </p><p>It shouldn’t have mattered. After all, she didn’t even need to exert herself fully to free herself. </p><p>Yet, it felt even stronger than one of the mysterious weapons the villains used against the strength-type heroes. The reason was not a mystery. It was the gaze of her new boss, who was a handsome but rough man… Two details that she loved. </p><p>“Who said you to stop moving your ass,” he ordered, and she started moving once more, his fingers pushing her closer and closer toward climax. The skill he displayed as he kissed her again and again wasn’t making her any easier to resist. She breathed hard, repeatedly, occasionally moving back hard enough to touch the desk behind her. </p><p>Meanwhile, his hand started to wander on her body, treating her like a toy as he repeatedly slapped her ass, twisted her nipples, and caressed along her spine … she just gasped and moaned, some suppressed by his lips, the others radiating freely. </p><p>He started to get more aggressive as she got closer to her climax. Soon, his fingers started moving, the resulting pleasure far more intense than what she could gain with her own effort. She just surrendered herself to the pleasure. </p><p>Yet, that made him move even faster. With an expression of savage satisfaction that drove her even deeper into the pleasure, he added another finger, curled them, and invaded her thoroughly, like he was the one with the super strength, and she was a poor damsel. </p><p>She loved it. </p><p>As his fingers plunged into her depths with incredible precision, her face twisted in a perverse joy, her face glowing with pleasure until she found herself wondering how she managed not to flicker into the fire. </p><p>Her mouth opened for a final time as the pleasure hit her with an intensity that she never thought to be possible. She tried to contain them, yet her climax made that impossible, her whole body trembling. </p><p>She collapsed against his chest, his heartbeat feeling like a lullaby after his aggression, her hands still bound behind her. She could stay like that forever…</p><p>“Stand up,” he ordered. </p><p>Unless her boss wanted otherwise, of course. She immediately jumped up to her feet, ignoring both her trembling legs and her bound arms. </p><p>“Now, for the next step, I want you to take a position that’s worthy of a secretary,” he added. </p><p>Tara didn’t waste even a second before she lay against the desk, her naked ass turned toward him, ready for what he had in mind. </p><p>“Smart girl,” he whispered, which gave her even more pleasure than the earlier treatment. </p><p>Her new job was … excellent.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Come on, my flower, don’t be like this,” Charlie called from the other side. “You’re talking too long inside. Clearly, you’re angry. Let me help.” </p><p>“Nonsense, I’m just trying my shirt with different bras, to see which one looks best,” Umi said as she stood up. </p><p>“No bra is the best,” I whispered, interrupting her tirade as I hugged her. </p><p>“S-sir, j-just a minute, I have to send him away,” she whispered, but she wasn’t able to keep her voice low enough to completely avoid her fiancee’s attention. </p><p>“What did you say, flower,” he called, even trying to open the door. It was locked, yet, the Umi was too panicked to notice that detail. Instead, she rushed forward to lean against the door, ready to keep it closed physically. </p><p>I followed her, and whispered another warning. “You have one minute,” I said, raising my arm. “Sixty seconds and counting.” </p><p>Umi’s gaze widened as she realized exactly what I was implying. My hands landing on her hips was enough of a clue. The panic that bloomed on her face as she looked at me, silently begging, was even more beautiful. </p><p>“Fifty-seven,” I whispered. </p><p>She whimpered desperately while Charlie asked her to open the door so they could talk, trying to come up with an excuse to send him away. Amusingly, she didn’t even attempt to bargain with me. </p><p>She was learning. </p><p>“Just go away, Charlie,” Umi gasped, saying the worst possible thing to send him away quickly in her panic, especially when combined with her exasperated tone. Charlie was simple enough to read her tone as suppressed anger. </p><p>Making sure he stuck around to make it up to her. </p><p>Umi was really a poor decision-maker under stress. </p><p>“Oh, come on, flower. You know I didn’t mean it like that. You don’t have to buy anything if you don’t want. I’m sure you’ll pass the interview in flying colors either way. I trust you,” he said, doing his best to earn quick forgiveness. </p><p>However, I couldn’t help but wonder if they were his opinions, or if it was once again Tiffany, whispering just the correct suggestion to make Umi angrier. </p><p>Either way, Charlie should have realized that trying to use his fiancee as an eye candy was causing problems — even if he completely missed the full extent — yet he just doubled down. </p><p>He was really lucky he was working for me, so I could teach him an important lesson about decision-making. </p><p>He continued to apologize, ignoring Umi’s attempts to intervene — not that they were particularly strong, as her state of dress didn’t solve her issues with speaking over others. “… I promise I’ll bring you to that holiday you always wanted to Paris once I receive my promotion,” he continued. </p><p>However, that seemed to have an effect on Umi. She must have really wanted that holiday. </p><p>Luckily, I had an easy way to reverse it. “So, Paris,” I whispered, and she nodded hesitantly. I leaned forward to press my hips against hers. “Good, it looks like our first destination for a business trip is set, we’ll fly the first weekend after your interview,” I whispered. </p><p>Her beautiful eyes widened in shock, the easy offer about what was no doubt her dream holiday easily destroying any possible weight of her fiancee’s future promise. </p><p>That was the risk of using promises of gifts further than gifts themselves. I couldn’t have competed with the memories of a beautiful holiday … but the promise of a distant one was easy to destroy. </p><p>“By the way, twenty-two seconds,” I warned her, making her focus on the present. </p><p>“Charlie, just go away,” Umi whispered desperately, but he ignored, continuing to talk about the amazing Paris holiday. </p><p>“Two, one … and failure,” I whispered, enjoying her begging gaze. Silently, she was asking for another minute. Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of giving that to her. “I’ll start slow, just try to send him away,” I said, knowing that she would not even be able to speak as I started playing with her naked body. </p><p>I started with soft touches, almost random as my fingers danced over her body. A caress here, a lingering touch there… It worked even better than I would have thought, her focus on keeping her mouth shut while her fiancee continued to ramble. </p><p>“It’ll be amazing to visit the Eiffel Tower, right, flower?” he asked. </p><p>“Yes, it will,” she said desperately. </p><p>“It looks like you’re not that angry anymore,” Charlie said, unaware that his fiancee’s holiday plans didn’t include him. </p><p>“Poor man,” I whispered to Umi’s ear even as I started to push her toward the door, slowly moving from casual touches into a more fun treatment. </p><p>“He should have thought that before trying to seduce that blonde … trollop,” Umi whispered back. She wasn’t particularly silent either, but Charlie missed in the fervor of his imaginary holiday plans. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at her attitude … and the fact that she couldn’t properly curse even at such a moment. “What’s so funny,” Charlie asked, hearing my voice but assuming it was Umi. </p><p>“N-nothing, just the fabric of this shirt. It tickles,” Umi said, her voice convincingly strained as I pressed my hand on her back, forcing her tighter against the door. </p><p>“Maybe I should pick you a better shirt,” Charlie said. </p><p>“N-no need,” Umi answered automatically. </p><p>“Oh, you skipped such a good opportunity to send him away,” I whispered even as I slipped a hand through the slit of her skirt, caressing her inner thigh. “Naughty.” </p><p>Only then, did it click Umi that she had just skipped an excellent opportunity to send Charlie away. She opened her mouth, no doubt to reverse that decision, but I sealed her lips with a kiss, enjoying the panicked dance of her tongue. </p><p>With my lips helping her to stay silent, my fingers climbed up, raising her skirt alongside, and soon, her ass was naked, with my shaft conveniently buried between her cheeks. </p><p>“Try not to make too much sound,” I whispered as I let my hands wander over her body. Her hips rebelled, pushing harder against my crotch, swaying needily. </p><p>However, even as she did so, her lips danced with a sense of confusion. Revenge was an interesting motivator, and the mixture of greed and desire didn’t make things any easier. </p><p>So, as I grabbed her breasts in preparation to fuck her against the door while her fiancee was on the other side, she just angled her hips for a better entrance. I continued to maul her breasts, which still carried the marks of my aggressive mauling from earlier. </p><p>I pulled my hips back, angled, and pushed forward slowly, dipping into her wetness. </p><p>She froze for a moment, her eyes wide in shock. It seemed that, even with all the setup, she didn’t think that I would dare to go all the way under the circumstances. </p><p>Well, she would soon learn better. </p><p>Her shock was replaced with alarm as I pushed forward slowly, not wanting to risk the sound of colliding flesh, which would have been hard to explain. Even to a gullible man like Charlie. </p><p>However, that didn’t mean it wasn’t a challenge for her to stay silent. Every push of mine was slow and deep, stretching her to the limits. It was hard for her to handle, especially since she was still a virgin until recently.</p><p>Very recently. </p><p>After a particularly hard push, her face contorted even more, alarmed.  A moan escaped despite my lips on hers. </p><p>“Are you alright, flower?” Charlie asked, though his tone wasn’t particularly concerned. </p><p>“I — I just stubbed my toe,” she answered, looking at me angrily as she said that. Not undeserved, as I continued to push inside her even as she struggled to speak. </p><p>“Be careful,” Charlie said, while Tiffany laughed in the background. </p><p>“Yes, be careful. I’m sure your new boss is not the kind that appreciates clumsiness. What if you spill his coffee. He might bend you over his leg and spank you.” </p><p>Charlie snorted at that. “That old man. In his dreams,” he said. </p><p>Umi’s eyes widened at the insult as she looked at me. I didn’t get angry … it was hard to feel that while I was fucking his fiancee just a couple feet away from him. </p><p>Still, sometimes, it was about making a point. “Your fiancee just earned you a creampie, sweetie,” I whispered as I started invading her core faster and faster. She struggled to contain her moans … but with the convenient excuse of stubbing her toe, silence was not a must. </p><p>Then, before we could finish our fun, his phone rang. “Damn it,” he said. “I need to go to an urgent meeting. I’ll see you at dinner, flower,” he said. </p><p>“Sure, go,” Umi said, almost a shout. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m here to take care of her,” Tiffany said, like a wolf trying to convince a farmer that she would make a good shepherd. </p><p>But, the farmer in question was gullible enough to believe the wolf in question. “You’re the best, Tiffany,” he said. “I’m sorry I’m working hard, but it’s not for nothing. Imagine how beautiful it’ll be when we visit Paris in Autumn,” he said. Then, he walked away. </p><p>His beautiful fiancee didn’t answer, too busy being filled with my cum…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I woke up, it was already near midday, yet I was still exhausted. Understandable, as I had worked incredibly hard for the last two days. Add in the long drive … and the nature of our fun times … no wonder I was barely feeling like I wanted to stand up. </p><p>Pity I didn’t have the luxury of lazing around. </p><p>The unexpected success of the convention was amazing. Receiving a mid-five figures income had been fascinating enough, but I wasn’t naive enough to think that it was enough. No, ultimately, in the business I was in, that was barely enough to set up a decent studio. </p><p>I needed far more funds to return to the sector. At a minimum, a studio in Manhattan, a very expensive car,  and several high-profile jobs were needed to show everyone that, despite the embargo I had been operating under, I was able to not only survive but thrive. </p><p>Was that unfair, certainly, but it was the minimum required to fight against the manager and the lead editor of one of the biggest fashion magazines. </p><p>“Well, it could have been worse,” I said as I stumbled through the stairs after a quick shower, wearing just a towel. “I could have angered a movie director … or worse, a producer.” Yeah, that would have been truly horrible. At least, against a magazine director, I had a fighting chance. </p><p>As I walked, I pulled my phone, and started browsing through the real estate, looking for an appropriate building. Not to live, but to use as a proper studio. </p><p>Someone else might have tried to use the opportunity to prioritize the living conditions, but I wanted to sink everything back into my business, some to rent a studio, the others to equipment. A better camera, lights, screens … maybe even a nice corner for a tailor considering the intense need for costumes in my current work stream. </p><p>Picking the location was an important decision that required my full attention on the screen as I struggled to pick the most appropriate locations, not paying much attention to my surroundings.  </p><p>\"What's wrong?\" a voice asked. Nicole, I recognized even before I raised my gaze, her concern making it known as much as her tone. Still, I looked up … and I am glad that I did enjoy the following blessing. </p><p>She was wearing nothing but a morning robe. It was a conservative piece, long enough to be boring … but with the front of it appropriately loosened to give a concrete view of her cleavage, it was not a concern. </p><p>A beautiful accidental reveal. </p><p>I barely held back a chuckle as I recognized the exact nature of that accidental reveal. One side of the edge was folded perfectly while the other was bunched, giving a perfect asymmetry. It looked natural … the kind of natural that required five minutes of careful tinkering to achieve. And, she seemed to forget that I was the one that taught that particular trick during the photoshoots. </p><p>I couldn’t blame her for forgetting, as I often ... distracted her after our photoshoots. Details such as those could slip easily… </p><p>“Looking for a new place is stressful,” I said, and immediately, a flash of panic passed through her face. “I need a new studio. Unfortunately, you have to still suffer my presence for a while more,” I immediately added. I had considered teasing her, but the sheer panic on her face changed my mind. </p><p>Messing with her would be mean. </p><p>With that, her gloom disappeared, and her clenched jaw loosened. “Is it urgent,” she asked. </p><p>“Very much so. I just received a new job that will make me a lot of money, and I need a better studio,” I said, then smirked. “Good news for you, for that job, you’ll make five times what I had been paying you earlier,” I added. </p><p>“F-five times,” she gasped. “I-isn’t it too much?” </p><p>I chuckled as I took a step forward. “Of course not. Though, I wouldn’t say no if it came with some extra benefits.” She blushed. “Like a nice neck rubbing while I look for a nice location.”  </p><p>She said nothing as she stepped behind me. She didn’t even ask to change the location, and started rubbing my neck. It was not something she would not have dared to do just a few days ago … but considering she had been caught doing far worse by Nancy — even if she was under a disguise that prevented Nancy from recognizing her — it was understandable that her morals had … loosened. </p><p>\"This stress is killing me,\" I complained as she rubbed the back of my neck while I stared at the screen, cycling through the available properties that could be useful.</p><p>Luckily, the back rub wasn’t the only way Nicole was battling with my stress. Occasionally, I checked her from a nearby mirror, enjoying the view. She was a true knockout even when dressed conservatively. Additionally, that was not the only benefit I had been enjoying. </p><p>Focused on her task, she didn’t realize just how scandalous her cleavage was getting as it parted … particularly since neglected to put on a bra — not that she needed one.  </p><p>If I was dealing with a more experienced model, I would have assumed that it was something she was doing deliberately in an effort to seduce me. But Nicole was easy to read … and despite how it looked, the situation was clearly accidental. </p><p>That didn’t mean she wasn’t getting worked up. As her hands slowly dipped down to my shoulders, caressing my muscles, she was getting aroused. She bit her lips, trying to contain her arousal, but failing. </p><p>I enjoyed her natural beauty on the reflection between checking the photos of real estate listings. </p><p>“Do you mind getting me something to drink?” I asked. </p><p>“Beer or wine?” she asked. </p><p>“Just water,” I said. “I’ll be driving a lot, and I prefer to check the buildings carefully. I need a place that I could move to my studio immediately.” </p><p>“I see, you’re really in a hurry.” </p><p>“Yes. I need to be shooting very aggressively the next week at worst, but I prefer to do it tomorrow if possible.” </p><p>Nicole said nothing else as she turned and walked toward the fridge, but stopped after a step. She didn’t make a sound, but her posture of one of distress. Only then, did she realize just how much of a show she had been putting on. </p><p>She looked at me panickedly — very unnecessary considering everything we had done together — relaxing only noticing I was still looking away … missing the fact that I was using the mirror to watch her all along. </p><p>Her perception was not exactly sharp, but that didn’t matter when she had other amazing qualities like an amazing ass and even more amazing tits. And, after a long pause, she decided not to fix her robe and continue displaying the latter. </p><p>Then, she bent over to the fridge, far more slowly than it was necessary, displaying the former to the best effect. “Maybe a glass of juice instead,” she offered, making sure my gaze turned toward her. </p><p>I decided to humor her and turned toward them. “Just water is enough,” I said, but I kept watching her as she stood up. “Oops,” she gasped as she looked down, acting like she had just noticed the state of her robe. </p><p>Unfortunately, while she was a natural model, the same certainly didn’t apply to her acting skills. I barely kept myself from laughing, knowing she would be sad at that. Instead, I made a show off looking at her assets on display while she made a show of fixing it. </p><p>Hardly a chore. </p><p>Her sweet little ass swayed as she walked toward me, and when she passed the water to me, I grabbed her by the waist and pulled her closer. “Thank you for the water,” I said as I kissed her on the cheek, deliberately soft and lingering … one that worked even better than a searing kiss to fluster her. </p><p>“T-that’s nothing,” she stammered, but made no attempt to extract herself from my arms. </p><p>“By the way. I managed to find a promising location, and I need to be there in half an hour to see the location.” </p><p>“Oh,” Nicole gasped, her disappointment clear. </p><p>“Do you want to come with me? It’ll be fun,” I said, then my smirk widened. “You can help me test the general outlook of the place with a test shoot. I need to make sure we can move immediately.”</p><p>“Sure,” she said. </p><p>“And, as a benefit, you can help me test the acoustics of the place,” I added.  </p><p>She was confused at that. “I don’t think I can help with that. I’m hardly an expert…” she started before her words faded away, what I had been implying clicking perfectly. “Oh.” </p><p>“Yes,” I said as I squeezed her ass, and she cried loudly. “Just like this,” I added while I enjoyed her blush. “Well, almost like this. I have some louder noises in mind. I’m sure I can help you with them,”  I explained, each word making her blush even more.  </p><p>Yet, she made no attempt to pull herself out of my arms. I was tempted to push her against the kitchen counter. Unfortunately, I actually needed to be at my destination in half an hour. “Go and put something interesting,” I said. </p><p>“W-what should I wear?” she asked. </p><p>“You’re a model now, surprise me,” I answered, slapping her ass as she walked away, her ass swaying despite her hurried dash. </p><p>She was turning out to be a truly excellent model. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“How’s being a prisoner going,” Helga asked the moment I teleported back to our little hidden spot, once again bringing a dozen prospective candidates with me for Helga’s special classes. </p><p>“Not bad,” I answered with a chuckle. </p><p>It was the third day of my imprisonment, and they were yet to allow me to come into contact with the Spear, still trying to come to a decision about my loyalty. </p><p>Naturally, it took me about fifteen minutes after the guild blacksmith had left to take control of the whole wing teleport back, using another disguise I prepared to pose as my own assistant back in my forge, making sure recruiting efforts were going well despite the production slowing down. </p><p>It wasn’t like I was short of money. </p><p>I teleported back to Silver Spires to bring the best candidates, finally pushing the number of private students Helga had over a hundred. </p><p>Of course, based on my request, she only interacted with them through a very complicated and awe-inspiring illusion, introducing herself as the spirit of knowledge. The sense of wonderment that awakened helped the Divine Spark generation quite a bit. </p><p>“How about the —“ she started, but I silenced her … rather directly, with a searing kiss. </p><p>“No talking. It’s time for my conjugal visit,” I said after I pulled back. </p><p>“Really, before we even give you a show of my newest discovery,” she said. I was about to say yes, but then I stopped, recognizing the naughty way her lips curled. </p><p>For a moment, I said nothing, examining her. Her beauty was as striking as always with her beautiful blonde hair spilling to her shoulders, and her robe hugging her body. Yet, it was her smile that grabbed my attention. Beautiful as always … but with a naughty, playful curl that was normally absent. </p><p>She was getting even sexier. </p><p>And wasn’t that a was a scary thought? </p><p>Good kind of scary. </p><p>“Alright, tell me,” I said as I decided to surrender, not having in my heart to ruin her little ploy. </p><p>She said nothing, but waved her hand. Immediately, a complicated illusion appeared, representing the single most complicated magical artifact I had ever seen, impossible to discern where the magic ended and the material aspects began. </p><p>Even with my intelligence, I was barely able to decipher its function after examining it for a while … and only because its ultimate function was simple. </p><p>“A beacon,” I gasped. “One that can be detected accurately through primordial aether.” </p><p>“It’s just a prototype, and I’m not sure how long it could resist the emptiness of the Primordial Aether … but yes, a beacon,” she said, with no problem of counting the negative aspects. She was proud. </p><p>As she should be. What she designed was no joke, even if it was impossible to build in its current form — the forging requirements were significantly above my capabilities, and flat-out impossible in several locations. </p><p>In comparison, purely magical aspects were masterful, perfect as far as I could see, with several methods showing it in a way that I hadn’t thought to be possible. “What does this ward here do?” I asked. </p><p>“Ah, it’s simple. It’s there to solve the core mismatch between the …” she started, giving me a lengthy explanation, one that I barely understood despite my Intelligence stat. </p><p>Admittedly, she didn’t make my job any easier by the way she positioned herself. She stood next to me, with her hand sneaking down, dragging her palm over my erection, my pants proving to be a poor insulator against her divine fingers. I stopped listening and started enjoying her touch. </p><p>“Focus. Do you want me to explain twice,” she said the moment my attention started to wander, before I could even give an outward sign. Yet, from the way her smile widened, it was clear that she was confident in her assessment. </p><p>“Your power?” I asked.</p><p>“The position of the Goddess of Knowledge has some interesting benefits,” she said. “Including how to catch wayward students,” she added, squeezing my shaft slightly. </p><p>“Inconvenient,” I pouted, and her smile turned even more vicious. “I’ll pay attention,” I immediately corrected, happy to play along by giving an exaggerated display of obedience. </p><p>She certainly deserved me playing along with her fantasies. </p><p>I kept my attention on the glowing magical display that zoomed in and out repeatedly as she explained how every single part worked. Some parts displayed how the fundamentals worked, while the others showed some magical rules and principles that I didn’t even know existed. </p><p>She was using her new strength as a goddess very efficiently. </p><p>I enjoyed the lecture on magic … even if her fingers were making it very difficult to focus. It was difficult enough when she was caressing from outside, but it turned even more difficult once she pushed my pants down. </p><p>“Is this appropriate behavior, professor,” I teased her. </p><p>“Of course. You can’t listen to the class with your pants feeling tight and uncomfortable,” she answered readily. True, but that didn’t make her naked touch any less distracting. </p><p>She was playing for the keeps. </p><p>The explanation lasted almost an hour … and even then, it could only be described as an introduction. “Now, show me how well you understood it by upgrading the design of the physical parts,” she ordered. </p><p>What she asked of me was not a simple task. The pressure from the complicated wards alone was enough to destabilize most of the ordinary metals, which was challenging enough. Then, there was the aspect of building a correct and stable structure. Then, it had to be able to hold the mana for long, resist the erosion of the Primordial Aether at least partially … as well as some other interesting features. </p><p>Even a prototype was difficult to truly design. </p><p>Still, I started working, doing my best to improve. </p><p>Then, Helga chose to complicate matters seven further by falling down on her knees and her lips wrapped around the head of my shaft, making the challenge even more difficult. Her soft fingers stayed wrapped around the base, pumping up and down steadily </p><p>I didn’t bother to keep down my moan. “Focus,” she admonished, pulling back just enough to deliver her warning before she sank down again, this time going deeper. </p><p>I followed her request and suppressed my moans, enjoying her steady effort. Jolts of pleasure spread through my body as she started to apply a very complicated pattern of movement. </p><p>“It looks like your Domain of Knowledge is not limited to magical knowledge,” I mocked her, learning a playful pinch. </p><p>“I told you to focus,” she warned, but she was unable to prevent the blush from spreading on her face. For all her efforts to look like she was an expert on maintaining control, she was still my shy bookworm at heart. </p><p>Anyone else trying to order me around would have earned a playful punishment at best. But Helga was different. </p><p>She earned the privilege of a delayed punishment. </p><p>I worked on my task carefully, maintaining a fragile balance between work and pleasure. It was a challenge to do so with the wetness spreading around my girth, attacking the fragile balance I had built. </p><p>I continued to take many magical notes, but my speed of writing slowed down once she took me into her mouth fully, moving back and forth at an incredible pace. </p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to process the sudden rush of pleasure without moaning. </p><p>I failed, spectacularly. </p><p>“I expect my students to be more attentive,” she said … without even stopping her treatment, using magic to vocalize it while her mouth was busy. She bobbed her head, her pace changing. Sometimes, she moved back and forth aggressively, sometimes, she bobbed slowly as she savored the taste. </p><p>Making my job harder and harder, grunts turning into a long string of moans as she worked on my shaft. </p><p>Time slowed down, and I suffered a delicious torture as I tried to put the finishing touches on the schematic. </p><p>However, as we climbed toward the peak of the pleasure, our bodies weren’t the only thing that was reacting. My mana danced in her automatically as it was my habit, helping her to process the new Divine Spark she had collected. </p><p>That spark started to float once I helped her to completely bond with the environment, solidifying her domain further. </p><p>And, giving me a beautiful reward in the process.  </p><p>[+7 Intelligence]</p><p>It was interesting just how little the size of the Domain mattered as far as my benefits went. Just in a few weeks, Helga was able to catch up with Seldanna, who had thousands of times more Divine Spark to rely on along with the memories of an old god. </p><p>Yet, Helga almost managed to catch up with her initial stage. Well, at least in terms of supporting my power. </p><p>In other aspects, like actually allowing her to resist an invasion, her tiny domain wouldn’t be particularly useful. Not that it mattered. </p><p>I was there to defend her. </p><p>With the significant boost of intelligence I had just received, working on the plans of the beacon got easier. The higher processing speed allowed me to make some interesting calculations that I was unable to complete earlier, and soon, the first set of changes was complete. </p><p>Of course, the beacon was nowhere near complete … but it was progress nonetheless. </p><p>“Good work,” Helga said and grabbed my legs while she took a deep breath. “Now, it’s time for your reward.” With that, she leaned forward, her blonde hair spilling down to hide her face as she mercilessly deep-throated me….</p><p>And, soon, I reached a limit, filling her mouth. She pulled back once she managed to catch every little bit of my seed, swallowing with gusto. </p><p>“It’s a pity you have to return to prison,” she chuckled as she waved her hand, and teleported away, teasing me. </p><p>Cheeky girl, I thought with a smile, and teleported back to my prison rather than following her. </p><p>I could punish her during our next meeting…</p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 61</p><p>Endurance: 72      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 58410}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>I considered saying nothing for a moment, letting the man revel in his smugness. Unfortunately, that would show him that all the production he had gone through to impress me had been for nothing. And, if he realized that, he might not reveal why he had gone through all that trouble. </p><p>Of course, I couldn’t just start begging for forgiveness or do something equally absurd. After all, I was supposed to be a brave soul that challenged the guild directly. “It seems that I should have joined the guild,” I said, acting like I was using my anger to cover up my fear. “That way, I might have learned how to be a coward like you.” </p><p>My insult was enough to create a flicker of frustration on his face. It wasn’t a particularly well-crafted one, but coming from someone that he saw close to his skill, it clearly had an impact. </p><p>He suppressed it with all the smoothness of a politician, and smiled instead. “Oh, the fire of youth,” he said dismissively instead. “As you grow old, you’ll learn that not every problem needs to be faced head-on.” He paused, his smirk sharpening. “Well, if you grow old…” </p><p>“Impressive, I would have thought that you would have at least finished explaining whatever amazing offer you had before resorting to the threats,” I said, leaning forward as if I wanted to turn that into a physical confrontation. </p><p>“You’re brave,” he commented. “Too bad you don’t have the necessary caution to temper it.” </p><p>This time, I gave a mocking laugh. “What’s the point of reaching the peak of what’s possible if I’m going to act cautious all the time. I rather die.” </p><p>That earned a patronizing shake of his head. “Oh, poor child. You think that you’re at the top of the world just because you leveled up somewhere near level thirty and earned a few achievements on your own. You don’t know just how many secrets the world truly holds. We’re just at the beginning. You’re weak.” </p><p>“What nonsense are you talking about, you crazy old man,” I said, acting shocked. “Do you want me to believe that there are others that could treat me like a weakling? Have you been using drugs? Why would the world be such a hellhole if there were people that are much stronger than us…” </p><p>He sighed in defeat. “That’s the question, isn’t it,” he answered, his sigh of frustration real as far as I could see. “For some reason, they don’t intervene even as the monsters massacre people, only intervening when things get too much…” </p><p>As I listened to him, I became convinced that his knowledge about the Eternals was quite limited. It was good, as it meant they wouldn’t be alerted if I had to take a sudden emergency action. </p><p>“Let’s assume for a moment that what you’re saying is correct, and you’re not getting mad in your advanced age,” I said, not missing the opportunity to get in another insult. “Does it have anything to do with this cowardly trap,” I added. </p><p>“Somewhat, but it’s mostly your fault,” he answered, his smirk widening. “This facility holds the key to making contact with that mysterious organization. It was the greatest opportunity of your life when the fourth prince reached for you to repair it … but you chose to waste that opportunity by trying to betray him for the crown prince.” </p><p>“And, let me guess, he reached out to you,” I said, implicitly accepting that claim. I had no doubt that the only reason they had learned was because the second prince’s spies deliberately let it known. The fourth prince’s spies — the ones that were actually loyal to him — were nowhere good enough to catch it otherwise.  </p><p>They clearly wanted to make sure I couldn’t just work for the fourth prince, and had to follow up with the plan of stealing the Spear. </p><p>“I have to thank you for that. The prince clearly has concerns about trusting any guild member with such a secret. Without your betrayal, he wouldn’t have contact with me.” </p><p>“Good for you, but why all the trouble,” I said, making a sweeping gesture as I spoke. “Why bother explaining all to me when you could just go and repair your precious weapon …” I continued, then I made a show of freezing. Shocked at first, soon turning into amusement. “But you can’t repair it alone, can you?” I said. </p><p>“T-that’s nonsense,” he immediately responded, but he was unable to suppress his shock. That was understandable. He no doubt didn’t expect to be caught due to the blunt personality I had been reflecting. </p><p>“Oh, really, then why are you here if you’re not trying to offer me a deal I can’t refuse. I help you, and you convince the prince to let me go free. Right?” </p><p>His silence was deafening as he tried to decide what to say, his preparations ruined. He could argue against my conclusion, but it would be pointless when he would eventually circle toward it. “And, you think   that you’re capable enough to offer me something that I can’t find in the guild.” </p><p>I leaned back even further, enjoying his growing frustration. “I certainly can. I’m much better than the bunch of lazy pathetic apprentices that you constantly fill into the guild,” I declared. </p><p>“Pretty arrogant of you,” he cut in, clearly desperate to change the topic. </p><p>“Maybe. It’s not arrogance if I can back it up,” I declared. He looked happy with that change, so I decided to douse his excitement once more. “It’s not like it matters,” I added. </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>“Well, you clearly don’t think that I’m not as good as your fellow legendary blacksmiths, but still went all that trouble of capturing me.” My smirk turned merciless. “Your fellows don’t know about the opportunity, do they?” </p><p>He paused, his arrogance long gone. He stayed silent for almost a minute before speaking. “I see, you’re not as politically unaware as you led us to believe,” he said.</p><p>“No, I’m not. I just prefer not to waste pointless flowery language and lengthy yet pointless intrigues.” </p><p>“Even when it costs you a lot,” he said. “Things would have been much more different if you tried to ramp up your operations slowly—“ </p><p>“Well, that’s debatable,” I cut in. “Discounting this nonsense that I couldn’t have foreseen, it wasn’t a bad plan. No matter how I tried to enter, the guild would have tried to cut my path eventually. At least, in my way, I would have gathered enough supporters to make the guild’s job harder.” </p><p>“Thinking like this, it’s not too unreasonable,” he admitted. “And, since you’re more scheming than you revealed, why don’t you show me exactly how good are you and guess why I need you,” he asked. </p><p>“Come on, that’s the best you can come up with,” I said. “My techniques are designed to create weapons that could be easily enchanted. And only an expert on the topic could create such simplified designs. Ergo, you’re having trouble repairing something about its magical structure,” I suggested. </p><p>“Not bad, not bad at all,” he answered. “And does such an offer look acceptable to you?” he asked. </p><p>“Depends,” I said. </p><p>“Depends on what?” </p><p>“On what you’re willing to offer, of course,” I added. “I want some evidence about this mysterious organization before even checking the weapon, and I want to meet a representative before I start working.” </p><p>“You can only meet with them once the repair is finished, but otherwise acceptable,” he accepted quickly. “Although, I had to admit, I expected you to resist much harder after the betrayal.” </p><p>Good point. Luckily, I had an answer ready to go. “Betrayal is unacceptable, of course, but you were my enemy until a few moments ago. How can we talk about betrayal when there was no allegiance.” I paused for a moment, taking a threatening breath. “Of course, if you were to pull something like this now…” </p><p>“Message received,” he answered with a chuckle. “Provided you can prove your worth, of course,” he said as he pushed some papers toward me. </p><p>Some very familiar papers, created by my own hand, showing some of the progress notes I had prepared when I had been working on the Spear. I didn’t have any doubt about the source of that mysterious repair job, but it was always good to have confirmation. </p><p>“Wow, that’s an interesting weapon,” I said, making a show of my shocked display. “Is this real, or is it just a complicated test?” I asked. </p><p>“Good question. Why don’t you tell me,” he said, looking happy now that he had achieved his mission without a problem. Of course, he was unaware that he was just another pawn. I had no doubt that the second prince’s agents were doing their own preparations to contact me, about to deliver their own incredible offer. </p><p>Patience, I thought. After all, I had already received everything I needed from the current situation. After I finished my notes, I pushed them back, and his eyes widened. </p><p>“Not bad, not bad at all,” he murmured, clearly impressed by my display even as I undersold my capabilities greatly. </p><p>I passed the test.</p><p>All that remained was to decide whether to use the opportunity to make contact with the Eternals. I was always afraid of targeting them directly … but what if they were the ones to recruit me… </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 54</p><p>Endurance: 72      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 56280}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>Darion was late to the event that his boss — and pretend girlfriend — had invited him, which was a bit annoying. Of course, ordinarily, he wouldn’t have cared much about it, but Mia was rather fun as far as bosses went…</p><p>Not to mention, Paisley was the reason for the meeting, and considering how amazing the previous meeting had been, Darion was rather positive about the possibility of another meeting. </p><p>“I just hope she doesn’t bitch for long,” he murmured as he pushed the door open. If there was one problem with Mia, it was her misguided impression that she was still the one who was giving the orders. </p><p>Often long, wordy orders. He had many ways to silence her if they were alone, but it was more difficult in a club. Not impossible, just more difficult. </p><p>However, after he opened the door, he paused. There was an unfamiliar face in the meeting … one that was not invited by Mia if her posture was any indicator. Still, it was a nice club, the kind that was paid for by someone who wanted a place to show their prestige rather than to make money. </p><p>As he walked, he noticed the bartender. A sexy piece of ass, but the way she was dressed confirmed that the place was more about making a statement. </p><p>Especially combined with the empty state. Clearly reserved for them. </p><p>“Hey, my love, you’re late,” Mia gasped the moment she noticed his approach, jumping up to her feet as she approached him, doing her best to look like she was a loving girlfriend who missed her man … but Darion could read the entitled annoyance on her face very easily. </p><p>“Where were you … honey,” she said, managing to sound threatening even as she used a loving nickname. </p><p>“Your sister needed my help,” Darion answered with a shrug. It was true … from a certain point of view, though he doubted Mia would appreciate it. </p><p>“Next time, just ignore her. She can just take a taxi,” Mia said. </p><p>Before Darion could answer, the unknown woman intervened. “So, Mia. Is this the hunk Madam Paisley was talking about,” she said, her voice just entitled and snotty enough to grate Darion’s nerves. </p><p>“Yes, he is. Good evening to you, Darion,” Paisley said, giving a put-together attitude, even more prissier. Though, Darion liked hers, as he could clearly see that Paisley was putting that expression on her face to cover up her panic. </p><p>After all, she was not as well put together when he was leaving their previous meeting. She was frazzled, and very much satisfied. </p><p>“And to you, honey,” Darion said, which earned a suspicious glare from the unknown woman. She was clearly sharp enough to catch there was something wrong with their little ploy. </p><p>Meanwhile, Mia took a step closer, and sent a warning glare at him. “What are you doing?” she whispered. “Are you trying to ruin the deal? She’s already annoyed.” </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry, honey,” he said, using the same nickname even as he used the opportunity to cup a feel. “You have your expertise, and I have mine.” </p><p>“But…” she tried to say, but Darion silenced her with a squeeze. </p><p>“Think of your own fun experience, honey,” he said, enjoying the way her expression danced between indignation and obedience. “Now, who’s this other woman.” </p><p>“The bane of my existence, Gina,” Mia said. “She’s a friend back from the school, and we’re in the same line of business.” </p><p>“And, why did you invite her?” Darion asked. </p><p>“I didn’t. It turns out she owns the place. I learned that too late.” </p><p>Before Darion could answer, Gina intervened. “Hey, lovebirds. It’s rude to spend all your time together. Save some to the bedroom.” </p><p>Mia looked angry, but Darion shook his head slightly. He would rather handle that uppity bitch himself. “Oh, you’re a rude little thing, are you?” Darion said as he stepped closer, taking a better look at her. </p><p>She might be annoying … but she was certainly sexy. </p><p>“Not as rude as you,” she said, then smirked as she slowly dragged her gaze up. “Though, I had to admit, I’m rather little when compared to you. I can see why Mia keeps you around … at least until she gets bored and dumps you to focus on her work.” </p><p>Darion smiled. “Oh, not exactly a problem. There’s a lot of me to get bored easily.” </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me that it was an innuendo about your little dick. How juvenile.” </p><p>Darion leaned forward. “Oh, I can promise you that little is not how you can describe my dick. Not that it was a surprise for you, as you have been watching it since I entered. Don’t tell me that you’re jealous of my girlfriend.” </p><p>Calling her jealous worked much better than he expected. “M-me, jealous of that little uppity bitch that thinks herself as my rival. No way,” she said, unsettled by his declaration. </p><p>“Well, it doesn’t look that way to me,” he said, then smirked. She failed to say anything. “Feel free to think of an answer. I need to visit the bathroom. I can hear your answer once I return.” </p><p>With that, he walked. Though, noticing just how satisfied Mia looked, he took a mental note to ask for a favor.</p><p>But, that was for later. For now, he had a more important mission. </p><p>Finding Paisley for a fun repeat.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Honey, are you ready,” Tiffany shouted, barely containing her amusement as she called for her. </p><p>“Yes—“ Umi started, only to gasp as I took a step forward and unbuttoned her blouse twice more, enhancing her cleavage even more, revealing her bra. “A second more,” she corrected herself under my gaze. </p><p>“Ask her to pick some interesting underwear as well. Something white and lacy,” I suggested. Not the sexiest underwear that could be found, but still good enough. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she whispered readily. “May I go now?” </p><p>“No,” I answered as I reached her buttons once more. She tensed momentarily, but it was soon replaced by an expression of surprise as I buttoned up her blouse instead. Sss</p><p>“Your fiancee doesn’t deserve to see you like this after daring to serve such a beautiful treasure for your prospective boss just for a quick promotion,” I whispered, enjoying her helpless trembling. </p><p>I let my gaze crawl down once more while she tried to process my words. To her credit, they were rather absurd. It was rude of me to keep poor Charlie from even getting a glimpse of her cleavage after everything we had done. </p><p>But, rather than letting my cute Umi process that, I squeezed her ass and gently pushed her toward the door, enjoying her one last frustrated glare. </p><p>“W-wow, you look beautiful,” Charlie gasped. </p><p>“Really,” Umi answered. I was glad that Charlie was really obvious, as otherwise, he would have realized that what strained Umi’s tone was not shyness but guilt. </p><p>Tiffany didn’t have such a problem. “Oh, definitely. You’re scorching hot,” she commented. Charlie yelped, and I guessed Tiffany poked him. “This one will definitely get his promotion by sacrificing you to that old goat,” she continued. </p><p>I was amused at Tiffany’s opportunistic nature, slipping yet another insult to the mix. However, that amusement didn’t mean I wouldn’t punish her once we were alone. </p><p>Training a slut like her required a steady hand. </p><p>Charlie choked at the reminder. Another mistake, as he should have been consoling Umi. The reminder was enough to destroy her guilt — admittedly, only due to our boat adventure already loosening her morals. “Yes, that’s true,” Umi spoke with a surprising fervor. “Now, how about if we go and pick something more striking. This outfit is good for daily work, but maybe we should get something more impressive for the interview.” </p><p>“Good, you need to make sure you don’t have any competition,” Tiffany commented, not bothering to hide her amusement. </p><p>“Yes, my dear fiancee needs it,” Umi declared, and she walked away with Tiffany. </p><p>Charlie stayed back. Stupid decision, I decided immediately. “It’s not like her to act like this…” Charlie murmured, unaware that he had an eavesdropper and thinking he was speaking to himself. He took a deep breath, then chuckled. “I’m sure she’ll calm down soon. It’s not here to stay angry,” he reasoned. </p><p>I barely held back from laughing. Instead, I pulled to a corner in case he decided to check the room during Umi’s absence, and entertained myself by answering emails.</p><p>“That’s what you picked,” Charlie said almost ten minutes later, the strained nature of his tone promising rather interesting things about the things they picked. </p><p>“Of course. You know I like to do everything properly. And, since I need to impress your boss…” </p><p>I barely held back laughter as Charlie used the next few minutes to try to calm Umi down. He might have succeeded, but with Tiffany’s constant innocent comments to ‘help’ it worked the exact opposite. Especially since Charlie took the bait and started talking about how Umi couldn’t handle wearing such clothes.</p><p>A big mistake. </p><p>“If you have such a problem with what I picked, you don’t need to see them,” Umi finally declared, ending the lengthy argument. </p><p>So, when Umi walked Into the dressing room, she was fuming. She didn’t say anything to me as she rushed toward the curtain. Her anger was useful to my aims, so I didn’t say anything, just sat back on the couch, crossed my legs, and started waiting for the reveal. </p><p>My smile got bigger and bigger as the sound of her clothes being removed aggressively filled the room, followed by the curtain hastily pushed aside. </p><p>She said nothing as she walked forward Meanwhile, I said nothing, busy taking her vision from bottom to top. </p><p>I didn’t have a particular foot fetish, but even then, the stilettos she picked alone were enough to send me into a raging arousal — if I wasn’t already there. Bright crimson and stylish, they shouted the presence of a recreational secretary rather than a professional one. </p><p>She didn’t wear any stockings this time, which was a fitting choice with the tall skirt she chose. It was a conservative length … too bad the aggressive slit along the side was enough to reverse any chance of looking prim and proper. </p><p>The slit was high enough to make the absence of her panties a certainty rather than speculation. </p><p>That alone was beautiful enough, but as I climbed higher, I took note of her tight blazer, looking ready to explode as she buttoned it. It was form-fitting and would have looked amazing even when combined with an ordinary blouse. </p><p>But, considering she skipped a blouse completely, the impact escalated several times. Moreover, it was clear — crystal clear — that panties weren’t the only article of clothing she had skipped, turning her cleavage into an endless valley that any explorer would die for. </p><p>She walked even closer as I focused on that magnificent valley. Her nipples were covered with her blazer, but not her areolas, enhancing her erotic sexiness further. </p><p>Well, hiring her as a secretary was certainly not a mistake. </p><p>She stood in front of me, her fury battling with her natural shyness. To my surprise, the latter was having trouble asserting itself. </p><p>“Come here,” I said as I uncrossed my legs, and patted my knee. “Since you’re appropriately dressed, let’s do a mock interview.” </p><p>Rather than answering, she sat down as I requested. No second-guessing, no hesitation. </p><p>I was already liking the angry Umi. </p><p>“Now, the first question. I’m attending a very boring teleconference with upper management, and you’re in the room. Show me how you would keep me entertained.” </p><p>“Are you sure you can keep focusing on your meeting, boss,” she said, her anger making her surprisingly confrontational. Even as she said that, she unzipped my pants, dragging her finger over my naked erection. </p><p>It twitched, and her smile widened, though her bravado was unable to hide the fragility behind it. Anger made her more aggressive, but it was not exactly a miracle.  </p><p>I kept my attention on her amazing cleavage as she fell onto her knees, her lips already parted as she leaned forward, the angle making her already incredible cleavage even more impressive. </p><p>As her lips touched the crown, she wrapped her soft fingers around my shaft. A great sensation. Pity I had to hold back my moan. Giving her some positive feedback would have been nice … but not at the cost of alerting her poor fiancee. </p><p>Her lips moved, trying to give an impression of calmness through steadiness, but her fingers were much more honest. The wetness spread around my girth, destroying the fragile balance I had managed to achieve. </p><p>I reached down to unbutton her blazer. It fell to the side immediately, revealing her beautiful breasts immediately. “That would not do. A secretary shouldn’t go around with naked tits,” I commented, but before her pretty mouth pull away, I showed exactly what I had in mind. </p><p>By palming both of them immediately. </p><p>She released a shocked gasp … but luckily, she was currently busy with a task that lent itself quite well to assist her silence. Though, the pretty pretty blush that spread onto her face was almost as beautiful as her tits. </p><p>My attempts to keep my moans down got harder and harder as she worked on my shaft, her enthusiasm and beauty doing wonders. And, admittedly, the fact that she was giving an enthusiastic blowjob while her fiancee waited outside added a certain amount of fun. </p><p>Especially since that young man was arrogant enough to think that he could manipulate me. </p><p>Time passed slowly, as I suffered delicious torture while I continued to play with her breasts, hard enough to add some new marks to the old ones, also left by me. That drove her arousal higher, which made my pretty mouth faster and faster, taking me steadily deeper into her mouth. </p><p>Then, I shifted my hand from her breast to her head, and pushed her down hard, invading her throat as I exploded. </p><p> The surprise that added to her already complicated expression while she continued to suck was beautiful. Not as beautiful as her slightly puffed cheeks. “Careful not to ruin your new clothes, or we have to purchase them,” I reminded her with a whisper. Her eyes widened as that particular challenge added to the mix</p><p>Then, a knock was on the door. “Umi, is everything alright,” Charlie asked. Umi didn’t answer immediately, busy swallowing my seed. “Umi, please,” Charlie repeated again with a needy tone. “We need to talk.” </p><p>“Now,” I whispered, too soft for Charlie to hear. “The next question. We’re going through the yearly performance reports, and you want to make sure your annoying, intruding fiancee gets the maximum bonus. How would you convince me?” </p><p>Umi didn’t even skip a beat as she pushed me back slightly and sat on my lap once more, this time letting her skirt ride up. “Wait a few minutes, my dear fiancee,” she declared angrily. “I’m working hard for your career here.” </p><p>Well, she was. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It took a while for me to start speaking. The vision of her trembling beauty was beautiful … especially with every second pushing her pleasure to a new level of obedience. She was like a beautiful spring, getting tenser and tenser. </p><p>Only when I started seeing the signs of snapping, I spoke. </p><p>“So, what do you have to say for yourself.”</p><p>“A-about what, sir,” she whispered, her voice trembling beautifully, begging for forgiveness even before she started. </p><p>“About hiding your powers, and making me a target, of course,” I said, acting like I wasn’t guilty of the exact same thing. One advantage of my shitty power, it was near-impossible to catch it unless someone had me tested. </p><p>“Please, sir,” she begged. “It was a mistake. I … I didn’t expect it to create problems,” she begged. </p><p>I sighed. “You’re lucky that I’m a merciful boss. I won’t fire you. That, and we don’t actually know whether you created any problem for me or not…” I said. Admittedly, any contribution she had to my problems was about her beauty and the way she distracted me rather than her powers. </p><p>Those helped me to avoid a nasty injury. </p><p>“T-thank you, sir,” she gasped. </p><p>“Of course, we still need to have a lesson about trust,” I said, my smirk suddenly getting wider. “By hiding such important information, you proved that you need another lesson about trust.” </p><p>“Please,” she begged. “It was a mistake. I won’t do it again.” However, as she did so, her hands were already twitching, showing that she was just as enthusiastic about removing her shirt. </p><p>Frankly, a part of me was tempted to keep her standing for a while more, to see if she would actually crack. And, if it was anytime else, I might have actually done that. However, tonight was different. </p><p>After my own surprise brush with death, I was more than enthusiastic about affirming my own life. Having an excuse to ignore the potential long-term implications of taking down three henchmen was just a bonus. </p><p>“I want to believe you, but I need you to prove me your loyalty,” I said. Admittedly, I was probably skipping a step or two, but considering her barely held-back enthusiasm, it wasn’t exactly a huge mistake. </p><p>The speed she pulled her top off was impressive, though not as impressive as the fact that it still stayed intact. She had an incredible control over her powers. Her bra suffered a similar fate, just as fast, removed before her top could hit the floor. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” I said. I kept my gaze on her face to exert my dominance further … but it was difficult. </p><p>But not useless. As our gazes met, she shivered and closed her eyes, showing the great hold I had over her. I was glad for her closed eyes because she missed my hungry expression as I devoured the sight of her beautiful body. Not for the first time, but still as impactful as ever. </p><p>She deserved to be a criminal because hiding that flawless body under those horrible boy clothes was a crime. </p><p>Of course, even as she turned her back and pushed down her jeans, I couldn’t help but wonder once again if her beauty was a part of her power. </p><p>She wouldn’t be the first heroine with that power. Otherwise, it was impossible to explain the existence of many heroines with their amazing bodies, and their skin-tight costumes displaying it excellently. </p><p>However, as she pushed her pants down, I ignored that track of thought and focused on the present. She kept her eyes closed as she slowly slid down her pants. It was a pity that her panties were wide and boring, hiding her incredible ass successfully. </p><p>Maybe I should invest some of the money I liberated from the henchmen into a shopping trip.</p><p>Luckily, the smoothness of her toned legs gave me something to focus on while she pulled her underwear down and faced me. It was cute that her arms were still twitching slightly as a desire to cover her body, contrasting with her arousal. </p><p>“Good, now sit down,” I said, patting my table. She said nothing as she circled around my desk, every step small … yet her body swayed beautifully, showing that she was a quick learner, already implementing our earlier training. </p><p>She was radiating hesitance as she perched on the edge of the desk, her legs crossed to her wetness. I let her do so. </p><p>“Very good. Obedient. You’re a good girl,” I said even as I put my hands on her hips, slightly below her ass, and she shivered. “Your powers are your only problem,” I added, and she tensed. “You’re lucky that your obedience is more valuable than the problems that might be created by your powers,” I added, and just like that, tenseness was gone. </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” she whispered as she grabbed my hand, holding it gently. I might have treated that as a step too far, but the sight of her gratitude was too beautiful to be interrupted. I let her enjoy for a moment before I continued. </p><p>“That’s assuming you’ll follow my orders until you solve the problem you created with your powers, of course,” I added, testing the waters to see whether her obedience was just sexual, or it extended to her powers. </p><p>“Of course, sir,” she declared, her voice direct. She didn’t even think a second before committing to that. </p><p>“Good,” I said. “I don’t think I can use you as a waitress,” I said, and she froze. This time, her stress was not intended, so I continued quickly. “You’ll be my secretary and my bodyguard. Do you accept?”</p><p>“Y-yes, sir,” she declared, her excitement palpable. </p><p>“Good, then your first mission will be to go to your motel immediately, checkout, and move to my studio apartment. It’ll be a bit cramped, but we have to survive that inconvenience for a while while experiencing that.” </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she said, but there was a sadness in her tone that surprised me. </p><p>She had to actually stand up for my words to click. </p><p>“Make that your second mission,” I corrected as I grabbed her waist and pulled her onto my lap, she surprised yelp enough to drive me mad already. She said nothing, but the way she settled on my lap was all the answer I needed. </p><p>Still, I made a note to be careful about exactly what I asked of her in the future. Just in case. </p><p>“Y-yes, sir,” she whispered in a trembling voice as I dragged my fingers over her hips for a while, her words delayed … and made even more erotic by it. As she shuffled on my lap back and forth, the fiction of punishment was abandoned — for the moment, as I had no doubt both of us would want an encore on that aspect. </p><p>“Good, now let’s celebrate your promotion, in a way worthy of a traditional secretary.” </p><p>She might be met, but she was certainly not stupid. She immediately understood what I was driving at as she abandoned her new seat, her fingers already on my buttons. She pulled off my pants, the ease she displayed a reminder of the great physical difference between us. </p><p>It only made the moment tastier as she leaned forward and captured the head of my shaft between her pretty lips, devouring easily. “Very good, beautiful,” I said, the compliment making her shiver even more intensely than her task. </p><p>I reached down and cupped her naked breasts, enjoying their perfection once more, this time without the barrier of our fictional punishment play. A paper-thin barrier, yet still, the difference was incredible. </p><p>This time, I didn’t need to use my power. Well, I still did, but this time, I wasn’t trying to see which move wouldn’t end with a broken arm, but making sure her enjoyment climbed upward at the fastest possible speed. </p><p>As my fingers danced around her nipples, her moans immediately turned charged, showing that my power was even more useful than I expected when I focused on a singular task rather than trying to split it in many different directions. </p><p>A thought entered my mind, making me smile. Maybe I should have got a job as a high-class escort rather than opening a rundown bar… </p><p>Of course, that was just a joke, as anything high-class was either regulated by guilds, or controlled by the villains — not that it made much difference either way — and expecting the sex trade to be the exception was simply a folly. Though, even if that had been an option, I wouldn’t have chosen it. </p><p>My pride prevented me from being a henchman to be used … accepting such a fate would have been the same thing. No, even worse. </p><p>After all, as Tara’s lips moved up and down my length, it wasn’t the physical pleasure that drove me crazy. That part was still amazing, especially considering her enthusiastic yet clumsy delivery, but the real pleasure came from the way she surrendered to my control. </p><p>It was an incredible sensation. I wanted more. </p><p>“Let’s make it really fun, my beautiful secretary,” I said as I grabbed Tara’s hair, and pushed her down…</p>",

    "content": "<p>What a mess. </p><p>It was my first thought as I looked at the three downed men in front of me, each wearing the same custom t-shirt. A bloody knife. </p><p>The famous symbol of Stabber, a villain. He was just a minor villain according to the government, and while reading the news, it was easy to dismiss him. But, against someone like me, every villain was a major threat. </p><p>Admittedly, I could have handled the sudden intrusion of his henchmen better … but then, they could have had better timing to suddenly knock down the door I had spent an hour to properly fix. Like the fact they had ruined my hard work wasn’t enough, but they chose the moment my brain was in the process of shortcircuiting. </p><p>I was already swinging when I had noticed their shirts marking them as henchmen. </p><p>And, just like that, I was against a villain. </p><p>Bad news, very bad news. </p><p>“One thing at a time,” I suddenly murmured as I looked at Tara, who was looking at me with a sheepish expression. I wanted to get angry at her. Claim that it was her mistake that suddenly put me in hot water, and that she didn’t listen to my orders. </p><p>But I couldn’t do that. I didn’t even think of asking for her help, forgetting her powers — it easy to treat her abilities as a cleaning aid rather than actual super strength with her submissive obedience — when she dashed and saved me from the gunman. </p><p>I was aware that he had been pulling a gun — one advantage of my observation powers — and had a plan to deal with … but considering that plan required me to get stabbed, I wasn’t particularly torn up about the alternative she presented without asking me. </p><p>Even if she did it in a way that revealed her powers. </p><p>Of course, whether they would remember it after that punch was a different issue. </p><p>One step at a time. First, let’s deal with my naughty employee.  </p><p>“You did good,” I said, and suddenly, she smiled brightly. Despite the situation, I found myself matching that smile… “Of course, the fact that you hid your powers deserves a punishment, but we can handle that later.” </p><p>The suggestion of punishment erased her smile … but it didn’t particularly erase her good mood. The suggestion that there would be a later punishment seemed to be enough for her, and the suggestion for future punishment was just a bonus. </p><p>She was ridiculously submissive. </p><p>“Let’s make sure to carry them several streets over,” I suggested. She made a move to grab them, and then I chuckled, realizing one important detail we had missed during the rush. </p><p>She was still naked. </p><p>“Go upstairs and dress first,” I ordered. The blush that covered her body was amazing. If I didn’t need to deal with the henchman in the room, I would have used that beautiful sight more efficiently. </p><p>Instead, I turned my attention to the henchman. I had to admit, dealing with them permanently was a tempting fantasy … but ultimately fantasy. Deaths would mean Stabber digging around for the disappearance, and I was sure that a dedicated search would reveal their position soon enough. </p><p>Police would get involved as well, which was not any better. Of course, even worse, another hero might decide to poke around, turning it into hell. </p><p>Luckily, there were other options. I went behind the bar, and pulled out three of the cheapest bottles of alcohol. Half of it, I force-fed to them, and the other half, I spilled the rest on them. The smell was suffocating.  </p><p>Then, to make sure there was no mistaking, I also poured a glass of cheap wine and a bottle of beer on them as well, the mixture turning the smell into a rancid mixture. </p><p>It would mean betting on a combination of the head trauma and the alcohol to keep their mouth shut … and, even if didn’t, I hoped that they would be smart enough not to reveal to their boss they attacked another powered individual with unknown allegiance. </p><p>If not … well, that was something I would think later. </p><p>“Let’s make sure you pay for your drinks,” I murmured as I went through their pockets, taking only their cash. Almost four thousand … not a bad haul. </p><p>And, after some thought, I took the gun as well. Only fair for the emotional distress they had triggered. </p><p>I wasn’t exactly experienced in shooting, but my new power should be helpful in that aspect. </p><p>When Tara came down, she was wearing her usual outfit. “Can you jump between roofs?” I asked. She nodded. “While carrying all three?” She nodded again. “Excellent. Grab them, and make sure to dump them near the landfill. Wear my coat and the ski mask as well,” I ordered. </p><p>She nodded, once again moving around with a shocking efficiency. I didn’t bother describing the location of the landfill, as it was hard to miss. Barely a mile away, it covered a great amount. There was only one advantage. </p><p>It didn’t have any organic waste, so there was no smell. Just an eyesore. </p><p>While Tara was gone, I focused on repairing the door. Not fully, but just enough not to look suspicious in case someone was searching for the three. </p><p>After I finished the repair, I stayed near the bar, my fingers still around the bat, the gun under the counter in case of an emergency, waiting for Tara to return. However, as her return got delayed, I couldn’t help but go through my phone, checking the news.</p><p>It didn’t take long for me to find the reason for my excitement. Apparently, there was a big battle at the downtown between a group of heroes and villains. Heroes won, and some of the villains had to move. </p><p>Slasher’s name was not anywhere in the report. It didn’t surprise me. He was too small a time to be a part of a fight of that scale in any case. However, as the bigger villains lost their territory, they moved onto less valuable areas … occupied by weaker villains, which then in turn dislodged Slasher and a few others in his class. </p><p>Just like that, my bar, which was supposed to be too worthless to be paid attention to, fell under the control of a villain. Likely only the periphery of his territory. </p><p>“Maybe they won’t care about me,” I murmured, but even as I said that I knew it not to be the case. Maybe I should just move away, and use the little money I stole to move to another city. </p><p>But, then what. Build another bar, or maybe find work, only to move again. Luckily, before I could fall into a spiral of depression, Tara returned. </p><p>I needed her distraction. </p><p>“Follow me to my office,” I said, doing my best to keep my voice sharp despite the confusion I was feeling. For two reasons. One, it was clearly how Tara was expecting me to treat her after her reveal. Considering her existence might be the only thing between me and a nasty end at the hands of Slasher, I decided to keep her happy. </p><p>Two, and even more importantly, I wanted to act like that as well. The sudden realization that I might lose everything due to a coincidence hit me hard. Not that I wasn’t aware that the bar was a long shot. My inconvenient powers, the location of my bar, my lack of financial power, lack of potential customers…</p><p>I just didn’t expect a random villain henchman visit to overtake everything before I could even open the bar. </p><p>Dominating her was a good way for me to feel settled. </p><p>Excellent, even. </p><p>I said nothing as I walked around my desk and sat on the chair, pausing only slightly to take the view. After her super cleaning, the place looked far better than the dusty cave I had taken over. It was still small, with substandard furniture. An old desk, a creaking office chair behind it, and two plastic ones on the other end. </p><p>It was hard to feel powerful behind it. </p><p>However, as I looked at the trembling and excited super in front of me, it was easy to ignore all the reasons why it was not worthy. Instead, I let the sense of power rush over me as every second of silence worked even better to pull her submissiveness further toward the surface. </p><p>A truly amazing feeling. </p><p>I let her stand silently for another minute while I kept my gaze on her face, not even offering her a seat. I wanted her to feel the weight of the moment as she trembled — though my abilities suggested she was enjoying the moment as much as I did. Maybe even more. </p><p>Opening a bar might have been a terrible choice. </p><p>But clearly, my hiring practices were perfect. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I arrived at the outer rungs of the city, the first thing I noticed was the name change. </p><p>Sunset City, the name read, followed by another statement. In remembrance of Sunset College. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel fascinated by the cursed nature of the name. But, I was even more fascinated by the changes in the city. </p><p>Or, more accurately, a lack of it. The city was more lifeless, half of the buildings already empty, showing the sudden disappearance of the college affected the city badly. Furthermore, from the number of billboards that proudly declared that the city itself was fallout-free, the reputation as a site next to a nuclear dump site clearly didn’t help the city. </p><p>The fact that there was even a city was a benefit. However, while the nuclear rumors affected the city greatly, I was truly shocked by everything else. </p><p>Particularly, just how utterly same everything was. I expected things to be much more horrible, panicking, and dangerous. At least, people should have been panicking about giant monsters, right?</p><p>But none of those had been happening. </p><p>Suspicious. </p><p>But just as I had been thinking about it, I felt a flicker of mental pressure, one that asked me to ignore the extraordinary, that anything absurd should be a figment of my imagination, fake videos, or a conspiracy theory. </p><p>It was weak and fleeting, even weaker than the magical effect of the nuclear warning. </p><p>But it was not targeted at me, but the whole city … maybe even larger. </p><p>“No wonder people are not questioning why there was a nuclear disaster in a college with no experimental nuclear program,” I said to myself. Particularly if that wave of suggestion that forced people to ignore the supernatural occurred periodically. </p><p>“Now that it’s resolved, let’s go on to the next task.” Since I was already dressed as a homeless person, I decided to start the easiest way possible. Digging through the trash for newspapers. I ignored the familiar sense of disgust. It was a common activity of my childhood, trying to dig something useful when I ended up in the streets. </p><p>A need that had disappeared once I had developed my chess hustle. </p><p>Tough times. </p><p>However, it didn’t take long for me to ignore those bittersweet memories. All I needed was to grab a newspaper. </p><p>And check the date. </p><p>Based on the changes in the environment, I was able to put the approximate difference of time somewhere between seven to eight months. It turned out to be correct, with a very minor difference. </p><p>A minor difference of two years. </p><p>It had been two years, seven months, and four days, to be exact. </p><p>“Almost three years of my life, gone,” I murmured shocked as I leaned against the wall, trying to get a hood of the shock. Admittedly, it didn’t take long, mostly because my gaze dipped down, and noticed a certain picture on the first page, covering half of the page. </p><p>‘Local hero saves a bus full of children from a mutated beast,’ the headline read, but I was more interested in the picture. It showed a man dressed in a latex costume, displaying his sculpted muscles perfectly. The color itself was equally attention-grabbing, bright red and stylish black. </p><p>Yet, all of those details were secondary. , despite the mask that covered the face, I recognized who was it. </p><p>Thad. </p><p>“Wow, that’s a face I didn’t expect to see,” I murmured as I read the news, which talked in great detail about the mysterious Red Lightning saving innocents once again. </p><p>But then, considering the way they disappeared, maybe I shouldn’t have been too surprised. </p><p>As much as I wanted to dig deeper, I decided to ignore it for a moment, and started digging through the news. First, I read about the ethical implications of genetically enhanced people … which seemed to be the excuse for the abilities of the heroes. </p><p>Admittedly, it sounded more reasonable than magic. </p><p>I ignored a lengthy discussion about whether corporate-sponsored heroes were beneficial, or a menace to society, and instead focused on other news… About the fallout site in the Egyptian Pyramids. The news piece itself was about something unrelated, so I ignored it, instead focusing on the so-called existence of another fallout site. </p><p>“I wish I had a computer,” I said, but as much as I was tempted to break into a house, or at least a public library, I held myself back. I didn’t want to take any risks. I decided to wait until the morning and kept myself limited to the newspapers and other discarded reading material. </p><p>Slowly piecing together a timeline. </p><p>First of all, there were quite a number of references to the Day of Disaster. According to the news, it was a day when a mysterious global terrorist organization delivered several simultaneous terrorist attacks using dirty bombs across several historical sites, to show their supremacy of the new world order. </p><p>I ignored other news about the terrorist group, which might or might not be fictional, but certainly did not use nuclear weapons around the land. Knowing the situation in the old campus, I didn’t need the Divine Mind to deduce they had used the exact same excuse for all locations. </p><p>Admittedly, dirty bombs were a good excuse. They wouldn’t create any explosion — other than a small conventional bomb to spread the nuclear material — but the aftermath would be enough to justify blocking access. </p><p>And, why the historical sites … almost certainly about magic. Even by digging in the garbage, I saw many different locations, Egyptian and Mayan pyramids, Stonehenge, Mount Olympus, the ruins of Troy, the Chinese Imperial Palace, several Buddhist temples, as well as a great number of historical Churces and other religious locations. </p><p>Clearly matching the idea of ancient gods. Interesting challenge. </p><p>As I dug deeper, I could see that it was not it. There were also many attacks, explained by convenient mutations. Was that scientific, certainly not. But it was a good excuse for no doubt magical disasters, while the periodical spell — which now I suspected to be a global phenomenon — kept people from panicking about them. </p><p>Even if those beasts had a habit of destroying modern religious buildings almost exclusively. </p><p>“A complete coincidence, no doubt,” I said with a chuckle as I continued to dig through the discarded papers, trying to create a better timeline. Soon, I realized the initial days a lot of locations had turned into battlefields, but in most cases, the conventional military was able to handle it. </p><p>And, whenever they failed … so-called genetically enhanced heroes intervened and saved them. The news made it look like they were the reason for humanity’s continued safety more than the military, but whether it was the truth or just the media spin was another point. </p><p>I had already seen them using fame like I did … to a lesser degree, of course. </p><p>So, I continued to read the snippets about true heroes, trying to get a handle on their numbers. At first, I expected a dozen or two. Maybe a few hundred at most... But the more I read, the more I realized the absurdity of their numbers. Even from the peripheral references, I could easily deduce that their numbers were already in the hundreds just in America, and reaching thousands globally. </p><p>And, that was only the public face. Who knew just how many other people existed behind the scenes aware of magic. </p><p>Regardless of the result, the outlook made me glad that I tried to hide the truth about my abilities. Though, that satisfaction certainly didn’t extend to keeping my guide suppressed. It would be an exaggeration to say I regretted the decision with her clearly displayed habit of pushing me to the center. Who knew how she would react if she was able to react properly during the Day of Disaster. </p><p>But I wished I tried to find a way that wouldn’t have ended up with me in a coma for almost four years. No wonder I wasn’t generating any intent. Who would remember a college player who won a bunch of lower-division games before dying in an alleged terrorist attack? </p><p>Sad, certainly, but ultimately, nothing important. </p><p>There were other ways of getting famous, ways that I could apply carefully and steadily, carefully and steadily planning each step until…</p><p>[Daily Intent Requirement Unmet. System resources consumed for maintenance]</p><p>[System Damage — 1%]</p><p>“Fuck, the system has perfect timing…” I said as my thoughts were interrupted by incredible timing. A sigh escaped my mouth as I looked down, my clothing even more homeless-chic after digging through for hours to get a sense of the news. </p><p>I needed to move fast. </p><p>First step. My identity. </p><p>I needed to find a way to explain my sudden reappearance after four years, and I needed to do that incredibly quickly…. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t need to know the notifications of the system to know that there was something wrong with the current state of the world, but the question mark next to Megan and my pet was a good sign nonetheless. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t just freaking out due to a symbol. The moment I had established that connection, I had felt some kind of connection between me and them, allowing me to feel their general location and state. That was now gone…</p><p>Well, not gone, at least not entirely, just faded to the point of uselessness except somehow feeling that they were alive. The good news, I wasn’t in a position to do more. </p><p>“Now, what to do,” I said, looking around. My only plan was to hide in a corner, hoping to wait until the System recovered. Now that it did, I needed to get away. The school was in ruins, but not completely destroyed, I managed to get some clothing that was reasonably clean and fitting … at least, enough to be mistaken for a homeless person. </p><p>My lack of uncontrolled hair growth despite the months that clearly passed was just a nice bonus. </p><p>“Okay, let’s focus on the facts,” as I started walking toward the direction of the city. “Somehow, the world has magic once more, there are giant monsters prowling around, and humans were not extinct. Altogether, not as bad as it could be,” I chuckled, mocking my own glass half-full attitude. </p><p>Or, quarter-full, at least. </p><p>The two people with obvious magical abilities were not exactly representative, but at least they had offhandedly mentioned something about defending the city, implying that it still existed … and since they wanted to defend, also reasonably in one piece. </p><p>However, how it would look in a world with magic … I had no idea. </p><p>With that, I continued, ignoring the temptation to reach the magic, and somehow try and absorb magic to see if it could be used to replace magic. But, considering my earlier attempt had summoned two magical guardians, I decided that it might wait.</p><p>The lack of a constant flow of Intent was frustrating. It seemed that my long disappearance, coupled with the nature of my fame, was enough for all to disappear. </p><p>A pity. </p><p>Some extra Intent would have been useful. </p><p>Extremely useful. </p><p>I continued my walk even as the darkness started to cover our surroundings. I was walking despite the tempting presence of the abandoned cars for two reasons. First, I wasn’t sure if any of them would actually run. Nine months were enough to make it doubtful whether gasoline would actually work, not to mention many other mechanical troubles that might result from such a lengthy wait. </p><p>The second reason was simpler, but even more important. The car promised me some defense against any possible attacking beast, but its ultimate effectiveness was doubtful. Walking, on the other hand, gave me a chance to stay hidden from the beasts … which was a good choice, as soon I noticed several giant dogs at a distance, each as large as an ox. </p><p>Hardly something I wanted to tangle even inside a car. I doubted the car would resist more than a hit … it might have been different if I had some Intent to empower the car, but I did not, making that a moot point. </p><p>I moved forward. The large dog didn’t notice me, and I had a feeling it was due to Divine Body, still allowing me to keep concealed. Regardless, I didn’t dare to test them directly, and instead made sure to put a great distance with any creature I noticed. </p><p>No need to have a battle I could easily avoid. </p><p>I noticed a great advantage soon enough. The beasts were getting smaller and smaller as I got away from the center of the school. I just needed to stop for a second and meditate to understand the reason. </p><p>The cloud of magic was getting considerably thinner. “Good,” I said, happy with the result. After all, I hardly wanted to step into a world that was filled with monsters. Even with my advantages, such a life would have been at least tedious. Fighting against giant monsters every day was hardly my idea of a good time. </p><p>With that, I continued, the plants getting thinner as I moved … until l met a surprising sight. A giant electrical fence, almost twenty feet tall, filled with cameras and other tools of observation. I stayed concealed even as I wrapped one of my spare clothes onto my face, and started observing. </p><p>The thick security protocols were a surprise, but then, considering the presence of the monsters, hardly unreasonable. </p><p>I was more surprised by the giant warning sign. </p><p>NUCLEAR FALLOUT SITE. DO NOT APPROACH!</p><p>While I didn’t have any evidence, it didn’t take a genius to guess that it was a coverup. Especially since, the moment I looked at the warning sign, I felt a desire to believe the statement, no matter how absurd it was. </p><p>It was a fleeting sensation, very easy to ignore. </p><p>At least, with my Divine Mind. Without it, things might have been slightly more troubling. </p><p>Ironically, the subtle usage of magic, combined with the clear fate reason, gave me confidence. Why bother lying about a non-existent nuclear fallout if the whole world was struggling under the monster attacks. </p><p>Of course, that left the question of why Sunset College had a higher magical density than the other places. </p><p>“My guide,” I sighed with a sudden realization. She had burst out in a rather memorable manner, destroying the stadium and damaging my Divine System at the same time. </p><p>Assuming that she damaged even more in the process was not exactly a logical overextension. </p><p>Of course, that left me with a fun challenge. Avoiding the security perimeter without getting caught … and preferably, without being noticed. Luckily, it was in the middle of the night, which significantly limited the capabilities of the cameras. </p><p>Worst came to worst, I could have just dashed and run, hoping that I would be able to ditch whatever followed me. I would have just done it if I hadn’t seen two men appearing from magical portals. I was confident in ditching a car — not because I could run as fast, but because I could just choose paths that a car couldn’t follow — but the same didn’t apply to magical portals. </p><p>I needed a better path.  </p><p>I might have tried to pull some tricks if I had any Intent stored, but I did not, leaving me to rely on more ordinary tricks. So, I started walking around the perimeter, using my superior vision to find the weakest spot. </p><p>I spent two hours on that, which was excessive in a sense, but I didn’t just want to escape. I also wanted to cover the fact that someone escaped from the quarantine zone as long as possible. Otherwise, things would have been far more troubling. </p><p>Soon, I discovered an area with some of the cameras broken. It wasn’t enough to create a gap in the observation radius … but I had a solution for that. I grabbed two stones, and started crawling toward the target until I was half a mile away. </p><p>An impossible distance for a human … well, an ordinary one. Admittedly, even for me, it was a challenge, especially without the intent to guide me. I took a deep breath, prepared myself, and threw the first stone. </p><p>It flew like a perfect Hail Mary pass, flying toward the target perfectly. Before it reached the target, I had already thrown the second one. With a second in between, two cameras exploded. I was tempted to put the same distance between the destruction of the two, but I was afraid that the destruction of the first would trigger some kind of maintenance response, wasting my opportunity. </p><p>I didn’t want to lose the opportunity while trying to act safe. </p><p>I rushed forward, using the gap in the observation I had created to my benefit, and soon, I was at the electric fence. Twenty feet high, a great distance, but as I jumped with a flying start, I was able to clear it with a comfortable margin. </p><p>Divine Body was truly awesome. </p><p>I hit the ground running, rushing toward a nearby ditch about a thousand yards away, and threw myself in, moving forward crouched to limit the view rather than maximize the speed. </p><p>Barely a minute later, a car arrived, and two mechanics jumped down, carrying their tools, confirming that my choice was a good idea. I just hoped that they wouldn’t realize the camera was taken down deliberately. </p><p>Just to be safe, I paid attention to them even as I slowly increased the distance. Particularly, I paid attention to the fact that whether they actually showed any kind of shock or panic as they installed the new cameras, or retreated it as an ordinary installment. </p><p>Unfortunately, that part, I wasn’t as lucky as I hoped, as their posture showed clear signs of distress, recognizing it as deliberate sabotage. </p><p>However, there was a silver lining, as their attention turned firmly toward the college rather than outside. They didn’t expect that someone was escaping. However, I could also see them calling for reinforcements. </p><p>I moved away even faster, hoping that whomever they called would share the same opinion. Either way, it was better to stay away…</p><p>A good call, as in a few minutes, I counted ten different military helicopters rushing toward the area, creating a search zone,  on both sides of the fence. </p><p>Luckily, I was already out of the range. </p><p>Next stop, the city… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Another batch is complete, apprentice. Prepare for the next set,” I ordered as I grabbed my hammer tighter, ready to forge another batch of weapons… </p><p>A routine that had been going on for almost a month at this point. Since the meeting with the fourth prince, followed by the spies of another prince — the second prince, but disguised as the spies of the crown prince — I had been busy. </p><p>Mostly with my forging. My weapons spread around the Empire, delivered to every border. Both the fourth prince and the crown prince — hence the disguised spies — each ordered almost fifty thousand sets of weapons. Up to this date, I barely completed about ten thousand of them. </p><p>Well, officially. </p><p>I had another surprise. I created another workshop under the first, one that was hidden below the capital, filled with enough wards to keep it hidden … to the point that I used some of our valuable darkness mana sources to ensure its safety, isolating it from the System. </p><p>Of course, ordinarily, there was a reason that people didn’t use completely independent magical wards to create weapons. Every monster part was unique, requiring the judgment of the blacksmith to perfectly meld into the structure of the weapon. It was impossible to attain uniformity, therefore impossible to rely on the wards to automatize anything…</p><p>Except for replacing monster parts with pure mana. </p><p>Naturally, I wasn’t the only one who came up with such an idea, but considering even the most ordinary enhanced weapon required hundreds of mana to properly forge that way, no mage was really crazy enough to do so when their mana took almost a day to replenish. </p><p>For me, converting hundreds of thousands of mana points was a trivial achievement, allowing me to produce more than ten times the weapon I had forged. Then, using various disguises, I made sure that they were distributed across the Empire. Some, I added to the royal deliveries but manipulated the delivery orders to keep that knowledge from reaching the upper echelons. Some were sold into the black market by ‘enterprising thieves’. </p><p>Some, I even allowed them to be discovered by various villages and towns in hard-to-reach areas, in the form of a ruined caravan after a monster attack that I personally arranged after destroying it repeatedly. </p><p>All of those measures ensured that the weapons were distributed at each corner of the world… </p><p>At the same time, the transformation of Silver Spires was going on with excellent speed. With both princes competing to steal the credit for that incredible achievement, tens of thousands of mages without noble blood were transferred to the place, most already at their level limit. </p><p>Of course, the process was not smooth, and many noble students left the school in protest, but that was hardly a problem. Helga confirmed that the ordinary students with their level limit were far more enthusiastic about learning, determined to squeeze even the smallest advantage from the situation. </p><p>Increasing Helga’s Knowledge Spark collection significantly. And, even for me, the rewards were not exactly negligible. I collected quite a bit of Purified Spark, enough to have a healthy reserve. </p><p>Of course, the most important advantage was her domain. As her domain got stronger and stronger, so did her power … and so did the multiplier effect on my Intelligence stat. </p><p>[Intelligence: 51]</p><p>It wasn’t at the point of matching my Endurance, but every progress counted. </p><p>However, while I was thinking about those things, another apprentice just joined. “What’s going on?” I asked. </p><p>“A-a messenger from the fourth prince arrived. He says it’s urgent.” </p><p>“Very well,” I said with a sigh, put my hammer into my tool belt, and walked out. A messenger without a warning only signaled one thing. The prince was getting impatient. </p><p>Pity. I wanted to make contact with Oeyne before I had to face such an important confrontation, but it didn’t matter. “Tell every apprentice to stay inside the base. I’m not responsible for the safety of anyone who leaves the workshop while I am away,” I said. </p><p>I had already reinforced the wards enough to handle anything but an explicit military siege just in case, with some interesting self-destruction mechanisms to handle extreme emergencies. But those measures would only protect the people who trusted my warning and stayed inside. </p><p>Hopefully, they would listen. </p><p>I walked into the courtyard, and found the messenger standing rather than taking a seat. Another display of patience. “Grandmaster. My Prince is asking for your presence in strongest terms,” he said. </p><p>His rudeness would have been enough for me to run away if I wasn’t confident in my abilities. “Alright, let’s go and handle this repair job,” I said, watching the messenger tense. </p><p>He was clearly aware of the nature of the task. Interesting. </p><p>Yet, he didn’t even conceal the hint of annoyance on his face as he stepped into the carriage, gesturing me to follow. I stepped inside, acting like I didn’t notice two dozen guards following us from a distance. </p><p>Or the fact that some of those guards actually belonged to the guilds rather than the royal family. </p><p>I ignored that, because the location of the spear was an impossible clue … that, and the existence of two parties was a boon for me. If I dealt with them and disappeared, they would be blaming each other first before digging into the issue. </p><p>I acted obedient even as the carriage left the capital, and almost a hundred guards joined the mix. Clearly, after the previous — fake — attack, the fourth prince wasn’t taking any chances. </p><p>Too bad his forces were already filled with enough spies to make that unnecessary. Clearly, those spies weren’t in his inner circle, or they wouldn’t need my help to steal the spear. </p><p>I wondered exactly what they had planned for me. </p><p>I said nothing much, staying silent as the carriage moved. A long while later, we arrived at a cave entrance. “Please, this way,” the servant said as he led me inside, four guards accompanying us visibly, while four others were hidden behind a magical field, hidden from ordinary view. </p><p>Further confirming that they were planning something. </p><p>I followed them even as they led me to a prison. </p><p>Not literally, of course. No, it was a nice room, furnished expensively enough that it wouldn’t be amiss in the royal palace. Yet, the opulence didn’t matter when contrasted by the sudden weight of the wards I could feel on top of me, restraining my physical strength. </p><p>In a very obvious manner. </p><p>“W-what’s going on!” I shouted in mock panic. The door opened, but there was a glimmering barrier remained. </p><p>It was the same servant that escorted me. “Please wait patiently, Grandmaster. Someone important will attend to you soon. Meanwhile, please enjoy our hospitality. He gestured to the table, which was piled with some of the most expensive food I had ever seen, no doubt made by the royal chiefs. </p><p>Aware that I was still being watched, I first looked angry, even trying to flip a chair, only to be prevented by a jolt of energy. It didn’t even hurt with my Endurance, but I acted like it was painful. </p><p>I made a show of raging for twenty minutes before calming down, and stumbled toward a large pitcher of chilled wine, enjoying a great deal. A predictable response from someone without magic trapped in a cage they couldn’t resist. </p><p>Too predictable, even, but I trusted my acting skills to sell it. </p><p>Interestingly, I had no idea exactly why they imprisoned me. I expected that, but at least I expected them to show me the spear and see whether I could repair it before locking me down. Yet, they just imprisoned me the moment I arrived, and did it decisively. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>I made a show of drinking and getting slightly drunk, as the magically reinforced alcohol was enough to make someone with about fifteen Endurance drunk. By acting tipsy, I was signaling that it was around twenty. </p><p>“I can’t believe it,” I raged several times, but stayed tipsy. I could already feel the presence of people at the other side of the door, and I wanted to have a talk.  </p><p>When the door opened, I turned toward it with a blaring gaze … only to actually feel surprised. “Oh, I feel honored. The guild sent its strongest dogs to attack me,” I said as I looked at the two warriors, and ignored the old man behind them. “It’s a pity you’re cowardly enough to need a ward to do your work.” </p><p>The old man, was one of the two legendary blacksmiths in the capital, and the only one that worked for the guild. Naturally, the guild had other legendary blacksmiths, but others were not in the capital.</p><p>“Oh, Legendary Blacksmith Hetra,” the old man intervened with a chuckle, using my name, but my title was rather surprising. Clearly, he was convinced that I was hiding my capabilities. After some consideration, I decided to play along. </p><p>“H-how do you know that?” I gasped. </p><p>“Please, do you really think a mere grandmaster could provide the exquisite weapons you seemed to create in seconds? Not to mention, the courage to challenge the guild in one of our home fields. Only Legendary Blacksmith could have the courage.” </p><p>“What do you want?” I asked. </p><p>“Well,” he said, his smile smug. “That’s the question, isn’t it?” </p><p> —</p><p>{Strength: 45    Charisma: 45</p><p>Precision: 45    Perception: 45</p><p>Agility: 45     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 45       Intelligence: 54</p><p>Endurance: 72      Wisdom: 45}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 56280}</p><p>{Pseudo-HP: 15000  Mana: 20000}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Light - Chosen 7.4</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{MINIONS </p><p>——</p><p>GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Now that I taught that uppity bitch a lesson about not reaching for things she didn’t deserve, let's start having fun,” Lily said, each word hitting Sakura hard. </p><p>Why the hell she was allowing that uppity bitch to insult and dismiss her. Yet, she watched in silence as her fingers wrapped around Darion’s shaft, moving up and down passionately as she fingered herself. </p><p>Whore. </p><p>Sakura pulled herself up, her face contorted with anger. “Bitch,” she said, wishing that she could say that louder than an inaudible whisper. Yet, she just waited in silence as she stayed on her knees, mostly naked, trying to gather her courage to act out. To pay her back. </p><p>It was turning out to be more troubling than she expected . Her heart was beating wildly even as she listened Lily’s handjob turned into a blowjob, her gags and gasps filling the room. “It’s much better than that little whore could do, isn’t it?” Lily asked, interrupting the blowjob for a moment. </p><p>Annoyed, Sakura managed to turn back to catch Darion’s gaze. Asking for his permission to make Lily pay. </p><p>She wanted to make Lily pay, but not at the cost of annoying Darion. That, she couldn’t handle. </p><p>She waited in silence as she looked at his face, waiting for him to pay attention to her. It took a while, yet she waited patiently. </p><p>Until he caught her gaze and nodded, a subtle smile adorning his face. </p><p>It was all she needed to truly act. She stood up and positioned herself behind Lily, who made a shocked sound … one that turned into a shocked gasp as Sakura pushed forward. “How about this, little whore. Does it help you have fun?” she asked as she pushed Lily forward, forcing her to take even more of his shaft. </p><p>She blanched a bit as Lily tried to push back, but Darion’s expression was all she needed to stay in place and push forward instead. Her gags and gasps filled her ears, asking her why the hell she was scared of that little bitch. </p><p>She just needed to react rather than freeze up. It wasn’t like she would complain to her sister … and even if she did, so what. She had a far better job, and she was sure that if she really worked, she could convince Darion for some extra hours. </p><p>As she pushed forward, Lily stiffened, but her mouth opened even more, his shaft filling her throat. “She’s a very enthusiastic little whore, isn’t she? Certainly nothing like her uppity sister.” Lily tried to argue, but with her mouth clogged, the best she could do was to push back slightly with her knees rubbing against the floor. </p><p>Sakura smiled even as she rose to her feet, pinning Lily under her body while she shared a kiss with Darion, his tongue giving her all the validation she needed and more. Lily’s moans were just the dessert. </p><p>Then, when she pulled back, she met with Darion’s smile. “It was a good start. But why don’t you show me if you can properly discipline your new work partner? After all, you have the seniority.” </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” Sakura said as she leaned down, grabbing Lily’s arms and forcing them behind her back, hard enough to make her gasp in pain as she forced her to bend. “Now, junior. Are you ready to learn about work discipline?”</p><p>The redhead can only gasp. “I’ll make you pay,” she tried to threaten, but Sakura squeezed her arms to extract another cry. Then, she pushed Lily down, hearing her back hit the floor with a loud thump while she got rid of her panties. </p><p>Lily’s wide eyes stared at her, but Sakura ignored in in exchange for repeating the earlier position, their roles reversed. “Lick, whore,” she ordered with a satisfied smile, meeting Darion’s gaze once again, this time proudly. </p><p>“Not a bad start,” he said. </p><p>“Of course,” Sakura said, but rather than changing position immediately, she stayed for a while, enjoying Lily’s tongue dance at her entrance, the speed of her lips enough to show that Sakura wasn’t the first girl she served. </p><p>Her college life should have been interesting. </p><p>However, soon, she pushed her to a sitting position and hugged her from behind, her fingers tight around her throat. </p><p>“W-what are you doing!” Lily gasped in a throaty tone. </p><p>“Making sure you learned your lesson, little whore,” Sakura said as she let her fingers dip down, fingering her mercilessly while also cutting her breath, the combination working wonders to drive her crazy. </p><p>“A good start, now show me you can control her,” Darion said. </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” Sakura said as she pushed her forward, on all fours just like she deserved, fingering her mercilessly.</p><p>Taking back the control felt good… Very good.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Even as she fell onto her knees to follow the orders of her new boss, Tara was having trouble believing just how far things had devolved. </p><p>She felt like she was in a fog, her body still trembling and aching as she reached forward. </p><p>Did she want it … certainly. It was because she had been dreaming of it, she wasn’t able to sleep the whole night, excited about what he would do once she arrived. </p><p>Yet, when she finally did, only for him to order her to stay downstairs and finish cleaning. A strong woman would have either turned and left … or grabbed him and told him what she wanted in very clear terms. </p><p>Yet, she was not a strong woman. She was weak. </p><p>Being a super didn’t change it. It just made her situation more ironic. </p><p>It was why she had been elated when he ordered her to undress once she had arrived at his room. It felt like a promise … a promise that he started fulfilling when she finally was hugged behind, teased, and molested without even asking. </p><p>And, followed by the order to clean him up. Not that she blamed him. After all, he was right. She had made a mess. A big one. </p><p>Following his orders was easy, she decided as she reached forward to grab his boxers, to use them to clean just like he asked. “You’re not allowed to use anything else,” he ordered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she answered, the response leaving her lips without she could even considering the nature of his order. Not that there was any problem with it, even though it was a very inefficient way of cleaning. </p><p>She wrapped her fingers around. She was the one who created the mess. She should be the one to clean it directly. </p><p>It was the first time she had touched a man in such an intimate manner, but any possible significance of it was easy to ignore as she followed his orders like a good little maid. It was all she needed. </p><p>Nothing else. </p><p>As her fingers moved along his length, she could feel the adrenaline dancing in her veins, begging for her to do more. But, without an order, she just stayed focused on the task at hand, feeling the way he throbbed. </p><p>“It’s not working,” he said despite his growing smile. She shivered, feeling like she had never felt before. She should stop and leave, but the way he throbbed under her touch made it impossible. “You need to use more skin. Use your breasts,” he ordered. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she answered, immediately getting closer as she wrapped her breasts around his girth, feeling his throbbing far more intimately as she moved up and down. </p><p>“Spit on it,” he ordered. </p><p>She did, no matter how absurd was the request considering the reason why she had been working on it in the first place. Yet, she didn’t make unnecessary comments or ask unnecessary questions. It was not her place. </p><p>She just focused on following the orders. It felt right.</p><p>“That’s not enough either. Use your pretty lips,” he ordered. Helpless, she ignored her own blush as she leaned … and captured his throbbing head, the taste filling her mouth. “Don’t forget the tongue,” he ordered. </p><p>She let her tongue dance wildly as he slipped his hand through her hair, caressing gently … then not so gently as he pushed her down, and her mouth was filled with his presence. </p><p>It was just right, she admitted in her mind, but lacked both the courage and the opportunity to say that. Luckily, she didn’t need to say didn’t say those words out loud. She just needed to accept his push. </p><p>And, just like that, her head turned into a toy while she did her best to keep the base wrapped with her breasts. She just kept going, doing her best to stay silent, but soon, a moan escaped despite her best attempt to maintain control. </p><p>It was an incredible feeling. </p><p>Her mental musing was broken as his hand suddenly tightened around her hair, pulling her out. “I don’t like my employees daydreaming while working,” he threatened even as his fingers dipped down, twisting her nipple. Tara felt her heart beat faster, doing her best to convince herself that what she was feeling was not lust. </p><p>Yet, as it raged inside her, she couldn’t help it. “I’m sorry sir, it’s just … my first time,” she admitted, feeling shame. </p><p>“Sorry sweetie, I didn’t know that. But you should have said to me. You’re lucky that I’m a good boss. I’m going to help you turn into an expert,” he said. </p><p>She just followed his order like she didn’t have a mind of her own, guided only by his hands. She shuffled on her knees as his thing got closer and closer.</p><p>Soon, it ended up in her mouth, but this time, she wasn’t trying to maintain her tits around his girth. She wasn’t even trying to control herself. </p><p>She just sank low, following his direction as she took his presence first into her mouth … then into her throat, her lips sliding across his skin.</p><p>He leaned forward even more as he pushed her, slamming down even harder as she felt her throat being filled. The way his hips moved to meet her face didn’t help either. </p><p>Or, helped excellently, depending on the perspective, but she didn’t bother focusing on that definition, instead, she focused on her task. She couldn’t fail. </p><p>Not when her boss was working hard to help her. </p><p>Her lips grabbed the base of his shaft, squeezing even as he pushed her up and down. His groan was like music to her ears, her lust growing in response. </p><p>She was a bad girl. A very bad girl. Otherwise, why would she feel herself getting even more drenched, ruining the floor, her mind filled with dreams of pushing him down before sitting on his lap, riding him like … like a whore. Nothing less, nothing more. </p><p>She wished that he ordered her to touch herself, and play while putting on a show, so she could suppress the growing fire inside her. </p><p>Since she lacked the courage to do that, she focused on what she could control. She followed his direction and started moving up and down faster and faster, sucking him for all she could, feeling the way he got even harder between her lips. </p><p>Soon, his hips started to move more erratically, indicating he was going to cum soon. She let him move her faster up and down, his free hand on her breasts to prevent their bouncing. </p><p>Almost there. </p><p>Then, there was a crash. For a moment, she thought that it was her climax … or hers. “Wait here,” he ordered as he pulled out, and only then she realized that it came from downstairs. </p><p>It was an order. She was supposed to wait. But as she watched him put on his pants hurriedly and dash down … but not before grabbing a discarded baseball bat she had assumed to be garbage. </p><p>“No, I need to support him,” she thought as she dashed and quickly dressed … then, stopped. She couldn’t just go and confront them in her face, not when that would mean revealing herself. </p><p>Helpless, she looked at his luggage, and found a ski mask. Not exactly the best disguise, but it was better than nothing. She hurriedly put that on before she dashed downstairs, cursing that she only had enhanced strength, resistance, and durability, and not speed. </p><p>The moment she arrived downstairs, she found herself looking at a messy situation. A broken bottle next to a bleeding man, while her boss … her dear boss, swinging the baseball bat to keep a man with a knife away from him while trying to reach the other … who had been currently in the process of pulling a gun. </p><p>She wouldn’t allow that. </p><p>She couldn’t allow that.</p><p>She rushed forward, ignoring the man with a knife even as she reached the man with the gun, and swung her fist, only at the last second remembering to hold back her punches to prevent a bloody end. </p><p>He still went down. “Fuck, a super—“ the other started, but before she could deal with him, a baseball bat caught him in the head, sending him down. </p><p>“Didn’t I tell you to stay upstairs?” he said, but he wasn’t shouting. </p><p>She pulled her mask off, and met with his gaze. “I’m sorry, sir,” she said as she looked at him, challenging him for the first time. “But I won’t let any harm come to you…” </p><p>And, just like that, the silence stretched.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The next day, I was up but exhausted when Tara arrived sharp, at eight o’clock, her clothing once again conservative and boring. </p><p>I was exhausted, as I wasn’t able to sleep because I was awake all night, the first half dedicated to the repairs, the second half designing and redesigning the drinks menu … I knew that it was a useless effort with the location of the bar … but it was my only chance to succeed, and I didn’t want to ignore it. </p><p>“First, finish cleaning the kitchen and the office, then come upstairs and wake me up,” I ordered. The moment I put my head down, I managed to sleep … but with her presence downstairs, my dreams were quite interesting. </p><p>Then, I felt a hand on my shoulder. “Sir, I finished with downstairs,” she said.</p><p>“Good,” I said as I stood up, stretching. “Now, start cleaning.”  </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she said and grabbed her cleaning rag. </p><p>“What are you doing?” I asked, and she froze. “Who told you that you can wear clothes while cleaning,” I added. “It’s a punishment, and you need to be dressed appropriately.” </p><p>She said nothing, and for a moment, I wondered if I pushed too far too fast. But then, she grabbed the hem of her shirt without saying anything, and my excitement was back. </p><p>Marvelous.</p><p>With a pull, she freed her body from her shirt, revealing a different — yet equally boring — bra. Still, the failure of her conservative bra to contain her cleavage was enough to entertain me as she pushed her pants down, revealing her matching panties. Yet, despite the lack of supporting clothing, the way her back arched as she leaned forward was simply incredible, revealing most of her bare flesh. </p><p>“Let me help you with that,” I said as I took a step behind her, but rather than helping to unhook her bra, I pushed her panties down … and she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Don’t forget to stand straight,” I reminded her as I pushed the small of her back, the other hand cupping her ass to remind me of the feeling of her ass. That hand stayed on her cheeks, the other climbed up and unhooked her bra. </p><p>Leaving her naked. </p><p>However, I could read her well enough that it had been fast enough to keep her on the edge. “Now, start working. I’ll go and check downstairs.” </p><p>I moved down without waiting for an answer, leaving her alone. I quickly walked around, and realized the place was near perfect. Everything that could be cleaned without a total rebuild had been cleaned … and she even fixed a few of the more obvious problems, showing she wasn’t half-bad when it came to maintenance. </p><p>How fascinating, I thought, tempted to keep her even longer despite the risks. “A decision for the future me,” I murmured as I grabbed a chair, and started climbing up. </p><p>She needed something to climb to reach the corners. </p><p>However, the moment I finished climbing the stairs, I started struggling once more. Tara was on her hands and knees, forcing herself to reach behind the radiator to clean properly. However, she was facing the other way … and considering she was in her birthday suit, the view was simply amazing. </p><p>I never thought that I could be happy with the level of dirt filling my room, but as I watched Tara clean, I realized that there was a first time for everything. </p><p>Just like that, I made a decision for the future. Cleaning my apartment would be her responsibility … and, as long as we were alone, she would be cleaning the place wearing exactly that, and nothing else … well, not exactly that. Maybe we could spice things up with a fishnet or something more, but the general direction was simply too excellent to be ignored. </p><p>Too excellent not to be enjoyed. I placed the chair in the middle of the room. “To help you to reach higher places,” I explained when she looked at me questioningly, and sat on the bed once more, watching her. </p><p>At first, I didn’t make any move as I watched her, not willing to risk pushing her too much, no matter how tight my pants were feeling. However, soon I realized she had been paying particularly extended attention to my crotch, so I decided to change things a bit. </p><p>Right when she pulled the chair to reach to one of the corners to get rid of the spider webs. </p><p>An amazing angle … then she started jumping up slightly to get the last bit, her breasts dancing as she moved, turning it into an incredible strip show. It was too much to resist, so I grabbed my cock over my pants, and started rubbing. </p><p>Slow at first, but when I realized her reaction was limited to a gasp and a blush, I decided to get rid of my pants directly, leaving only my boxers, which allowed me to feel more comfortable … and for her to get a better view of it. </p><p>Then, it was time for her to move the chair to the next location. I expected her to move far away from me, but, much to my surprise, she moved closer. </p><p>For such a shy woman, she could be surprisingly horny. Fascinating. </p><p>Still, as much as I wanted to say something, I held my lips shut. I could sense that she was already at her limit, and she needed to get used to it. The way I played with myself slowly while she did her best to look like a star attraction at a strip club had to be enough while I waited. </p><p>She didn’t exactly strut around the room as she cleaned, so I decided to mix things up a bit. “Remember what I taught you about walking. Practice them while cleaning,” I ordered. </p><p>Which, once again, worked wonders. Her hips started to move far more vigorously as she moved the chair once more, almost like she was moving in rhythm to the beat, her hips swaying to the beat of a song that didn’t exist.</p><p>She bent forward slowly as she stepped on the chair once more, this time just a couple feet away from me, giving me an even better angle for me to enjoy her naked wetness. </p><p>She didn’t smile as she raised her hands over her head, but her expression was inevitably sexy as she did her best to hide her arousal … and failing greatly. She turned slightly, and her breasts became fully exposed to me. </p><p>I started rubbing mine with a bigger fervor … her gaze slipped toward me, and she lost her balance for a moment. She didn’t fall, but that wasn’t needed. Since she was already in the mood, I decided to push for more. </p><p>“You clumsy thing. You almost fell on top of me,” I said, deliberately sharp as I jumped up to my feet. She shivered under my anger, clearly enjoying. </p><p>“I’m sorry, sir,” she answered, this time, her voice actually throaty. </p><p>“It seems that as your boss, I can’t rest while you work. Not without you ruining everything,” I said, entertained by just how much she enjoyed my sharp words sexually. </p><p>Without even asking for her permission, I grabbed her thighs to ‘stabilize’ her. “Now, clean,” I ordered. </p><p>She did so, unable to resist the order. She tiptoed on the chair, her legs parting slightly, giving me a show that could only be called as excellent. As she rose and went down, her tits swayed softly, driving me crazy. </p><p>Well, crazier. </p><p>When it was time to step down, I grabbed her waist, and lowered her myself despite the absolute lack of need, but she said nothing. Realizing it was time to push some more, I brought pulled her against my body until her ass rubbed against my chest first, then slowly lowered, our bodies rubbing together. </p><p>And, when she landed, my shaft was comfortably buried between her cheeks. She shivered, but as my hand stayed around her belly, she made no move. I let my hands dance on her belly for a while, enjoying their smoothness, and then one of them climbed up. “It must be hard to walk around with them without a bra. Let me massage them.” I said, but I wasn’t asking for permission. </p><p>If I were, I would have waited to finish my words before I cupped them aggressively, squeezing. “Move your hips,” I ordered, feeling it was time to push. “No need to stop working on your walk.” </p><p>It was absurd. I knew it, and she knew it. But that paper-thin excuse was all she needed for her hips to start moving despite my shaft buried in between, my old boxers a poor insulator. </p><p>For a moment, my second hand joined the first as I mauled her breasts, and she danced. Her hips moved perfectly at first, but soon, her movements started to get choppier as the arousal started to build up. </p><p>I had been planning to start dipping down to test just how aroused she was, but her body decided to show it more directly. Suddenly, with the slightest of warnings, she started trembling as a sudden orgasm hit, her wetness flooding down … drenching my boxers in the process. </p><p>“You clumsy girl,” I said as I spanked her ass hard without a warning, which made her moan desperately, followed by a whimper as I took a step back and sat down on the chair, kicking off my boxers in the process. “Look at the mess you have made,” I said as I pointed at my shaft, and she shivered. </p><p>“S-sir,” she stammered, her arousal growing incredibly quickly as she looked down … telling me that I wasn't the only one with interesting dreams. </p><p>“On your knees,” I ordered. </p><p>And, she fell on her knees.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was pushing my luck. </p><p>Seriously. </p><p>Who in his right mind calls a super he had just met to his lap for punishment, especially for an accident that only happened before he had been teasing her naked body … after letting her towel drop. </p><p>Yet, looking at her naked body — it had to be a part of her power, as such perfection couldn’t exist otherwise, I refused to believe — I had no choice but to do that, the temptation impossible to reject. How could I when I looked at her incredible, teardrop-shaped breasts that defied gravity in an impossible manner, crowned by her nipples? </p><p>I just called her, sitting on my rundown mattress, the room itself an insult to such an incredible example of womanhood. </p><p>Yet, she took a step forward, her toned legs tensing slightly under the pressure, reminding me of a dancer at the peak of her career. Her hips, no less perfect than any other part of her body, tightened just slightly as she moved. </p><p>And, then there was her core, sopping wet, the only thing that convinced me to believe that my observation powers were actually working like they were supposed to when I read dozens of signs telling me that she was actually enjoying the treatment. </p><p>Enjoying it immensely, even. </p><p>Still, only when she stood in front of me and started lying down like I asked her, did I finally dare to look at her face. I would have never believed she didn’t have any makeup on her face if she hadn’t just stepped out of the shower, but she was even more beautiful without her makeup and her glasses. </p><p>A side note, she really needed to learn how to actually put makeup, considering she managed to actually hide her beauty even from me … and I had an actual power for that. </p><p>Her stunning features were surrounded by her long brown hair, still straight and silken after the shower, adding more to her beauty … but not as much as the demure expression she carried. </p><p>I never remembered my pants feeling this tight, my cock hard enough to hurt as she lay on my knees. </p><p>It took everything I had to keep my mouth to fall open in pure awe and shock, and only the knowledge that it would ruin the mood that gave me the power I needed. I could never forgive myself if I ruined the moment with such an elementary mistake. </p><p>When I opened my mouth, I wanted to actually compile sonnets for her beauty, but what I actually said was different. “You’re lucky I’m a merciful boss. Just a quick punishment, and you’ll be forgiven,” I said as I raised my hand. </p><p>And brought it down, the sound ringing in the empty apartment. </p><p>She moaned. </p><p>“I’m still disappointed, of course. I certainly expected better of you,” I added as I raised my hand once more, using every bit of willpower not to just leave it there to caress her incredible ass … or somewhere slightly lower. </p><p>“I’m sorry, sir,” she repeated as her eyes started to shine with tears. Certainly not pain, as even with everything that was going on, I didn’t dare to hit too hard to startle her. </p><p>I preferred my bones to stay intact. </p><p>“I know you are, Tara. You’re a good girl,” I said as I brought my down once more. She shivered once more, but my words affected her even more than the spank. Especially the phrase good girl. “You’re a good girl, right?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she moaned, her desperation as beautiful as her naked body. Well, almost as beautiful. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I spanked her once more, but this time, I left my hand in place, soft and lingering, for several seconds rather than pulling back immediately, caressing her skin. </p><p>As an added benefit, I was getting a better sense of her powers. I didn’t know whether she had enhanced resistance as a part of her powers, but if she did, it only worked after a certain amount of damage. </p><p>My spanks worked just fine. </p><p>Another spank, and this time, she gasped even louder. A fake gasp, my power helped me to recognize … concealing a moan. </p><p>Naughty girl. </p><p>I was literally incapable of not taking advantage of that. As her body was wracked with shivers, I placed my hand on her side, right where her waist and hips met. It didn’t help to contain those shivers. </p><p>For the next spank, I let my fingers rest there, then let them climb up slightly, caressing her belly gently. I wanted to do much more, but I didn’t want to abandon what was working. </p><p>Especially when it contrasted greatly with my harsher spanks. Seeing that she enjoyed them, the next one, I landed considerably harder … and in response, received a louder cry. </p><p>I caressed her stomach for another second before I committed to what I had been desiring since I had noticed what she had been hiding under that ugly shirt — albeit the real thing turned even better than what I had imagined. My fingers climbed up, and soon, they were cupping her breasts.</p><p>The greatest I had ever touched, certainly, no matter the metric. Size, firmness, sensation, beauty … they were just ethereal. </p><p>I had been planning to stay there only for a second to act like it was just an accident — in case she reacted negatively — but when her response was just a moan, especially one she wasn’t able to hide as a pained gasp, no power could actually make me follow that horrible plan. </p><p>My hand stayed around her breast, rebelling against my control as my fingers squeezed her breast hard; the other landing on her perfect ass in another spank. </p><p>And squeezed again … and again. </p><p>“Not bad. I’m impressed with your obedience,” I said. “Just five more spanks, and you’ll be properly punished,” I said. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she responded immediately … but I didn’t need the help of my power to catch her intense disappointment. My eyes widened in shock, realizing just how lucky I had been in terms of the response to my ad. </p><p>“Or, maybe ten,” I corrected as I spanked her ass again, even harder, and my fingers stayed on her ass, dancing freely. “We don’t want you to forget your lesson too quickly, do we?” I said. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she repeated, but this time, elation replaced disappointment … followed by another moan as I squeezed her nipple. At the same time, my fingers dipped slightly down around her ass, toward her wetness. </p><p>She didn’t tense, at least not in a noticeable way. My power barely caught her reaction … but it was enough to understand that I shouldn’t be pushing too much. </p><p>So close to heaven, yet so far away. A part of me was begging me to ignore that ethereal warning and just dip down, replace pain with pleasure … but my power had been accurate until now, and I didn’t dare to ignore it just because I was feeling impatient. </p><p>Instead, I spanked her again while playing with her amazing breasts. It wasn’t like the consolation prize was particularly horrible. </p><p>“Last five. Almost over,” I whispered after a few more spanks, but this time, I actually grabbed her ass, squeezing hard as I enjoyed her naked plumpness. She shuffled a bit, a vain attempt to hide her arousal, but failed spectacularly. </p><p>Most importantly, she didn’t try to shuffle away from my touch, even when I delayed significantly before spanking her again. </p><p>Pity the last five spanks had gone too quickly. “And, that’s the last one,” I said my hand landed for the last time. I didn’t pull my hand away, and she didn’t make a move to stand up. </p><p>Or to push my hand on her breast. </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” she suddenly said, which surprised me. </p><p>“Did you enjoy it?” I suddenly asked. </p><p>“W-what, no!” she gasped, her lie the most obvious I had ever seen. </p><p>I wanted to laugh, but instead, I growled. “That was a lie. You just lied to me,” I said, not willing to miss that opportunity. </p><p>“No, sir,” she answered. Yet, my statement didn’t exactly alarm her, clearly happy to receive more spanks. </p><p>I decided to change the pace. “Stand up,” I ordered. </p><p>“S-sir,” she stammered in shock, this time alarmed, but she still followed that order, and she stood in front of me, naked, with her hands crossed in front of her. “Don’t wrangle your hands, it makes you look anxious,” I ordered, and her hands fell to her sides, giving her full frontal nudity without the slightest obstruction. </p><p>I made a point taking my time as I stood up. She avoided my gaze, so I cupped her chin gently and raised her head … until I was looking her directly in the eye, close enough to feel her breath on my face. “Tell me. Did you lie when I asked whether you enjoyed the spanks?” </p><p>The way she shivered was simply marvelous. “Yes, sir. I lied. I’m sorry. Please forgive me.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, you earned another punishment,” I said, doing my best to keep my expression tight as I tried to come up with the perfect punishment. Luckily, I managed to come up with one quickly. “You’re going to clean my apartment as punishment, first thing tomorrow,” I ordered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she murmured, clearly disappointed as we reached the end, but my power was telling me that I had pushed her enough for the day. </p><p>“Good, make sure you’re here first thing in the morning,” I said, which was the last thing I had said before she left … but, naturally, I made sure to watch every slow, lingering move as she quietly dressed… ‘</p><p>All around, a rather excellent first day. </p>",
