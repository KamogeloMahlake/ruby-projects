    "content": "<p>The mystery behind her name was important, one that I fully intended to explore. </p><p>But it was not the task for the moment, not when I was watching her body tremble helplessly in front of me as I watched her, on her knees, obediently accepting the presence of the silver chain around her neck. </p><p>It was a thing of pure amazement, watching her confidence and abrasion slowly eroding into obedience as the pleasure invaded her body…  </p><p>Inexperience was a dangerous thing. </p><p>Admittedly, she wasn’t as bad as Aria had been, her immense magical potential and her outward confidence creating a much stronger outer layer. Aria wouldn’t be able to survive alone without the protection afforded by her status, just like a cute little lamb lost in the forest, unprotected from the jaws of the predators. </p><p>Unfortunately for Cinder, the strength of her exterior prickly personality meant that she was equally vulnerable once someone daring — admittedly to a crazy level, enough to push forward, risking a battle that would leave an area of several miles radius in cinders. Just thinking the pun put a smile on my face, but I certainly wasn’t crazy enough to say that out loud. </p><p>Not even as the pleasure invaded her deep enough that she accepted the presence of the chain. I had a feeling that the comment would push her too much. </p><p>I turned my attention back to how to process. The additional services I managed to convince her to receive during the massage managed to destroy that prickly exterior, revealing a soft heart, one that was longing for comfort and pleasure. </p><p>I was more than willing to test whether my own brand of attention could fill that gap. </p><p>“So, you have completed the preparatory steps, are you ready for the real massage,” I said even as I leaned back. Though, that was not the extent of my moves to reflect my confidence. The real move came later. I tugged her chain, the pull making her stand up. </p><p>She stood up slowly, the move making her amazing curves ripple in a way that tempted me to abandon the theatrics and enjoy the show. I took a deep breath as I glanced at her, the chain still connected to her neck while she was otherwise naked and trembling, her beautiful wings flickering in intensity.  </p><p>“P-preparatory steps…” she murmured in a daze, but only after she fully stood up to show just how much time she needed to process it, unable to hide her surprise. “Was that—“ she started, only for me to tug the chain to silence her. </p><p>Admittedly, her half-formed statement was accurate, as I had initially framed the earlier massage she received differently. </p><p>Too bad for her that I had no problem leveraging her dazed state to mislead her. “Of course sweetie, I told you so, remember,” I said even as I put a hand on her hips. “Let’s see if you’re strong enough to handle the true massage.” </p><p>Despite my words, I didn’t push her to the next stage, and just put my hand on her core, dancing around her wetness to push her pleasure even more. Her moan was beautiful, a soft tremble quick to invade her body as she bent forward. </p><p>It wasn’t a climax, at least not yet, but as my hand moved back and forth, it wasn’t too far away either. </p><p>For a while, I said nothing, which would have given her a chance to consider the direction the situation was devolving, but, luckily, the pleasure was an excellent way of keeping her away from such pesky concerns. It was a beautiful moment, even more than the previous massage despite all the access it gave me, because of the nature of the position. </p><p>Unlike the massage, which was a servile position — at least on the surface — I was sitting while she stood with a chain around her neck, which left no doubt about the power difference. And, as much as I was willing to play along, I was self-aware enough to understand where my true preference lay. </p><p>One didn’t climb up through all the barriers to take the seat of the Dark Lord.</p><p>As my fingers continued to work, I could have easily pushed her to another climax at this moment. However, I had no intention of actually doing so. </p><p>I had a different plan in mind. </p><p>I tightened my hold over her chain once more, this time pulling her down to my lap. </p><p>It was an interesting moment. She could have resisted my pull easily. Despite my intention, the pull was soft, almost gentle, one that allowed her plenty of time to escape. Not to mention, her physical strength was immense enough that I doubted I would be successful even when pulling with my full power if she wanted to resist. </p><p>Of course, there was a great range between resisting and actively participating, and she was somewhere in the middle of that great distance, too confused by the rapidly changing conditions to properly react. </p><p>That didn’t prevent her from letting out a spectacular moan as my pull reached completion, and invaded her core. </p><p>Then, I met with another surprise. </p><p>I felt magic slamming my body with all the strength of a rabid dragon. I assumed that it was an attack, and was ready to retaliate, but not only my magic was in chaos, but the invasion of fiery energy filled my body to weaken my movement. </p><p>It was fortunate as well, because it prevented a retaliatory strike that would have likely hurt her significantly from such a close distance, even if all the stories about their regenerative capabilities were accurate. </p><p>It might have even been fatal if I used the chain as a weapon. </p><p>I was glad that I didn’t retaliate, because that second was critical for me to notice I wasn’t the only one that froze. Clearly, it was not a deliberate attack, but some kind of magical reaction that was triggered after I took her virginity, throwing her magic into chaos as well. </p><p>If the surprise growing on her face was any indicator, not exactly a casual one as well. </p><p>With the burning energy locking our bodies and magic, I didn’t have the luxury of reacting, so I turned my attention inward, trying to understand the nature of the change. </p><p>Two things were clear. Despite the intensity of the energy, it wasn’t harmful — at least not immediately so. And cutting the process halfway might have some dangerous implications. </p><p>Luckily, considering the method of trigger, continuing the process wasn’t exactly a chore. As I slowly regained control over my body, I tightened my grip around her hips, preventing her escape. </p><p>Not that it seemed necessary, as she made no move to actually abandon my lap. “Impossible,” she just muttered, showing that she recognized what was going on. </p><p>“Nothing is impossible when it’s about me, sweetie,” I said as I tightened my grip even more and started rocking my lips. She was not too far away from a climax. As I started pushing forward, she started trembling. </p><p>Despite her trembling, she created an amazing view. Her hands landed on my shoulders for balance, and her back arched, which, the sudden bursting intensity of the flames of her wings, was a wondrous sight, her naked body nothing less than a beautiful painting. </p><p>A masterpiece that only got more beautiful as she started moving once more. She let out a beautiful, primal moan before her hips started to rock, assisting my furious pumping, her back still arching to display her beautiful breasts perfectly. </p><p>I leaned to capture her nipple between my lips, biting aggressively, the sudden flare of pain just making her move faster. </p><p>I could feel her fingers digging into my shoulders painfully, but just like her dilemma, it made it more fun for me. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, it could also remind her that just how much power she actually had, so I had no choice but to take another step. </p><p>I gave another command to the chain as I let it go, and it wrapped around her wrists, forcing her arms to her back — which happened much slower than I would have loved, as my magic control was still fizzy as some kind of energy fused with it. </p><p>But, it still took only a few seconds, and with the silver contrasting against her fiery wings, the view certainly looked amazing. </p><p>“Impossible,” she murmured once more, showing that she was less concerned about the way I was using the chains, and more about the process that we were going through. </p><p>Clearly, it was an important process, but since interrupting that was clearly a bad idea, I just focused on the moment, enjoying the way her virgin hole tightened around my shaft. Her hips sashayed beautifully as they moved, showing I wasn’t the only one that was preoccupied with the pleasure aspect to some degree. </p><p>I didn’t stop observing the changes in my magic, of course, but as a fully nude phoenix — well, technically chain could count as an item of clothing, but it was not exactly an impediment to the pleasure I was feeling. </p><p>I grabbed her cheek aggressively, hard enough to leave a mark, which enhanced her moan. “So, do you like my special massage,” I asked mockingly as I turned that grip into a spank, hard enough to make her flinch. </p><p>“Y-you —“ she gasped, but that was all she was able to say before I leaned and captured her lips in a searing kiss, my tongue invading her mouth, enjoying the intense warmth of her mouth.  </p><p>Her eyes widened, showing a hint of anger at my interruption, but her reaction stayed limited to that as she obediently accepted the invasion of my tongue. </p><p>I felt a wave of amusement at her reaction, which was considerably more intense than her silent obedience as she chained her arms behind her. Teasing her about that was tempting, but that would have required me to stop the aggressive kiss we were sharing, and that was not something I wanted to do. </p><p>Instead, I continued to spank her ass, each slap triggering her tightness, while my other hand climbed to her chest, once again mauling her spectacular tits, each second making the moment even more intense. </p><p>Under that multifaceted treatment, it didn’t take long for my poor little Cinder to climax beautifully, her tightness around me begging for me to explode. But luckily, my earlier adventure with Isolde did wonders to give me some extra strength to resist that temptation. </p><p>Naturally, I had no intention to stop, or even pause for a second. All I just needed was to decide a particular direction of action first.</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Compared to the extra training in the morning, the evening training held no surprises, pleasant or nasty. </p><p>Well, almost no surprises, as Coach Bill occasionally popped next to me during the training, questioning me about the formations he had taught the day before, making sure I remembered all of them accurately.</p><p>Which was surprisingly challenging the exhaustion started to build up, each breath burning my lungs. </p><p>Luckily, the benefits of Strategy and Tactics Traits were too amazing to be stumped by something as simple as exhaustion. </p><p>And, Coach Bill might be an old curmudgeon, but his strict reputation about playing only the ones that were having a good training week was clearly accurate, because, toward the end of the training, he let me take the mike position for the practice game, much to the shocked gazes of the rest of the team, bouncing between me and Carter. </p><p>Despite starting to lose his position, Carter didn’t have a reaction to that. </p><p>Naturally so, as it was what he was fighting for, but the rest didn’t know that. </p><p>The shock of the people resulted in a nice flood of Intent, quickening the recovery of my guide. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough for me to split the flow sufficiently to feed the System, so it didn’t give me any nifty Traits that would help me to reinforce my abilities.  </p><p>The training only ended when it was time for the class. A few of the players stayed for extra practice, and, noticing the subtle gaze of Coach Bill, I decided to stay in as well. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my traits, doing that much extra training would certainly be harmful, but such ‘dedication’ would certainly impress the old-school coach. </p><p>And, I needed to impress him to play. There was no substitute for a stadium full of people, watching me as they cheered as their lives depended on it to farm some intent. </p><p>I stayed in the stadium until ten, pushing more than every other player was willing to, which, as an added benefit, gave me some reproachful looks from the rest of the defensive players. </p><p>They were jealous, but their gaze was also tinged with respect. </p><p>Their thought process was rather clear. Losing a starter spot to a newcomer was certainly not a happy occasion for the other hopefuls, but if that player increased the chances of victory even marginally… Playing football was good, challenging, and fun at the same time. </p><p>Winning football games was the best.  </p><p>After the training, I was planning to go back to my room for a quick nap, but after the shower, I found a message on my phone. </p><p>It was from the coordinator of the Chess team, calling me for a team meeting at nine-thirty. </p><p>Meaning, that I was already half an hour late, a fact that was not appreciated by him if the five unanswered calls were any indicator. I wrote a quick message, telling him that the football training extended and I would drop by. </p><p>It was his fault for calling for a meeting without a warning, of course, but I was not in a position to raise that point and annoy someone that had a right to make decisions about my scholarship. </p><p>At least, not before I actually played in a couple games to strengthen my place on the team and convince the football team that gave me a full scholarship was preferable to splitting my time with the chess team. </p><p>I drove to the building that held the headquarters for the chess team, even though calling it headquarters gave it an unjustified grandiose. </p><p>Unlike the football stadium, filled with the state of the art equipment, the modified classroom was barely enough to host a dozen people, the only decoration other than the chairs and table was a large bookcase filled with chess books — most of them outdated to the point of complete uselessness. </p><p>Interestingly, seven people were already there, working hard. </p><p>Six of them were familiar faces. They were members of the chess team. I had a passing familiarity with them, but nothing more. </p><p>Unlike me, they were not scholarship students. It was an important detail for me, because their college attendance was not dependent on their success. </p><p>I wouldn’t have bothered about that if that fact didn’t show itself in their studying schedule. </p><p>The seventh person in the class was certainly a surprise though. A certain raven-haired girl, carefully explained a complicated pattern to the other six. </p><p>“Long time no see, Lauren,” I said as I walked toward them and pulled a chair. “Tell me, what made you decide to waste your time in this horrible place.” </p><p>Her expression of annoyance was cute enough to put a smile on my face. “You’re already late, why don’t you respect the rest of the team and stay silent until I finish teaching.” </p><p>Her attitude was much sharper than I was normally used to, which was a nice exception to her usual attitude. “Harsh. I like it,” I said as I caught her gaze and hit her with a beautiful smirk, enjoying the way a blush invaded her face instantly, demolishing her earlier confidence.</p><p>The improvement in Seduction was no joke. </p><p>“I-I’m simply being fair,” she stammered as she tried to recover himself. </p><p>Then, one of the other players turned his gaze at me, his courage bolstered. </p><p>I recognized the nature of his sudden courage. Lauren was a beautiful girl, and he wanted not to miss the opportunity to play the heroic prince. “Hey, be respectful to our new tutor. Just because you joined the football team—“ he started. </p><p>That was all he was able to say before my fist landed on the table, my gaze pinning him down. “Who are you to talk to me,” I growled, not even bothering to use the full impact of the Intimidation trait to optimize my move. </p><p>Just my gaze would have been enough to silence him. My words were enough to make him lean back fearfully, making me wonder whether he would fall down the chair. </p><p>To test that, I took a step forward, but before I could bring that to completion, Lauren intercepted. </p><p>“Enough, don’t bully the other students,” she said, her tone sharper. “You’re all members of the same team, you need to get along.” </p><p>“Who would get along with this thug,” the boy who just challenged me murmured, encouraged by the sudden intervention. </p><p>I thought about turning my attention to him and teaching him a small lesson about talking back, but I decided to ignore him. Instead, I turned my attention to Lauren. “So, you’re the new tutor for our chess team?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, I decided to volunteer to thank the school for giving me the opportunity,” she said. </p><p>I shook my head, enjoying her naivety. She didn’t need to pay back, as her hiring was clearly about her family pulling the strings, but clearly, the coordinator decided to leverage her naivety to get some free work from a player of her caliber. </p><p>“You’re wasting your time with them,” I said dismissively. </p><p>“Hey—“ one of them started, only to fall silent when I caught his gaze and made a zipping motion. </p><p>My reputation had already been set in the team long before I had received the System, and while they had been momentarily encouraged by the inclusion of a tutor, hoping that an authority figure would limit my action, their hopes were short-lived. </p><p>“What do you mean?” Lauren asked before her expression stiffened. “And, don’t talk disrespectfully about your teammates.” </p><p>I sighed. Unlike the others, I liked Lauren due to her courage to actually cut off her family to focus on her dreams — even though I knew that it was little more than polite fiction, her family humoring her rebellion, Lauren didn’t know that, which was enough to earn a modicum of respect for me. </p><p>And, if I was being honest, her innocent beauty and fun personality helped to magnify that effect. </p><p>So, I decided to explain. “You’re wasting your time with them,” I repeated, and when I gestured for her to stop when she opened her mouth. “You’re wasting your time, because none of them puts enough time to actually study the game, so they are just going to waste your time while you try to explain the same concepts again and again.”</p><p>“Hey, we study,” interjected one of them. </p><p>“For how long?” I asked. </p><p>“At least five hours,” he answered. </p><p>“You see,” Lauren interjected, happy to find an opportunity to invalidate what I told her. “They are studying more than enough, and they just need someone to guide them properly. If you bothered to mentor them rather than wrestling with grown men, maybe you would have a proper team.” </p><p>Coming from someone else, that statement annoyed me. But Lauren had a certain aura of cuteness radiating off her, somehow making her even more fun. </p><p>I turned my attention to the guy who spoke. “Five hours per…” I murmured, letting him complete. </p><p>“Per week, of course,” he said, looking around confused. </p><p>I didn’t say anything, just caught Lauren’s gaze, enjoying her blush. The boy — whose name I didn’t bother to learn despite being in the same team for almost two years — looked at Lauren, realizing the sudden shift in her attitude. </p><p>“That’s not exactly sufficient to improve,” she admitted softly, not willing to defend them after realizing that what they meant with serious work was not five hours a day. </p><p>“But, we have classes and other clubs—“ the boy started, only for me to slam my fist once more. </p><p>“New team rule,” I said. “You guys are going to study at least three hours a day before bothering Lauren about teaching.” </p><p>“We can’t—“ one of the others started, only for me to gesture them to silence. </p><p>“This is not a debate. That’s the new team rule. Either quit, so she can pick new team members, or you start studying hard. And if you stay on the team and don’t work…” My smirk widened. “I wonder how many players I could convince to torture you guys for laziness. If there’s one thing they hate more than nerds, it’s the lazy nerds that ruin the name of our school.” Their expression was simply beautiful. </p><p>“Now, get out,” I growled, tapping into Intimidation for the first time since I entered the room. </p><p>The speed they escaped was impressive. Maybe I should bring them to running back selections. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I prepared myself for an immediate battle, ready to retaliate as Marcus charged forward, glancing at his bodyguards to see whether they would arrive first, or their master. </p><p>Yet, I met with a surprise. </p><p>Only Marcus moved forward, his weapon drawn. His bodyguards waited on the side while he walked calmly. I might have expected that he wanted to do something ridiculous as dueling for honor, but even that was disproven by the way he was holding his gladius. </p><p>Or the fact that he didn’t have his shield. </p><p>Gladius was an interesting weapon. It was one of the most useless weapons in a duel alone, though the addition of the shield turned it into a half-decent combo — though still inferior. </p><p>Yet, when used by a legion in tight formation, their connected shields cancel most spells that could be used. With the sorcerers of the legion ready to block anything that could overcome the protection of the shields, the simple, unassuming weapon turned into the deadly weapon that allowed Republic to dominate both Europe and Asia. </p><p>Most Roman nobles carried a gladius rather than anything that would be more useful during actual combat due to its military association, but ignored the shield.  </p><p>The slow march of Marcus, however, was one of the worst representations of that arrogance. He didn’t even bother to raise his gladius up, giving me free rein to kill him before he could close the distance, especially since I was armed by a spear. </p><p>Of course, nothing he could actually do could save him while I wielded the Spear of Scipio, but it was the principle of the thing. </p><p>It showed that he was supremely confident his opponent, me, a mere slave, could never dare to retaliate, even on the eve of death. </p><p>I paused, only because I wanted to decide whether teaching him a lesson would be appropriate with everything going on. Before I could decide, however, other interruptions arrived. </p><p>“Master Antonius. This slave is truly an expert warrior. Not to mention his achievement of taking down the lion. His presence might help us control the beast. Isn’t it a waste to kill him with everything going on,” Harpax interrupted hurriedly? “I’m willing to pay triple the price you just mentioned if you sell him together with the Nemean lion.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but shake my head. Like they were competing for who would be the first one to die. </p><p>Maybe it was something about being a noble in Rome. They were too far removed from any kind of danger, to the point of losing even the most basic hint of survival, lacking the fear. </p><p>To the point of missing just how badly the Nemean Lion was reacting to my presence, enough that it collapsed on the floor in a submissive pose, their attention on Marcus’ confident walk and what it implied. </p><p>Pity they missed, if they looked at the beast, they would have noticed its abject terror as it trembled like a little kitten, afraid to make even the slightest noise. </p><p>“Unfortunately, that’s not viable. He’s already paid for,” Antonius answered regretfully as he looked at me, though not for a moment I thought his regret was about my death. No, it was the look of a merchant, sad to lose an opportunity to haggle for a higher price for the horse he had already sold. </p><p>“Yes, he is,” Marcus growled as he took another step forward, closing the distance even further. “And it’s money well-spent. It’s time someone taught this disgusting worm how to treat his masters —“ he added as he raised his sword, while the rest watched in, a mixture of pity and fascination. </p><p>Once again, only because they were watching an asset they wanted to be ruined by a spoiled rich brat, and nothing else. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was all he was able to say before I took a quick step forward and grabbed his hair, too fast for him to react, and I pushed him down. </p><p>The gazes of the audience turned into shock, unable to comprehend that I, a slave, dared to raise my hand against them, even when I was on the edge of death. </p><p>Yet, despite their shock, even the bodyguards didn’t move forward. Not because they were afraid of how I would react, but because they didn’t believe that I would actually take that step forward.  </p><p> “H-how dare you—“ Marcus gasped, his eyes wide, but more due to anger than fear, showing even he didn’t understand the true danger he found himself in. </p><p>A tired sigh escaped my mouth even though I felt the fascination of the depths of his entitlement, not even bothering to defend himself as I raised my spear, confident that it wouldn’t come down. </p><p>What a weird mentality, expecting me to accept death just because he was having a temper tantrum. If it was another day, I might have spent some time beating some sense to him before letting him survive. </p><p>But, after the long, exhausting battle that would probably declare me an Enemy of the Republic soon, I was not in the mood. </p><p>An accurate stab from a Patrician Weapon was enough to seriously wound a Disaster-Class beast. Against a spoiled noble brat…  </p><p>Immediate death. </p><p>The room fell silent, like they were unable to believe what happened despite the blood slowly spreading. “Fucking morons,” I murmured as I started walking toward Antonius. </p><p>I might have copied Marcus’ slow walk to drive the message, but I found that, as the revenge hovered, I didn’t really care much. </p><p>I had bigger worries than caring about the owner of a gladiatorial school. </p><p>Antonius proved his mettle in ruling a school filled with disobedient warriors by being the one to overcome his shock first, and he turned the rest of the gladiators. “Attack, kill him!” </p><p>“Think about it twice, boys,” I said as I looked at my fellow gladiators, twirling my spear, letting my confidence spread along with my magical presence. “Life is a beautiful thing, do you want to waste that opportunity for our dear ‘master’ just because he made the grievous mistake of crossing me,” I said. </p><p>Unlike the nobles, the gladiators faced death every day, and one benefit of such an opportunity was a sense of survival. They had fought with me many times during training, enough to know that if they dared to attack me first, they would not meet a good end. </p><p>Combined with my excessive confidence, they were smart enough to realize it was not the time to listen to their dear ‘master’ Antonius. </p><p>I couldn’t help but get a perverse enjoyment of Antonius’ shock as his brave gladiators refused to defend him. </p><p>The guards of the nobles didn’t share that perspective, and prepared to attack. Before they could rush forward, I threw my spear. </p><p>They ducked in fear, each fearing they were the target, but the spear sailed without connecting anyone. “So much for the brave Peirous, not even able to hit one of us —“ one of the guards commented, but it was all he was able to say before the Nemean Lion pounced from behind, killing him instantly. </p><p>The spear was there to destroy the lock. </p><p>The gladiators smartly stepped away from Antonius, realizing that things were passing to a point they could intervene. “Go away, no one would know you were here,” I said. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t stupid or naive enough to assume that just because I didn’t kill them they wouldn’t reveal my secrets, but considering the next step of my plan, anything they might reveal about me was worthless.</p><p>I never shared anything true about myself in the first place.  </p><p>The gladiators escaped, but under my orders, Nemean Lion easily prevented the nobles and their bodyguards that tried to replicate the achievement of the gladiators. </p><p>While the beast dealt with them, I continued to walk toward Antonius. </p><p>“You wouldn’t dare,” he gasped at first, but as I continued to walk quickly — more to save time rather than actually caring about what he might do —  his confidence was quick to disappear. </p><p>After all, he might be without morals, but he was certainly not without the necessary intelligence to understand after killing several nobles and their servants, killing him wouldn’t exactly add to it. “I can pay you. I have a lot of hidden treasures, you just need to—“ he started, only to be silenced by a stab into his stomach. </p><p>“You’re lucky that I’m in hurry,” I whispered as I pulled back. I considered leaving him bleeding, knowing no one could save him with such a wound, but after a momentary consideration, I stabbed again, this time through his eye, not wanting to leave a determined enemy behind. </p><p>Better safe than sorry. </p><p>The little time I used was enough for the Nemean lion to kill the rest — though their panic and lack of formation helped the speed of his achievement. </p><p>I gestured again, and the beast stood in front of me like an obedient horse, allowing me to climb on his back, his pride conveniently forgotten for the moment.  </p><p>“Move,” I ordered. </p><p>It was time for me to make a memorable exit out of Rome, properly triggering the brewing chaos…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I tensed as I processed the extraordinary information that my probe gave me. </p><p>There was no doubt about the accuracy of that outcome. I pushed the layer of disguise, and there was no one underneath.</p><p>It was supposed to be an impossible conclusion, one that I was supposed to dismiss as a crazy conclusion. Just to make sure, I cast a more ordinary detection spell. It was a healing-based one, essentially a variant of what I had been using to detect the undead, only geared to detect life rather than unlife. </p><p>The result told me that, other than the intensity of her life force — which was a very indirect indicator of her level — there was nothing extraordinary about the beauty in front of me. </p><p>Someone else might have been more inclined to believe the healing probe, but I had a different idea. </p><p>I was certainly more inclined to believe the results of Tantric</p><p>That didn’t mean I stopped probing, of course. On the contrary, it was just an invitation to intensify my exploration. I repeated my attempt, but this time, I combined my healing spells with Tantric.</p><p>A subtle operation. </p><p>Well, subtle in terms of the real objective and the aspect of mana, as I also needed an excuse to get a sample to experiment on. </p><p>I reached forward and grabbed the deficient fabric she was using as a top. I pulled it off aggressively before she could react at the inversion, while I did so, I made sure to grab one of her hairs and pulled it along. </p><p>And, the experiment wasn’t exactly without side benefits. </p><p>[+1500 Experience]</p><p>[Level Up!] </p><p>[Grandmaster Tantric (113/130)]</p><p>The improvement was certainly welcome, I thought. </p><p>Then I turned my focus on the experiment. Not the greatest sample perhaps, but more than enough to start. Despite her angry gasp, she didn’t bother to cover her chest, which was an interesting choice that would have surprised me before the earlier conclusion. </p><p>But her possible non-existence put the dismissal of her nudity in a new light. </p><p>Interesting, not as much as the little mana invasion I directed toward that single hair, healing mixed with Tantric, which evaporated that tiny sample into mana. </p><p>Just like a conjured item would have done under attack. </p><p>It was not pure mana, I recognized immediately. It reminded me of elemental, but not exactly. It was not a type that I recognized immediately. </p><p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t yet at a point to focus on that aspect, so I quickly created storage and pulled that mana inside me, to be analyzed later on in case I failed to extract more samples for any reason. </p><p>I certainly wasn’t afraid of it escaping, as that storage could hold Divine Spark without an issue. </p><p>Mana, no matter its nature, was nothing in comparison. </p><p>I decided to distract them to focus on my experiment without getting afraid of their interaction. I grabbed the warrior’s breasts, squeezing them hard enough to earn a beautiful breast. Their fakeness was unable to reduce the amazing sensation. </p><p>Even though the said fakeness reached a degree that was hard to comprehend. </p><p>Conjuring a full, working body was a great challenge, especially since it was not a mixture of biological and magic, but pure magic — at least, according to everything I could detect, as I used my connection to replicate the same trick a few times, stealing some extremely small samples from different parts, only for them to turn to be made from that unique form of mana. </p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>Yet, the notification popped reminded me that, their little conjuration was real enough to actually trick the System. </p><p>Fascinating… </p><p>Delia distracted me from my thoughts as she leaned to my ear, her breasts once again pressing against my neck. “I’m feeling neglected,” she whispered. “Maybe you should pay some attention to me,” she followed, but even as she said so, her hand sneaked toward my stomach, caressing my muscles for a fleeting moment before reaching to my shaft, dancing up and down softly. </p><p>“Not a bad idea,” I said as I turned slightly, capturing her lips in a searing kiss, my tongue invading her mouth aggressively. She accepted that, unaware that I was using the connection to send a similar spike of mana inside her to check her soul space while taking a tissue sample as well. </p><p>[+1 Tantric]</p><p>Both experiments returned with the same outcome, confirming that Delia was fake as well. </p><p>Amusingly, that outcome relaxed me a bit more, because it gave an explanation for two critical questions that were making me doubt my senses. Why they were so willing to turn things into a full sexual encounter rather than trying to minimize the contact, or at least trying to bargain…</p><p>And, why they were giving the exact same reactions, the intense reactions I expected from not-Delia. </p><p>I was yet to discover how they were being controlled, I was willing to make a very considerable bet on both were controlled by not-Delia. </p><p>Moreover, considering the speed of their reactions, their instinctual responses, and their inability to fully erase their emotions, I was willing to believe that the control was more instinctual than deliberate. </p><p>Of course, to understand the exact nature, I needed to discover the control method, which certainly wasn’t a trivial task. </p><p>Luckily, I was not in a hurry to do so. Since not-Delia was kind enough to give me two magical dolls that could still give me experience, I decided to use the opportunity to achieve another level, maybe even more if the Divine Spark I allowed the System to absorb would allow me to go for more. </p><p>I pulled back from the kiss even as I wrapped my arm around Delia’s waist, and stood up. </p><p>The warrior looked shocked at the sudden move — one that I could also see echoing in Delia’s gaze, giving credence to my assumption about both conjurations were controlled by the same person — but before she could react, I grabbed her chain and pulled. </p><p>“Stay on all fours,” I ordered as I tugged her chain, feeling much more comfortable pushing her limits more than I would have otherwise tried, knowing that she was just a magical puppet, indirectly managed by the mysterious woman behind it. </p><p>She growled in anger while Delia tensed in my arms, but neither followed their reaction with an action, obediently accepting my dominance as I dragged them toward a particularly large crimson cushion in the room. </p><p>“You can sit,” I said to Delia even as I grabbed her dress and ripped it off her body. It was already around her waist and wasn’t covering much, but I wanted to get rid of it completely to get an unobstructed view of it. </p><p>[+3000 Experience]</p><p>Since someone had gone through all the trouble of creating it, it would be a pity not to enjoy it properly. </p><p>The warrior growled in anger, only for me to flick her nose. “Bad girl,” I admonished, unable to keep my chuckle down as I saw her anger growing more, treating her like a pet angering her more than anything else I had done. </p><p>I acted like I ignored her growing tenseness as I walked her around the room. It was certainly fun, especially with eye candy like Delia sitting on the cushion, her legs parted open invitingly as she did her best to look seductive. </p><p>Yet, it wasn’t as effective as her skills would have otherwise allowed, because as the warrior tensed angrily at my treatment, so did Delia, showing the nature of the connection between the two. </p><p>And, as I dragged her around, I noticed two important things. First, as I dragged the warrior around the room, the smoothness of her movements was changing slightly. It wasn’t a great degree, one that would have been impossible to detect even with my observational abilities if I hadn’t been looking for it especially. </p><p>Yet, considering there was a noticeable difference even with a simple movement like crawling on all fours, the difference would have been much more intense if the magical puppet was fighting or casting spells. </p><p>More importantly, by using that performance change, I was able to identify the direction of the controller. It was just behind the wall opposite side of the entrance, in the direction where the girls first appeared, quite near to where Delia was currently sitting with her beautiful legs parted, her wet core begging for my attention. </p><p>The second important thing I focused on was the physical differences between Delia and the warrior. </p><p>Or, more accurately, the lack of it. </p><p>Considering they were magical constructs, I would have expected them to look wildly different. It would have been the smart thing to do to distract people from their nature. </p><p>Yet, there was suspiciously little difference between them. The lines of their faces were different, and their blonde hair was in a different shade and model, but that was almost the full extent of it. </p><p>Their naked bodies were suspiciously similar, the warrior was slightly more muscular while Delia had marginally bigger breasts, but that was the full extent of the differences. Examining them, I was almost completely sure that their creator was using her own body as the template.</p><p>I remembered the first time I had seen the princess and her handmaidens. At that time, I assumed it was something to protect her against assassinations through convenient disguises while using it as an excuse to hide an expert among them — an expert that almost successfully robbed the headmistress — but the recent details I had managed to discover certainly threw that into question. </p><p>Maybe they were similar because all of them were magical puppets, constructed from the same mysterious energy. </p><p>And, if that assumption was true, not-Delia was the only one that could create such constructs, and she was behind the wall, controlling the two puppets.</p><p>More importantly, I had a very good guess about her identity. </p><p>“That’s enough walk,” I said suddenly as I dragged the warrior to the large cushion Delia was sitting on. </p><p>It was treason to keep such an exalted member of the royalty waiting…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 35 Experience: 599670 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7140 / 7140 Mana: 8242 / 8750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/130]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I felt tense. </p><p>It was a kind of tenseness that I didn’t face for a while, finding myself facing a mystery that I didn’t expect. </p><p>I didn’t let that distract me, at least not for more than a moment. After all, it didn’t come as a complete surprise. I already knew that I was yet to understand the depth of their trickery, so facing something surprising wasn’t an unexpected occurrence. </p><p>Naturally, I didn’t expect both characters to look at me with the exact same emotional intensity, making it very difficult to identify who was the real not-Delia, and who was copying the other’s expression to look like she had a personal problem with me.</p><p>There was something refreshing about the situation. </p><p>I smirked. It had been a while since I failed to use my sharp perception to discern a situation I found myself in. In a way, it was a fun challenge, especially since I still felt there was no risk of sudden violence — and was confident enough to defend myself if facing such a problem. </p><p>After all, if they wanted to take me down, with everything I had revealed them, they would surely prefer challenging me physically — only to learn I wasn’t as physically deficient as the abilities I revealed first implied.  </p><p>I decided to push them. “It’s good that you know what’s good for you, and decided to follow my orders obediently,” I said as I looked at the warrior, determined to watch her expression to identify which one was one I had been working together with for a while. </p><p>The expression of the warrior flickered into a more intense form of anger at my mention — one that she managed to erase almost immediately — but that didn’t help me to catch their true identity, the same expression appeared on the face of her diplomat version as well, lingering for the exact same time before getting erased. </p><p>My little trick failed, but luckily, I didn’t have only one arrow in my quiver of trickery. I turned my back on them as I walked toward the table, showing my supreme confidence as I grabbed one of the pastries and took a bite — only to get the subtle presence of even more aphrodisiac, triggering my arousal even more. </p><p>Alone, it wouldn’t be more than quickening my heartbeat, but combined with the airborne version, the impact got much stronger, enough to trigger a flame. </p><p>A flame that turned into an inferno thanks to the seductive sight in front of me as they walked toward me. I looked at the warrior, and patted my lap. “Since you decided to be my slave for the day to earn your penance, why don’t you start feeding me,” I suggested as I patted my lap. </p><p>Meanwhile, the figure that was currently disguised as Delia walked behind me, only stopping near one of the pillows to pull a little crystal bottle. “You deserve to relax, after all the trouble she had given you,” she whispered, her voice beautifully seductive, albeit completely artificial. </p><p>On the contrary, the warrior had a more honest expression as she stood in front of me, stiffening reflexively as I put my hand on her beautiful ass, caressing softly. </p><p>She was unable to keep herself from turning toward me, barely able to contain her annoyance. I smirked in satisfaction.  </p><p>Annoying her was fun, but my little move had other benefits than just annoying her.  </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>The rewards toward a new level were certainly welcome, especially since it gave me a chance to gain even more experience, which would improve my Tantric. </p><p>And under the circumstances, improving Tantric certainly had extreme importance, making that improvement as important as other requirements. </p><p>Yet, the real benefit of the casual touches was giving me an excuse to inject some mana. Not knowing their levels and their exact skill distribution, I didn’t dare to inject mana rashly. </p><p>Instead, I let some gather underneath my fingers, a subtle layer that could be easily mistaken for a reflexive reaction. </p><p>That amount of mana was too little to use as a probe even with my control, but I opened my mouth to take a bite of the pastry that the warrior brought to my lips, enjoying its crunchy taste, not worrying about that part. </p><p>Meanwhile, I felt Delia’s hands on my neck, her fingers, covered with massage oil, working on my neck skillfully. </p><p>It wasn’t like I was in a hurry to leave. </p><p>For a while, I maintained my passive state, just enjoying the combined attention my two temporary servants were lavishing on me, each second another second of pleasure. </p><p>As they lavished their — reluctant attention — on me, I could feel my shaft growing. Though the sight of their incredible bodies, enhanced by their Charisma, had a big part in that achievement as well. </p><p>“Let me make you more comfortable,” Delia murmured as she grabbed my shirt as pulled it up, leaving me half naked, which was a more appropriate state under the circumstances. Yet, when she started massaging me once more, it wasn’t just her hands that pressed against my skin. </p><p>It was hard to mistake the certain round softness for anything else, especially when they were covered with massage oil as well. </p><p>It was a daring move, one that couldn’t help but make me feel suspicious about her identity. Just yesterday, she was much more reluctant about physical contact, making me doubt that she was the one I had previously interacted with. </p><p>Yet, as far as I could see, her emotions were not fake. </p><p>[+1500 Experience]</p><p>However, the steady flow of experience I enjoyed thanks to their double treatment was certainly a sufficient reason for me to suffer the mystery of unanswered questions for a few minutes. </p><p>“Well, you have a good point, but it’s not fair to do things halfway, right?” I said, slapping the warrior’s ass loud enough to echo. “Remove my pants.” </p><p>At our level, that much pain barely registered without some magical tricks to enhance its impact, but that didn’t prevent the warrior from avoiding my gaze in a failed attempt to hide her flicker of anger, no doubt not appreciating the indignity. </p><p>It was a nice opportunity to push for a bit more. “Do you have a problem with that,” I said even as I grabbed the chain that was connected to her collar, and flooded it with my mana, tightening the collar around her throat. </p><p>It was an impressive display of magic, but since I was selling myself as a crafting expert from the beginning, it wasn’t surprising enough to display. Interesting, as she caught my gaze, I felt plenty of anger, yet no fear, not even the reflexive kind. </p><p>Which was weird enough to make me struggle to keep a suspicious frown away from my face. Yes, the system provided significant protection thanks to HP, but there were limits to it. </p><p>And, a mage that was holding a magical item connected to their throat, an item that was already designed to restrict the target, was enough to bypass that. </p><p>Especially with the said item already wrapped around the throat. No matter how much one trusted the one on the opposite side, an instinctual fear rose from one’s heart. </p><p>Even Helga felt that flicker whenever we experimented on the rougher side of the bedroom fun, and she trusted me enough to open her whole being to me — that instinctual fear was the only reason bondage was any fun. </p><p>Yet, the warrior in front of me just felt anger and annoyance, and lacked that instinctual fear, like it was impossible for me to hurt her. </p><p>It would be a lie that I wasn’t tempted to tighten the collar and actually follow that implied threat, to see how she would react. Pity doing so would ruin everything I had spent days setting up, so I held myself back. </p><p>And the fact that she followed her flare of uncaring anger by unbuttoning my pants and pulling them down, freeing my shaft from the building pressure certainly helped. </p><p>Then, Delia leaned against my back even harder, her breasts deliciously soft against my muscles, tempting me to forget my anger even without a word. Then, she started whispering. “Please forgive her, she’s a bit wild, but she has good intentions,” she whispered seductively. </p><p>“Well, whether I forgive her disrespect would depend on her performance, and your willingness to cover for your friend, maybe even all the way,” I whispered, yet didn’t receive the expected sudden tensing from her as well. </p><p>Things were getting more interesting. </p><p>While the warrior didn’t care much about the immediate threat to her life, she reacted to the sight of my throbbing shaft much more viscerally. Her eyes widened in shock even as she put her hands on my legs, clearly enjoying the sight despite the tenseness of the moment. </p><p>Distracted by her new view, she missed one important detail. My earlier threat with her collar was just not a show, but also an excuse to inject a great amount of mana into her body, finally allowing me to explore her soul space. </p><p>I was quick to send the first spike, which was not strong enough to break through the fake nature of her soul space. It just gave me a breakdown of her skills and level, which was more interesting than I had expected. </p><p>The lack of a martial skill didn’t surprise me, other than confirming my earlier guess about them not trying to turn that into an ambush halfway in. Instead, more than half of her skills were there to increase her allure, some extremely specific such as dancing and massaging, while others were mostly magical, geared for detection. </p><p>A more passive distribution, one that was designed to keep me happy while making sure I didn’t pull any trickery. </p><p>Smart, but destined to fail due to their assumption that I was an arrogant mage that flaunted his abilities, rather than one that hid most of his tricks. </p><p>The next stab of mana was bigger, one that was formed with the assistance of Tantric to allow me to pass through the false facade much more easily to see her real identity. I wondered whether I would find not-Delia under that, or someone else. </p><p>[+1 Tantric] </p><p>The indirect conclusions were rather inaccurate. </p><p>Yet, when I let that bypass the fake soul-space, I froze for a moment. </p><p>There was no one underneath!</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 34 Experience: 594670 / 595000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6936 / 6936 Mana: 7826 / 8500 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [113/120]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I looked down, capturing the beautiful sight of the topless blonde bending over the desk, her skirt struggling to cover her amazing ass, her red garter belt and stockings adding a nice contrast to make the situation even more legendary. </p><p>As I watched her, I couldn’t help but think that, if every study session had such a beautiful reward in the end, I would have certainly studied more. </p><p>It was certainly superior to cheerleader parties after training. </p><p>“P-punishment,” she stammered, trying to sound afraid, but her acting bad enough to get the worst actress award even in a volunteer theater, her voice colored with arousal. </p><p>“Of course, how else you’re going to learn to be a proper tutor,” I said. She opened her mouth to answer, but before she could do so, my hand landed on her ass, earning a delicious moan. </p><p>I didn’t slap her hard, of course. If it was Sarah under me, I would have spanked her a lot harder, but unlike Sarah, Carrie didn’t enjoy the pain as much as she enjoyed the idea of punishment. “Let’s test your math skills properly,” I whispered as I spanked her ass again. “You have failed to explain real numbers, but at least show me that you know your natural numbers.” </p><p>“O-of course,” she whispered. “How?” </p><p>“Simple,” I said even as I spanked her ass softly again, but I flicked my phone with my other hand and did a quick search. “I’m going to spank you, and you’re going to count until you made a mistake.” </p><p>“T-that’s it,” she whispered. </p><p>“That’s it,” I answered with a smirk. Normally, the challenge of that was to count as the pain of spanking build-up, but I didn’t want to spank her that hard, meaning I needed another difficulty. “But, since you’re a genius, it shouldn’t be hard to count in prime numbers only, right?” I asked. </p><p>Her beautiful gasp was enough to show the difficulty of that, especially since I remember her dismissively mentioning that memorizing prime numbers was just another parlor trick that people did for quiz shows to look intelligent. </p><p>It was my honor to teach her that it was impossible to know what could come useful in different circumstances. </p><p>“Let’s start,” I whispered before I gave her a chance to argue against it, and my hand landed on her beautiful hips, hidden behind her skirt. </p><p>“T-two,” she started as I grabbed her skirt up, and rolled up, revealing her beautiful ass and her sopping wet lips, showing the after-effects of our extended foreplay. Since two was the only even prime number, it was only right for that spank to land on her skirt. </p><p>The others would land on her naked ass. </p><p>“Three, five, seven, e-eleven, thirteen,” she counted rapidly as my hand landed on her ass just as rapidly five times, though none of the hits were hard enough to actually distract her, barely more than soft caresses. I delivered the sixth one just as quick, but this time, her answer was delayed a bit. “S-seventeen,” she whispered. </p><p>I slapped again, this time a touch harder. She gasped, though more of a shock than pain. “Well, there needs to be a punishment for the delays and mistakes, right?” I whispered even as I let my fingers dance at her entrance for a fleeting moment, making it even harder for her to get the next one. </p><p>“T-twenty-three,” she whispered, only to gasp painfully as my hand landed again, this time hard enough to add the sting of pain in her tone.</p><p>“B-but I was fast this time,” she whispered. </p><p>“Yes, but you skipped nineteen,” I answered, my smug sense of victory suffocating my tone. It was exaggerated, of course, but it was hard to argue that the sense of smugness it provided was not negligible. </p><p>Carrie’s moan was soft, yet delicious. </p><p>“N-nineteen,” she whispered when another soft spank landed on her ass. </p><p>“No sweetie,” I whispered even as another spank landed on her bottom, this time on the opposite cheek, spreading the growing pinkness symmetrically. “You need to start from the beginning.” </p><p>Yet, this time, my fingers dipped down into her wetness, caressing it to make her answer even harder. “Two,” she mumbled between her bitten lips, trying to keep her voice contained as my fingers invaded her wetness, but failed spectacularly.  </p><p>I let out a defeated sigh, overdone on purpose. “Better, but try to speak clearer,” I whispered as I spanked her bottom once more. </p><p>“Three,” she continued, louder, but no clearer as her voice started to get invaded by the soft tremble in her tone. </p><p>“Better,” I said as I continued spanking. Though, admittedly, it was hard to qualify them as spanks as she counted rapidly and reached the count of fifties. They were more accurately classified as not-so-soft caresses. </p><p>Yet, just as she was about to reach a hundred, she stumbled once more. “Ninety-three,” she whispered, in a hurry to avoid another spank, only to follow by a gasp before I could spank, realizing her mistake. </p><p>This time, I decided to punish her mistake more viscerally. And, in our current position, there were two ways of escalating. One was to spank her harder, but while it would make it more challenging for her, it wasn’t something she would enjoy. </p><p>Luckily, I thought even as I pushed down my shorts and pressed my shaft against her entrance, that the second option was much more fitting for her preference. </p><p>It was impossible to contain my moan as I slipped into her wetness, but luckily, I wasn’t the only one that was facing that challenge as a matching cry let out of her hips. I impaled her only once, the sound of flesh hitting flesh ringing in the room. “Let’s start again,” I whispered, though my shaft stayed inside. </p><p>“T-two,” she whispered, only for me to impale her again, slapping her core to trigger a delicious moan as the sound of a different kind of slap exploded in the room once again. </p><p>“Three,” she whispered as I leaned forward, my hands firmly on her hips to stabilize, my breath falling on her neck, her body trapped between the desk and my body. “You’re doing much better, go on,” I whispered. “Maybe we should increase the challenge until we reach a thousand and I keep you on the edge as we play, what do you think?” </p><p>The way her body froze, in a manner I would have categorized as fear with erotic undertones, was beautiful, though not as beautiful as her tone. “N-no,” she stammered, her voice split between terror and arousal. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, knowing that it was impossible for her to accurately calculate them without making a simple mistake — not that she would have trouble normally, but forcing her to calculate in her mind while continuously distracting her physically was much different. “But then, we need a different challenge.” </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” she whispered erotically. </p><p>“Well, I start working at a stable pace, and you start counting. If you wait too long, you start again. If you can reach a hundred before you climax, you win, and if you climax first, I win.” </p><p>“And what do I get if I win?” she asked, though the confidence in her tone as she asked surprised me. I decided to keep the pace more aggressive just in case.” </p><p>“What do you want—“ I started, only for her to interrupt rapidly. </p><p>“I want you to seduce Irene and Ida, and do it before Friday,” she answered rapidly, too rapidly for it to be unprepared. “It’s not fair that they are the only ones missing the fun.” </p><p>“Oh, really, two targets,” I said, realizing that she had been baiting me all along. “Unfortunately, it’s not appropriate.” </p><p>“W-why?” she asked, unable to hide her disappointment. </p><p>“Well, it’s unfair for me to ask to seduce both of them with that little bet. If it was counting every prime number until a thousand—“ I continued, only to be interrupted again. </p><p>“Deal,” she said. </p><p>“Really?” I said, suddenly having a sinking feeling about our little bet. “Do you think you can—“ I continued, only to be interrupted. </p><p>“Are you afraid?” she whispered. </p><p>“As you wish,” I chuckled even as I felt stirrings of an unsettling feeling, making me realize that I might have been played even more thoroughly than I had expected. I tightened my grip around her hips and started working on her at a steady yet merciless pace, barely giving her enough time to refresh her breath before she could answer. </p><p>Yet, that didn’t prevent her from counting rapidly. “Two, three, five … forty-three, forty-seven … a hundred and one, a hundred and three …” Just like that, she had easily surpassed a hundred despite my deep invasion. </p><p>“You cheeky minx,” I said, unable to help but mutter in fascinated shock, realizing just how far she had been playing me. Not that the forfeit was not something horrible. On the contrary, I would have done a lot to get her permission in the first place. </p><p>But being tricked was interesting. </p><p>Maybe I should have realized caught onto that. Once her shyness was broken, she was really an interesting bundle of surprises. </p><p>Yet, even as her voice tensed, she rapidly climbed the numbers, two hundred soon reaching five hundred, then eight hundred, though I could feel her voice getting tenser and tenser. Technically, I could still win. All I needed was to let my hands join our little game and tease some of her more sensitive spots, triggering her climax early, but her achievement certainly deserved some respect as she worked on it steadily. </p><p>“Nine-hundred-ninety-seven,” she declared victoriously as she took a deep breath as she twisted her neck. The smug victory invading her face might have looked unattractive on someone else, but it only enhanced her cuteness. </p><p>Especially since she let out a loud cry moments later, filling the room with the amazing signals of her cries, signaling my spectacular defeat as she collapsed against the desk. </p><p>“You win,” I whispered, unable to help my smirk as I found myself on the losing side. </p><p>Well, only technically considering the forfeit, I admitted as I continued impaling her even as I grabbed her arms and pulled her up, not giving her a chance to catch her breath. </p><p>I imagined two beauties, one game-obsessed demure Asian, and one fantasy-obsessed redhead as I pushed deeper and deeper into Carrie… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The combination of the amazing view of her eyes, filled with metaphorical fires of arousal, and her wings, colored with the literal fires of desire, was enough to force me to make a decision that had a high likelihood of being a mistake. </p><p>Yet, sometimes, it was fun to make mistakes. Especially the kind that I was about to make, I decided as I put my hand on the side of her panties, infusing the silver fabric with my mana, stealing her control, with no attempt to even conceal the attempt.</p><p>“Feel free to tell me if you’re too weak to handle the next stage,” I declared recklessly, the unkind warning the only compromise I gave to her before I triggered the transformation of her dress — well, panties — into thin yet effective chains, immediately wrapping around her arms and legs, the strength of the magical silver enough to completely remove her ability to retaliate physically. </p><p>That didn’t mean she was helpless, of course. She still had her magic, and I could hardly block without actually triggering a spectacular battle. Luckily, that was not the only way to pacify an arrogant beauty. “We can stop whenever you want, just tell me if you can’t handle it and want to surrender,” I added, reinforcing the earlier declaration. </p><p>Her lips stayed firmly shut, her pride a stronger prison of the recently formed magical chains. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, while her pride was strong, it was not a defense against her raging arousal, one that reflected in her beautifully parted lips, hardened nipples, and wet core, begging for my touch. When my hand lashed against her breast, the spank exploding even harder on her skin, the gasp she let out was simply wondrous. </p><p>When I next gazed at her, I found her eyes closed, making me wonder whether she wanted to avoid my gaze or she wanted to process her sexy helplessness and vulnerability, completely under my carnal mercy. </p><p>My fingers, gently brushing against her stomach before continuing to go down, managed to receive the answer for that. She shivered helplessly under my fingertips, smart enough to realize the destination of my fingers. </p><p>A destination that was without protection for the first time. </p><p>I felt her tremble more and more as my fingers got closer to her core, one that was followed by a beautiful moan as my fingers circled around her clit, earning a beautiful moan in the process, her pulse getting faster and faster as the flames of her wings intensified. </p><p>Her intense reaction confirmed her lack of experience when it came to touching. She was clearly passionate enough to tease men with her clothing — her silver dress, even in her initial form, was hardly a modest homewear, and the fact that she put that dress on after I had triggered the silent alarm left no doubt about her intention — as it was hardly something that one might wear while working alone. </p><p>I also had no doubt that, even as she made her choice, she had no idea where I wanted to drive things. Even at the moment, she was too preoccupied with the pleasure think about what might follow.</p><p>It was time to teach her about the perils of teasing. </p><p>My fingers circled around her clit slowly while her back arched, displaying her amazing breasts even more prominently. Her eyes flickered open for a second, giving me a taste of embarrassment and arousal hidden underneath before the former proved stronger and they firmly shut once more. </p><p>Not that I needed to see her beautiful eyes to know about her growing arousal. Her growing wetness under my finger was more than enough as an answer. </p><p>For a while, she stayed silent — if one discounted her barely suppressed moans, ones that were slowly getting stronger with each repeat — until her strange reverie was broken by a finger finally slipping into her core. </p><p>“T-that’s too much—“ she started, only to die halfway as I added two more fingers before repeating the earlier impaling motion, replacing her words with a beautiful moan, strong enough to completely bypass her attempts to stay silent. </p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me the great phoenix is too weak to handle a few measly fingers,” I said mockingly as I flared my mana, tightening the grip of the ropes around her limbs, adding a strained quality to her cry. </p><p>I expected that to trigger her pride, so I was surprised when, instead of her responding to the challenge, her moan just intensified, showing that she was busy enjoying the moment.</p><p>“How beautiful,” I murmured, unable to prevent the pleasant surprise from infecting my tone as I let my fingers free to tease her core, rocking back and forth aggressively, each second further enhancing her explosive pleasure. Luckily, the intensity of her flames was an excellent way to display her current level of arousal, making my decision even easier. </p><p> I guided my fingers deeper inside her, enjoying the benefits of the extended foreplay session, one that worked even better than even my wildest, most optimistic expectations while the room got brighter and brighter thanks to the flames of her wings. </p><p>Tempting me to take the next step far sooner than I was planning. I waved my hand, controlling the chains until she was kneeling in front of me, while simultaneously pulling down my pants, revealing my shaft. </p><p>The shock in her eyes as they locked on my shaft was enough to confirm that it was the first one she had ever seen, at least from such a close distance. Her mouth fell open in shock. </p><p>And, never one to miss such an opportunity, I slid forward, invading her beautiful mouth. </p><p>The shock in her gaze was beautiful, though not as beautiful as the follow-up as I grabbed her flaming hair, the flickers of fire tickling my palms — without burning — while I invaded her throat, not giving her any quarter. </p><p>The dazed shock in her beautiful amber eyes as she knelt in front of me was beautiful, like she was having trouble believing that she was not dreaming. Yet, she was yet to rely on her magic to stop me, meaning that she either didn’t want to stop.</p><p>Or, surrendering to my power over her subconsciously, defeated by the unfamiliar nature of her carnal adventure. </p><p>Either way, I was not a man that would take pity on her sudden demureness. I grabbed her head with both hands, no matter how tempting it was to continue caressing her naked body. Yet, stabilizing her head as I recklessly invaded her throat had higher priority, leveraging her momentary indecision to the limit, trying to turn it into an irreversible situation. </p><p>She tilted her head back to accommodate the invasion, though other than shock, she wasn’t showing many signs of physical discomfort. Her physical abilities were as phenomenal as her magical powers. </p><p>I decided to add another layer to our little fun. With a flick of my foot, my boot went flying, leaving my foot naked, and I started rubbing against her core, making her mewl in intensifying pleasure. Her sense of control, already compromised, started to fray even more. </p><p>She let out a loud moan, one intense enough to overcome the suppression effect of her full mouth and echo against the walls. Yet, her own shock at the loudness of her moan was even more beautiful than the moan itself. </p><p>Though, her voice earned that rank back when her body arched back abruptly, with little warning, helpless moans escaping her mouth as she trembled helplessly, turning into delicious moans as an amazing orgasm hit her. </p><p>I pulled back, watching her in utter amazement, shocked by the intensity of her orgasm, almost enough to bring her down. “Wow,” I murmured in fascination even as I waved my hand, directing my mana to flow through the silver chains, creating a beautiful collar to drag her along. </p><p>I walked toward the nearest chair, dragging her along. A ridiculously aggressive decision, risking a deadly battle that would force me to escape helplessly if she realized the indignity she was suffering. </p><p>Luckily, her mind was too addled with pleasure to process the exact details of the situation, allowing me to walk while dragging her along. </p><p> And, it was hard to say that no matter how great the risk, it was unjustified. She was a beautiful woman, one that displayed an amazing potential, and the sight of her on all fours, her wings going between flickering exhaustedly and burning brightly as she followed me obediently was certainly worth the risk I was taking. </p><p>At least, it seemed to be the case at the moment, though I had to admit, that priority might have been affected by the desperate throbbing of my shaft, begging for me to lash out and resolve its great struggle. </p><p>Then, as I took a seat on her fancy chair, turning my gaze to examine her beauty, I realized one thing. </p><p>I was yet to learn her name. “So, sweetie,” I said as I used my empty hand to caress her chin, the other still tugging her chain, enjoying her dazed state as much as possible. “We somehow managed to miss one important detail. You still hadn’t shared your beautiful name with me.” </p><p>“I-it’s not important,” she answered rapidly, suddenly feeling ashamed and self-conscious at the question, which was a great achievement considering her current state. </p><p>Under different circumstances, I wouldn’t have dared to push her for the question, but her current state was in an excellent mood. </p><p>“I expect a prompt answer when I ask a question,” I reminded her as I tugged her chain, just enough to send a jolt of pain. </p><p>“Ci—“ she started reluctantly, only to be interrupted halfway. I turned my gaze to her, once again sharp, forcing the answer out. “Cinder,” she whispered, the shame radiating her tone even as her wings lost their brightness more, confirming that she didn’t miss the irony of her name, an irony that was clearly intentional. </p><p>Maybe I should explore its origins more. Or maybe not?</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>After three days filled with dangerous adventures, exhausting training, and mind-numbingly detailed yet boring hacking, I threw myself to my bed the moment I arrived at my room, barely able to kick my jeans off, glad that I had already showered after the training. </p><p>It was a miracle I didn’t fall asleep while driving. </p><p>Yet, even as I felt the comfortable hug of my bed, I knew that I wouldn’t have enough time to sleep properly, especially since I had to wake up at six, to arrive at the morning training that would start at six-thirty. </p><p>Of course, eight hours wasn’t exactly the worst sleep schedule one could imagine, but it was not enough after the intense training I had just gone through, my body still hurting after all that tackling. </p><p>Properly earning a place on the team was fun, but that didn’t make the repeated full-speed tackles fun by any measure. There was a reason that they recommended professional athletes to sleep almost ten hours a day — though most preferred to take naps during the afternoon to compensate, not wanting to ruin their social life. </p><p>From that perspective, combined with the sudden intensity of the training, eight hours would certainly be not enough to feel rested even if I hadn’t been skipping sleep the last few days to juggle what I had found me facing… </p><p>From fake girlfriends to magical cults.  </p><p>So, it was understandable that, when I was woken up by the ringing of my phone rather than by the alarm I expected, I had a curse word on my lips. Especially since it was a number I didn’t recognize.  </p><p>Only to forcibly swallow that anger when I recognized the voice. “Be in the stadium in fifteen minutes for extra training,” said Coach Bill, while I was busy with some of the more creative insults that appeared in my mind. No apology for calling so early that it still qualified as night, no attempts to explain his reasoning, not even bothering why he decided to add a training at the last moment. </p><p>“Fuck you, you old goat,” I growled, but only after the coach slammed the call shut, not even bothering to wait for my response. I didn’t think of myself as a coward, but I was certainly not brave enough to challenge Coach Bill like that. </p><p>Still, at that moment, I could appreciate why people really hated the old-school coaches even when they were successful. They were still under the impression that they were generals, and the athletes were nothing more than poor little soldiers, expecting their orders to be fulfilled. </p><p>Normally, I had no problem with that — well, not a big one, at least. Compared to the incompetent assholes like Coach Spencer who thought that being liked by the athletes was the most important issue, I much preferred winning, but it was hard to maintain that attitude when I was forced to wake up before five for extra early training. </p><p>Of course, technically, it was not a binary choice, and there were some young and modern coaches with the correct attitude and skills. Unfortunately, those talents were rare, and rarely would work in a third-rate college which would ruin their future opportunities. </p><p>The considerations about the potential difference between coaches were enough to keep my mind occupied as I drove to the stadium hurriedly, doing my best to be equally quick. I had no idea who was going to be my coach for the additional training, but I was very doubtful that he would appreciate the sudden extra training any more than I would. </p><p>No need to annoy him more by being late. </p><p>But, when I arrived at the gym, I found a familiar face waiting for me. “Good morning, Coach,” I said even as I waved at the Latina woman that was dressed in loose sports clothing. </p><p>“You’re late,” she answered, not bothering to hide her frustration. </p><p>“Sorry Coach, won’t happen again,” I answered, happy to see her anger fade a bit. Accepting responsibility for the delay was a risky choice, especially considering I had been informed about the training so late, but after a full day of training, I had a sense of her personality, and guessed she wouldn’t appreciate excuses.</p><p>Even if they were accurate ones. </p><p>“The coach asked me to manage your remedial training,” she said, her voice sharp like a whip, challenging. “We’re going to have two sessions, one before the morning training, and one after the evening training, to make sure your tackling technique and footwork are up to par. For the rest of the week, we’re going to skip the strength and endurance portions, and focus on technique.”</p><p>“Yes, Coach,” I said, swallowing my questions about the absurdity of the situation. I wasn’t exactly an expert on sports health, but I knew enough to know that this training was certainly not recommended, especially during the tournament season. </p><p>I might have assumed it was just a misconception of an old, outdated coach, but Coach Bill was too successful for that to be the case even in such a dysfunctional situation. Combined with the surprise early morning call, it started to feel like a test. </p><p>Not that it mattered, I thought even as I followed Coach Juana to the center of the room. Whether it was some kind of test or a mistaken perspective about the benefits of Spartan training, I didn’t have the power to push back against Coach Bill. </p><p>It was a task even the head coach failed to do so. </p><p>I followed Coach Juana outside, doing my best to ignore the cold winter wind, even worse than the day before at this early hour, biting my lips to hold back a question about whose decision was to work outside at this ungodly hour. Because I knew that, regardless of the answer, Coach Juana would take it as an insult to her authority.  </p><p>“Let’s start with some ladder exercises,” Coach Juana ordered as she gestured the yellow ladder on the ground, and I completed some basic footwork exercises as she occasionally shouted corrections. </p><p>“Good, much better than our previous training,” she said, though, I noticed a frown on her face. “Don’t tell me that you were holding back in our training.” </p><p>Her frown was not undeserved. The benefits of Agility Trait were not exactly easy to be dismissed. The jump between our previous day would have been noticeable. It had to qualify agility like other physical attributes like strength or speed, but the difference was enough to be noticed even by an amateur, let alone a professional. </p><p>“Of course not, Coach,” I answered. “However, it has been a while since I had trained my footwork, and I’m just warming up. I’m sure I’ll be even better by the next week.” </p><p>“Good, work hard, and don’t waste my morning,” she said. “Show me that I didn’t volunteer to train you for nothing.” </p><p>Interesting, I noted as I repeated the same exercise pattern. I had expected her to be assigned just because a junior, and if someone needed to wake up early, she was a good candidate. But her volunteering came as a surprise. </p><p>Though, not too much of a surprise considering the earlier training she had given me. She was clearly trying to penetrate more relevant aspects of football coaching, and an official training assignment by the defensive coordinator was a good opportunity to show off. </p><p>Even if that training happened in a frozen tundra, during an hour that was abandoned by the gods. </p><p>“Faster!” she shouted. “And try to keep your weight centered, you can’t commit a turn that early.” </p><p>“Yes, coach,” I answered, focusing on the training, doing my best to ignore the freezing cold. After all, it was uncomfortable, but it was clearly not as bad as the cursed fires I might suffer if I started slacking off.  </p><p>Luckily, even with the limited sleep, Stamina and Recovery kept me in a reasonable condition, allowing me to push myself hard, and still have some strength for the rest of the training. “Enough,” she called. “Enough, take five before the training starts,” she said. </p><p>I just nodded, and we started walking inside, and I did my best to ignore the sway of her hips, noticeably swaying even in her thick parka and loose sweatpants. </p><p>She was really beautiful, and a smarmy voice that rang in the corridor showed that I wasn’t the only one that noticed it. </p><p>“There’s my favorite conditioning assistant,” said a male voice. I would have loved to dismiss those words, annoyed by the interruption, but the identity of the person that interrupted it made it much more difficult. </p><p>Head Coach Spencer. </p><p>“Good morning, sir,” she greeted, her tone calm on the surface, but I didn’t miss the subtle tenseness of her tone. Nor did I miss the slight quickening of her steps. After combining that with the soft, smarmy tone Coach Spencer used, a clear picture emerged. </p><p>“How are you on this amazing morning?” Spencer said with a greasy smile that he no doubt thought as charming, but only came as entitled. His blind willfulness as he decisively ignored her body language hardly helped the impression. </p><p>And her body language was really hard to mistake for anything else, with her distracted frown, her arms carefully folded over her chest to further reduce the impact of her bosom while giving a defensive aura. </p><p>Her gaze wandered over the room, no doubt hoping to find an excuse, but the empty corridor didn’t provide her with any. So, her gaze fell on me. “I’m fine, coach, but I’m with a player. We are busy with some extra training before the game.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about the game, this time, it’s a sure win,” he commented with confidence that was unwarranted by the performance of the team. Then, his gaze fell on me. His eyes widened in surprise, showing only then he registered my identity. </p><p>The new backup player who had just humiliated his star running back in front of him. </p><p>“Especially since we have such a great new talent helping us,” he added, the vindictiveness in his tone showing he had not only remembered the event, but also didn’t appreciate it. </p><p>I barely held back a curse. Just when I was hoping that he might ignore the fact that I had humiliated his backup quarterback. </p><p>Fun. </p><p>“You should go prepare for actual training,” he said, his gaze sharp. “I have important things to discuss with Juana.” </p><p>“Yes, coach,” I said, doing my best to hold my tongue, aware that even Coach Bill’s protection had limits, especially since I was a backup player. </p><p>I walked away, but before I could take my turn, he continued speaking. “So, Juana, did you reconsider my offer to join the offensive team as a receiver coach?” he said, though her expression of dismissal made the answer obvious. </p><p>I ignored it continuing to the training arena. I had too many things to care about to involve myself in such a dispute. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Xia didn’t waste any time before dashing to her destination, carrying the remaining dragon hearts with her, I slipped into a back alley before climbing to the roof of the nearest building. </p><p>Trying to walk around the roofs of a bustling city without any illusion spells to assist the concealment was supposed to be impossible, but, luckily, my transformation was not completely negative. Even with the limited effects of the transformation while the scales were suppressed, my physical abilities had been elevated to a shocking level. </p><p>Giving me the speed and flexibility to allow me to dash through the roofs with a shocking speed, the gaps easily covered through a leap. </p><p>My destination was the houses that I had discovered during my walks around the city with excessive protective wards, marking them as belonging to important families and organizations. One of the advantages of living in the city for several weeks as a Sorcerer, it allowed me to discover otherwise ordinary buildings covered with wards with great ease — and a few that I missed had been revealed to me by Theodora. </p><p>After that, it didn’t take much to identify which houses belonged to the families and organizations strong enough to defy House Junia, at least for a couple days. It might have been if I was looking for an organization to defy them permanently, but finding the ones overestimating their abilities under the effect of their greed to keep a Patrician weapon…</p><p>That was much easier.</p><p>For fifteen minutes, I run over the roofs, carefully spreading the Patrician weapons I had acquired by pushing them through the wards, their spell resistance turning into a benefit to accomplish that easily, their weight enough to complete the process. It was something that could only be done by Patrician Weapons. Without their amazing magical abilities, the process would have ruined them completely. </p><p>Then, I walked away, curious about how long it would take for the Agents of House Junia to discover the fate of those weapons, and how many of those houses would reject the order for their bases to be searched, to give up the treasure that literally fell from the sky into their treasure. </p><p>Greed was a useful trait. </p><p>Without these weapons to weigh me down — except the three weapons, the bow, the sword, and the spear, that somehow resonated with me — I was much faster. Which was good, because several alarms were already ringing across the city, while the guards walked around with their weapons drawn, ordering people to go back into their houses, declaring an emergency. </p><p>At a distance, I could see the rest of the guards gathering around the gates and barring them close. Luckily, I already had a plan to get away that didn’t include the gates, I thought even as I changed my direction toward Ludus Dacius, the School that had been my home and my prison for the last few weeks. </p><p>I still had a mount to acquire.</p><p>Luckily, while the guards walked around, the citizens didn’t just obediently walk inside but argued with the guards — it wasn’t just the noble residents of Rome that were arrogant — and the chaos they created allowed me to travel without being noticed. </p><p>The first undercurrents of chaos started to appear before I could arrive at my destination. More than one group of warriors and bodyguards on the move, with their weapons drawn, and a surprising number of wards were being constructed around me — they tried to keep those wards hidden, but to my newly enhanced senses, hiding such activities was near impossible to even on the distance. </p><p>Like a true storm, it was yet to declare its presence by a showy signal, but to a professional eye, the smothering pressure was already there. </p><p>And like a true undercurrent, it was ready to pull anyone that dared to underestimate it. </p><p>Yet, it didn’t take long for those undercurrents to turn into waves and reach my destination before me. When I arrived at the entrance of the Dacian School, a group of nobles were already there, gathered in three different groups, each staying away from the others, clamoring to meet with Master Antonius. </p><p>“How dare you bar our way, you slave,” growled one of them. “I’m a senator of Rome, and I can walk wherever I want. If I want to talk to a dirty slave trader, I will.”</p><p>Despite the importance of time, I couldn’t help but shake my head despondently for a second. Sometimes, I was shocked by the arrogance of the nobles, and no matter how much I got exposed, they always found new ways to surprise me. </p><p>The shouting senator was a good example. He was right that, technically, as a member of the senate, he deserved respect. Unfortunately, not only he was just a Quaestor, which was the lowest official active politician rank, but he was also an ex-Quaestor, which was literally the lowest rank of the Senate, only there as a seat filler. </p><p>And, his advanced age implied that he certainly had no chance of climbing above that rank. </p><p>His attitude gave me a reason to guess why. Yet, gladiators were slaves, but everyone knew that they wore their identity as a badge of honor, and saw themselves above other slaves — and behind closed doors, even other Romans. </p><p>That old man was clearly there to hire some gladiators in an emergency, yet he decided to start his negotiations with grave insults. </p><p>No wonder they were still keeping him at the door. </p><p>Meanwhile, a few others were already being led to the main courtyard, several servants hurriedly carrying chairs, and spreading them in a half circle. One that I recognized as an improvised auction. </p><p>Everyone was trying to shore their defenses hurriedly at the sudden appearance of that many weapons. Well trained and available, the gladiators were clearly the best option, which gave the schools a huge chance to profit. </p><p>Too bad I had no intention of letting Antonius profit from that. </p><p>Not after he sold me out despite all the benefits I brought. </p><p>Of course, I was never one obsessed with revenge, and loved to wait for the opportunities. If  I didn’t have another reason for being there, I might have not bothered to find him to increase the risk I was facing. </p><p>But since I was there, there was no point in rejecting the opportunity just because it would give me a few seconds of delay. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the presence of Spear of Scipio on my back, giving me all the confidence I needed to fight against a Sorcerer even without my magic — to get away if not to kill — I might have tried to skulk around the courtyard and discover his location. </p><p>Instead, the moment I slipped inside the building, I walked toward one of the servants, about to say that I was summoned. </p><p>The servant was faster. “Why are you walking around!” the servant exclaimed. “Master has the strict orders to escort you to him the moment you arrived. The gate guards were supposed to lead you there immediately.” </p><p>“They are busy with a senator,” I said, smirking sharply. It seemed that my so-called master was already impatient about his meeting with Pluto. “Why don’t you bring me to him instead.” </p><p>The servant nodded and started walking, though his destination surprised me. He was leading me toward the stables rather than his office. </p><p>Interesting, I thought, though my surprise hardly lessened when the servant brought me to our destination, only to meet with a shocking crowd in the stable. There were about three dozen people in the room, most of them with already weapons were drawn. A crowd that included both Antonius and Marcus. </p><p>I would have assumed it to be an ambush, if it wasn’t for the fact that those weapons were already pointing at each other. </p><p>“… I’ll be the one that buys it, Harpax. How dare you challenge me here, when I’m under master’s orders?” said an old, skinny man.  </p><p>“Simple, it’ll belong to one that pays the most,” Harpax answered smugly. “After all—“ he tried to continue, only to be interrupted. </p><p>It was Marcus that interrupted him. “The slave is finally here,” he shouted in anger as he looked at the doorway. “You pushed your luck too much, you worthless worm,” he shouted as he walked forward, his sword drawn. </p><p>Someone was impatient to take Antonius’ place in the line, it seemed. Luckily, I thought as my smirk widened, Marcus was just as responsible for my situation as Antonius. </p><p>All that remained was educating them about that…</p>",

    "content": "<p>After I left the tower, I didn’t waste any time resting and moved to my next target. </p><p>My destination, the temporary Royal Quarters, to enjoy the apology breakfast that was promised — well, promised was a rather liberal description of what had happened.</p><p>The more accurate definition was to say the one I extorted after not-Delia’s poorly thought-out revenge attempt, thinking that her amazing concealment would hide the truth behind her transformation — which, admittedly, was not a bad assumption. Even with all my advantages, I had barely managed to discover the truth behind her disguise and her fake skills, an achievement that relied on a lot of luck.  </p><p>Though, her fake skills were the reason I let the System absorb a decent portion of the Divine Spark I had managed to steal from the headmistress, preparing myself for the experience I was about to receive. Of course, whether their fake skills would be high enough to trigger was a guess, but I was rather confident in the guess I was making. </p><p>I didn’t keep the rest of the Divine Spark in the storage either. I purified that through Tantric — a process that had gotten much faster now that I understood the principles behind it, absorbing the transformed Divine Spark, empowering myself. It was not very noticeable, eclipsed by the System, but I still liked the security of having a backup.  </p><p>I walked slow enough that, when I arrived in front of the Royal Quarters, the job was already complete. </p><p>The guards opened the door before I even talked with them, bowing to me respectfully as I stepped inside silently, their bows exaggerated enough to make a clueless observer think that another member of the Royal family was visiting. Such a bow was certainly inappropriate to the point of counting as treason — but I doubted the princess would care much considering she was in the middle of a civil war, only lacking an official declaration.</p><p>Once again, a maid led me toward the familiar room, but this time, the maid was wearing a modified uniform, much more revealing than their usual outfit, creating an impressive view as her hips swayed with each step. </p><p>A small yet carefully thought little touch to put me in the mood, one that I had no problems enjoying even though I was constructing a spell simultaneously. Dealing with the great change in their attitude was fun, and the implication that they would comply with my demands rather than do something more aggressive was rather obvious. </p><p>Yet it was better safe than sorry, especially since it might easily be a trick from them to make me drop my alertness. Not to mention, with their mysterious abilities challenging my detection capabilities, the need was very clear. Especially if they had some offensive techniques to match their disguise. </p><p>Though, hopefully, they were lacking in that aspect. </p><p>The maid had led me to the same room I had enjoyed the experience of being hosted for my previous breakfast, yet, this time, it was decorated much differently. The large table was still in place, filled with an even greater number of delicious-smelling delicacies, but everything else was different. The elegant furniture was gone, replaced with huge satin pillows, thin silk curtains, soft smelling incenses, everything in tones of red and purple. </p><p>Yet, as the maid closed the door behind me, I turned my attention to the smell of the room, a soft, beautiful incense that sent stirrings inside me. A stirring that was suspiciously strong, but luckily, my healing abilities were up to the task of analyzing its nature. </p><p>It was an interesting concoction, I decided as I examined it. Despite its nature to manipulate the body, it didn’t trigger the innate resistance given by the Endurance. Understanding the reason for that didn’t take long, as rather than trying to infect the body directly, it was replicating an external pheromone, letting the body react naturally to give the response it would, only exaggeratedly. </p><p>It was a good technique, one that had interested implications to be used as a poison, which would have bypassed the biggest reason for their relative rarity — the natural resistance of Endurance. Unfortunately, I realized after I analyzed the concoction a few seconds more, using the accelerated thinking provided by my stats, that even the fastest impact would have been measured in weeks and months rather than hours and days…</p><p>Which meant it was more or less useless for me. </p><p>Then, someone stepped behind the curtains, her body swaying as she walked. Delia, or at least that was her identity visually, but I needed physical contact to make sure whether that was actually the case. </p><p>Luckily, with the way she dressed — and not dressed — a few subtle touches were certainly on the table. </p><p>She wore a beautiful silk dress, the skirt long enough to reach the floor, and the topside wasn’t exactly daintier. </p><p>[+500 Experience] </p><p>Yet, the sudden notification suggested two things, though only one was new information. The new information aspect was related to her power level. It told me that she once again chose a configuration with a higher level, with some interesting implications about her objectives. She clearly didn’t just want to earn my forgiveness, but leverage the opportunity for something more. </p><p>The truth behind that objective, only time would tell. </p><p>The second part of the information, one that wasn’t a surprise, was related to the supposed modesty of her beautiful silk dress. After all, it didn’t really matter how much skin the fabric covered, not when it lacked substance enough to reveal everything that lay underneath, not hiding the slightest. </p><p>Things that her dress failed to hide included the level of arousal she was feeling, both her wetness and the hardness of her nipples showing it excellently. It was excessive even under the circumstances, suggesting that she didn’t have a counter for the aphrodisiac she had set up for me. </p><p>How amusing, I thought even as I caught her gaze, enjoying her intense blush. </p><p>She might have been being supported by the System to an impressive degree thanks to her fake skills, but her blush clearly showed that it wasn’t enough to resist the combination of my charm and her trick. </p><p>Certainly not when she still had the amazing memories I had left her with the previous time. </p><p>“Welcome back to my modest room,” she said, her voice smooth and seductive enough to stir my heart — confirming that at least one of the skills she had chosen was related to her acting capabilities. Both her tone and attitude were too perfect to be natural.  </p><p>Yet, her skills were not enough to hide the flicker of frustration as she looked at me, confirming her identity as not-Delia without needing to touch her — albeit an interesting way to identify her, suggesting that it was well past the time I discovered her identity. </p><p>How entertaining, I thought as I prepared myself for an entertaining struggle. Yet, as much as it would be fun to play with not-Delia, it wasn’t the only objective I had. I wanted to meet with another member of their little royal band of tricksters. </p><p>Dealing with the second one and comparing her capabilities with not-Delia would allow me to get a better understanding of the trick they were trying to pull under the circumstances. It would at least show me whether two could use their skill trick and disguise trick at the same time, a knowledge that would have a significant impact on my future strategies. </p><p>So, no matter how beautiful not-Delia looked in her Delia disguise, I turned toward the second figure that stepped from behind another thick curtain. </p><p>Outwardly, it was the same woman that had kicked me around the training room repeatedly, her body giving the same oppressive aura, her face contorted in frustration and anger, all enough to make me think that she was the same person. </p><p>The way she dressed was radically different than Delia, wearing scraps that were barely worthy of a slave. Two scraps of fabric, one wrapped around her waist, one around her chest, but neither piece was large enough to cover the area they were supposed to be covering — and that was before several strategic rips that further compromised its ability to hide her beautiful assets. </p><p>Of course, while they looked like scraps at the first glance, they were still made from very expensive magical silk. </p><p>Yet, the more impressive part of her outfit was not the fabrics, but the chain, connected to a collar on her neck, further increasing her impression of submissiveness, ready to be grabbed and dragged around, and the magic that was spreading from that item was strong enough to give some trouble to a high-leveled warrior. </p><p>And, she was certainly high-leveled, as the notification I received as I looked at her confirmed that conclusion.</p><p>[+500 Experience] </p><p>The notification was welcome and threatening at the same time. If it wasn’t for her smooth, seductive walk, suggesting at a considerable portion of her impressive level had been occupied by seduction abilities and Charisma, I would have been actually afraid, considering the possibility of an ambush. </p><p>Still, there was no harm in being cautious. Before I turned my gaze to catch her expression, I let a strand of my magic spread around the room, assessing the wards again, only to find nothing out of ordinary. The only thing that could be classified as out-of-ordinary was the several layers of isolation wards, making sure no one would be able to observe the room from outside. Yet, from inside, all it would take was a flex of my mana to successfully break it. </p><p>It seemed that there was no treachery waiting for me — at least, no direct one, as I certainly had many doubts about the mission they were trying to foist on me. </p><p>I smirked as I looked at the eyes of the warrior beauty, expecting to find frustration. Yet, even as I met her gaze, I found a familiar kind of frustration and arousal mixing. Too familiar. </p><p>It was the exact same impression the beauty next to her was wearing, implying that their secrets were even deeper than I expected.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 34 Experience: 592170 / 595000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6936 / 6936 Mana: 7826 / 8500 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [112/120]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>While I created the storage the headmistress requested I had a tense expression, and that was not just a fake expression I wore to trick her about the difficulty of the challenge.</p><p>I wanted to mislead her, but that was not the reason for my true tenseness. I was tense because, even at the moment, I wasn't entirely sure the path I had chosen was the right one, and I revealed the correct level of information to her. </p><p>As I created the storage, the mana I used to construct it carried little Tantric mana. </p><p>Or, more accurately, it didn't carry the Tantric effect. It was hard to describe the effect of Tantric on mana, because it didn't work like the other natures, like elemental or arcana,  which just transformed the pure mana into corresponding nature directly.  </p><p>It took me a long time to understand but Tantric didn't just transform but somehow elevated the intensity of mana — though even that was an inaccurate definition, just the best way I was able to pin the process down. </p><p>It was not just a merger like one achieved by merging light and elemental magics.  That process, while being extremely explosive, was much easier to understand. It was just that merging different natures, requiring a lot of power to suppress the necessary conflict between them.</p><p>Different natures, but the same hierarchy of existence. </p><p>The hierarchy of existence was certainly a difficult concept, but one that I wasn't sure I understood correctly. I certainly didn't remember reading it in a book or talking to someone about such a concept. Of course, such instinctual understanding was not entirely unfamiliar. I had received many skills, and every single one of them came bundled with such deep and integrated understanding.</p><p>And, that left me with another interesting conundrum. Which skill was responsible for that information?</p><p>I was inclined to believe that it was Tantric responsible for this portion. </p><p>After all, not only it was about how Tantric was different from other skills — a fact that was getting clear more and more as time passed – but also that realization came after I have just improved Tantric twice in a row, making it my first grandmaster skill. So, assuming Tantric was the origin of that information was reasonable.</p><p>However, under the circumstances, assuming something was true because it was reasonable and fit together well with other circumstantial evidence might be dangerous, leading me to a tunnel of misunderstanding. </p><p>After all, we were living in an apocalyptic world that was built over ruins of a battle that included gods in destroyed planes.</p><p>Logic was not a rule but a luxury.</p><p>Luckily, identifying the source of that scrap of information was not exactly a priority with everything going on. </p><p>And, deciding on where Tantric fell under this hierarchy was much easier. It was clearly higher than ordinary mana, and belonged to some group as the divine spark. And even, considering its great effect on the divine spark, even on that scale, it clearly ranked high. </p><p>Though, if I asked the headmistress, I had a feeling that I would receive a different classification.</p><p>I still remembered her calling the presumed source of the fake companion node I created to trick her as the Degenerate — though, whether she was referring to another user like me or someone that might be compared to her God needed to be clarified.</p><p>Ultimately, lack of information was the problem I faced constantly, making it difficult decision whether to reveal the full extent of Tantric's effects or keep it hidden.</p><p>So, I decided to play it conservatively. I used only a minuscule amount of Tantric effect as I created the storage, just enough to contain the divine spark successfully while also adding a subtle calming effect, but nothing else. Because, ultimately, it was better to be on the safe side when it came to such matters, especially when dealing with someone like the headmistress, who was yet to earn the privilege of my trust.</p><p>Still, even if the effect was subdued compared to its full potential, it was a great improvement over the last display, enough to show that, without a doubt, my mana was superior when it came to containing the divine spark.  </p><p>And, while my mind was busy with the tangent of Tantric and how it compared to other mana natures and divine sparks, the headmistress was busy examining the effects of my storage, making a note of the improvement. Seeing the expression of astonishment on her face, impossible to be hidden despite her best efforts — not that her best efforts were particularly difficult to unravel when it come to subterfuge — suggesting that, even my conservative choice was already pushing the limits of credibility. </p><p>Dealing with the divine spark might be even harder than I had assumed despite my best efforts to put a safety margin on the concept. </p><p>“How…” she murmured as she continued to examine the storage, poking with her own to get a better sense of what was going on, only to fail spectacularly. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised by her failure to understand its source. I was the one that cast the spell, which gave me a considerably better insight into the process behind it, and even then, it took several hours of repeated experimentation to understand the reason for the Divine Spark’s reaction. </p><p>When she glanced at me, her suspicion was clear, but unlike the previous time, I was more prepared for that. “Any idea why it’s able to contain it successfully this ?” I asked, throwing the problem back to her, like it was something I expected her to know. </p><p>“Probably a unique reaction as the power of the Divine Spark is getting settled on your body,” she said, trying to sound certain, but she was not a sufficiently good liar to reflect that — or the fact that she was trying to mislead me intentionally. </p><p>“Really, then Titania should be able to do it as well?” I asked, doing my best to hide my smirk as I poked a hole in her explanation. </p><p>“Not … not really,” she answered, her speech slower as she tried to get herself time to find an explanation. “She’s not as good when it comes to wards and crafting,” she added quickly. </p><p>“If you say so,” I answered with a shrug, amused that she chose to explain that way rather than spinning something about the interaction between my companion node and the new one. It would have been much more believable as an excuse. </p><p>It would have been much closer to the truth as well, but that was not really the issue. I was more interested in the fact that she just ignored the possibility of assistance from the companion node, like it was not even possible. </p><p>Admittedly, even for me, it took a while to accept that Tantric had such potential, and unlike her, I already knew that Tantric was the gateway to many suspicious things, from helping others to increasing their level cap to giving more experience in addition to other, more mundane impact like a more fun time in bed and helping transfer mana more easily… </p><p>“Still, we need to study it more to make sure we understand its full implications,” she said, trying to look disinterested, only to fail miserably.</p><p>Trying to look casually disinterested was one of the things that inexperienced people fail miserably at, mostly because they misunderstood the complexity behind such a trick. That were many simple components to it, from how one positioned their hands to where their gaze pointed. They thought they knew, but the truth…</p><p>The hands were usually defined by a lack of action, standing unnaturally still at their sides or being busy with a trinket. The eyes, on the other hand, were either unnaturally still as they maintained eye contact lingering to the point of discomfort, or avoided that connection in the first place.</p><p>To her credit, the headmistress managed to show all these traits at the same time despite the supposedly contrasting nature of those moves, cycling through them with great speed.</p><p>It was amusing to see her relative competence of Subterfuge — at least one discounted the time she required to develop that — had fallen into pieces completely when she tried to tell a lie.</p><p>That, she clearly used very little in her long tenure.</p><p>How amusing…</p><p>“Try to create a storage in your finger,” she ordered, her explanation once again brief but her expression tight with concentration, unaware that she gave me another little decision challenge, especially with her deliberate wording. Creating mana storage inside a living being was significantly more difficult than doing it externally, and the cost of failure was much higher. </p><p>I was already using that trick for a long time, of course, but that didn’t mean it was safe to reveal that to her. Yet, looking at her enthusiastic expression, I decided to show her I could do it. </p><p>After all, it was what she needed to solve her problem, and the casualness of her question — one that I could read as genuine — showed that she expected me to succeed, making it a safe choice.</p><p>[-931 Mana]</p><p>“Here,” I said as I pointed my hand to her, and she channeled her magic through it, storing some Divine Spark inside. Pity I couldn’t just take it and leave, as consuming it would have been suspicious. </p><p>I let it go after five minutes, giving her sufficient time to observe. “Sounds simple enough,” I answered. </p><p>“Good, now to the next task,” she said, her voice colored with enthusiasm, which was incredible considering her usual subdued emotions.  </p><p>“Whatever you wish to do, I have nothing else important to address other than paying another visit to Janelor, she asked me to bring breakfast, but if you’re okay with me delaying that…” I said, doing my best to sound casual. It was not true, of course, as rather than visiting Janelor, I wanted to go and dig the little secrets of the princess — the team that was spying on Marianne and Titania was enough to show that was more urgent than I expected. </p><p>Yet, it was clearly not something she would care about. Such political tricks were dangerous, but if there was one thing the deadly undead attack taught me, that the headmistress was too passive against the threats that the school faced. Even if she didn’t want to act, she had many tools she could have leveraged before Zokras and his merry band of undead could become a threat too difficult to handle. Only sheer luck — in my peculiar form — prevented Silver Spire from getting terribly damaged. </p><p>I had no reason to believe she would be more proactive against the growing political threat. Luckily, I had Janelor as the excuse to act however I wished. And, right now, I deliberately wanted to leave after showing her that my little storage trick was more effective than she expected. </p><p>“No, don’t delay that!” she said, her panic clear. After all, my storage trick was only a possible solution to her problems, and until she could make sure that it worked, she wouldn’t dare to make Janelor unhappy. “Go and handle her, then come back.” </p><p>“As you wish, milady,” I bowed, giving a little obedient bow, my mind already busy on how to leverage my newfound leverage… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 34 Experience: 591170 / 595000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6936 / 6936 Mana: 8163 / 8500 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [112/120]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The challenge of studying with Carrie didn’t reduce the slightest as I finished writing the first draft of my essay and passed it to her to give feedback and moved on to my next task, my physics homework. </p><p>It wasn’t that she didn’t help. She certainly did, whispering an accurate explanation whenever I got stuck in a question. And her explanations were impeccable, not only helping me to solve the question accurately, but also deepening my understanding of the topic, visibly improving my performance. </p><p>I didn’t instantly turn into a straight-A student, of course, but I had a feeling that, if she continued like that, the first year of college would be much smoother than I expected, allowing me to dedicate myself to my training fully rather than splitting my attention. </p><p>Though, I had another thought, one that I didn’t verbalize to her yet, fearing the implications of such a question. Maybe I should convince her to attend a college in the same city, or even the same college. After all, the college I was going to, in addition to having a competitive football team, was also good enough to be on the upper parts of the list of Ivy League colleges. </p><p>Technically, there were better schools for football I could go to, but that was the only one my father found acceptable, and since his reasons were good, I was unable to argue. He reasonably pointed out that, even for the best recruits, a professional career was only a possibility, and the school had an amazing business school I would attend simultaneously — the same one that my father had graduated from —  so that I would have a strong fallback option in case of failure.  </p><p>And as much as I wanted to be a professional player, I was aware that the odds were not on my side.  </p><p>Yet, as Carrie whispered some more important physics facts to my ear, I focused on the present and turned my attention to her. Carrie didn’t mention anything about her destination college, but I had a feeling that, a student of her caliber, she had already received her acceptance letter in the first recruitment round. </p><p>I ignored the topic as I let my pen dance on the paper as Carrie squeezed my shoulders once more while asking a question. “Do you have any other homework?” she asked. </p><p>“No, that’s the last of them,” I said. “Then, we can —“ I started, only to gasp as her fingers dug into my shoulders warningly. It wasn’t enough to leave a mark, but it was enough to silence me. </p><p>“Then we can do some free studying,” she whispered. “We need to make sure your algebra is up to par for the finals.” </p><p>Under normal circumstances, I would have rejected the idea of free study, especially after finishing three assignments in one sitting. But it was miraculous just how much my mind could be changed by the weight of a certain part of her anatomy pressing against my back, moving up and down… </p><p>“Whatever you planned for me, ma’am,” I whispered, doing my best to sound respectful, but it was impossible to restrain the heat in my tone, not with every time she lowered herself, a certain part of my anatomy doing its best to drill through my basketball shorts, denying their baggy nature. </p><p>As I was about to open the workbook, however, she pulled back, and after a slight shuffle, no doubt digging through her bag. I couldn’t help but turn to look at her, only to see her bending down fully, her skirt riding up to reveal her amazing thighs, looking particularly beautiful in red thigh-high stockings connected to her garter belt. </p><p>Even the edge of her delicious ass was peeking through, though, unfortunately, the skirt still managed to keep her core hidden, if barely.</p><p>Though, the sight of her perfect globes was more than enough to compensate for that lack. Her legs were just wide enough to give a perfect glimpse of her skin while her nipples stayed hidden behind the blocking of her legs. </p><p>An amazing sight, I decided as I returned to my work, not wanting her to notice I was ogling her, giving some respect to the persona she decided to display. </p><p>And since I had turned back, I didn’t realize the book she was carrying until it hit on the desk, thick enough to make an impressive thumping sound, a glance enough to show that it was actually a college-level book, and certainly not the first-year one. </p><p>‘Basics of Mathematical Proofs’, along with its leather-bound dark cover, didn’t give an easy impression. </p><p>I prepared to complain, as there were levels of studying that even Carrie couldn’t convince me — or so I thought until she plopped herself down to my lap, her naked back pressing against my chest. </p><p>It turned out that I could be convinced to study more complicated topics if the appropriate incentives were presented. “I know the topic seems complicated for you, and you think that it is unnecessary for a business major, but I had researched, and most of the stock market algorithms are actually based on real analysis principles. I’m sure having some knowledge would help you immensely.” </p><p>“Whatever you say, ma’am,” I whispered as I wrapped my hand around her waist, finally feeling the warmth of her skin under my fingertips. “I’m willing to learn whatever you’re willing to teach, as long as you explain,” I whispered. </p><p>Admittedly, a part of my willingness came from the opportunity to pay her back. A fact that didn’t take long for her to realize as my fingers moved up, brushing against the underside of her breasts, making her tremble softly. </p><p>“As long as you can help me decipher it,” I whispered again, leaving no doubt about what I had been planning. </p><p>“G-good,” she stammered, her earlier confidence quick to crack under the receiving side of the deal, especially with the arousal she experienced yesterday, hearing the stories of the amazing show her besties put together. </p><p>“The first thing about mathematical proofs is to create a representation of the concept if possible —,” she started, only to be interrupted by a moan as I squeezed her breasts, my fingers disappearing into her flesh. </p><p>“Sorry, what was that last part,” I said mockingly, couldn’t help but be amused at her reaction now that the aggression changed sides. </p><p>She turned just enough to send me an angry glare, though, considering her pouty lips were still parted as if begging for more, it wasn’t exactly a scary move. Yet, I let my fingers go down regardless. </p><p>I still wanted to torture her more before we moved to the main event… </p><p>And, as my aggressive interventions stopped for a moment, she continued her explanation about the art of proofs. To her credit, despite the complexity of the topic, she was explaining it incredibly well, good enough for me to develop a rudimentary understanding despite the distraction on my lap, slowly rocking. </p><p>Admittedly, that movement wasn’t entirely her fault. Just because I decided against overt didn’t mean that I stopped completely. I had long put my hands on her thighs, pushing and pulling to enhance the soft rocking of her hips even more, giving my extended erection the simulation it had been searching for. </p><p>As my indirect masturbation quickened, her poor, unsupported breasts joined the dance, jiggling and dancing in a way only her perfect breasts could achieve. </p><p>She started to let out gasps of pleasure, but it was the evidence of her academic integrity that she smoothly moved to the first sample proof she had prepared — simple from her perspective, but complicated from mine, explaining why somehow, real numbers and fractional numbers were different kinds of infinities. </p><p>It didn’t seem like something that would be useful in my career, certainly, but I didn’t poke that detail after all the effort Carrie put into her curriculum. </p><p>I would certainly be a better student if every class was delivered privately by an enthusiastic blonde that was suffering from a deficiency in her clothing. </p><p>However, as she finished her proof and moved on to the next one — a monstrous, eight-page mess that somehow proved real numbers existed. Though, as she went through her explanation quickly, line by line, my fingers climbed back to her breasts once more, though, this time, dancing gently around her nipples rather than squeezing aggressively. </p><p>As she had reached the third page of the proof, I had long lost the ability to follow her explanation, and that had little to do with the beautiful distraction on my lap. I simply couldn’t have followed her explanation, even under the best of circumstances. </p><p>The subject was simply too unfamiliar for me. </p><p>It was different for Carrie, whose explanation was slowly getting slower. Her enthusiasm was proof that she was familiar with the subject, but even with the familiarity and her impressive intellect, it was hard to accurately explain a complicated mathematical proof while my fingers conducted a distracting dance over her breasts.</p><p>“… and then, going back to line…” she delivered another line, only for it to fade halfway as she looked confused, clearly losing track of her words. “And then…” she repeated, hoping to find her track of thought, he gaze attentively. </p><p>She might even succeed if it wasn’t for my lips, pressing against her neck to steal a kiss. Instead, she moaned, losing the last hints of her explanation in the flood of pleasure. </p><p>“Such a disappointment,” I murmured as I grabbed her waist, and without a warning, pushed her on the desk, face first, her beautiful ass pointing upward, her deficient pencil skirt struggling to keep everything hidden, but no more successful than her latest attempt of tutoring. </p><p>“Wh-what are you going to do?” she stammered, trying to sound fearful, but the arousal in her tone was simply too dominant. </p><p>“Punish you, of course, so that you can learn to take your job more seriously.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>Under Laura’s complicated gaze, impressed and intimidated at the same time, Penny just nodded, not bothering to say anything as she grabbed the cup of coffee I prepared for her.</p><p>She used the opportunity to take a long sip, using it as a chance to adapt to the situation she found herself in. If it wasn’t for yesterday’s adventure, I would never trust her with such a mission, but during the latter half of the day — particularly during our shared bath — Penny had proved herself to be a magnificent assistant, enough to earn my trust. </p><p>It still took a while to adapt to the role, but luckily, as she raised her hands to take a suspiciously lingering sip, she had other assets to steal Laura’s attention. Such as, the way her small robe loosened further as she moved. </p><p>I let Laura take stock of the view, enjoying the way her earlier urgent confidence left itself to hesitance. It was good, because, for the earlier sessions, I preferred models unsure of their places and their ultimate results. It helped them to follow my directions with the appropriate care rather than assuming they knew the best. </p><p>It was helpful even when working with professional models. But if it was nice to have then, it was a must while working with aspiring ones, a category that the brunette in front of me certainly qualified for. </p><p>“So, Laura,” I said as I poured a cup of coffee for myself, taking a step to interrupt Laura’s gaze, enjoying the sudden blush that came from the realization that she had been ogling another woman for the last several seconds. “I remember promising you a practice shoot…” I started, deliberately being vogue, curious whether she would try obligating it as a payback for the room. </p><p>She managed to pass that little test easily. “I’m happy to have the opportunity,” she replied quickly, her beautiful brown eyes wide enough to show her enthusiasm, yet mixed with a touch of desperation, showing that it wasn’t the first time she tried to penetrate the business. </p><p>“Good,” I said as walked toward the couch they were sitting on, using the opportunity to glance at Penny, who was radiating an unusual amount of confidence that suggested she was getting into a mood that promised a lot of fun. I put my hand on her waist, which would have been too low for the mixed company if the way we dressed hadn’t already ruined any potential of respectability. </p><p>“So, tell me about your modeling aspirations,” Penny interrupted, and I patted her hips, showing I approved her initiative. </p><p>“I…” Laura whispered, but her voice trembled a bit as she noticed my hand dancing up and down on Penny’s waist, the movements too large to be just a casual caress. She took a deep breath as she tried to gather her wits, self-conscious about the situation she found herself in. </p><p>I might have taken mercy on her, if she didn’t choose to wake me up at this ungodly hour. I admired her initiative, but not enough to save her from some punishment. </p><p>Unaware of my thoughts, she the earlier question. “I have always wanted to be a model,” she murmured. </p><p>“Just a model?” I asked, catching a small pause in her explanation, suggesting she was not being entirely forthright. </p><p>She blushed. “N-no, I also want to be an actress—“ she tried to add, only to be interrupted by Penny. </p><p>“And you thought that being a model was an easy step to launch you forward, like modeling is easy,” Penny interrupted dismissively, with a level of derision that was rather excessive, especially considering she was trying to use the exact same strategy. </p><p>“Behave,” I warned Penny, but that warning was not particularly harsh considering it came with a playful spank and a kiss on her neck, a little byplay that made Laura blush more than Penny. </p><p>“Don’t worry about Penny, it’s not a problem that you want to be an actress. A considerable number of models I worked with also had small yet decent acting careers,” I added, not mentioning the part that I lost contact with all of them under current circumstances. “Do you have any experience with acting?” </p><p>“Some,” she murmured shyly. </p><p>“Really, why don’t you show them to me,” I said. </p><p>She was quick to pass her phone to me, a gallery already open. I circled through it, unable to prevent myself from shaking my head dismissively. Just cycling through the photos without seeing one of the videos, I could see that it was one of the local theater productions, one that took themselves too seriously, to the point of their detriment — usually due to a self-important director. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said, but the dismissal in my tone was neither hidden nor fake. “Do you have any experience in modeling?” I asked. </p><p>“A … a couple,” she said as she switched to another folder, this time a proper studio. A glance was enough to confirm that it was a professional environment, and the poses she showed suggested that it was not a professional photo shoot, but one that she paid for — probably a considerable amount of the quality of the studio was any indicator. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, but a nice studio didn’t always mean quality work.  </p><p>Laura’s sets certainly suffered from that. Despite clearly being a paid session for a modeling portfolio the professional choices made by the photographer ruined its usefulness completely. The photos were clearly taken by a hack, because they hardly showed any of her best qualities. </p><p>Laura was certainly a beautiful woman, and while her body lacked the curves Penny proudly displayed at the moment, considering the requirements of the modern modeling world and preferences of the fashion companies, it was more of a benefit than detriment.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, the professional she had worked with was clearly unaware of that, as none of the angles they picked up highlighted Laura’s most marketable traits that might give her a chance to stand out in a crowded application, instead doing their best to hide them, disguising her as another standard model from nineties.</p><p>Consigning her into rejected application pile of any semi-decent professional work. </p><p>For example, as the beautiful miniskirt she wore displayed perfectly, she had amazing legs, thin yet toned at the same time, which was a feature that needed to be highlighted further by the pose selection, yet the body shots turned chose angles that turned her beautiful legs into ordinary. </p><p>Her face certainly suffered from that even more. The makeup choice was horrendous. She had a face with some interestingly sharp angles — though not enough to mar her classical beauty. In the photos, they had chosen makeup that leaned toward the classical aspect of her beauty, hiding the angles with makeup — further enhanced by light. </p><p>Of course, even through badly taken photos, a professional could easily see the truth of her features. Unfortunately for her, the actually experienced photographers almost certainly never deal with the initial screening, and leave it to interns to reduce to a manageable number. </p><p>And, with those photos, Laura could never qualify through that stage. </p><p>I had no doubt that, if she had a better portfolio, it would have been much easier for her to get a job. She would probably get some state-level campaigns already, maybe even some minor national ones. Not exactly the height of fame, but enough to free herself from the necessity of having a day job. </p><p>Maybe even more, if she was as willing to trade in favors with the shadier members of the industry, as she was clearly trying to imply at the moment. </p><p>What a waste. Seeing a potential model ruined by her photographer always annoyed me, an affront to my professional pride. After all, while I certainly enjoyed the glorious benefits of the high-flier lifestyle, it didn’t change the genuine passion I had for my work. </p><p>No matter the network they had, one couldn’t climb the heights I climbed without genuine skill and passion for the job.  </p><p>I turned to her, intent on telling her to never work against whoever was the hack that was responsible for killing her potential career, when she took the phone from my hand. “These are not the only ones,” she whispered rapidly, her face stark-white in fear, clearly misunderstanding the target of my frustration.</p><p>A chuckle escaped my mouth at her move, and I was ready to explain to her my anger wasn’t directed at her when she pushed her phone back into my hands, the view on the screen enough to change my words.</p><p>A view that was enough to make Penny blush despite her current mood. </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured even as I squeezed Penny’s hips, while my gaze danced between the screen and Laura’s face. My statement was not directed to the quality of the photos, as they were definitely even worse than the previous ones she had shown, though considering that they were by Laura, with the help of a mirror, the quality was hardly surprising. </p><p>The interesting thing was her clothes, or more accurately, the lack of them. </p><p>A scoff escaped Penny’s mouth as she examined the photos. I recognized it as an attempt to compensate for her shock, but Laura, missing that nuance, only blushed harder. </p><p>I examined her reaction, trying to see whether she was used to revealing those photos. Yet, the level of excitement she was displaying, along with the rather clumsy way she chose to reveal them suggested that it was the first time she was choosing to employ those photos. </p><p>And, not just in the context of getting a professional backdoor, but also in a private context. It proved her determination. </p><p>All that remained, was whether she had the skills to support her daring opening gambit.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>The moan she let out as I dragged my fingers along the side of her breasts gave me a reason to adjust my plans once more. An excellent one, especially since that was accompanied by a flare of her wings, brightening the room momentarily, suggesting that her pleasure reached a point to compromise her self-control. </p><p>In other words, the perfect opportunity to push her limits. </p><p>But not before giving the proper bait. “Pity I can’t use the full extent of my massage abilities,” I whispered, soft enough that if she was an ordinary woman, she would have missed it. </p><p>She was not an ordinary woman, very noticeably so. She was a supernatural phoenix, which allowed her to hear that. “What do you mean?” she asked as she raised her head and looked at me. </p><p>I faked a shocked expression, mixed with just a flash of fear, giving her the impression that I didn’t intend to be heard by her, my smirk slowly widening at the sight. “Y-you heard that,” I said, stammering for a moment. </p><p>Admittedly, my acting was too exaggerated, but her widening smile after my fake fear suggested that I didn’t misread her. With her unique brand of confidence — one that implied an extremely sheltered upbringing — the exaggerated nature of my little acting project only made it more effective. </p><p>“Yes, I did,” she said proudly as she turned toward me even more, making me wonder whether she was intentionally displaying her nudity, or she had forgotten that she had shrunk her dress into a deficient piece of underwear, and missing the fact that she gifted me with a glimpse of her beautiful nipple. “So, what’s the full extent of your abilities, and why are you not using them?” </p><p>I stopped for a moment to enjoy the spectacular sight before I answered her, still hesitant. “Well, it was something I regularly applied to the queen. It’s challenging, and at times, it had a tendency of getting a bit exaggerated, not to mention requiring a lot of action from your end. I just didn’t think that you can handle— appreciate it,” I added, both using the word handle and the sudden attempt to correct it intentionally, goading her to take the next step, ensuring her commitment. </p><p>A commitment that came even quicker than I expected, carrying all the hallmarks of a reflexive reaction. “I can handle anything that useless Queen can handle,” she responded. Getting caught by the deliberate misleading framing, giving her the impression that the challenge was about abilities than carnal preference, her answer was as quick as a lightning. </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked. Not because I wanted her to change her mind, but because I wanted her to further commit to her misleading decision, expecting her pride to work better than chains. </p><p>“Don’t make repeat myself,” she said. Her wings of fire flared once more, but this time, it was about her anger than arousal. Yet, her anger just reinforced my impression about her unfamiliarity with the position of command, as reflexive displays of anger were one of the most effective ways of ruining the authority over one’s following.  </p><p>“As you wish,” I said. Without a warning, I slapped her ass, hard enough that even her tight flesh rippled for a fleeting moment, but before she could gasp, my hand was already on the area I spanked, using magic to soothe the area and relax it more. </p><p>She froze in shock, caught flat-footed by the sudden change, enough to delay her response for a moment. “What are you doing!” she gasped warningly as she shuffled in place, shifting in place enough to give an even better view of her tits as she turned hurriedly, the intensifying brightness of her wings enhancing the aura of attraction even more. </p><p>“Moving to the next stage. You said you can handle it,” I said, doing my best to sound bewildered rather than challenging her directly. Her ego was clearly fragile enough to react badly if I directly blamed her, but doing the same indirectly worked much better. </p><p>And, just like the time she ‘decided’ to transform her silver dress into a deficient piece of underwear, her fragile ego forced her to make a terrible decision — though, admittedly, my skillful massage and the incredible amount of tantric mana I managed to infuse into her body made sure that her terrible decision came in a form that would bring her more physical pleasure. </p><p>Without that trick to adjust her priorities, she would have probably reacted much more explosively.  </p><p>She stopped, split between her pleasure and the indignity of getting spanked, but I used her momentary freeze to continue work on her skin, using my magic to heal the sting of my touch — once again mixing it with tantric mana to awaken an intense pleasure with it. </p><p>A sensation that she didn’t miss if the widening of her beautiful eyes was any indicator. </p><p>After closing her eyes for a moment to enjoy the sensation, she caught my gaze again, her gaze conflicted as she glanced down at the dance of my fingers. I continued caressing, reducing the intensity, as I had obediently accepted her earlier complaint directly… </p><p>“Who told you to stop?” she finally answered, doing her best to sound angry, but unable to hide the sudden huskiness of her tone. </p><p>Pride and arousal created a deadly combination. </p><p>I spanked her ass again before dousing her bottom with even more tantric mana, triggering another moan. “As you wish, I’m here to serve,” I said. My words were certainly exaggerated, and under different circumstances, I would have refrained from uttering them, as it risked ruining the helpless but still proud image of the king I was trying to reflect. </p><p>But, having the target lay in front of me, mostly naked, and squirming helplessly in a vain attempt to deny the impact of pleasure, I felt safe pushing that limit. </p><p>She was not in the mood to catch such nuances. </p><p>I spanked again even as I spoke once more. \"Now, turn around,” I said even as I continued squeezing her beautiful ass. “Let’s start the next stage properly.\"</p><p>She tensed at the request, but that only worked to delay her for a moment before she followed my request, letting out a shaking breath, finding herself unable to extract from the careless commitment without trampling her own pride. </p><p>Her eyes were closed to hide her emotions, but the way her body’s stillness was broken by the occasional trembles betrayed her and revealed them. </p><p>It was a beautiful sight, surprisingly cute considering the amount of nudity and arousal it included, enough to earn the mercy and love of most men. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I was not like most men. I spanked her beautiful tits twice, one for each, watching them sway before returning to their beautiful state, enjoying her shocked gasp even as I sank my fingers on her breasts, my fingers dancing over its expanse. She gasped desperately as my fingers met around her nipples, squeezing them hard. </p><p>She bit her lips in an effort to contain her moan, a move that wasn’t as effective as she might have hoped. </p><p>I was tempted to test the capabilities of those lips in a different manner, but, unfortunately, that wasn’t really an option, at least not yet. Just because I managed to make considerable process didn’t mean that I could just push the situation recklessly. </p><p>Forgetting her explosive magical power, and even more, explosive fury, would have been a deadly mistake. </p><p>With a soft sigh, I continued working on her breasts, alternating between spanking and massaging. Though, seeing that she reacted to the teasing of her nipples effectively, I soon added several flicks to the mixture, each repeat making her gasp in shock. </p><p>Her body shivered in anticipation as the pleasure built up further and further. She was getting drunk on pleasure, her determination to hide her moans fading. Occasional gasps slipped out of her mouth, while I enjoyed the extraordinary shape of her body more and more. </p><p>I decided to challenge her a bit more, and dragged one of my hands down to her stomach, the other staying on her breasts. As I caressed her stomach, she shivered more and more, smart enough to realize that, with the speed and steady direction my hand-picked, they had no intention of just focusing on her belly. </p><p>I stopped just at the line her magical panties created, dancing along the edge back and forth, suggesting a touch at her most intimate place, but didn’t take that step. I just teased her with the idea. </p><p>The location of my right hand was enough to make her much tenser, and with her attention focused on that carnal threat, my other hand started to treat her breasts even more roughly, slapping and mauling harder and harder before dousing them with more tantric energy, conditioning her for the rougher side of the bedroom fun. </p><p>A concept she was clearly unaware of if her incredible reaction was any indicator. </p><p>She finally opened her eyes once more, catching my gaze, shock and arousal dancing in their beautiful depths.</p><p>And, just like that, I faced another choice.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Not bad for a newbie, right,” Thad said as he pushed me toward the center of the group as the defensive players chattered around me in the locker room. The offensive players would have had a contrasting, angrier expression, but they had left the stadium more than an hour ago. </p><p>Once again underlining Coach Spencer’s understanding of difficult training was wildly different than what was necessary to be successful.  </p><p>Unlike their training, our training run for three more hours, and it had been exhausting. After the initial show, Coach Bill certainly didn’t have any mercy on us, but didn’t let us directly compete with the offense, instead running us through several painful yet boring drills, mostly tackling dummies, breaking our victor through monotone exhaustion and pain. </p><p>Yet, despite the extra pain that came from my success, the mood of our half of the team was excellent, finally treating me as a part of the team. Even the other backup linebackers lost their animosity. A part of it was certainly the general football attitude, accepting anyone as long as they showed the necessary grit and ability. </p><p>Though, I had no doubt that the show of superiority I delivered through the unfortunate twenty-two was certainly a factor as well, showing I was not merciful when ticked off. </p><p>And, more importantly, stealing people’s girlfriends was not my only ability. </p><p>Still, even with the recent boost I had received, both in Agility and Strength, I wasn’t exactly an overwhelming physical display. Measured in pure physical abilities, I wouldn’t be able to get any chance to play unless the team experienced a particularly unfortunate string of injuries. </p><p>Yet, combined with my intangible abilities, it was almost a certainty that I would receive a significant playing opportunity. And, aware of that, the rest of the linebackers were ready to accept the new ranking system, grudgingly if not happily. </p><p>Normally, the other starters were supposed to react badly to my presence, but considering my skill set, there was only one starter position I could take. The middle linebacker, along with the mike position. </p><p>Since Carter, both as the mike and the captain, kept his mouth shut very pointedly, none of them said anything. </p><p>Just like that, I realized as the people around me joked and mocked, I had an actual place on the team, albeit it was arguable whether it was earned, or acquired through cheating. How to position the System was rather arguable. </p><p>Not that I cared much. I wouldn’t be the first man that climbed unfairly to the top. It might be unfair, but so was having rich parents, or being born as a genetic miracle with unbeatable speed. </p><p>More importantly, rich parents and great genetics usually didn’t come with a looming mythical threat that forced them to readjust their understanding of life, one that came with a lot of implied threat of violence. </p><p>And it wasn’t like I had overwhelming physical abilities thanks to the system. Even with the boost I received, I was barely strong enough to count as a starter. </p><p>I felt a strong slap on my back. I turned reflexively, ready to defend myself, only to meet with the smiling face of another defensive lineman “So, Terry,” he said as he squeezed my shoulder, in a manner that could be classified as excessively hard. “Three days of training, and three big surprises, any other surprises for us tomorrow?” </p><p>Despite the threateningly painful way he squeezed my shoulder, his words were cheerful.  </p><p>“I shouldn’t say,” I shoot back with a smirk, ignoring the painful presence on my shoulder. Compared to the endless full-strength tackles I had fought earlier, that little bit of pain was nothing. “Someone should keep you old-timers on your toes.” </p><p>“Too right,” quipped one of the younger backups from the side, and the locker room, at least the side the defensive team had been using, exploded in laughter, echoing from the empty section. </p><p>“Good work,” commented one of the others, a starter safety. “Today, you managed to impress the coach, and it’s a hard thing to do, especially for a freshman.” </p><p>“Sophomore, actually,” I corrected. </p><p>“God damn it, what a waste” shouted one of the others from the side, and turned to Carter. “Captain, we clearly need to update our walk-in selection, maybe even have a talk with the scouts. We are not in a position to miss monsters like him just because he’s a bit on the scrawny side,” he added, slapping my back to emphasize. </p><p>“Hey, do you think I’m happily missing the potential for a decent mike,” Carter answered. His tone was much softer, but that didn’t prevent the room for to fall silent for a fleeting moment. After the study session, the fact that Carter intended to treat me as a successor was implied. </p><p>But there was a great difference between implications and open declarations. </p><p>I caught a couple of the linebackers looking rather dissatisfied, but with my performance both on field and off the field, they didn’t have too much to argue.  </p><p>Soon, the cheer returned to the room, and the other players started congratulating me, though their attitudes were slightly different. They realized that things were going to change. </p><p>Yet, the number of well wishes wasn’t just about Carter’s decision, but also about me finally earning a real place on the team. </p><p>Considering I had joined the team as one of the certified ‘nerds’ had been attention-grabbing enough, and the spectacle between me, Megan, and Kevin was nothing short of truly spectacular. Yet, that didn’t mean they truly accepted me as a part of the team, but treated me more as an oddity. </p><p>The only real exception had been Thad, and even then, he had the net benefits of two cars — one he didn’t lose, and once he gained. </p><p>Even the show I had displayed at the tactical meeting hadn’t been enough to earn true acceptance. On the contrary, it probably lost me some of my already limited clout around the players, though more than enough trade considering the impact it had on the coaching staff. The game required a lot of strategic and tactical acumen, but quite a few players resented that requirement, more focused on the physical aspect than the tactical competition. </p><p>For them, the amazing performance I had displayed tactically was just another sign I was a nerd, therefore making my place on the team suspect. </p><p>Facing two running backs in a rigged game and taking down both in the process was different. Of course, the last encounter between me and the number twenty-two was rather inconclusive considering I used his facemask to pull him down, which would have earned a significant penalty rather than a victory. </p><p>Yet, playing dirty, especially under those exact circumstances, was accepted much more readily. </p><p>Today’s performance earned me true acceptance from the team, managed to shine from the perspective of the coaches, and even received Carter’s unofficial declaration about passing the flag to me — with the implicit assumption that I continued to perform, of course. </p><p>With the number of people trying to talk to me, I was one of the latest that finished preparing after the team, though, when I finally reached my phone, I had found a lot of notifications, and a message on top. </p><p>‘You owe me one,’ read the message. It was from Megan. </p><p>A quick check of the notifications was enough to show me her meaning. She had shared that live stream several times, and she wasn’t the only one that shared. Several other girls that belonged to some of the more popular sororities had shared the video as well, usually with a lot of comments.</p><p>It answered the question of why I had received such an intense amount of Intent, enough to give me two more physical Traits even with my guide greedily stealing a significant portion to recover. Even now, I was still receiving a steady stream of Intent, but it lacked the earlier intensity, making it much more difficult for me to channel it to the System for more Traits. </p><p>‘Agreed,’ I wrote back to Megan. </p><p>Technically, since I didn’t ask her for her help, I might have argued that it didn’t count as a favor and I didn’t care about my popularity, but if I did so, she wouldn’t help in a similar situation in the future. And, even more, she might even decide to be a nuisance. And, as Kevin could attest, she really knew how to do so if she was determined, and it was not something I could afford with my need for attention.</p><p>One that had more objective reasons than just a narcissistic drive for fame. </p><p>‘Good,’ she wrote back. </p><p>It was a single word, with no emojis or other tricks to soften it. ‘I owe you one, as long as it’s reasonable to request,’ I added, just to be on the safe side.  </p><p>‘Ahh, you’re no fun,’ she answered, this time with a smiley, though I had no doubt we would have a detailed discussion about what constituted a reasonable request. My earlier experience showed me that Megan was the exact kind of person that would push herself to the limit. </p><p>With a sigh, I put the phone back in my pocket and stepped into my car, battling against the exhaustion that crept up after the shower. With the intensity I had been experiencing the last two days, even the supernatural addition to my Stamina was barely enough to keep me awake. I earned a long sleep. </p><p>With all the impressive things I managed to achieve in the last few days, that rest was certainly earned. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The elation of leaving behind the Junia estate was incredible. Even the air tasted sweeter. </p><p>It wasn’t that we were safe, not by any stretch of the word, but at least, we were out of the estate wards, which meant that even if the worst happened and they discovered the nature of our escape, we would have a fighting chance. </p><p>Not a very big change, mind you, especially with my ability to use magic significantly compromised by the sudden boost of power, but even the smallest chance was better than certain death. </p><p>Especially since, with the distance between us and the gate widening with each hurried step we took, the chances of our survival increased as well. Though, the distance created by our steps was hardly satisfying. I would have preferred to start running, but that hardly seemed to be the most prudent idea while we were still visible from the gate. Betting on the distraction of the guards was not the best idea.  </p><p>Luckily, not too far from the estate, there was a forest — which was another proof of the confidence of the Junia family, prioritizing beauty over security. Not that I was complaining, as the presence of it allowed us to take a turn, finally hiding from the view of the gate. </p><p>“What now?” Xia asked as she looked at me, her voice already strained. “We were supposed to get horses to get away, and I can’t suppress all of those weapons and dragon hearts for long. Running will only exhaust me faster.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about them, we’ll get rid of them soon. And about lacking horse,” I said, then with a sigh, crouched in front of her. “Hop on.” </p><p>I wished that we weren’t in mortal danger, because her shocked expression was enough for me to tease her for a considerable amount of time. “You can’t be serious—“ she started. </p><p>“We don’t have time to waste. Unless you can find a horse in less than a minute, or have the ability to run as fast as one without completely collapsing, that’s your ride.” </p><p>“T-that’s nonsense,” she gasped, clearly hating the idea, but if there were perks to immediate mortal danger, it was to prevent pointless discussion. Xia was aware that we were racing against time to get away safely. Under my gaze, she swallowed her complaints, and climbed on my shoulders. </p><p>Then, I loosened my control on my transformation once more, letting my legs turn into clawed monstrosities. And…</p><p>Started running. </p><p>Her shocked cry was not a surprise, nor was the sudden tightening of her hands around my hair. Even I was surprised by my speed. With the assistance of my transformed legs, I was moving at a speed that could easily surpass a significant portion of magical horses. </p><p>A shocking development, but not an unwelcome one in the short term. The impact of the transformation in the long term… Well, it was a problem to be focused on after handling our sudden challenge. </p><p>I turned my attention to the more immediate concerns. Interestingly, even as I moved with such rapid speed, I didn’t have any problem moving through the forest, a challenge that would have resulted in a broken leg for any horse. With my perception, I was easily able to notice the holes and roots, and my legs allowed me to take sharp turns that a horse could never replicate under the circumstances. </p><p>If I was still a young boy that didn’t know how the world worked, that speed would have made me change my plans, hoping that a mad dash would put enough distance, giving me the edge I needed. After all, with such speed, there were very few things that could actually catch me, and adding to the fact that I was able to run through areas where horses and other beasts of burden couldn’t easily penetrate. </p><p>That would have been a deadly mistake.  </p><p>My new speed meant that, while I could certainly avoid anyone that was sent from the estate, I wasn’t stupid enough to think that the strongest Patrician house’s strength was limited to their own estate. No, they had many other mages and soldiers they could call across Italy. </p><p>Not to mention their ability to actually mobilize the legions of Rome. </p><p>Escaping from a cohort had been hard enough when I first became a sorcerer, even with my increased strength, I didn’t want to replicate that experience against a legion or two. </p><p>Certainly not in the middle of Italy, surrounded by legions. </p><p>Also, while not as important as the first reason, I also didn’t want to keep the transformation active for too long. The abilities that transformation gave me were incredible, but the sudden intrusion of wild emotions and instincts was as intimidating as those abilities were incredible. </p><p>I didn’t want to transform into a wild animal. </p><p>Of course, if I wanted to get away, I needed some distraction. Luckily, we managed to collect sufficient ammunition to enable so. As I run through the forest, I made sure to stay relatively close to the main road, and barely five minutes later, we managed to catch up with another noble carriage, one that left the Junia Estate several minutes before we did. </p><p>“Slip a weapon and a dragon heart to the carriage,” I requested from my ally. </p><p>“I can’t believe that you’re asking a sorceress to cast parlor tricks,” she murmured in dissatisfaction, but her annoyance didn’t prevent her magic from flaring. </p><p>“Well, I can always try it if you want,” I suggested with a smirk.  </p><p>Her response was a panicked gasp. “No! You can’t cast anything without burning half of the carts,” she followed by a furious whisper.  </p><p>I paused a moment to consider her words, feeling the tumultuous rage in my core. “Maybe,” I answered, my voice suddenly tense even as I watched a weapon and a dragon heart silently floating toward the cart, avoiding the notice of the guards. </p><p>I took a deep breath, suppressing the sudden rage, rising much more aggressively despite no reason to do so. It seemed that I would suffer an even more confusing emotional storm this time. </p><p>“Run,” she ordered after our little present was safely hidden, tapping my shoulder, which didn’t help my unnatural fury. Luckily, running at full speed was a good way to suppress it. </p><p>And just like that, our escape attempt continued, which was surprisingly dull considering the stakes — and the value of the items we spread around in the hopes of creating a distraction, every single one of them enough to trigger a sizable scuffle even in the center of Rome. </p><p>When we arrived at the gates of the city, half of the weapons and dragon hearts were already unloaded, some buried in the forest, some carefully placed in various carts. I even managed to send a prearranged message to Theodora, one that asked the ship she prepared for me to set said and move to a predetermined location in the open sea. </p><p>Docks weren’t connected to the city, but I had a feeling that, once we finished with Rome, they would close the docks as well. </p><p>Unless he was convinced that his treasures were somewhere else, somewhere they couldn’t barge directly and discover things. </p><p>And, luckily, we were sufficiently close to such a location. </p><p>“Such a waste,” Xia murmured as she pulled a gray cloak around her head — one that she stole as we were moving, while murmuring about wasting her great talents to do petty thievery — while I did my best to suppress my transformation once again under a similar cloak. “So many dragon hearts and magical weapons, all thrown away as a distraction.” </p><p>I shrugged as we got closer to the gates. “I don’t love the feeling of throwing them away for nothing either, but we need the distraction. They might notice our disappearance any moment, and we need them distracted trying to recollect their treasures rather than just trying to find us.” </p><p>Luckily, that was yet to happen, as we were able to go through the gates with minimal fanfare, a spell from Xia enough to distract the careless guard that was supposed to check our identity, and we stepped into Rome. </p><p>“It’s such a pointless risk to enter Rome,” she murmured in annoyance. </p><p>“Feel free to find an alternative location where they can’t just send their full army. If you want to distract a tiger, you need a wolf even if you can’t find a tiger. Luckily, we are next to the den.” </p><p>“Pomerium is still too excessive. If I got caught under the wards of the Pomerium, it’s a death sentence.” </p><p>“It doesn’t matter where we are caught. We’re dead meat no matter where we are caught. We can’t escape the jaws of a Patrician house without taking some risk,” I answered. “Not after delivering such a deadly injury.” </p><p>“But, entering Rome… It’s certain that they block the exits once they discover what we are doing, and they will do so before we could leave. How are we going to escape.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, just try to finish your work as soon as possible and hide those dragon hearts with the strongest families, then leave the wards and cast the signal spell. I’ll return after distributing the weapons and return to pick you up.”</p><p>“But what if they raise the alarm…” she murmured. </p><p>“You just have to trust me. After everything going on, I certainly have no intention of leaving you behind after everything.”  </p><p>She looked reluctant, but after everything we had gone through, she was smart enough to realize that I wouldn’t have sacrificed her for nothing. Not when I desperately needed her help to understand the transformation I was suffering. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I looked at the collapsed figures of Titania and Marianne, their exhaustion at the peak after a night filled with debauchery, though, considering the great benefits it had granted to them, I doubted they would mind the exhaustion. </p><p>I couldn’t say I was unhappy about the results as well. </p><p>[Grandmaster Tantric (112/120)] </p><p>[Experience: 591170 / 595000]</p><p>Not only I had received another level after the completion of the Companion process, but also made decent progress toward another amazing level up. </p><p>Too bad the System chose to give me that annoying notification about lacking Divine Spark once again, one that came faster than I expected, invalidating my earlier calculations about Divine Spark and the experience gained. </p><p>Like I didn’t have enough reasons to be suspicious of the System and its behavior already. </p><p>“Let’s make sure you girls are secure,” I murmured as I looked at the beautiful sight of their naked bodies, wrapped around each other, exhausted and defenseless. </p><p>I didn’t have the luxury of staying there and protecting them until they woke up, and while a healing spell would wake them up, ruining their beautiful haze after everything we had done would have been equally rude. </p><p>I might need to go back to visit the headmistress at the promised meeting time, but I had no intention of sacrificing the security of my girls to do so. </p><p>Luckily, there were other alternatives, ones that came in the form of layers and layers of wards.</p><p>They weren’t as complicated as my usual ones, but considering I wouldn’t be there to control the wards, I needed to be careful of an accident. Of course, that limited complication meant the wards wouldn’t be as strong, so I compensated by spending a scary amount of mana. </p><p>[-6720 Mana]</p><p>Then, I left after scribbling a note, leaving them to continue their mission. I didn’t like them staying away from Silver Spires with some of the royal forces trying to keep tabs on them, but summoning them back might be the riskier choice. </p><p>Especially since I was yet to truly understand the source of the conflict between the Princess and the rest of her family — and more importantly, the identity and the objective of the mysterious support of the other royals. </p><p>It wouldn’t be too much of a problem for Titania, who not only had sufficient power, but also lacked easily manipulated levers. That didn’t apply to Marianne, who belonged to a minor noble house, one that would only hurt her in such a conflict. </p><p>For her, it was safer for her to build a reputation first. </p><p>But that was something to be focused on for the future. After one last glance, I summoned another air elemental to go back, once again using the travel time to practice my abilities, to increase my casting abilities without the assistance of the System. </p><p>When I arrived, the sun was already halfway up on the horizon, suggesting I was late. Very slightly late, but still late. </p><p>Luckily, I was too familiar with the paths around the school to have any problem traveling around, and managed to arrive at the entrance of the tower without extending that delay too much. </p><p>Not many people would care about such a slight delay, but I found the door already open, giving me the impression that the headmistress was not one of those. </p><p>I climbed the stairs without wasting any time. At the top of the stairs, I found the headmistress waiting for me already, a disapproving expression on her face. </p><p>Technically, with her stern expression, supported by her impressive armor and her even more impressive wings, she was supposed to be intimidating. Yet, maybe it was my changing perception of her, driven by a combination of her attitude toward Janelor and the realization of how much she needed me, but I didn’t find her threatening. </p><p>She almost looked adorable. </p><p>“I’m sorry I’m late,” I said, still apologizing, even if my mannerism was a touch of perfection. After all, just because I didn’t find her intimidating didn’t mean that I could treat her without respect outwardly. </p><p>She was yet to learn just how much she needed me. </p><p>“Make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she said even as she gestured for me to take my usual place for another transfer of Divine Spark. Her tone implied that she would much prefer to send me away for my ‘disrespect’ but the pressure she was under prevented her from being heavy-handed in her punishments. </p><p>After all, I was still responsible for keeping Janelor happy. </p><p>Her torrent of mana hit me soon after, once again carrying a limited amount of Divine Spark. At this point, the method of pilfering Divine Spark was rather familiar, allowing me to take even more. Of course, it was also about my confidence in the advantages I managed to find, allowing me to be more greedy as I captured the Divine Spark. </p><p>Even if she noticed my trick, I could easily use my connection with Janelor to prevent her from punishing me, which would still leave my other cards hidden. </p><p>Yet, those thoughts turned out to be unnecessary. </p><p>She seemed to be in a hurry to complete my Light Node, as today’s transfer lasted even longer. When it finished, she was panting hard, giving me very visible signs of exhaustion. </p><p>I was tempted to show the illusion of a completed node, but not for long. With the System asking for Divine Spark once more before letting me get more experience — a cycle that seemed to shorten significantly with each repeat — I needed an excuse to get more Divine Spark. </p><p>And if it exhausted her, tough world. She still owed me for saving Silver Spires. </p><p>“Thank you, my lady,” I stood up as I made a very visible show of struggling to stand up, while I was busy locking the Divine Spark behind the storage the System couldn’t reach. I gave an impression of struggle and pain, because it wouldn’t be reasonable to believe I had managed to handle the wild infusion of Spark while it impacted her too much. </p><p>She waited silently as I put on a show of struggle. It was not due to kindness, of course, but she was using it as an excuse to hide her own exhaustion, acting like it was a rare display of mercy. She understood the value of posturing — though that shouldn’t be a surprise as she maintained her grip on Silver Spires for two centuries mostly through posturing. The nature of her mana might contrast with that direction, but it was impossible for her not to get at least reasonably competent on a subject after such a time. </p><p>Even without the assistance of the System in the form of convenient skills to significantly shorten the learning process, two centuries was sufficient to do so. </p><p>Only after finishing my little show and standing up, she spoke, but rather than acknowledging the impact of the transfer, however, she chose to move to the next topic. “Is there anything you need to share about your mission?” </p><p>“Nothing in particular,” I answered as I put my hands on my knee, selling the idea of exhaustion even more. “She’s quite lazy. As long as I prepare her food and make sure nothing interrupts her nap, she’s happy.” </p><p>“Good,” she said, though while her answer was simple, her expression was more nuanced, the kind that would make someone with less control over their emotions curse. The fact that she needed to beg Janelor for her help must have been difficult. </p><p>Janelor’s offhanded comments implied that the headmistress wasn’t a particularly important part of her faction, probably equivalent to a middling student, but no matter how long one’s life, two centuries were more than enough for a substance to be addictive. </p><p>Especially since the substance in question was power, the most addictive substance ever known to mankind. It was clearly not too different from other life forms, like angels and dragons… </p><p>“What should I do if she asks something excessive?” I asked, probing her a bit more on the subject. </p><p>“Like what?” she asked, though her frown tightened, clearly not enjoying talking about her blackmailer. </p><p>“Well, she looks happy for the moment, but what if she gets bored cooped up and wants to go out for a trip?” I asked. “Do I help her, or keep her inside?” </p><p>This time, her face actually showed a hint of emotion, an explosive one. “You need to keep her in, no matter what! We can’t afford her getting caught by the Eternals, it would ruin everything. Do whatever you need to entertain her.” </p><p>“As you order, milady,” I answered, doing my best to keep my smile more hidden than her growing panic at the suggestion. Her word choice was enough to reveal that she didn’t care much about Janelor’s fate, but about losing access to the benefits Janelor represented. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have mentioned anything about her not being afford such a condition. “I’ll do my best to keep her entertained, no matter what.” </p><p>“Good,” she said as she looked at me. “Then, we can focus on what’s important. Create a container.” </p><p>“As you order, milady,” I repeated as I gathered my mana, ready to create the storage she needed.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 34 Experience: 591170 / 595000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6936 / 6936 Mana: 8414 / 8500 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [112/120]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Luckily, while I needed to understand better how Companion Node worked, it was not one of the boring, joyless magical research projects. No, it was much more fun. </p><p>I continued to slide inside Marianne, enjoying the amazing way her warmth wrapped around my shaft, I split my attention toward the way the Companion Node was getting stronger, enhancing the connection between us. </p><p>Naturally, it wasn’t the first time I was paying attention to this process, but my growing experience with Divine Spark helped me to notice a lot of details I had missed earlier. </p><p>In particular, a particular similarity between the Companion Node and the Divine Spark in its raw form — or what I deemed as the raw form after it had lost its elemental nature with the assistance of Tantric. </p><p>I had no idea whether that was actually the case, but I still received a reward in the process. </p><p>[+2 Tantric]</p><p>Focusing on the way the Companion Process was developing gave me a significant boost on Tantric, more than I had been expecting, especially with its already high attainment as my first Grandmaster skill. </p><p>It was supposed to develop slower, which only went further to confirm the link between Tantric and the Companion Process. Although, I couldn’t help but wonder about the underlying implications. </p><p>Especially since I had learned that I couldn’t block the connection between me and the Tantric, implying wasn’t coming from the System. </p><p>And, if that wasn’t coming from the system, maybe it was the case for the Companion Node as well. So, even as my hips rocked hard, alternating between two girls that presented themselves in front of me, each moment enhanced the subtle core of power that was hidden in their soul spaces. </p><p>With my current Tantric sensitivity, I could see that, even without the notifications, the Node was getting stronger. Only slightly, but still getting stronger. </p><p>Then, I started noticing other important details. There was a flow between the Companion Node and the system, subtle yet unmistakable in its unique nature. </p><p>Divine Spark, in its purified form, reinforcing the girls after coming from the System. </p><p>If it wasn’t for Grandmaster level Tantric, supported by my phenomenal perception, that might have been the only thing I noticed. But, paying careful attention, I could see that a similar flow of Divine Spark subtly flowed out of my body and mixed with theirs, before coalescing into their Companion Nodes. </p><p>It was harder to notice than the interaction between the Node and the System, because the interaction of the system came from a single, linear source, like a drip of water, while from my body, the same amount radiated from a wider area, with the soft consistency of a vapor. </p><p>Making it much harder to notice. </p><p>The amount was really subtle, not enough to have a noticeable effect on the amount of Divine Spark I had absorbed in my body. </p><p>Even then, I frowned at the realization, because I had been hoping that absorbing Divine Spark to enhance my body was permanent. </p><p>That would not do, I decided as I tried to exert some control on that flow. </p><p>Surprisingly, I had received instant success. Stopping my own Divine Spark flow had been rather simple, much easier than intervening with the System, still, Divine Spark was a more reliable source of power. </p><p>And, since I was able to slow down the process, I could use the same trick to quicken it as well. I closed my eyes for a moment and let the Divine Spark evaporate off my body faster, and channeled it to their Companion Nodes. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 86%]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 85%]</p><p>[+2 Tantric]</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>And received great success. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured as I quickened the assault of my hips, and instead focused only on Marianne, sending another wave of power, this time in the form of Mana, giving her more experience. </p><p>[-2910 Mana]</p><p>Even as I did so, I stopped to think for a moment, trying to decide the relative merits of quickening the Companion Process and wasting some Divine Spark — which was, ultimately, only a fraction of my current capabilities — versus letting the System handle it, saving some in exchange of time it would require to complete the last step. </p><p>In the end, I decided on the former. Not because spending several uninterrupted hours with two beautiful women who were willing to do everything to make that period pleasurable was a great chore. </p><p>But the unexpected interruptions to my plans were becoming a norm, and it was for the better not to push my luck to see whether I could do it. Spending my own Divine Spark was not the greatest thing, but it was not a good habit to be miserly. </p><p>And, the fun part had no problem as well. After all, there was nothing preventing me from extending the fun after the Companion Process had been completed. </p><p>So, I decided to change the pace a bit by focusing on Marianne fully. I grabbed her waist, easily lifting her, interrupting their little kiss even as I hooked my arms under her legs while I flared my magic to summon another crystal furniture, this time a chair for myself. </p><p>I sat down, with Marianne on my lap, her back pushing against my chest, her amazing breasts free to jiggle with each push, creating a spectacular view in the process. </p><p> “More,” Marianne moaned breathlessly while Titania looked at the sudden change of pace with a disappointed gaze. </p><p>“As you wish,” I whispered to Marianne’s ear, pulling back only after leaving a soft bite before turning my attention back to Titania, who was watching us with a barely-disguised disappointment in her gaze, not entirely welcoming the sudden change. “Come on, sweetie, what are you waiting for,” I said as I caught her gaze. “Marianne’s breasts certainly need more attention.” Then, I slapped Marianne’s ass. “Don’t they?” </p><p>“Yes, they do!” Marianne moaned beautifully, repeating the invitation, which was enough to break Titania’s momentary hesitance. She shuffled until she was sitting on the same crystal she was lying on a moment ago, close enough to my chair that she could reach Marianne’s tits while sitting on the corner of it. </p><p>I stopped for a moment to enjoy the sight of Titania’s hands disappearing into the great expanse of Marianne’s bosom before turning my attention — most of it — back to the changes going on in her soul space, her companion node getting stronger with each second. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 91%]</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>Even as the companion node continued to grow, I was getting a better sight of the details of the node. Interestingly, the process itself was less complicated than I expected — just not as simple as the headmistress’ direct and violent method, not requiring such a pointless show. </p><p>Though, to be fair, unlike the headmistress, I had full control of the Divine Spark in my possession rather than constantly battling against it in an effort to prevent spontaneous combustion. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 94%]</p><p>I decided to reward Marianne’s help with another burst of experience. </p><p>[-1902 Mana]</p><p>“Yes,” she moaned softly, barely able to gather sufficient breath between her moans. “Another level!” </p><p>“Good performance will not go without a reward,” I whispered, which earned a satisfied moan from Marianne. </p><p>Titania’s expression was markedly more pointed, jealousy coloring her face. Yet, she didn’t explicitly ask for it, showing her shyness was not an issue that could be cured immediately. “Sorry about that, sweetie, but your level is a bit much to boost easily, but don’t worry, I still have a little achievement lined up for you.” </p><p>That didn’t make her give a verbal answer, but I was more than happy to take the way she leaned down to capture Marianne’s nipple between her lips as a win. </p><p>I tightened my grip on Marianne’s hips instead, quickening the assault, catching an interesting detail in the process. The more aroused Marianne was feeling, the more efficient the companion node creation was going excellently. </p><p>Not that it was a shocking revelation at this point, not with the source of my power. </p><p>Instead, I let one of my hands slip forward, teasing her knob to enhance her pleasure even further, seconds turning into minutes. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 100% - Final Stage Completed +20000 Exp]</p><p>[Permanent Perk Established: Mana Regeneration]</p><p>[Permanent Perk Established: Skill Share]</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!” Marianne moaned repeatedly, but as the pleasure hit her, which was not exactly helped by the intensity of the pleasure combined with the rush of leveling.

It was unfair to focus on that fact while I had two beautiful naked ladies begging for my attention. </p><p>I conjured a bed for Marianne to lie on before I turned my attention back to Titania, who looked fascinated by the explosive intensity of Marianne’s climax. “She lost quickly,” she still managed to stammer. </p><p>“Yes, she did,” I said with a big smirk on my face. “But, if you’re feeling she underperformed, let’s see how long you would be able to handle,” I added as I grabbed her arm and pulled her onto my lap. </p><p>The same space Marianne had just vacated a second ago, my glistening shaft a sign of her presence…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 33 Experience: 556660 / 561000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6732 / 6732 Mana: 5863 / 8250 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [106/110]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I woke up to the sound of a doorbell that I didn’t expect. </p><p>Under normal circumstances, being woken up by an unexpected visitor was certainly not a pleasant experience. Waking up on a couch wasn’t supposed to help as a flashback to the unlucky time after I had lost my job. </p><p> Yet, the couch didn’t feel as bad as it was supposed to feel. For once, the painful back pain that plagued me in those times was absent thanks to the amazing quality of the couch that I was lying on, one that was significantly better than my current bed. </p><p>Still, the great comfort of the couch was nothing compared to my amazing blanket, one that was amazingly comfortable even though it was significantly heavier. A beautiful, blonde blanket.  </p><p>It was good to see Penny had other abilities than being an excellent model. </p><p>I shuffled in place, feeling the soft weight of her beautiful breasts against my chest. But before I could close my eyes again and fall back to sleep, the doorbell rang again, putting a snag into my plan.</p><p>It seemed that I had a determined visitor. I decided to stand up and answer the door before the girls woke up as well, when my plan hit another snag. This time, it came in the form of her beautiful globes pushing against my palms, tempting me to stay on the couch rather than stand up to answer the door. </p><p>They made a compelling argument, especially when combined with the amazing strength of my morning wood. </p><p>Yet, the doorbell rang once again, ruining that little plan. This time, it even managed to wake Penny up. </p><p>Unlike me, her first reaction was too look shocked and panicked, though a quick kiss worked wonders to remove her momentary panic. Then, the doorbell rang again, the presence of an impending visitor enough to resurrect the shy parts of her personality. “Are we expecting any guests?” she managed to stammer as she pulled back panickedly, looking around to find her robe. </p><p>“I don’t remember any,” I answered, but I couldn’t help but have a niggling feeling that I was forgetting something. “It must be a mistake,” I said as I squeezed her breasts. “But since we’re already awake … why don’t we start with a morning exercise,” I suggested as I squeezed her breasts, which earned a delicious moan, showing she wasn’t entirely against the idea. </p><p>The doorbell rang yet again, showing that our visitor was rather determined. </p><p>“Give me a moment to send them away first, sweetheart,” I whispered as I grabbed her waist to lift her, easily depositing her next to me. “Why don’t you put on your robe while I send away our impatient visitor to prevent any accidental glance, and we can focus on our morning exercise when I return,” I said, my smirk getting bigger. “Not to mention, I love slowly getting rid of them.” </p><p>Then, I walked toward the door while Penny was busy blushing. </p><p>My annoyance didn’t survive for long, when I looked from the peephole, only to see a familiar face. </p><p>The brunette from the reception, one that I promised to have a test shoot in the morning. </p><p>I was tempted to reject her and go back to help Penny exercise, but the peeping hole give a view wide enough to reveal not only her cute face but also her striking dressing — a naughty crop top and a skirt that was significantly shorter than reasonable for a first-time visit too a stranger’s room — was good enough to change my mind. </p><p>The cart she was pushing, filled with some very expensive silver trays, was just a bonus. A nice one, of course. She clearly had a reason for her early appearance. </p><p>I turned to Penny, who was just pulling her robe on. I waited for a second, enjoying the glimpse of her nude body before speaking. “Oh, I forget that I promised to have a test shoot with an aspiring model. Our morning exercise needs to be canceled,” I said, which made Penny reflect a look of disappointment. </p><p>Normally, a petulant look like that wouldn’t have been an attractive attitude, but like most things in life, it looked significantly better on a barely-dressed busty blonde, trying to stuff her beautiful body into a robe that was too small for her amazing curves, a blush of arousal on her face. </p><p>“We have two options,” I decided to explain. “First, you can go to the bedroom and continue sleeping…” </p><p>“And what’s the second option,” she asked, rather quickly. </p><p>“You can stay here and help me assess the new model,” I whispered, my tone leaving no doubt about the limits of the things I had in mind. “Would you be interested in that?” </p><p>Penny didn’t say anything, too busy blushing, but the fact she was still sitting was sufficient as an answer. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said before I turned my attention back to my new visitor. </p><p>“Good morning,” I said as I opened the door, facing a cute brunette, blushing as she realized I was only wearing a robe. “I hope nothing is wrong. We don’t need to check out early, do we?”</p><p>“N-no, not at all,” she managed to stammer. “I t-thought you could use a breakfast, complimentary!”  </p><p>“How kind,” I answered, intrigued by her stammer. She had been much more confident while she was in the reception. A part of it could be blamed to change of meeting location, from public to private, and the importance of the way I dressed, only a robe, was hard to deny. </p><p>Yet, there was something else as well. </p><p>“Please come in,” I said as I took a step back, gesturing her to walk in. She did, pushing the cart as well. Naturally, when she entered, the first thing she noticed was Penny, wearing a robe that was already too small for her beautiful curves before ceaselessly ruffling and displacing it in our little game. </p><p>I had no doubt that her face was contorted with a beautiful panic, but since she was frozen in shock and looking the other way, a casual observer like our aspiring receptionist could mistake that for dismissal. </p><p>“I-I shouldn’t interrupt,” she murmured as she pushed the cart panickedly before turned back. </p><p>“Where’s the hurry,” I said as I gestured for her to stay, not willing to miss such a beautiful moment and opportunity. “Penny and I can’t really finish all of it together. If you don’t have anything to do, why don’t you stay and help us?” I offered. </p><p>“I…” she murmured as she glanced at Penny, her eyes wide. Penny still looked the other way, inadvertently giving the impression of haughtiness. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you have work to do, you’re clearly out of your work clothes, so your shift should be over.”  </p><p>“It… It is,” she whispered as she closed her eyes, doubtlessly measuring the perks and challenges of making such a choice. She then opened her eyes and glanced around, focusing on Penny for a moment before her gaze slipped toward the half-open bedroom door, the angle just enough to notice the naked leg of an exhausted Nancy. </p><p>It was a rather exaggerated view about my approach of mixing business and pleasure. While I certainly enjoyed seducing the models I had worked with, I had never actually used that as a condition for their job. It only cheapened the beauty of the conquest.  </p><p>She was more than free to reject my advances, as long as she was a good model, I would continue work with them — which was, I had to admit, a rarity in the industry. </p><p>And, in my current persona-non-grata state, I was more than willing to drop the skill requirements for my models as well. As long as a model was beautiful and enthusiastic, I would work with them. No perks were necessary. </p><p>Of course, from the perspective of the cute brunette whose name I was yet to learn, the situation looked markedly different, so much that, I expected her to stammer an excuse and walk away. </p><p>Instead, she continued to push the cart toward the sofa. “Thanks,” she murmured, her stammer replaced by determination. </p><p>Interesting, I thought until she had pulled her phone to write a quick message, but on that message screen, I noticed a photo she had shared with a friend. </p><p>The cover of a global magazine, carrying a famous supermodel stuffed into a tight bikini. I was able to recognize it with a glance, because it was the single most high-profile job I had done — unfortunately, the celebration for said job managed to destroy my connections in the industry. After seeing that, I understood the sudden shift of attitude she was displaying, erroneously assuming I still maintained that level of career, and was determined to prove herself. </p><p>The question, just how determined she was for that proof of ability. </p><p>And while I never pushed it as a condition, I was more than enough to accept the benefits of such offerings directly. </p><p>“Why don’t you take a seat, I’ll handle the service,” I said as I gestured for her to sit next to Penny, who had a stony expression and a confident posture. Panic was still dancing in her beautiful eyes, of course, but it was hardly noticeable by another aspiring model. </p><p>She made eye contact, and after receiving a nod from me, changed her posture, not bothering to fix her clothing as she shuffled in place. </p><p>Interestingly, even a day before, Penny would have folded completely under such a surprise development. A day that started with sexy modeling and ended with a threesome clearly had some positive impact for her confidence, at least under the situation where I was there to help her mood.  </p><p>“This is Penny,” I said, gesturing at my beautiful busty blonde model. </p><p>“And I’m Laura,” she answered, looking hesitant as she gazed at Penny. An understandable attitude, as Penny was an impressive woman even when dressed casually. Dressed in an ill-fitting robe, her cleavage peeking beautifully, she looked more like a dream, the kind that would remind the other women of every single deficiency they possessed — and conjure a wreath of imaginary ones in the process. </p><p>The perfect view to blunt the confidence of an aspiring, determined model.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the end, this time, the decision didn’t require a long, stretched-out process where I measured a list of advantages and drawbacks. I had an incredibly beautiful — and incredibly deficiently dressed — beauty in front of me, lost in her pleasure enough to miss her own dress getting more and more inconsequential under, her arousal getting thicker and thicker under my fingers… </p><p>There was definitely no question, I decided even as my fingers rose higher, only to land on the small of her back, climbing upward. I had no intention of avoiding her hips, of course, but I wanted her to think that I would as I climbed up her back quickly, covering her back with a generous amount of massage oil, even using the opportunity to add some more Tantric energy to the mixture to further enhance her arousal. </p><p>I had to be careful around her wings, trying not to touch them, but luckily, isolating the heat as long as there was no direct touch was much easier — though, I had a feeling that, the challenge would have been much different if she was actively trying to weaponize those spectacular wings. </p><p>Then, after that brief climb, I was back to the small of her back.  My return was not something she had any problems with. She was even kind enough to let a strained gasp inform me of her happiness whenever my fingers brushed against the lines of her ass. </p><p>They were instinctual rather than deliberate as she slowly got lost in pleasure, of course, but that only made those cries more reliable. I decided to let my hands finally go and slide to her posterior. </p><p>Of course, that move wasn’t without its own little decision, whether to do it over her dress, or let the dress melt away even more. I glanced toward her head, only to see her face buried in the pillow, moaning softly, with no inclination to stop me despite my fingers getting more and more dangerous, I decided that the dress would be just a pointless distraction. </p><p>As I moved lower, my hands landing on her plump cheeks, the silvery fabric of the liquid dress avoided my touch, moving away, allowing me to caress her naked skin. She said nothing about my intrusion, which was more than enough as a permission under the circumstances. </p><p>The moan she let out as I started getting closer and closer to her core, on the other hand, could be considered as active permission. Still, I decided to use the opportunity to push for the next step, but only after a minute, pushing her pleasure to the next level.  </p><p>“Feel free to tell me if you can’t handle it,” I said, my tone mild as I said so. I spoke slowly, because if there was one thing that was clear, she had an overinflated sense of ego. The implication of my words, linking her ability to handle it with her capabilities were dangerous enough, and an arrogant voice would have triggered it. </p><p>Even at that moment, she raised her head, anger flashing in her gaze — one that was quickly replaced by panic as she took a notice of the current state of her dress. Yet, my earlier trick worked. As she took control of the dress and ordered it to grow back reflexively, any evidence of my tempering had been destroyed. </p><p>“I see, you want to stop,” I said as I pulled my hands back. “As you wish,” I added even as I reached to plug the massage oil back, my tone extremely respectful. </p><p>Yet, I was careful to push a dismissive glare on my face, one that only existed for a moment before getting removed, too short for her to point out, yet long enough for her to notice; the sudden flare of anger confirming that she had seen it. </p><p>It was a risky trick. Under different circumstances, it would have triggered a dangerous reaction from her, but her arousal was high enough to impair her decision-making, turning that from a certain to a low possibility. </p><p>Yet, there was no victory without taking the occasional risk, as her frozen expression showed me. </p><p>Then, she followed it with something that actually managed to surprise me. “Who told you you can stop?” she said as she waved her hand, and her dress started shrinking once more, getting smaller and smaller until it turned into panties, trusting her prone stance to hide her breasts from my attention. “I was just fixing my dress, continue,” she ordered. </p><p>It took every bit of my acting ability to maintain a respectful expression on my face rather than collapsing on the floor, cackling like a madman. I had already realized that she had a fragile ego, but reacting to such a degree, with such urgency… </p><p>It was even more fragile than I had expected. </p><p>How fun, I thought even as I put my hands on her ass, letting my fingers dance freely as I enjoyed the incredible texture of her skin, enough to prove her supernatural origin even without the impressive wings she had. </p><p>And, speaking of wings, I noticed that the way flames were flickering on them had changed as I returned on her ass, mauling aggressively. The tongues of fire got longer, their movement was more chaotic, the color deeper. </p><p>A beautiful sight, just not as beautiful as the view of her breasts, large and perky enough that laying on her chest was an imperfect solution to keep them hidden, their beauty enough to kill a weaker man. </p><p>My fingers danced around her ass, getting closer and closer to her core, making her tense in anticipation and fear, only to pull back before she could react, bringing her closer and closer to the climax as I applied my unique brand of magic — both the literal kind in the form of Tantric, and the figurative kind in terms of skills. </p><p>And, the combination worked wonders to build enough pressure to build her pleasure. While her panties provided an inconvenient barrier, and without their absence, I might have pushed to the next glorious stage. </p><p>Pity that she wouldn’t be tricked by the same ploy twice. </p><p>Instead, I waited until she was on the edge of climax before I grabbed her shoulder, and flipped her over before she could react. </p><p>For a moment, I glanced at her wings, whether they would burn the room, but they didn’t, showing that despite their fiery nature, they didn’t burn things. </p><p>Her arousal, right on the edge of a climax, was enough to slow down her reaction enough to allow me to grab her breasts and start teasing her nipples with the excuse of covering her body with oil, triggering her arousal. </p><p>She bit her lips desperately, her otherwise arrogant face painted with shock as she tried to contain the invasion of pleasure. She failed to contain that, but to her credit, she managed to limit her reaction to a few errant soft moans. </p><p>I would have loved to tease her about her achievement, but such verbal teasing would give her the excuse she needed to lash out. </p><p>Luckily, that was not the only way of teasing her. </p><p>While she dealt with the invasion of pleasure, I got another generous portion of massage oil and spread it all along her torso, her shoulders, and her stomach… </p><p>Her breasts…</p><p>I would have loved to focus on her breasts, but after the initial brush that triggered her climax, I moved down to her stomach, continuing with a clinical precision massage — one that was enough to extend her little climax. </p><p>She looked at me angrily as her arms twitched, making me wonder whether she wanted to cover her breasts or raise them to blast me with a cone of fire — I had never seen her cast an offensive spell, but her element of choice was not a difficult guess. </p><p>I turned away from her face, just enough to make it plausible for me to notice her sudden flare of anger. She swallowed it soon enough — though it left hints on the surface — once again the pointless form of pride was more efficient than chains to lead her decisions. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk even as I let my magic invade through her stomach once more, exploring the way her magic flowed under her skin even as I enjoyed her softness — the anger made her magic flow faster, which in turn allowed me to learn more about her casting abilities. </p><p>Not everything I had found was good news, of course. The deeper I got into her body, the more I started to realize just how much power she had underneath her beautiful body, ready to be leveraged to create a natural disaster. </p><p>Yet, even as I noticed the immensity of her power, my confidence in handling her in case of a magical altercation increased. Pure power was not everything, and knowing the secrets of an opponent would help greatly to the victory — especially if one could set the pace rather than just defending passively. Every second I spent on her body, the higher my chances of my victory were becoming. </p><p>Though that didn’t change my intention of avoiding such a battle in any condition, for a few reasons. First, with dozens of constructs in the place, it wouldn’t be a fair battle — though even thinking about the concept of fairness in a battle was amusing — and second, a battle would have ruined half of the capital. </p><p>Even under the ‘best’ of circumstances, it was not a commotion I wanted to be a part of, and the battle of two mysterious factions, strong enough to treat the Empire and Dark families as chess pieces, was hardly the best of circumstances. </p><p>Instead, I focused on the massage once more, letting my fingers climb up, brushing against the edge of her breasts… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Like the other traits I had received, enhanced Intimidation wasn’t a cure for all. A gaze didn’t allow me to send the running backs running away in fear, but it helped me to put a more imposing sight as I positioned myself at the correct spot, waiting for them to rush. </p><p>“Blue,” called Coach Spencer, and they dashed forward once more. Interestingly, number twenty-four was the target once more, no doubt a favor from Coach Spencer if I was reading his smirk correctly. </p><p>After all, for an experienced backup like him, punishing a player that joined the team recently should be a trivial achievement. </p><p>To his credit, he charged better this time, realizing I had no intention of making it easy for them to bully me. Yet, even if he did his best to slam his weight against me, it only resulted in an explosive collision. His momentum forced me to take a step back, but luckily, he failed to push forward without putting his knee on the ground. </p><p>“It was as light as a mosquito,” he said as he pushed his chest out, trying to look confident, though I was sure I wasn’t the only one that caught the weakness of his blustering tone. </p><p>Another win for me, I thought even as I glared at him, once again not bothering to say a word. Trash talking worked to anger them, but the silence was much better in unsettling people. </p><p>For all his faults, Coach Spencer wasn’t a complete idiot, and realized his player’s confidence was floundering. So, for the next attempt, it was the number twenty-two that was the target. </p><p>He was fully serious, and even as I was prepared for it, it didn’t go as well as I hoped. Just as I was trying to tackle him, he took a cross-step like he was about to juke forward. It was a trap. </p><p>It was too late when I realized that, and I was already throwing my weight to my right. He continued trucking, catching me in mid-move, his shoulder collapsing against my chest. </p><p>My feet lost contact with the ground as I had the dubious pleasure of unassisted flight for a fleeting second, interrupted only when my back hit against the turf. The collusion was painful enough to make me glad for the mouthpiece, allowing me to squeeze my teeth and hide my pain. </p><p>My movements weren’t exactly smooth as I stood up, but not crying in pain as I forced myself up was still positive. As I pushed myself up, I turned my gaze toward twenty-four, wordlessly promising the same pain to him. </p><p>It took a while for Coach Spencer to allow it. The next three attempts forced me to fight against twenty-two, though, aware that he optimized delivering pain, I deliberately stayed conservative. </p><p>Even if it allowed me to actually fake a very successful switch to free from my control area, freeing him for an effortless touchdown. </p><p>After that trick, the Intent I was receiving — already reduced thanks to my earlier flight — dropped even more, yet for the next attempt, I was able to read his fake accurately. I wasn’t a moron he could trick through the same attempt again and again, even though the cheers and insults of the offensive team were getting rather overwhelming. </p><p>Then, what I was waiting for happened. Coach Spencer called blue, forcing me to target twenty-four. </p><p>“It’s time for a trick of my own,” I murmured even as I made a move toward twenty-two like I had been successfully tricked, only to forcefully pivot a step later. </p><p>My target, expecting a quick success, was not prepared for a painful flying side tackle. He hit the floor painfully, rolling on the ground. </p><p>The sudden silence of the offensive team was beautiful, and the cheers of the defensive team weren’t too far away, clearly not enjoying the idea of one of them being bullied obviously. </p><p>“Maybe we shouldn’t mess with the chess players anymore,” shouted one of them, though it took a second for me to recognize it was Thad that shouted, the resulting laughter distracting me immensely. It only highlighted the humiliation of the poor running back, taught a lesson by a ‘weak’ nerd. </p><p>I might have been slightly annoyed by Thad’s words, but the sudden spike of Intent was more than enough to destroy that annoyance. Instead, I turned my gaze at my poor victim, still doing his best to stand up after the unexpectedly painful hit, even though my attention was on channeling the Intent I was receiving. </p><p>The amount truly surprised me, even more than the sudden flood I had received after my pool adventure with Megan. I waited until it settled, before I reached and triggered the System again. </p><p>[Strategy III, acquired]</p><p>[Strength I, acquired]</p><p>The increase in strategy was certainly welcome, though I had a feeling I could easily trace that to Thad mentioning that I was a chess player once more in a place close enough to the live stream he arranged. </p><p> Yet, the real win was the Strength had received. It was hard to measure the direct impact immediately, but considering the general benefit of Stamina and Recovery, I expected something between ten to twenty percent. </p><p>It didn’t sound as impressive, but considering I was benching a touch above two hundred and twenty under optimal condition, and a top-tier linebacker player usually benched around three hundred, an additional twenty percent was a very significant increase, the kind that required months of dedicated training and good genetics. </p><p>Just in case I had been measuring it wrongly, I didn’t push myself to the limit during my next confrontation with number twenty-two, yet, I managed to take him down, keeping him less than two yards progress after the initial contact despite that. </p><p>A fleeting smirk popped onto my face, one that worked much better than my earlier intimidating attempts. From my opponent’s perspective, unless I received a dose of adrenaline, it was impossible for me to increase my strength. </p><p>Luckily, in his perspective, there was a more reasonable excuse. I was holding back all along. </p><p>“Again,” he growled angrily, clearly feeling insulted that a backup player dared to mock him that way. His gaze at Coach Spencer showed that he had no intention of letting twenty-four have that attempt. </p><p>Recognizing the sudden change of atmosphere, both teams suddenly got silent. “Damn, maybe Thad is right,” one of the defensive players murmured. “We shouldn’t mess with the nerds too much they also come in this variety.” </p><p>While the murmurs continued, I lined against the running back, waiting for the coach’s order. Though, seeing the angry expression on number twenty-two, I smirked, wide enough to be noticed. </p><p>If Intimidation didn’t work against him, there was always Taunt. </p><p>The moment Coach Spencer whistled, we dashed against each other. Number twenty-four, wise enough to catch the mood, stayed behind, letting us contend directly. </p><p>And I was glad for that, because even with the sudden increase in my strength, the collusion was enough to throw me a couple steps behind before I could take him down, the pain radiating significantly. </p><p>The impact was much more different once my opponent was serious. </p><p>“Again,” he growled as he walked back to his position, ready to rush once more. Happy with the Intent flowing to me, I was more than happy to comply. Another rush, another collision, my natural pain resistance the only thing keeping me upright even with the assistance of my Traits. </p><p>After all, while we mocked the offensive team for being soft and weak, it was mostly about the tactical ineptitude and the lack of preparation. Some of the players still did their best to maintain their personal excellence. </p><p>And my current opponent was certainly one of those. Though, after three more attempts, I noticed the earlier anger had disappeared, replaced by blind fury. For some people, myself included, anger burned cold, allowing them to plan and react better. For most, it was a hot emotion, forcing them to make mistakes even if it helped them to perform better physically. </p><p>My opponent was clearly a volcano, if his flushing face and widening nostrils were any indicators. At this point, it was no longer about defending the honor of the offensive team, or his quarterback. </p><p>It was personal. </p><p>A halfway-aware Coach would have recognized the signs and stopped the training. Luckily, Coach Spencer was certainly not one of those, unaware of the upcoming explosion. </p><p>Much better, I thought, readying myself for a painful collision. Yet, before Coach Spencer called another repeat, I noticed Coach Bill walking toward us, no doubt intending to stop us as he recognized the change. I didn’t want to miss such an excellent opportunity to farm more Intent, not after everything had been set with such excellence. </p><p>I raised my arms slightly, and mimed a chicken. </p><p>My opponent said nothing, nor that he needed to. The angry growl he let out as he dashed forward was more than enough. Though, despite his anger, he still maintained the standard rush posture. </p><p>I dashed forward as well, just a step slower. </p><p>If I had been as angry, I would have greeted him with a direct hit, turning it into direct competition. Yet, just before the collision, I forced myself to take a dangerously wide step, forcibly changing the angle of collusion, forcibly unbalancing him. </p><p>It wasn’t a smooth delivery. If he wasn’t that angry, he could have easily used that to walk around me and pay me back. Yet, with his anger burning bright, he wanted to make me pay, the fact that I never tried a trick like that against him limiting his wariness even more. </p><p>And just like that, I hit from the side, in a way he didn’t expect. Yet, even then, I had to grab his face mask and push him down. It was certainly an illegal move deserving of a penalty if that was an official match, but people that were watching from the live stream didn’t care, if the sudden burst of Intent I received was any indicator. </p><p>Nor did the defensive players care if their laughter and jeers were any indicator. The offensive ones started cursing and shouting, not appreciating the low blow. Twenty-two, from his position on the ground, looked angry enough to kill me.  </p><p>“Enough,” Coach Bill spoke. Compared to the others shouting and crying, it was barely more than a whisper, yet everyone fell silent. Even the unlucky running back stopped his actions. “Our new recruit proved himself. Gather around, it’s time for the next step.”</p><p>Just like that, the event was over. </p><p>But not before giving me some more spectacular gains. </p><p>[Intimidation III, acquired]</p><p>[Agility I, acquired]</p><p>All around, an amazing training.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“D-done,” she stammered as she took a step back, a deep blush on her beautiful face. Then, she reached for a uniform of her own and turned to me. “Now, leave!” </p><p>“Do you think that’s fair after you get such a good view of my body?” I asked, her sharpness enough to put a smirk on my face even as her fury grew. </p><p>“If you think I’m going to undress in front of you—“ she started, her voice getting louder with every word. It was nice to see that she had an actual temper behind the impervious aura she was trying to convey. </p><p>Just for that reason, I was tempted to let her anger continue growing as I teased, but the amusement factor it created wasn’t worth the risk of the delay. We had already spent too much time in the base, and the more we stayed inside, the more difficult it would be for us to escape successfully. </p><p>And that was not something I wanted to test the limits. </p><p>Even under the best of circumstances and against an ordinary Patrician house, attacking their Estate as just a Sorcerer was a way of committing suicide. Exchange an ordinary house with House Junia, the strongest Patrician house — which was even stronger than the public perception considering the amount of treasure hidden in their research base — and add in the fact that my ally had an extremely poor combat attitude compared to her vaunted rank, but also already exhausted to the limit, and the suicidal nature of such an event just doubled further. </p><p>Though, technically, my own condition was a plus. After I had merged with that huge dragon heart, my magical power multiplied. I didn’t know the exact limits of the power I reached. Yes, it had ruined my control in the process, but that was not very relevant in a straightforward battle. </p><p>Under overwhelming power, no defense worked. </p><p>Of course, that was under one important assumption. I could actually cast any spells without burning myself, which, unfortunately, wasn’t a given. </p><p>Ultimately, one thing was certain. We didn’t have the luxury of wasting time, forcing me to reject the temptation of teasing my reluctant ally. </p><p>“You’re not going to change, you’re going to stay in your usual clothes.” </p><p>“I don’t understand,” she asked. “Wouldn’t it raise an alarm?” </p><p>“That’s the only thing we can do. I can’t cast anything without bringing half of Rome chasing us and risking exploding myself, and you can’t cast illusions. Things would have been different if the mages among them had been wearing robes in a style that could conceal you, but that’s not the case. Adding a hood would be more suspicious than trying to bluff that you have a mission.” </p><p>“And do you think you can convince the guards that they are allowing me to leave with only one guard?” </p><p>“Maybe,” I said. “Either we convince them, or we make a run for it. Sometimes, acting directly is the better option. How well can you ride?” </p><p>“N-not bad,” she stammered, but her blush suggested she might be slightly exaggerating her ability. </p><p>“Maybe one horse then,” I suggested. “But it’ll get tired carrying both of us.” </p><p>“I can remove its exhaustion, it’s not a difficult spell,” she answered. </p><p>“Good, then start sealing the dragon hearts and the weapons, and we can leave.” </p><p>“For how long you can seal them?” </p><p>“After that battle?” she said. “I’m too exhausted. Maybe an hour, anything more would make me collapse unconscious.” </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured as I looked at Dragon Hearts and weapons, quickly separating them into many groups. I pointed to the first group. “Seal these with a weak one, so that they only last for a minute,” I said before turning my attention to the next group. “Seal these for fifteen minutes…” I continued, creating a wide variety of sealing. </p><p>“Why something so complicated?” she asked, which was enough to confirm for me that she didn’t have a mind for more mundane aspects of trickery. </p><p>“Just do it,” I said, not wanting to bother to explain, and when she finished, I threw her the biggest remaining piece. “And seal this for as long as you can manage without compromising your ability. It’s going to be your ace in case of an emergency.” </p><p>“And how about you—” she started to ask, only to stop halfway, remembering that I was not exactly suffering for extra magic power. “Silly question,” she said. </p><p>“Don’t worry about me,” I said as I flipped my spear, then, patted on my side, touching the sword hanging on my belt and the bow hanging on my back simultaneously, though the bow was covered with a cloth to hide its extraordinary gold look. </p><p>Its looks didn’t match with more utilitarian looks of the Patrician weapons, suggesting that it didn’t belong to Rome, but there was no doubt that it was strong enough to rival the others. </p><p>Luckily, it was a common practice to keep bows covered to protect them from the effects of the weather, so it wasn’t too suspicious of a move. </p><p>“Can you use those?” she asked, looking suspiciously. </p><p>“Well, we’ll find out if we face a disaster,” I said with a smirk that looked more confident than I had been feeling. Handling a Patrician class weapon was certainly not simple, but compared to the other risks I was taking, it didn’t even register properly. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said as I gestured for her to follow, and we arrived at the entrance. Without anyone to control it, it was easy for Xia to control the ward and open the entrance once more. </p><p>I walked out of the building first, dressed as a guard, carrying a large bundle in my hand — that contained all the weapons we took from the base. </p><p>Yet, as I took a step, the first rays of the morning hit my face, proof that I had spent way more time than I had been planning inside the base. The good news, there wasn’t a huge army that surrounded the secret base, which told me that the modifications I had done on the wards to block communication worked. </p><p>Bad news, my absence still managed to trigger some kind of commotion. By the courtesy of my visual abilities, increased even further, I could hear more than one servant walking around, asking whether the others had managed to find the lost barbarian with increasing panic. </p><p>Not exactly what I had been looking for. </p><p>Xia was just a couple steps behind me. Lacking my senses, she was aware of the additional commotion that was going on. “Are you sure I shouldn’t disguise myself as a mage? Or at least another guard?” she asked, looking hesitant.</p><p>“The answer is the same unless you managed to learn how to create a convincing illusion in the last few minutes,” I answered, doing my best to look expressionless as I started walking toward the gates, Xia just a step behind me. </p><p>I moved forward, tapping into the more ordinary aspects of the abilities I had developed as a child, in particular, disguises. The biggest part of any disguise was the attitude. People were much more willing to go along as long as they were confronted by something familiar. </p><p>So, as I walked toward the guard, my face was expressionless, my steps sharp, doing my best to look like a brainwashed warrior. </p><p>Meanwhile, the guards were dealing with the exit of one of the noble parties — the beautiful woman in the carriage one of the ones I had been acquainted with the last night closely, sitting next to her clueless husband. </p><p>I smiled at their presence, and not just because of the pleasant memories of her beautiful cries. The existence of the noble party at the gate meant most of the guards were distracted by them, making my job easier. </p><p>It turned out that my luck was not limited to that, because as I got nearer, the horses of the noble party started to shuffle uncomfortably. Though, when I walked closer, only for their panicked faces to turn toward me while they started making scared voices, I realized that it might not be luck. </p><p>They were feeling my aura even when I was trying to suppress it, I realized. With that, it wasn’t entirely shocking, considering I had used the same aura to dominate an actual Nemean Lion into submission. </p><p>Compared to a mythical beast, an ordinary horse was nothing. </p><p>With most of the guards paying attention to the horses, I hoped that I could slip unnoticed, but the guard captain noticed me and walked toward me. “Where are you going?” he asked, though, behind his confident tone, I could hear his hesitancy. </p><p>He was just as comfortable as the warriors in black, just hid better than the ordinary guards. </p><p>“Mission,” I said sharply.</p><p> “And you’re taking the Sorceress with me, yet only one guard. That’s not allowed,” he commented, looking suspicious. </p><p>His comment was reasonable, and the determination mixed with his fear suggested that he was willing to argue that point. </p><p>But I had other options than my words.</p><p>“Mission,” I repeated, but this time, letting my aura slip just a bit as I did so, making my words hit him with the strength of an avalanche. He took a step back fearfully, but it was nothing compared to the reaction of the animals. Their fear finally broke through their attitude, and they started a panicked canter, spreading the party. </p><p>The guard captain looked at me hesitantly before rushing toward the carriage of the nobles, deciding that dealing with one of the black warriors was not as important as preventing a noble from getting injured at his gate. </p><p>As I started to walk, the Sorceress behind me, I gestured to her twice, using prearranged signs we had discussed. And just like that, a small dagger floated off the bundle I was carrying, and went inside the window of the guard house, while a small dragon heart flew fast toward the carriage of the nobles, lodging underneath their carts, their concealment aura about to be dispersed in a couple minutes. </p><p>The perfect distraction for us to use while we got away. </p><p>With that, I stepped outside the gate, feeling the oppressive weight of the Estate Wards disappear… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The smile bloomed on Marianne’s face as she found herself in a new position, one that signified the massage was over. </p><p>“About time,” she growled as she shifted in her place, trying to get comfortable. Titania said nothing, but that didn’t mean her answer was more subdued. Her lips were busy with letting out a delicious moan. </p><p>Understandable, as Marianne’s shuffle on top of her didn’t exactly help her to get calm after her spectacular climax. </p><p>I paused for a moment, enjoying the scene of their beautiful bodies rubbing against each other, especially the beautiful sight of their breasts pressing against each other, dominated by the weight of the moment. </p><p>Yet, Marianne didn’t seem to be happy about that pause. “Hurry up,” she whispered, gasping loudly as she did so. </p><p>“Such impatience,” I whispered even as I slapped her ass, enjoying the moan that escaped her mouth, particularly the way her flesh rippled. “Don’t worry, I’ll start working on you properly. But first, let’s make sure that our dear librarian doesn’t say anything. You know that I’m too shy to handle a sudden comment. What if she hurts my confidence.” </p><p>“Yes. You’re a walking embodiment of embarrassment, I’m sure you can’t handle a little comment,” Marianne said as she chuckled. </p><p>“Of course I am,” I said, even with the Subterfuge, barely managing to sound serious. “Now, start working on silencing her.” </p><p>“As you wish,” Marianne answered as she leaned down, showing that while she enjoyed the banter, she didn’t enjoy it as much as what she wanted to start. </p><p>“W-wait —“ Titania murmured panicked, but, with the closeness of their lips, that was all she was able to utter before Marianne’s lips landed on their target, burying the rest of her attempt rather efficiently. Marianne was more than enthusiastic as she launched her assault, enjoying the sweetness of Titania’s mouth. </p><p>Though, considering the way their tongue twirled with great practice, I couldn’t help but assume our after-battle celebration wasn’t the only time they had been practicing that particular move. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I twirled my fingers into Marianne’s soft blonde hair, giving just enough pull to extract a little gasp, but not enough to pull her back from the kiss. “You’re certainly benefiting from lots and lots of practice.” </p><p>Titania’s tongue stilled at the notification, but Marianne just continued to kiss. Seeing Marianne getting comfortable with some girl-on-girl action was not exactly a big revelation, not with how our little relationship started. </p><p>That didn’t mean that it was impossible to interrupt her, of course. There were several ways to do so, ranging in various difficulties and impacts. </p><p>I chose the most direct way and slid inside her, not that the simplicity meant the impact was limited. Already aroused from the show she had been watching, the sudden push triggered Marianne, resulting in a spectacular moan that forced her to pull back from the kiss. </p><p>One that she didn’t return, but Titania didn’t seem to mind, especially when Marianne started kissing her neck instead, occasionally alternating to light nibbles to trigger her pleasure even more. Titania didn’t respond, too busy moaning in pleasure. </p><p>And, keeping her included even gave me a little surprise reward. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>Luckily for Marianne, I was there to compensate for Titania’s lack of response. I grabbed her amazing hips, enjoying their tightness even as I created leverage, then started pushing my hips. </p><p>Which came with its own reward. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 76%]</p><p>As my hips started picking up speed, Marianne’s moans started to get more frequent, to the point of neglecting Titania’s neck, allowing her to finally get a handle of the haze of the pleasure. </p><p>I managed to catch her eyes when Marianne’s back arched after a particularly hard push. “She’s being too loud,” I said to Titania. “Why don’t you help her keep silent so her voice doesn’t alert any nearby beasts.” </p><p>As far as the excuses go, that was a rather lazy one, considering that three of us were not only capable enough to defeat a hostile army theoretically but literally had done so a few days ago, and no monster that could be found in the wild would have been a threat to us. </p><p>At least, not any monsters that would still need to depend on our voices to find us. </p><p>However, at the moment, with her mind blanked in pleasure, Titania lacked the mental alacrity to point out that fact. Not that she would have chosen to argue at that point even if she was in a better mental state, not with the rush she caught Marianne’s lips like she was just waiting for an excuse. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at Titania’s attitude, impressing me with her shyness. It seemed that her habit of authority was still not translating to the bedroom — or the other places where we experienced our fun. </p><p>I decided to help her a bit. “Marianne is moving too much, why don’t you help me with that as well by wrapping your beautiful legs around her waist so that she can slow down.” </p><p>Her embarrassment didn’t slow her response to direct order. Her legs, deceptively strong despite their thinness — a fact that I was intimately familiar with — wrapped around Marianne’s waist, slowing her wild rocking. </p><p>Marianne let out a surprised grunt that managed to escape Titania’s attempts to silence her, showing that she was not as intimately familiar with the strength hidden in her legs. Which would have suggested a lack of physical contact between them if it wasn’t for the familiarity of her kiss, but with that, the real reason was clear. </p><p>Titania had stayed passive enough to keep that as a secret during their little carnal games, to the point that she had never employed her full physical strength even for the purposes of fun.</p><p>What a waste, especially with such a soft beauty like Marianne that enjoyed the other side of the little games of domination. Not that seeing my blonde busty healer taking the dominant role for once wasn’t extremely entertaining. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 78%]</p><p>Under the double assault, Marianne’s companion progress was paying dividends rather rapidly. I decided to give a little reward as well, the kind that actually impacted her combat ability. </p><p>[-2310 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Tantric] </p><p>Her moan intensified as my mana invaded her body, but she didn’t bother to comment on the sudden rush of experience, far too familiar with the phenomenon to bother even wasting a second on that. </p><p>I smiled at the relative ease Tantric had gained another small improvement — though I was aware that there wouldn’t be a lot of people that would classify spending more than two thousand mana in a single burst as a trivial achievement. </p><p>I continued my urgent assault, but not in a steady manner. After all, with the great effort, she was showing, Titania had earned a more direct involvement. I pulled out Marianne — immediately replacing the resulting lack of attention with my fingers — only to slip right back into Titania, which changed their roles about who was responsible for silencing, and who was the one being silenced. </p><p>To their credit, their lips never parted even as alternated between them, lost in the pleasure of the moment. </p><p>It was a beautiful moment, I decided even as I tightened my grip around Marianne’s hair and pushed her down, forcing her to intensify their kiss even as I impaled her repeatedly from behind. </p><p>“I’m sure you didn’t work closely with the students, but as the head librarian, you need to learn how to take a firm hand with the students. You can’t just assume you can intimidate them,” I explained, even though I doubted Titania was in a state to process that explanation. </p><p>Marianne stiffened slightly, showing that she didn’t appreciate my push, but under my merciless pounding, she was unable to comment even before I added a light sprinkle of spanks to the mix. </p><p>With no words, the beautiful meadow we were enjoying was filled with moans, spanks, and cries of ecstasy, their attention split between my alternating assault and the attention of each other. </p><p>My hips continued to move in an endless rhythm, the growing pleasure allowing me to get more and more </p><p>I continued pushing my hips, wanting nothing more than to get lost in pleasure as deeply as the two beauties in front of me… </p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>Unfortunately, I had another task. </p><p>Understanding what was going on with the Companion Process. </p><p>After all, with my growing distrust of the System, it would be a silly thing to continue to rely on the System in such a fundamental aspect of my power. </p><p>And, in that area, there were several questions to answer. </p><p>Why did completions in Companion Process was rewarding me with incredible bursts of experience? Why it was allowing me to gather mana one at a speed that reached the point of impossible through perks? Why it was giving me incredible perks that were several times more useful than levels — even at the risk of being dangerously explosive? </p><p>And, most importantly… </p><p>Whether I could replicate it without the assistance of the System… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 33 Experience: 532660 / 561000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6732 / 6732 Mana: 6728 / 8250 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [102/110]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As usual, I started with a spell to coat my fingers with massage oil, once again leveraging the more utilitarian aspects of my Biomancy Skill, enjoying the convenience it provided. </p><p>[-281 Mana]</p><p>My mana consumption was much higher than that trick required, but that wasn’t exactly useful. Most of the mana I had spent wasn’t consumed by the oil spell, but carefully mixed into the outcome as I prepared for my next trick, ready to deliver a proper infusion of mana along with with the massage. </p><p>I wanted to do to test the tricks I had learned after working on Janelor. </p><p>Marianne and Titania wouldn’t benefit from that as intensely as Janelor, but that didn’t mean that it would be completely wasteful. Especially since I was carefully manipulating the mana into a warm sensation with the assistance of Tantric. </p><p>Marianne’s moans rose, more intense than usual, showing her appreciation for my new trick. </p><p>“Well, this feels nostalgic,” I murmured even as I let my hands dance on Marianne’s back, couldn’t help but remember how our relationship started, first through trickery, then through addicting her to my touch, making her moan more and more… </p><p>“S-shut up,” Marianne murmured while I covered her back with the massage oil, clearly feeling self-conscious about the memories. Just not enough to actually ask me to stop,  instead arching her back in appreciation. </p><p>I chuckled as I finished covering her back, then let the oil warm over her body while I turned to Titania, who was lying on her back. </p><p>“Someone is enthusiastic,” I murmured with a chuckle even as I caught Titania’s gaze, enjoying her blush even before I started working on her body. And, since she lay in such an inviting pose, I decided to take that as an invitation for a more aggressive start. </p><p>And started by squeezing her beautiful breasts. </p><p>Titania didn’t answer, busy moaning as I squeezed her nipples. </p><p> “Damn, it just had been a few days, but I missed you two,” I said with a smirk even as I let my hands climb up to her neck, not wanting to push her too fast and too hard because just after a few touches, she was showing the signs of melting. </p><p>Yet, even as I slowed down the treatment, I was amazed at the speed Titania was folding, suggesting that, after getting used to the sensation of pleasure, she was developing a weakness to it. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>The notification that popped into my sight was certainly as welcome as her moans, giving me a little burst of power to push me toward the next level. I continued to work on her neck as I enjoyed her shivers, signaling her anticipation, filled with desire. </p><p>I let my hands wander on her body momentarily to cover the rest of her body with the massage oil before going back to her neck, applying the full range of my massage skills to her in a soft gentleness. </p><p>A subtle purr started escaping her mouth soon as my fingers destroyed the stress she had accumulated during her extended mission. Yet, I pulled back to attend to the other naked beauty that was waiting for me, terminated Titania’s service momentarily. </p><p>Titania sent a fleeting glare toward me as I pulled my hands away, clearly unhappy with the early stop. “We’re just warming up, sweetie,” I said as I put my hands on Marianne’s curvy body once more. “A little patience.” </p><p>Titania didn’t look particularly happy about that idea, but that didn’t prevent her from starting to watch me as I started working on Marianne’s body properly. </p><p>“You’re right, a little patience—“ Marianne tried to tease Titania, only for her words to fade into a moan as my fingers danced along her spine, finding one of her many sensitive spots to trigger a moan. </p><p>It was Titania’s turn to chuckle as I continued to tease Marianne… </p><p>As much as I wanted to move to the main event, I wanted the girls to rest after their difficult mission as well, so I restricted myself to massaging them for the next several minutes, alternating between them, destroying the stiffness that had been accumulated during their tedious mission.  </p><p>It was not without its benefits, of course, as playing with Titania gave me rather beautiful rewards, which, while not enough to make me reach the next level, pushed me to the border of it.  </p><p>[+1000 Experience] </p><p>It was time to push for even more. </p><p>I focused on Titania even more, grabbing her legs as I continued to massage her inner thighs, her eyes closed under the invasion of pleasure. Therefore, she didn’t notice my spell to get rid of my clothes. </p><p>Marianne noticed it, but rather than complaining, she shifted her position to get a better view of the show, her eyes brimming with enthusiasm. </p><p>Titania’s rumbling and mewling were interrupted when I slid inside her without a warning, the sensation of her warmth enveloping my shaft unmatched. </p><p>Though, the emotions triggered by the double-notification were a close second. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 76%]</p><p>I let my gaze slip back to Marianne, catching her gaze for a fleeting moment, whose lips were curled in amusement as she watched Titania’s spectacular moan in amusement. I couldn’t help but feel that her amusement was more about the fact that Titania was more hesitant than her in bed than the pleasure she was deriving from the view. </p><p>Not that the pleasure she was deriving from the scene was not significant, evidenced by the way her fingers disappeared inside her, dancing around her knob mercilessly. </p><p>Watching Marianne was fun, but not as much as watching Titania who was busy gasping and moaning under my surprise assault, the calm yet steady invasion of my shaft working wonders to resolve the last scraps of the stress she was suffering under. </p><p>Rather effectively. </p><p>Her moans got only more intense as I slid my hands under her hips, raising them to a more convenient angle for my repeated invasions while my fingers dug into her tight ass. </p><p>“So, tell me, how was the mission?” I asked with a casualness that contrasted greatly with my other actions. </p><p>“R-right now?” Titania managed to stammer between her moans as she opened her eyes. </p><p>“Why not?” I answered, trying to look calm, but unable to prevent an amused quirk of my lips. </p><p>Titania’s look of surprise was beautiful. “M-maybe Marianne can explain instead,” she offered. </p><p>I looked at Marianne, who was busy enjoying the show we were putting on in a way that kept her fingers very busy. “She is clearly busy, it would be rude to ask her,” I said. Titania sent me a frustrated glare, but that was all she could do, as before she spoke, I quickened my hips, the intensifying pleasure burning her words. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t handle it?” Marianne commented from the side between her moans, followed by a chuckle. </p><p>Titania’s blush was simply beautiful. “Of course I can,” she declared with a dedication that reminded me of the times I had only seen as the scary head librarian that I could never touch. “The mission started by targeting several rumored undead presence, though we didn’t expect to find much,” Titania said. </p><p>“Let me guess, because of some internal analysis, discounting the possibility of a significant undead presence,”  I said. </p><p>“Exactly, someone was clearly fiddling with the reports to make us underestimate the undead presence. The potential was much more than we expected, ready to invade the nearby cities once the initial armies sieged Silver Spires, making it almost impossible to reinforce the area.” </p><p>“Therefore forcing the headmistress to take personal action,” I suggested. </p><p>“E-exactly,” Titania said, agreeing with my conclusion before giving a more detailed report of their mission, including the distribution of the undead presence between different bases and the minor challenges they faced. </p><p>It didn’t take long for her determination to start fading, her words interrupted by her frequent moans. I had no doubt that, if we were alone, she would have folded already, but with Marianne watching with a smug smirk, occasionally supported by her teasing remarks, Titania persisted in her determination. </p><p>And I received my reward soon after. </p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 79%]</p><p>[Level Up!] </p><p>I didn’t even think before selecting my new skill, finally pushing Tantric to the next level. </p><p>[Grandmaster Tantric (100/110)] </p><p>On the one hand, it was not a good feeling to sacrifice my flexibility, the greatest reason for the chain of success I had been enjoying since that fateful day I had gained my first experience, showing that I wasn’t a waste — at least in a world that measured success with martial might. </p><p>Not that I could blame them, not with a world rife with danger. I had lost count of the times I would have met an unfortunate end if it wasn’t for my rapidly-growing strength, as well as the utility of my growing list of skills. </p><p>Yet, ironically, Tantric, despite its abject uselessness in combat, was the only option for me to select to increase my survival ability, for one simple reason. </p><p>It worked even when isolated from the System. I didn’t know why or how, I didn’t even know whether it could be actually relied on or was an illusion. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the first time I was made to make a choice despite lacking information…  </p><p>I put my hand on Titania’s breasts, invading her Soul Space to reinforce it more, which took more mana than it took me to actually destroy an army with my current skills, but earning a welcome notification in return. </p><p>[-2129 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Tantric]</p><p>“I think that’s enough reporting,” I said as I grabbed Marianne’s hand and pulled her over to Titania, creating a delicious sandwich for my pleasure for my own enjoyment. </p><p>“It’s time to start the proper celebration.” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 33 Experience: 528660 / 561000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6732 / 6732 Mana: 6728 / 8250 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [101/110]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Playing with Natalie and Jenny was fun, but considering signs of exhaustion already showing on Natalie’s beautiful face, no doubt the effects of a sleepless night where she imagined what I was doing with her girlfriend. </p><p>And I doubted the lengthy flight helped. </p><p>A lengthy flight on economy-class, as, after all, I was aware of her financial status, and while she was making much more thanks to my help, her spending habits had jumped up in a similar manner — and it wasn’t helped when Jenny stopped working due to her pregnancy. And the company certainly didn’t allow business class for company events, even for the directors. </p><p>I wouldn’t have rejected to help at this point if she asked, of course, but Natalie still had her pride — however damaged and bruised — which prevented her from probing for direct financial assistance. </p><p>I didn’t push her about that, not when I could wait until a critical moment to help.  </p><p>There was a reason for that choice. Even now, Natalie was not the kind of person that would appreciate kindness, and would only take it as a sign of weakness. If I started helping them without a great need, Natalie would catch the opportunity to push for it. </p><p>However, as I arrived at one of the breakfast restaurants, I stopped thinking about Natalie, a more important topic stealing priority. </p><p>Brenda and Umi, sitting at the same table. </p><p>Of course, they were not alone, as Umi’s fiancee — whose name I failed to remember — was on the table, and just to make things more fun, he was having trouble keeping his gaze away from Brenda’s cleavage. </p><p>In his defense, Brenda’s cleavage was hard to ignore as she was only wearing her bikini — red and black to highlight her beauty, and just as revealing as one would expect from Brenda. She had a beach dress on, but it was a transparent one, which only worked to add a beautiful sense of mystery to her amazing cleavage.</p><p>Umi’s stormy expression suggested that she didn’t consider Brenda’s dress a good excuse for her fiancee to turn to her cleavage every couple of seconds — probably still under the impression that he managed to hide his occasional gazes. </p><p>Brenda was smiling subtly whenever Umi shuffled in her seat in discomfort, enjoying her power.  </p><p>That hardly surprised me, as Brenda was even worse than Natalie when it came to enjoying others’ misfortune, though with a correspondingly weaker will and a penchant for luxuries that made it much easier to manage her with a stiff hand.</p><p>And, the way Umi dressed made it much easier for Brenda to achieve her mission. Thanks to our recent adventure, I was very much acquainted with Umi’s body, enough to know that she had the assets to compete with Brenda. Not in every aspect, but each woman had their unique advantages. </p><p>Unfortunately, at the moment, Umi just faded against Brenda. </p><p>It was not shocking, as Brenda was dressed to maximize the impact of her amazing curves and smooth skin, but Umi failed on that aspect. Not only she was wearing a one-piece, but she was also wearing one that would be classified as boring even among them, more appropriate to be worn by a grandmother to hide her faults. </p><p>And not by an exotic beauty like Umi, with a flawless body and curves to die for. </p><p>What a pity, I thought as I watched her fiancee pay more attention to Brenda than the shy beauty. </p><p>I decided to join them. Just to make sure my dear employees were having a nice event, of course, nothing else. </p><p>That was what I needed to do as a good boss!</p><p>“Good morning,” I said as I walked to the table, and sat next to Brenda without even bothering to ask for permission. After all, there were perks to being a boss, and I was just thick-skinned enough to leverage that. </p><p>“G-good morning, boss,” Umi’s fiancee said as he noticed my presence, even reflexively making a motion to stand up before he caught himself. </p><p>“Hello, sir,” Brenda said as she changed her posture, in a way a less attentive observer might have assumed out of respect, but it would mean that that observer missed the way she had pushed her chest out to maximize the impact of her cleavage. </p><p>While Brenda was doing her best to give me an attractive glimpse of her peaks, Umi was busy blushing, no doubt remembering the spectacular events of the night before, the impact even stronger since she was sitting next to the clueless guy. </p><p>Who had sent her to entertain me in the first place, wildly underestimating the lengths I would go. </p><p>Her fiancee proved that he lacked the sensitivity to catch the exact nature of her blush, and poked her side. “Why don’t you greet my boss, I need to impress him to get my promotion,” he whispered, probably assuming he couldn’t be heard.</p><p>He wasn’t loud enough to be heard, of course, but that didn’t prevent me from reading his lips. I wasn’t an expert, but I could easily read such a simple statement. </p><p>“Charlie,” Umi gasped in response, trying to convey her unwillingness while reminding me of his name as an added benefit. Yet, she only received another poke in response, his expression impatient. </p><p>That impatient yet dismissive expression alone was enough to tell me that Umi didn’t share even a hint about what truly happened during that night with him. Umi looked at him angrily, blaming him for trying to push her. </p><p>It was delicious anger, the kind that I could never trigger on my own. After the last night’s adventure, Umi was already feeling self-conscious about her guilt, and was clearly looking for an outlet that would help her lessen that sensation. </p><p>Tiffany was not a good target, as while she pushed Umi more, she was also in the same boat with her. More accurately, she managed to sell that impression, positioning herself as the tragic loyal wife working for her husband’s benefit by keeping the old, lecherous boss happy. </p><p>Normally, as the old, lecherous boss in question, I would have been an excellent target for the frustration and guilt Umi was struggling with after the spectacular hot tub fun, but before that could come to hold, a little snag appeared. </p><p>Charlie seemed determined to be the target of her frustrations. </p><p>And since he wanted to make such a beautiful sacrifice for me, I decided to help him a bit. While they were distracted by their short yet intense discussion, I leaned toward Brenda and whispered. “Keep him distracted, and you’ll win a shopping trip,” I whispered. </p><p>The reward didn’t even make me blink. I had already promised a stopping trip to Tiffany, and bringing Brenda along would just make it more entertaining, maybe to the point of creating a fun adventure. </p><p>Brenda’s smirk widened at my words, then she turned her attention to Charlie. </p><p>Meanwhile, their little discussion came to an end with a frustrated Umi and a satisfied Charlie, giving me a clue about the victorious party. “How are you since the last night, sir?” Umi asked forcibly, unhappy with the little struggle. </p><p>“A bit exhausted. I had stayed up for a long time after you left. But nothing a morning swim couldn’t fix,” I answered. Umi blushed deeply, astute enough to realize the reason for my late departure.  </p><p>Her blush was intense enough to tell a man even as obtuse as her fiancee that there was something wrong, but luckily, Brenda chose that moment to interject. “Oh, lucky,” she gasped. “I’m so jealous. I have always been a poor swimmer,” she said as she mimed. </p><p>Which was not as innocent as words might imply, not with her amazing bosom and the tiny bikini she was wearing. </p><p>She might be a lousy secretary, but she was an expert when it came to playing with men. </p><p>Distracted by Brenda’s rippling bosom, Charlie failed to notice Umi’s growing blush. Charlie asked a question about swimming, Brenda responded as she leaned forward to enhance her cleavage even more. </p><p>Distracted enough to miss the flinch of his fiancee when I raised my foot and caressed her inner thigh. Her eyes widened beautifully as she sent a panicked glare to Charlie… </p><p>Only to see him peering deep into Brenda’s tits, almost hypnotized, as Brenda moved her shoulders repeatedly to show her swimming technique. </p><p>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned was certainly an accurate statement, because Umi said nothing, just turned back to me, standing still as I caressed her inner thigh, next to her fiancee. </p><p>Admittedly, it was nothing compared to the lengths we had gone the last night, but those had been only possible thanks to her submissive personality, lost in the haze of the moment, but it was different to see her primed by anger, enough to allow me play with her under the table while she glanced at the man that was enraptured by the show Brenda was providing. </p><p>An excellent opportunity, one that I decided to leverage even more.  </p><p>“I have rented a small boat for a quick adventure before the event starts. Why don’t you come with me and I can teach you how to swim,” I said to Brenda, winking at her as I did so, amused by the disappointed expression Charlie wore. </p><p>“I don’t know, Charlie seems more confident in his swimming skills. Maybe he should be the one that teaches me.” </p><p>“That’s easy,” I said as I looked at Umi, who was looking at Charlie’s disappointed expression with great distaste — more than happy to ignore the fact that she was still receiving a subtle teasing under the table. “Why don’t you two join us as well.” </p><p>“Sure,” Charlie jumped in at the offer, which was a mistake. Not the decision itself, as it was smart for him to get more ‘face time’ with his boss. </p><p>His mistake was to stay stuck in Brenda’s amazing cleavage as he spoke, leaving no doubt about the source of his enthusiasm… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I walked toward the ‘flaming’ beauty in front of me, my mind was occupied by one question. What should be the aim of the massage?</p><p>Initially, it was just to put her into a better mood while I whispered some suggestions that would make her decide to free Isolde while giving her the impression that it was her free will. A conservative strategy, but since I was unfamiliar with her culture and her personal habits, that was the smart choice. </p><p>Yet, her sudden enthusiasm was enough for me to revisit that decision. </p><p>She didn’t exactly conceal the source of her enthusiasm. The idea of treating a ‘King’ as a servant appealed to her immense — excessively so — pride. And, considering the state of her dress, she clearly didn’t put too much stock on modesty while asking me to serve as a masseuse. </p><p>I didn’t become the dark lord just despite my lowly birth by missing opportunities. </p><p>And, in front of me, lay one of those great opportunities, one of the keys to deciphering the complicated threat I was facing. What kind of abilities she was hiding… </p><p>Of course, testing the limits of her body in a more carnal manner was also an attractive option. </p><p>I might have been split between two equally attractive options, if they weren’t mutually exclusive. </p><p>“Is there any massage oil?” I asked. </p><p>“Check that drawer,” she said as she gestured. When I checked, I found it filled with various cosmetic products, each in unfamiliar containers, each radiating an impressive amount of magic, highlighting her richness. </p><p>Luckily, while the magical language she used might be different, such differences weren’t too pronounced when it came to basic equipment, allowing me to distinguish the massage oil among them — the spell to loosen and relax feeling much different from perfumes and other cosmetics in her drawer. </p><p>As I walked back to her, I flared my magic, using a fancy trick to cover my hands with oil as I walked, radiating mana. A dismissive snort escaped her mouth, showing what she thought of my little show. </p><p>It was good, as it meant it served its purpose of concealing the tantric spell I had cast on the oil. She clearly had the sensitivity notice that as long as she paid attention, but luckily, she was too overconfident to bother looking. </p><p>The spell could be considered as an extension of my earlier trick, one that would enhance her arousal more. The difference, was it was more effective than the passive trick I had pulled on her, letting her absorb unshaped mana to trigger reactions. I dared to cast a more aggressive spell, because the physical contact and the massage oil were good enough as a screen as long as she didn’t start looking carefully. </p><p>And, it was my expertise to distract her so she didn’t start looking. </p><p>Then, I stood behind her and pressed my hands to her feet. A suspicious glance came from her as she raised her head, clearly not understanding my aim of starting from there. “Trust me,” I said. </p><p>“Well, you’re the servant,” she answered as she lay again, her voice sharp enough to annoy me. Luckily, it was very easy to suppress that annoyance, as I was already in the process of making her pay for that concern. </p><p>Her dismissive attitude was quick to disappear as my fingers started working on her soles, replaced by tenseness. Yet, even for a moment, I didn’t think that she didn’t enjoy the results of my touch, as, with her personality, she would never hide her dissatisfaction. </p><p>The pleasure was a different story. </p><p>Impressed by the results, I kept my touch limited to her soles, enjoying her bruised silence for a moment, curious whether a moan could break through her deliberate attitude of not making a noise that would reveal the intensity of her pleasure. </p><p>And, as I did so, I slowly infused my magic into her body. A part of that magic was perfectly innocent, a mild healing spell to enhance her comfort, but just like massage oil hiding my Tantric spell, the healing spell was there to create an excuse for the diagnosis I was running on her. </p><p>She didn’t pay attention to that, maybe because it allowed me to adjust the pacing of my touch even more, likely assuming it was just a part of the massage.</p><p>And, her misconception allowed me to finally find answers to the questions I was seeking. The first thing I wanted to make sure was whether it was her actual body, or was some kind of extreme elaborate transformation. </p><p>The answer was complicated. It was her true body, but her flame wings and burning hair were not exactly a part of her body — yet they were not deliberate accessories either. </p><p>She had two sources of energy, one of them mana generated from her whole body, just like any other person generated such power. Yet, there was a core at the center of her chest, radiating scorching hot mana constantly, the same type of energy that created her wings and her flaming hair. </p><p>But, from a distance, that was all I was able to discern about that. </p><p>As I continued to examine her mana signature, I worked on her feet, enjoying her increasing tenseness. Several minutes later, I finally received the first fruit of my determination, a beautiful moan escaped her mouth, avoiding her attempts to muffle it. </p><p>It was suppressed halfway, and she threw a suspicious glance toward my side, forcing me to suppress the desire to wear a big, satisfied smile. </p><p>She was weaker against the pleasure than I had first thought — though, admittedly, the subtle tantric tricks I pulled helped me on the path to success. </p><p>I only smiled once she turned her gaze away once more, but I kept my touch restricted to her feet. And, this time, it wasn’t the fear that kept me restricted, but amusement. Watching her struggle with her unexpected arousal was fun. </p><p>Watching her struggling with her unexpected arousal while I kept my touch in an area that she couldn’t blame for being excessive… </p><p>Priceless. </p><p>I kept my touch restricted to her feet for a while, enjoying her growing tenseness for another minute or two. She managed to keep her lips shut, but that didn’t prevent her body from getting tenser and tenser. </p><p>Soon, I decided that was more than enough for the first stage of my mission, and I started moving forward. Not because I was feeling impatient. I would have loved to stay there until her moans started to rise uninterrupted and filled the room, threatening to deafen me. </p><p>Yet, I was hesitant to push her too much at the first stage. I didn’t want her to stop the massage, or worse, react aggressively to punish me — which, considering her usual attitude, was a likely reaction. </p><p>I paused for a moment to coat my hands with a fresh layer of oil — as well as a thicker dose of tantric energy, encouraged by her lack of realization — and started treating her delicate calves for another extended period. </p><p>The time I stayed on her calves was much shorter than my earlier attempt, but still, it was enough to be measured in minutes. This time, my attention was split in two directions. One, infusing my mana deeper into her body — which both increased the impact of the tantric, fueling her arousal, and allowed me to get a better sense of her mana flow — two, reestablishing my subtle control over her dress. </p><p>Since she had already reduced the area the dress covered on her back — leaving her back naked in preparation for the massage, not expecting me to first focus on her legs — I saw no harm in further compromising the function of her dress. A slight magical push, and the area covered by her dress got even smaller. </p><p>The skirt shrunk, allowing me to see most of her beautifully tight thighs, begging for my touch as more of her skirt melted, enough to reveal the edge of her beautiful plump ass. </p><p>I stopped there, afraid that any more, and she would realize my manipulations even in her distracted state, busy suppressing the visible signs of my success. </p><p>More importantly, I was getting more and more familiar with her mana. Enough to pull dangerous experimentation to pull a trick. As my fingers continued to dance on her calves, I traced her connection with her dress, using a moment to understand the subconscious subtle connection between her and her dress, and added a little spell. </p><p>A spell I cast slowly, carefully, copying the exact same nature of her mana. The spell structure was not the same as she would use, of course, but I did my best to shape it like the other magical orders she used to control the shape of her dress. </p><p>It was certainly dangerous, as, unlike my previous tricks, it was persistent evidence of my manipulations, one that would stay for at least several minutes, to be dispersed once she gave another strong order to reform the dress. </p><p>Yet, it was worthy of that risk, because it triggered a continuous development on her dress, allowing it to get smaller continuously. The impact was slow enough that such an impact didn’t happen immediately, but it was a continuous growth. </p><p>I pulled that trick, because it meant that she wouldn’t be able to catch me interfering with her dress directly, and hopefully blame her subconsciousness and her arousal for that mistake. </p><p>Risky, but it was a necessary part of my experimentations about her power — with the added benefit of creating an incredible view…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I stood in front of Coach Spencer, the starter quarterback behind him, a smug expression on his face. Behind me, I could hear more than one player from the defensive squad whispering in discomfort, no doubt not appreciating Coach Spencer singling me out. </p><p>Not because they had a great love for me. On the contrary, they barely liked me. Yet, in their mind, Coach Spencer was the enemy, which automatically elevated my position for them. I had a feeling that, without Coach Bill’s silent yet looming presence, their reaction would have been much more explosive. </p><p>The rest of the defensive squad waited as I stood in front of Coach Spencer, though, from the corner of my gaze, I noticed Thad slinking away — as sneakily as he could do as a six-six blond giant wearing full-paddings. </p><p>“Let’s start with something simple, to test the performance of our newest genius recruit. Let’s do a modified linebacker hole drill,” he said. </p><p>The linebacker hole drill was a simple training. Four cones were put on the ground, creating three alternative corridors to represent the paths the running back could take. He didn’t commit until the last second, and the linebacker was tasked to read him and dash forward the moment he determined the correct path, and tackled the running back. </p><p>It was a simple exercise, though it didn’t prevent it from being painful when it was conducted in full gear. </p><p>Tackling a six-feet tall, two-hundred and twenty pounds running back made from pure muscles running at full speed with the intention of trucking through the defender was not exactly the most fun activity imaginable. </p><p>Of course, there were two types of running backs, the power type that focused on going through the defenders, and the smaller, elusive type that focused on speed and footwork, but I had no illusions about which type I would compete against in the exercise. </p><p>“Twenty-two, twenty-four, step forward,” Coach Spencer called, and two running backs stepped forward, both clearly the power type, suddenly giving an idea about what the Coach had in mind in terms of modified exercise. </p><p>It was not going to be fun. </p><p>“Do you know the standard hole drill?” Coach asked, and I nodded. “We’re going to make a small modification on it,” he said. “Both running backs will start running at the same time, and before they start, I’m going to call blue or red. Your task is to tackle the one that’s carrying the correct ball. Though, be ready, occasionally, I’ll order you to change target.” </p><p>“I understand, Coach,” I said even as I hid a wince. That adjustment was certainly not as small as he tried to sell. First, seeing the ball in ball in a running back’s hand was already difficult. They were trained to hide the football as they run, both to protect the ball, and trick the defenders about whether the ball was with them, or still with the quarterback. </p><p>Yet, not only I was going to identify which ball they were holding correctly, but also be prepared for the late command he might deliver, not allowing me to get the necessary speed to properly tackle them. </p><p>It was going to be painful. </p><p>I said nothing as I lined at the opposite side of the two running backs who sported matching smirks, no doubt happy to have an official excuse to make me pay for all the humiliation I brought to the offensive team with my debacles with Kevin. </p><p>Coach Spencer raised his whistle, yet, before blowing it, he glanced at the rest of the defensive team, no doubt thinking this moment as a victory over his disobedient players, clearly unaware that he was pushing even more. </p><p>“Red,” he called. And when the sound finally rang, the two running backs dashed forward simultaneously, one through the first gap, the other through the third gap, forcing me to focus on the ball they were carrying, barely enough to identify the correct assignments. </p><p>Luckily, Pattern Recognition came to my aid. I noticed that one of them was pushing himself even lower, perfectly ready to tackle, allowing me to recognize the true intent behind his move. </p><p>Pity, I thought even as I dashed to meet him midway. If I wasn’t trying to get some playing time as soon as possible, I would have deliberately targeted the other running back, hurting him before he could prepare. </p><p>Yet, I needed to impress Coach Bill as well, so I targeted number twenty-two, doing my best to keep my center of gravity low, my arms ready to wrap around. </p><p>It didn’t prevent me from flying back the moment our bodies collied, accompanied by a loud noise. The running back did his best to run through me, and not only as a starter he was stronger than me, but also, unlike me, he had enough time to gather his speed. </p><p>Yet, even as his shoulder buried into my chest, I grabbed my arms around him, clenching around, not allowing him to get away. He took a couple steps, then his knee touched the ground. </p><p>“Not bad for a start,” Coach Spencer said as I forced myself to my feet, despite not wanting anything more than laying on the ground and breathing to battle against the pain. </p><p>I had forgotten just how much full-contact tackle hurt, especially when the offensive player decided to give pain. Compared to that, the collusions between me and the practice-squad receivers during the training were nothing more than love taps. </p><p> Worse, I couldn’t even call them on, because it was a legitimate tactic. Some of the running backs used their bodies as battering rams against the defensive players even though it didn’t give them much extra yardage, at least at the beginning of the game. </p><p>It was different after three-quarters of painful hits, the defensive players found themselves much more reluctant to put their full weight behind their defensive attempts, allowing the running backs to rack up some really impressive yardage. </p><p>It was clearly the tactic they had in mind for this training as well. And, unlike a proper match, I didn’t have backups to spread the impact. It was me against them. </p><p>“Let’s see how tough you are, chess nerd,” number twenty-two growled at me before he pulled back. </p><p>I said nothing, just glared at him silently as I did my best to stand up, though I was unable to completely conceal the pain. </p><p>The offensive team cheered happily, glad to see me in pain. I took starting the position once more, this time, prepared to target the number twenty-four. Coach Spencer was smiling at me smugly, like he was about to pull a trick, and I was confident that using alternating players counted as a trick in his mind. </p><p>He called red again for the next attempt, but this time, the red ball was with twenty-four, allowing me to target him properly, with full speed. Even better, number twenty-four clearly expected another weak hit, making him unprepared for a full-powered tackle. And considering that he was a backup, making him both weaker and less skilled than number twenty-two, he certainly couldn’t afford that level of confidence.   </p><p>And I was more than happy to teach him that lesson, in the form of a painful collision from the side with full speed, making him roll on the turf, earning matching cheers from the offensive team. </p><p>Technically, it wasn’t the most painful hit I could deliver, but it was certainly the most impressive. The sudden flow of Intent just confirmed that, thought the amount was certainly more than I expected. </p><p>It confirmed that Thad already succeeded in setting the live feed I requested, and we had more than a few watchers already. </p><p>Contrasting with the cheers of the defensive team, I said nothing. I just stood in front of number twenty-four, looking down. No goading, no insult, not even a satisfied smirk. Just a sharp look. </p><p>I was an expert in the art of intimidation, after all. </p><p>Naturally, it wasn’t as effective when I relied upon that during the chess tournament. First, I didn’t have that overwhelming physical superiority against football players that helped me greatly against the other chess players, who were much more fitting to the quintessential chess player archetype. </p><p>More importantly, I didn’t have a reputation among the football players, or more accurately, my existing sources of reputation — the newest backup, chess player, and girlfriend stealer — hardly helped me to intimidate another football player on the field. </p><p>I was already starting to miss being called the Assassin. </p><p>Hopefully, it wasn’t that far away, because as I walked back to my position — only after my victim stood up — I was also busy channeling Intent to the system, as intensely as I could manage. And when I touched the System, I received the reward I had been hoping for.  </p><p>[Intimidation II, acquired]</p><p>The training was certainly getting fun.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The first part of the training had passed rather routinely, contrasting the great fanfare that defined the start of it. The offense did their own training on the other side of the field while we worked on our own.  </p><p>Of course, the routine didn’t prevent it from being painfully exhausting, especially with the level of detail that Coach Bill was forcing us to follow, making us repeat the plays for each mistake until the whole team was able to run it perfectly, regardless it was the starters or backups on the field. </p><p>Which meant a lot of repeats, especially since what counted as a mistake in his perspective.  </p><p>It was painful, but much easier to accept whenever our gaze slipped toward the offensive team practicing their reps, their routes sloppy, their runs lacking the speed required, showing they were not pushing themselves. </p><p>Yet, just as I was starting to think that the training would be a copy of the morning one — exhausting yet predictable and boring at the same time — I noticed the captain of the offense, the starting quarterback, talking with Coach Spencer. </p><p>I wouldn’t have noticed that if I didn’t catch his fingers pointing directly at me, yet that gesture, combined with the way Coach Spencer nodded viciously gave me a premonition, one that didn’t help my mood any. </p><p>“Give me ten sets of cone drill, lateral movement,” the linebacker coach called while I was busy trying to understand what was going on, though that didn’t prevent me from exploding into action immediately, sliding between two distant cones while keeping my face straight, fast, pushing my limits in a way that would have ruined the training if it wasn’t for my Recovery Trait. </p><p>I was glad for its presence, because, as I watched Coach Bill nod in approval to Coach Spencer’s suggestion, I started suspecting that a much more grueling moment awaited me. </p><p>Yet, the linebacker coach clearly didn’t see that as a reason to take it easy on me, the next order coming immediately. “Twists and footwork,” he ordered. </p><p>I did my best. Unfortunately, it didn’t go that smoothly. Unlike the other training, footwork required constant practice to keep up, and the finer parts of it certainly couldn’t be recovered in a day or two. Even my supernaturally-enhanced Endurance didn’t help much. </p><p>One couldn’t brute force flexibility through Endurance. </p><p>It wasn’t completely useless, luckily, because as the same training continued for almost fifteen minutes, forcing us to dance around the cones almost endlessly, others — at least backup players, as the starters were still significantly better than me even with that help — started to make mistakes, making me look better in comparison. </p><p>Not the most honorable victory, but I would get whatever I could, especially in an area like footwork I was relatively weak. “Not bad,” the coach said as he looked at the others. “Everyone other than a newbie, take a rest.” Then, he turned toward me. “And for you, let’s see how long you can last. Give me some zigzag runs,” he said, raising his whistle. </p><p>And just like that, I started running back and forth, making a sharp turn whenever he whistled, which wasn’t as easy as it sounded, especially with the sharp cuts the coach required. “Keep your center of gravity low,” he shouted. “You’re swinging it too much, and it’s putting too much weight on your angle!” </p><p>It wasn’t the only correction I received, dashing back and forth painfully as the rest of the linebacker core rested. It was certainly unfair, no doubt about that, but I had noticed Carter making eye contact with the linebacker coach more than once, suggesting that, despite having all the appearance of hazing, it was another way for Carter to assist me. </p><p>Smart move, giving me a chance to shine and testing me at the same time, all while not alienating the rest of the team. Certainly a good move, if a bit cold-blooded. </p><p>Twenty minutes later, I was breathing hard, my legs trembling worse than a skyscraper during an earthquake… But that didn’t prevent a smirk from appearing on my face. </p><p>Pushing myself to the limit was fun. </p><p>After that show, the linebacker coach called the rest of the group and started running group exercises once more, though, he did give me a minute to catch my breath.</p><p>The more I saw, the more I was impressed by the tight ship the defense was running. Such a pity the team was going through a losing streak because of nepotism, wasting all our efforts. </p><p>Lost in the training, I stopped paying attention to Coach Spencer, though he was kind enough to remind his presence. “That’s enough, boys,” he shouted. “Take a break while anyone that doesn’t have full pads go and change.” </p><p>Interesting, I thought, because the padding was neither comfortable nor light. Coach Bill made us wear it, but the offensive team clearly didn’t wear them for training. </p><p>The defensive team turned to coach Bill, waiting for an order. “Go change and put the pads you use for the match,” he ordered, suggesting that there was a reason for that order. “Any idea what’s going on,” I asked Thad. </p><p>“We’ll see in a minute,” he said with a shrug as we followed the rest to the locker room. </p><p>“Oh, it’s going to be fun,” whispered Kevin as he passed near me, his tone gleeful. It was clear that he had a significant part of the little surprise that was about to come.  </p><p>“As fun as banging your girlfriend?” I countered, unlike him, not bothering to keep my voice low, earning several happy whistles from the defense, while Kevin looked at me like he was about to start swinging. </p><p>Though, this time, he was able to keep himself back without someone else dragging him away, which was a surprise. </p><p>Whatever surprise he prepared for me, it was clearly enough for him to suppress his frustration. </p><p>“Be careful,” Thad said once we were in the locker room and changing into full-padding. “He can be dangerous, at least for a sniveling coward.” </p><p>“Thanks,” I said, not bothering to mention that the reason Kevin had any success against him was his pointless pride and tendency to explode in anger. For all the evidence on the contrary, Thad was a smart guy, and heeding his advice was certainly going to be helpful. </p><p>When we arrived back at the field, the field had changed significantly, with the new layout. “Line up,” Coach Spencer shouted gleefully, clearly enjoying the speed the defensive team followed his orders as well. </p><p>It was only because Coach Bill tacitly allowed that by standing behind him, of course, but he didn’t seem to mind it. </p><p>Such a vain man, I thought, shaking my head dismissively. </p><p>“Since the match this week is too important. With all the rivalry between the teams, it’s certain that they are going to come to the field, ready for the kill. I want you all to be prepared, so, we’re going to run some full-contact drills.” He paused, then turned toward me, his gaze gleefully dark. “I especially want to make sure our newest player could handle a few tackles. We don’t want one of our players crying on the field, right? Fifty-eight, step forward.” </p><p>They were clearly wanting to target me even more than I expected, without the slightest intention to hide it. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t complain. First, even if I did, against Head Coach’s order — especially with the implicit approval of Coach Bill — it wouldn’t work. It would just make things worse. </p><p>More importantly, they were unaware that they were giving me the exact thing I needed. A platform to show off. I dipped my head before I took that step, and whispered to Thad. “Make sure the recording finds its way to the social media, live if you can manage,” I whispered as I took a step forward. </p><p>Thad looked at me questioningly, clearly aware that whatever was about to come was going to be painful and humiliating. </p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“Fifty-eight, enough delaying,” called Coach Spencer immediately. “You can always quit the team if you’re afraid of a bit of contact.”</p><p>I said nothing, just walked toward him, trying to prepare myself for the upcoming trial. </p><p>One that promised to be very painful. </p>",

    "content": "<p>While my reluctant ally didn’t appreciate the idea of swimming for a great distance, she also failed to come up with an alternative plan, that was determined. </p><p>That didn’t mean we were free to leave the ruins of our battlefield. There was still looting to be done. </p><p>Luckily, while actually using patrician weapons required the bond of bestowment ritual, just carrying them was much simpler. A little layer of mana to prevent contact was enough, after she cast that spell, I gathered all of them into a large bundle, while she collected dragon hearts into another one. </p><p>Together, we were holding enough treasure to make countries take notice, let alone the noble houses. Even with their position among the patrician houses, it was still impressive for House Junia to gather such an impressive treasury and keep it hidden. </p><p>I tried to ignore just how badly they would work to get them back, and try to get me to pay them back. I just hoped that the distance we would be able to put before our little heist got noticed would be enough. </p><p>As we climbed the stairs, an eerie silence dominated the building, showing that every single soldier in the building had attempted to attack us, only to die to the last man. </p><p>Another disadvantage of the magical brainwashing they had gone through, was the complete lack of initiative. </p><p>“So, I’m yet to learn your name, beautiful,”  I said in an attempt to break the silence. </p><p>“You can call me Xia,” she answered. </p><p>“Xia,” I repeated as I tasted the unfamiliar nature of her words. “It’s a beautiful name, worthy of an exotic beauty like you.” That earned a dismissive glare from her, suggesting that, I wasn’t exactly the most handsome man imaginable. </p><p>Maybe it was the scales that covered me. I decided not to look in the mirror. Looking down to see my limbs was more than enough. I didn’t need to know how my face looked. </p><p>“And I’m Marcus, Marcus Scipio,” I said. </p><p>Yet, that earned an unexpected reaction. “S-Scipio,” she said as she stammered, skipping a step as she did so, almost falling down. </p><p>I tried to reach toward her reflexively, only to stop myself halfway, realizing that such an attempt was more likely to kill her, and even the least amount of damage was better than the bruises she might receive falling down. “Did you say Scipio?” she repeated after she stumbled. </p><p>“Okay, it’s definitely something we’re going to talk about once we escaped,” I said as I looked at her, curious why the name of an old Patrician house that had fallen low enough to be pushed out of Rome elicited such a reaction from her. </p><p>But not curious enough to stop our escape attempt halfway. Avoiding the fury of House Junia was more important than questioning her about her mysterious reaction. </p><p>Especially since I had a feeling that particular line of questioning was going to trigger a long discussion. </p><p>Instead, I continued to climb the stairs even as I arrived at the ground floor. “Where are you going?” she asked. “The exit is here.” </p><p>“I’m going to pick some uniforms from the storage,” I said even as I quickly climbed to the first floor. Yet, when I tried to open the door of one of the storage rooms, I had succeeded in a peculiar way. I pulled the door off its hinges rather than opening it. </p><p>It would have been an impressive achievement if the door was locked and I was trying to do so, but considering it was not, it was hardly a good sign of my own control. </p><p>Things hardly got any better as I tried to wear one of the uniforms, only to shred it to pieces the moment I grabbed it. The second was the same. The third attempt went much better, and I was able to actually, grab a shirt successfully, though that was the limit of my achievement. </p><p>Before I could raise it up, it was already shredded. </p><p>My new claws might be excellent weapons, but they were certainly inconvenient for daily activities. Still, I didn’t have the right to complain. I was lucky that they were nimble enough to allow me to hold a spear — and even luckier that the Spear was far too strong to be damaged by my new sharp claws. </p><p>I took a deep breath and started focusing on the transformation, trying to force it back using the same trick I had been using since the transformation started to spread. The tactic behind that was simple. I just grabbed the unique sensation under my skin and pull it back, stuffing it back to my core. </p><p>Unfortunately, with the recent flood of mana, pushing back the sensation got much harder. The process was still simple, but simple didn’t mean easy. Lifting a pound of weight was simple and easy, and lifting a thousand pounds of weight was equally simple. Just grab and lift. </p><p>But it certainly wasn’t easy. </p><p>So, even pushing myself to the limit, I was barely able to restore my hands back to their state. Yet, even then, it wasn’t complete, the back of my hands still showing half-formed scales. </p><p>Still, considering that alive and conscious, it was better than I could have expected. I finally managed to grab a shirt and pull it through my head. Though, unfortunately, that caused it to rip. Suppressing the transformation didn’t solve the problem of excessive strength. </p><p>Luckily, before I could fix it, Xia arrived next to me. “Do you mind helping me dress?” I said as I raised my arms while she looked at the broken door and ruined costumes, releasing my attempt to suppress the transformation, the claws appearing once more. </p><p>“I’m going to do something better,” she said as she put her hand on my shoulder, and her magic slipped into my body. </p><p>I had to clamp on the sudden aggression as my instincts shouted for me to kill the unknown aggressor. I managed to keep myself from attacking, but I failed to suppress a snarl escaping my monstrous mouth. </p><p>She took a step back fearfully. “The instincts?” </p><p>“It’s worse than I expected, but still controllable,” I answered. I wasn’t surprised by her question, as foreign instincts — leading to eventual wild madness — were one of the things I had noticed on the research notes she had shared with me. </p><p>And, more importantly, I could feel the transformation getting easier to control after her spell. I repeated my attempt to suppress my transformation, but this time, easily pushed the transformation down my wrists, even weakening it around my elbows. “It’s working,” I said as I raised my arms. “Try the spell again.” </p><p>She said nothing as she pressed her hand on my shoulders, and I felt her soft magic infusing into my body once again. This time, I closed my eyes and focused on the way it had been interacting with my transformation. </p><p>I didn’t understand the process behind it, but the impact was much easier to understand. For the lack of a better term, it was softening the transformation, allowing me to pull it back much easier. I felt a sense of warmth spread along my arms, then to my shoulders and to my chest. </p><p>Yet, as it spread to the rest of my body, Xia let out a gasp and pulled back, cutting the mana off without a warning. </p><p>I opened my eyes, ready to attack the enemy that somehow managed to come nearer, only to find out that we were still alone. Then, I noticed her state. She was pressing her hands to her face, while a blush crept to her face…</p><p>A chuckle escaped my mouth as I realized the reason for that. A glance down was just what I needed to confirm that impression, a certain part of my body peeking through my pants in the full mast. I wasn’t surprised by my erection, as extremely boosted desire was one of the side effects of the transformation, and with my pants ruined by the battle and transformation, the view was rather noticeable. </p><p>“Just keep your gaze for a moment,” I said as I grabbed another shirt, only for it to rip the moment I tried to pull it down. </p><p>Apparently, pushing back the transformation didn’t remove my new enhanced strength, at least not entirely. In the long term, it was good, but it didn’t change the fact that it was a great inconvenience at the moment. </p><p>“My strength is still uncontrollable, it seems that you’re going to dress me,” I said as I looked at Xia. </p><p>“You’re not serious,” she gasped, her hands still on her face as she kept them closed. I couldn’t help but feel amused at her sudden shyness despite everything. </p><p>“Unfortunately, you have to, unless you want to try to avoid notice while walking next to a naked man,” I answered with a chuckle as I looked at her. </p><p>She said nothing as she grabbed another shirt, her blush getting bigger as she got closer. </p><p>Pity that our time was too limited for me to enjoy that reaction… </p><p><br></p>",

Though, whether that effect was a positive one was open to argument. “How dare you scare us like that?” </p><p>“What did I do?” I said with an innocence that was too smug to convince anyone. </p><p>Marianne glanced at Titania, and made a gesture to her, earning a small nod and a smile from Titania, a reaction that was no less surprising than Marianne’s angry reaction. Clearly, my blonde goddess wasn’t the only one that was affected by the mission. I could see that Titania had mellowed significantly. </p><p>After all, for her, this mission was not an excuse to learn the merits of aggression, but finally have a calm mission that she didn’t have to work alone. Not to mention, the weakening of the mental effects of the Light Node helped her to connect better with her feelings, allowing her about the reality of the situation. </p><p>Though, I wasn’t able to think about their transformation much, because they raised their hands simultaneously, and a complicated web of magical attacks appeared around me, a rain of light, and rotating blades of life energy that danced inside in a chaotic pattern. </p><p>“Impressive,” I chuckled as I rolled forward, though I had to abort my assault when one of the rotating blades took a turn sharper than I expected, forcing me to change my path to avoid damage. </p><p>Of course, the damage itself would have been negligible, as Marianne barely put any mana behind the rotating blades — and even if she did, the life energy might be the weakest weapon against anyone that was not undead. </p><p>Though, it was still violent enough to cause some damage — and pain — as it was still not a healing spell. </p><p>In contrast, Titania’s rain of light was both easier and harder to avoid. Unlike Marianne’s assault, it didn’t have the ability to change direction midway, but in contrast, they were both fast and numerous — not to mention, unlike Marianne’s like magic, those spears that rained from the sky very much had the ability to hurt the living. </p><p>Otherwise, she would never develop her fearsome reputation.</p><p>Light elemental had a unique destructiveness, able to slip through any other element, including Arcana, easily. Luckily, that was not a problem for me. I conjured a blade of light, using the same element to deflect her attacks. </p><p>I dodged, danced, and weaved through their combined assault, deliberately throttling my Melee skill until their assault had turned an overwhelming rain that forced me to retreat. </p><p>Trying to dodge Marianne’s complicated assault while deflecting Titania’s unpredictable yet merciless rain was good training. And as an added benefit, I was pushing their formation to the limit, making them notice the weak points of their assault. </p><p>While my plan was to get stronger in a different manner, I decided to play along with their game. After all, it not only helped me to increase my Melee abilities without the system, but it also helped them to perfect their own formation, making them safer. </p><p>Unfortunately, not everyone had my boundless mana, and even with their limited expenditure, barely ten minutes later, their attack lost its intensity. Still, it was an impressive achievement for two mages, especially right after taking down an undead fortress. </p><p>“Are you girls bored with foreplay?” I asked, earning matching blushes on their face. </p><p>A part of that blush was borne of frustration, showing their unhappiness of failing to deliver even one hit despite their combined assault, but I was familiar with their expression enough to know that the majority came from the implications hidden in my latest words.</p><p>“S-shut up,” Marianne said, but with her blush invading her face, her earlier domineering attitude was replaced by her usual shyness. </p><p>I just chuckled as I walked toward them, summoning an air elemental halfway. When I stood between them, I presented my arms to them. “Shall we go, ladies,” I said with a smile that was familiar to them on my lips. </p><p>They said nothing, not that they needed to, with their intensifying blush and the hurry they displayed as they stepped onto the air elemental and hooked their arms around mine. And then, with beauty on each arm, I floated away. </p><p>We didn’t fly much. Before they could say anything, I had already stopped in a small meadow I had discovered when I was floating forward, beautiful and free from monsters and other annoyances. </p><p>“So, girls, who want the first relaxing massage after your exhausting battle,” I asked. </p><p>“Me,” both girls jumped simultaneously, their earlier alliance quick to shatter in the face of benefits. I was amused by the way they glared at each other, both unhappy with the initiative the other showed. </p><p>I chuckled as I let my hands move lower and cupped their assess at the same time, Marianne’s wide and soft, Titania’s small and tight. “It looks like a tie,” I chuckled as I let the elemental land next to the water, and slammed my foot on the floor. </p><p>[-729 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Craft]</p><p>And two massage tables rose, both made of crystal and covered with complicated patterns as I once again used the architectural style I had deduced from the headmistress’ stash, as their unique nature allowed them to hold mana much better. </p><p>After all, since I was interrupting their mission, I needed to pay back them properly for such interruption, and a beautiful massage was certainly a good way to do so. </p><p>While also awakening their bodies properly for some post-massage fun. </p><p>“Jerk,” they replied soon, once again simultaneously. </p><p>I chuckled at their response before giving them another suggestion. “Well, we can skip it if you are not in the mood,” I whispered, but my suggestion had received no answer but a pointed silence. “I thought so,” I answered, not bothering to hide my smirk as I continued. </p><p>“Why don’t you girls lay down, and I start the massage to destroy all the stress that you accumulated during your adventures.” </p><p>They looked hesitant, mostly because they were annoyed by my teasing rather than a lack of desire for my massage. </p><p>so I decided to give a little incentive. “And I’ll start with who manages to lay down first, appropriately dressed for a massage,” I added. “Or…” I tried to continue, to add the words, appropriately undressed, but my little joke was ruined. </p><p>Admittedly, considering my little self-indulgent joke had been interrupted by two beautiful girls furiously undressing as they competed to be the first one to lay on the crystal massage tables I had conjured, it wasn’t exactly the greatest loss I had ever experienced. </p><p>Apparently, their little moment of solidarity wasn’t enough to survive the temptation of being the first one in line. </p><p>“Amazing effort,” I murmured even as I looked at their beautiful bodies as they lay on the crystal surface. </p><p>Titania lay on her back, displaying her modest curves directly, her legs parted to give a glimpse of her core, getting wetter by each second in anticipation. Marianne, on the other hand, lay prone, which was supposed to be less sexy than someone laying on her back, but it seemed that Marianne’s curves had never heard that fact. Her beautiful plump ass was as attractive as always, begging for my attention, and her breasts, squeezed between her weight and the massage table, created an amazing view to complement it. </p><p>I said nothing else as I walked toward them, standing between them. “Who’s first?” Marianne murmured, unable to resist the temptation. </p><p>“I’m not sure, who do you think was faster?” I asked. </p><p>Marianne turned to look at Titania, who was already looking at her. To their credit, even distracted by their desire, they had realized that I had been teasing them, and refused to engage. </p><p>Yet, they also wanted to receive a proper massage — and much more — so, despite their frustration, they continued to lay on their massage tables. I chuckled. “I think it’s fair to take it as a tie, won’t you agree?” I asked. </p><p>I received a pair of hesitant nods and prepared myself to start some fun activity. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I dispelled the air elemental before I decided to close in, wanting to get a better view of the event. After all, surprises on any battlefield had the potential to be deadly, especially against two mages with little to no support. </p><p>The first thing I did was to cast a low-level detection charm, allowing me to get a real-time map of the living — along with the unliving — with no effort and no risk. </p><p>[-28 Mana]</p><p>Of course, in the past, using such a trick was risky enough to trigger every single alarm of the liches that was found in any area of decent size, but my current skill level was different. I was able to replicate the same trick using much less mana, which made it much harder to be noticed. </p><p>And it allowed me to get a sense of the layout, which was simpler than I expected. It consisted of a group of defenders behind several layers of wards, and attackers trying to break them through repeated assaults. </p><p>Though, as a nice surprise, Titania and Marianne were the attacking sides, while undead was the side that was trying to put together a desperate defense against the inevitable assault. </p><p>It was a nice change of pace. </p><p>I started closing in as I carefully focused on their mana signatures. Titania’s incredible assault didn’t surprise me, as I had seen her fighting before. While she had certain flaws — her direct approach to battle one of them — she had the capabilities to justify her fearsome reputation. </p><p>The achievements she had gained during our fun only made her scarier. </p><p>Marianne, on the other hand, surprised me greatly. The last time I had seen her, she was just a healer — an amazing healer, maybe even the best in Silver Spires, but a healer nonetheless. Yet, the closer I got, the more accurate my feel for her magic got, and what I found surprised me. </p><p>The life energy was formed into several complicated shapes, rotating in a self-sustaining space as they danced around the wards of the undead, ready to destroy any undead that dared to get out of the wards for a counterattack. </p><p>They even managed to avoid the oppressive bursts of light magic as they rained on the wards — a courtesy of Titania — each formed into thin spears, weakening the integrity of the wards without wasting Titania’s energy in the process. </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed with Marianne’s performance, who was using my trick in a spell that I didn’t even think off — though, admittedly, with my perks, saving mana was hardly the greatest priority for me. Still, the smoothness of her spells and the efficiency of her approach were amazing. </p><p>Though, even with Titania, I was impressed by the way she was methodically disassembling the wards rather than overwhelming them in one burst, showing that she had learned quite a bit compared to our first fateful meeting, where she had been trapped by much simpler wards. </p><p>I wanted to watch them slowly work on the wards, but, unfortunately, we had bigger issues to deal with, so I started walking closer, intending on helping them. </p><p>Yet, before casting a spell to resolve the issue, I repeated the earlier spell, but this time, putting enough magic to cover a much wider area. </p><p>After the earlier debacle, after my target turned out to be a decoy in the first place, I decided to treat the undead with more care, in case I met with another tactical disadvantage. </p><p>That turned out to be a smart decision, as, the moment the spell spread past a mile, I felt a ping at the distance. I had found a ward that was hiding a couple of presences, which, interestingly, were not undead. Too distant to launch an ambush, but not too distant to observe the battle. </p><p>I decided that it was not appropriate. </p><p>[-294 Mana]</p><p>An earth spell, combined with a furious dash, and barely half a minute later, I was under their location. There, I stopped for a moment underground, focusing my senses upward to examine the little group, consisting of four people. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was that they were not necromancers. It was possible to conceal the taint of their destructive spell-casting from a distance, but it was impossible to do so when it was just a few feet of earth that were separating us. The second thing, even more helpful, to note was they didn’t belong to Eternals — at least, that was what I assumed considering their wards were both too weak to be cast by someone over level thirty, and they were not based on the mysterious structure they had used during every encounter I had with them. </p><p>With that, I had no fear as I let my mana radiate up, and invade their structure — something that was made much easier by their ward protecting the top and sides much better than the bottom. </p><p>Simple mistakes, but simple mistakes were no less critical than complicated ones once someone started to abuse them. I let my mana bypass their wards and slip inside their bodies. </p><p>They were all between level twelve and fifteen, which put a frown on my face. Not because they were strong, at least not by the standards that I was getting used to, but their lack of strength. </p><p>If they had been stronger, I might have assumed that they were trying to assassinate Titania, but that didn’t make sense. Even before she started receiving the benefits of working together, Titania was strong enough to demolish such a group in seconds even if they had the opportunity to ambush her. </p><p>The speed of retaliation her light magic allowed was simply ridiculous. </p><p>Yet, their presence was not accidental either. If that had been the case, they wouldn’t have been hidden in wards good enough to avoid Titania’s detection spells, or my first, weaker, detection spell. And their levels were enough to qualify them above disposable pawns for every single force with the great exception of the Eternals — and I had a feeling that Eternals were not exactly a group that bothered to deal with such weaklings. </p><p>Interesting, I thought even as I invaded their soul space with more of my mana, and with a flick, blocked all of their Stats and Skills at the same time, the great power difference allowed me to do so. </p><p>When I pulled up, I met with the panicking party, each just barely cognizant enough to realize what they had lost. And, my immediate presence revealed the truth of my presence. “Tell me, why are you here?” I asked. </p><p>They didn’t turn completely idiotic even without the System, but the difference with and without their assistance was significant — a fact that I was intensely aware of, hence the reason I was objectively wasting a resource like Divine Spark that even the System required, and the gods battled for it outside the System space, just to avoid that exact fate. </p><p>“Tell me who do you work for, or perish!” I ordered, not even bothering to tap into the benefits of my Charisma to enhance the intimidation value. I was afraid that I would trigger a heart attack if I did so. </p><p>“W-we’re working for Crown Prince,” the four-voice answered at the same time, unable to resist the sudden pressure without the assistance of the System. </p><p>I found their cacophony of voices as unpleasing as the answer. “You three, silence,” I said before I turned at the one at the center, who looked slightly more coherent than the others. “What do you mean by Crown Prince, I thought the Empire had a Crown Princess.” </p><p>“N-not for long,” he stammered, his coherency not making him any more courageous than his friends, at least not in a manner that was useful. </p><p>“Explain,” I ordered. </p><p>“E-everybody knows the Princess escaped the capital with her tail between her legs. With that, it’s only a time before the Emperor takes her title and delivers it to the rightful Prince.” </p><p>“And you work for that Prince,” I asked, only to receive a nod. “And are you here under his orders?” </p><p>To his credit, he managed to maintain his hesitancy for a fleeting moment, until I blasted him with the weight of my Charisma, which worked wonders to increase his intimidation value to a dangerous level. </p><p>“Yes!” he gasped as he stumbled back, his face flat white. “He wants us to give a report about the members of Silver Spires since the Princess retreated there.” </p><p>“And?” I asked, but he kept his lips closed. Which, I had to admit, was an impressive display of loyalty. Too bad it was wasted in a game he was little more than a pawn. He didn’t even see the blade of air that cut off his head, and as he was busy with the realization that his life came to an end, I turned to the next one. “And?” I repeated. </p><p>This time, the answer arrived quick. “He wants us to take down any target of opportunity to weaken Silver Spires just in case they allied with the Princess,” he answered. “But only if we are sure that it couldn’t be traced back to us.” </p><p>I made a note to inform the headmistress about that particular detail to pull the school patrols tighter. I might have complicated feelings about Silver Spires, but it didn’t change the fact that it was the closest thing I had to a home. </p><p>With my pressure getting tighter, I had asked them a few more questions about their numbers and distributions, but they knew very little as they operated as a cell, and they were sent directly from the capital with no local connection, just with a communication item to send emergency information. </p><p>So, I used their communicator to send an interrupted message about a sudden undead attack before killing them, a few simple modified healing spells was all I needed to create the evidence of a successful undead raid before destroying the bodies — as necromancers would never leave high-level bodies lying around. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the undead fortress, and with a flick of my hand, I used my Arcana abilities to unfold a few critical nodes, causing a cascading critical failure in the wards to destroy the bulk of the forces. </p><p>Until I could arrive at their location, Titania and Marianne finished destroying the remaining undead, looking at the ruined hill with a sense of satisfaction. </p><p>“So, girls,” I said cheerfully, amused by the incredible speed they turned to face me with their magic flaring, only for it to fade as they realized the identity of the intruder, though as their mana calmed, their anger only got more intense, an expression that did nothing to their spectacular beauty. “Who’s in the mood for a party?” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 524160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 7923 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",
