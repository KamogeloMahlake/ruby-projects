    "content": "<p>Once I absorbed the Quake Hammer skill, I didn’t immediately start using it. Instead, I sat down, legs crossed, like I was about to meditate, my hammer on my lap, processing the new set of information the skill had brought about. </p><p>Just like Hammer of Might, Quake Hammer was an offensive skill that relied greatly on the concept of one deadly blow, but it left its user open to retaliation if the attack failed. That, I was familiar with from Hammer of Might. Assuming they would have a similar development pattern, the skill would have some defensive maneuvers as it improved, but ultimately, it didn’t matter much. </p><p>Because, if needed, I was confident that I could employ Fleeting Step to avoid most of the danger the current dungeon might provide. </p><p>Time that I spent running around was paying off. </p><p>“First, let's give ordinary practice a whirl,” I said as I stood up, and swung the hammer several times, merely following its suggestions, even though it had many issues that could easily be fixed. Understandable, as among all the techniques I had, Hammer of Might had seen the most use. </p><p>Learning was much easier when there was a magical force correcting every mistake one might make, but that wasn’t it. I also had two other techniques for different styles, and learning them had allowed me to understand my new skill even better. </p><p>Well, at least as far as how to move my body. The fighting skills used the power from the Stats in a way that defied physics — or, at least, the classical understanding of it — which was not something I was able to learn. </p><p>At least, not yet. </p><p>“Still, every little bit helps,” I said as I continued attacking the air, doing my best to correct the moves based on my old understanding of Hammer of Might, though I mixed some tricks from my two other styles wherever I deemed appropriate.</p><p>As usual, the reward only arrived once I stopped. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) 1 -&gt; 26]</p><p>“Fascinating,” I said, but my words weren’t about the improvement. It was certainly welcome, especially since it gave me a better way to improve stronger skills than mere repetition, which meant I wouldn’t be helpless even if the Mana Blow trick stopped functioning as a cheat. </p><p>No, my interest was a new attack that had been unlocked. I swung my hammer, targeting the nearest rock. It didn’t break, but shattered. </p><p>[-10 Health] </p><p>“My first proper attack,” I realized even as I repeated the attack four more times, trying to get a sense of what it was. </p><p>It felt like an enhanced version of the Shattering Blow perk, but with additional benefits. The greatest difference was a rush of vitality, wrapping around the hammer head as it landed, giving it an incredible destructive power. </p><p>It was similar to Eleanor’s ranged attack, but unlike hers, mine didn’t have the ability to modify the intensity of the blows, or use it as a ranged tool. Whether those features would reveal themselves as I improve the skill, I didn’t know. </p><p>Though, if I were the bet, I would have said the first one was far likelier than the second one. A ranged hammer attack didn’t seem intuitive. </p><p>But then, it wouldn’t be the first time the System defied common sense. While the attack seemed effective, it wouldn’t be too useful on the fourth floor. I could already kill the giant monsters in one blow, and more importantly, I couldn’t use my Health as a disposable tool down there easily. </p><p>I still didn’t have a way to bring food or other things without them degrading in a few minutes. </p><p>“Vitality attacks are a problem for the future,” I said even as I moved to my next test, and used a mana blow. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) 26 -&gt; 27]</p><p>[-5 Mana]</p><p>“Alright, that’s bad,” I said even as I started moving to the forge. While improving one point of skill with one blow seemed like an excellent improvement, the skill was still merely in its twenties. This meant that, for a Rare skill, mana blow wasn’t as much of a cheat as the previous stage. </p><p>Meaning, no easy push to the peak unless I found a new method — another experiment I added to the list rather than starting immediately, as it was something I could work on during the night. I just needed to stand in front of the forge while testing the hammer technique. </p><p>I decided to use most of the silver I had brought to create a brand new set of foreign equipment  instead: tongs, hammers, chisels, two sets of anvils. The small portion, I had left for further experiments. After that, I used the remaining iron to forge a cart made purely of anti-corrosive alloy. </p><p>Wasteful, but I had a lot of things to carry around, including trees. I couldn’t simply carry them. After everything had been done, I dug a nice hiding spot that was concealed with a rock, and put the old set there. There was a chance they would be useful. </p><p>Then, I created a smaller hiding spot near the gate to put my food, my old equipment, and the other stuff I had to leave on the third floor to protect them until I could find a storage method that protected from the corrosion aura. </p><p>Another item for my ever-growing list. “I need a bunch of doctorate students to make them deal with the nonsense —” I started, then reflexively corrected myself as I smiled, remembering how angry the others got when I phrased it like that. “No, give them valuable learning opportunities.” </p><p>I sighed wistfully, missing the times I could spend my time locked in a room, working on a particularly tricky model for a month straight. Running around killing monsters and building stuff might be something I turned out to be proficient at — with the System’s extreme help — ultimately, it was not what I desired to accomplish with my life. </p><p>I was just doing that to create an environment for my research. Just like how I had to deal with a bunch of old men whenever I needed another grant. </p><p>“It’s still better talking to a grant committee,” I growled even as I stepped into the gate. Given the choice, I always preferred a giant army of insect monsters over a grant committee. For one, they had a better personality. </p><p>I didn’t drag the cart forward immediately. First, I snapped a healthy looking branch from the tree, and moved toward the spot I picked for my forge. </p><p>It died halfway. </p><p>“Not good,” I said even as I went back, wondering what to do. I couldn’t simply uproot a tree… could I? Of course, I could also create a line of trees that led directly to the spot, but it would take too much time. </p><p>Carrying a tree was easier. </p><p>With that in mind, I first went to the forge spot and emptied the cart. I knew the monsters didn’t attack inanimate objects unless their density had reached a certain point. Still, I spent half an hour cleaning its surroundings. </p><p>A part of it was collecting the material. I needed the shells from the large beasts to boost the growth of the trees. Also, it gave me a chance to improve my Hammer skill by using the old trick of chaining mana blows. </p><p>[Quake Hammer (Rare) - 81]</p><p>Unfortunately, even when killing giant monsters, its cheat-like ability started to lose its effectiveness. I could probably push it to a hundred with a week of dedicated effort, but that would be the limit. Of course, for anyone else, that improvement would have been nothing less than a miracle, but for me, it was not worth the effort. </p><p>Assuming, of course, the situation didn’t change radically. </p><p>However, just because the development had stalled below the old skill didn’t mean that I was unhappy about replacing my old skill. The existence of the Health attack alone would have been worth it, as it opened a brand new research avenue for me. </p><p>Then, there was the difference between the Rare and Uncommon skills. Even without the special attack, the Rare skill outperformed my old one significantly. </p><p>It was an unexpected benefit to use the hammer skill as a mining tool, but I wasn’t complaining. I dug a bunch of pits, and filled them with broken pieces of shell, and topped it up with my strongest fertilizer mixture. Then, I went back to the giant tree, uprooted it completely and put it on the cart. </p><p>Even with my strength, dragging it had been a chore. Luckily, as I dragged it, the monsters avoided me. A good benefit, though not one that was worth the effort. I still had to use Health on the tree multiple times to keep it alive. </p><p>Hard work, but certainly satisfying, I thought as I looked at the giant tree hovering proudly. Next, I started picking nice branches that could function as cuttings, and started boosting their growth. After the first time it finished, I realized that I had to make a lot of trips just to eat and replenish my Health. </p><p>I forged a small silver box from the remaining silver, making the best anti-corrosive metal I could achieve. Maybe it would work. I tried that, because otherwise, I would have to spend my time going back and forth just to replenish my Health. </p><p>Air-tight silver box worked somewhat. The next time I opened the box, I found the food starting to show signs of degrading, but it was still edible. However, the moment it connected with air, it started degrading even faster.</p><p>So, I modified the box even further. It was essentially a lunch box with multiple air-tight compartments. Not enough to maintain the food overnight, but just enough to keep my Health up while I explored the fourth floor. </p><p>“Now, let’s get to work,” I said. I had a lot of work to do if I wished to be done before noon. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When the next morning arrived, I moved down the dungeon with a renewed passion, dragging the cart with me at full speed, not even slowing down by anything but the giant monsters. I left the smaller ones behind. </p><p>I didn’t even sleep a wink after my revelation, still trying to process the potential implications of the peace field. A naive part of me was telling me to reveal the truth to the public and trust people. Luckily, that part had been battered even before the Calamity, so it was easy to silence. </p><p>Of course, the real reason I was able to silence it was having a better path, unlike pre-Calamity world, where trying to convince the masses to support me so that I could start working on the problem, with vague hopes of finding definite evidence to prove my conclusion was my only option. </p><p>Which then would have triggered a decade long political battle where utterly idiotic politicians mangled the truth just to score cheap points.  </p><p>The System offered an alternative: personal power. </p><p>“Talk about an unhealthy coping mechanism,” I muttered as I killed yet another monster that stumbled right onto my path, and stopped next to the forge, which was still on the third floor. I dropped everything there, changed to my silver anti-corrosion set, and passed through the gate, ready for a fight.</p><p>A fight that hadn’t arrived yet. The monsters circled the tree line I had created, looking agitated — or at least, that was what I assumed was something like anger, insects were not exactly easy to read — as they circled the tree line, appearing right at the edge of the expanded range provided by the trees.</p><p>However, they were closer to the bodies of the tree than they were the day before, which meant that the effect might be temporary or include other limitations. </p><p>“Still, even if it’s temporary, a forge could be set on the fourth floor. It’s just a matter of picking a nice spot,” I said, speaking to myself. </p><p>But, that meant that I needed to make a decision. The spot on the third floor was more than enough as long as I wanted to use it as a personal forge. I had already forged everything I needed, and even if I wanted to improve something, I could keep the forge buried until I decided to do so, along with the chopped wood from the temporary plantation. </p><p>Temporarily, it was alright to keep it on the third floor, but once the town had reached its full capability, things would be different. Sooner or later, someone would want to scope the area and see if there was something useful. </p><p>Which meant that I couldn’t keep my forge out in the open, let alone expanding it further to produce more equipment. Which, I needed if I ever to make enough money to purchase more expensive skills and help others grow. </p><p>Technically, I could set a forge somewhere else. Finding a nice cave or another spot in the wilderness to set a forge was an option, so was setting one up under the guild’s name, but both options had problems. Setting one in the wilderness would mean that the logistics would become more of a challenge. Meanwhile, one under the guild would have spies poking around it sooner or later. </p><p>In comparison, having one on the fourth floor had neither of those problems. The only challenge was to bring metal inside, but even that could be solved by melting the rocks with iron content I had detected. Collecting them would be a hassle, but not to the same degree as trying to smuggle a few tons of metal inside. </p><p>Even my cart trick wouldn’t be sustainable once the scale reached a high enough level. Luckily, silver was much easier to smuggle, as the alloy still required a relatively tiny amount. </p><p>“That means I need to discover a spot rich in iron,” I said. Inspect Perk from Repair could be used to examine rocks to see their metal content as long as they had more than a certain percent, and a quick test showed that Observe was even better. </p><p>Unfortunately, it required a touch … or did it? I couldn’t help but remember the way Maria used Identify, with a line of Mana stretching toward the target. </p><p>“Maybe I could replicate it,” I said as I quickly forged myself several thin silver-iron tubes, trying to expand the sense of Repair. To my surprise, it worked, but after six feet, the amount of details I could get started to drop significantly. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I started expanding the test, creating a tube as thick as my thumb, with a hollow center, which was the limit of getting any kind of detail. </p><p>I heard the existence of skills for this exact purpose. Unfortunately, all but the Basic one required Perception, and I doubted the Basic version was worth the attention the purchase of it would bring. I might change my mind if I couldn’t find anything for the next two days, but for the moment, I decided to limit myself to my newfound solution. </p><p>If I could find a decent iron deposit on the fourth floor, everything would be dandy. If not, I could decide which strategy would be the better option. </p><p>However, as I pulled my trick, I couldn’t help but wonder if I could use Observe on the movement of Mana, trying to get a better sense of what was going on. All I would need to do was to create a thinner tube and push the Mana through it. </p><p>It wouldn’t come close to being perfect, but anything was better than the fizzled perception I had. While Essence allowed me to sense it, the Mana was more like a blob with fuzzy edges. </p><p>Hardly enough to make a judgment. </p><p>I was tempted to push that on top of my to-do list. To start understanding the secrets of Mana was just that important. Unfortunately, there were a lot of things to do, including finding an alloy that interacted with Mana the way I wanted it to.</p><p>That alone was a task that might potentially take days, not to mention it was hardly the only challenge in my plan.  </p><p>“Focus on setting up the logistics first,” I muttered even as I grabbed the thin tube, and pushed it to the ground. I didn’t fear it breaking, as Mana alloys were extremely strong. </p><p>Just to see if there was any possible deposit, I spent twenty minutes checking the third floor, but I wasn’t able to find any. If there was, it was either in a deeper spot, or more localized. </p><p>Then, I went to the fourth floor, and started using the stick every ten steps, covering the area around the gate. I wanted to understand the nature of the area, but in the process, I discovered that the depths of the dungeon had a limited amount of iron. </p><p>It wasn’t high, less than a percent. It meant, a pound of iron would require more than a hundred pound of ores, and that assumed I could extract all of it. However, it was still good news. Especially since I carefully went through the entire area, and discovered two types of underground plants that reminded me of potatoes, and a new type of dungeon crystal.</p><p>A new type of crystal represented the possibility of developing new alloys, making it incredibly valuable for my purposes. And, while the underground plants weren’t immediately valuable, the fact that they were able to survive in the weird environment of the bog was promising enough. I could potentially use these new plants to push my Nurture skill further even if I couldn’t find any use for them. </p><p>I put them in the sample bag before I started moving once more.  </p><p>Once I left the protective field of the trees, I picked a direction, started the exciting life of mineral prospecting, interrupted by waves and waves of monsters, enough to raise a lot of people to a new level. “Nice,” I muttered as I found my first inferior deposit, which contained a mere five percent iron density. I quickly dug a pit there, mostly as a signpost so I wouldn’t miss it, and continued to go deeper. </p><p>Once again, half a mile later, the dungeon door disappeared behind the mist. I pushed half a mile more just in case before I returned, and started repeating the same thing from a different angle. Ideally, I wanted to set up the forge where the dungeon gate wasn’t visible. </p><p>The harder it was to discover, the better. </p><p>I walked back and forth, killing monsters in the process. However, even as I spent half a day killing giant monsters, there wasn’t a level up, nor was I able to discover any usable skills. I still piled them on top of each other, trying to get Rare skills, but I either got ones that were incomprehensible, or I got another Rare Nurture. </p><p>Still, I continued. It was a tedious task, but persistence was a virtue. And, I didn’t want to settle on that deposit with five percent content. Especially since it was already close enough to the gate, which made it a troubling target. </p><p>Then, I discovered a nice rocky outcropping, one that would be more defensible than anywhere else. I started searching its immediate surroundings more carefully, and soon, I discovered a lovely deposit, one that reached almost ten percent iron content. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I said. I knew that such a purity would not be even treated as a mine outside, but I didn’t care. Once again, its value was relative. </p><p>My luck must have turned, because one of the skills reacted. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Quake Hammer (Rare)]</p><p>“Fascinating,” I muttered. Any other skill, I might have delayed absorbing it, afraid whether my Mana trick would be able to push it to the next level, but a Hammer skill was different. With the way it synergized with Forge, I would eventually raise it to its new limit. </p><p>It was an excellent test target. </p><p>Especially since I had two more skills that were extremely useful for combat.</p><p>However, despite my excitement, I still returned to the third floor first. No need to get distracted in the most dangerous spot I could currently access. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 100 -&gt; Quake Hammer (Rare) 1]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Time to return,” I said to myself serenely, and started walking back. </p><p>Of course, I knew it was not true acceptance. However, once the heat from the realization was gone, I was able to put it back into the pile of things I would deal with in the future. It was a big disaster, one that could potentially change the world, but it wasn’t something I could deal with blindly. </p><p>And, the first step was to confirm that it was actually the situation. Admittedly, studying it wouldn’t have been too easy. Even the simplest experiment I could think of, which was to give two groups some kind of tricky problem that was disguised as an IQ test, required me to access at least a hundred people, and hold experiments in two different locations. </p><p>Observing the new town was not an option, as there were too many variables to come to a conclusion. Maybe if I had the data from at least a hundred new towns, and a proper computer to process it —</p><p>“Not the time,” I said. While it was tempting to spend the next month coming up with fascinating observation methodologies that might solve my issue, it would have been ultimately counterproductive. Even the cheapest setup I could envision required a lot of money to run. More importantly, it would have been too obvious. </p><p>There was one important question about the peace fields: Whether they were intentionally there to control the society, or if that was just a side effect. As much as I wanted to dismiss the first option as a crazy conspiracy theory, I couldn’t. And, until I could, I didn’t have the luxury of experimenting freely. </p><p>I was even happier that I hid my Mana Forge and Mana Repair after this revelation. </p><p>Instead, I needed to use the opportunity to experiment with environmental mana. We wouldn’t stay here for long, and I had already wasted most of my time. It would be even more annoying if Eleanor wrapped up her business with Rosie. </p><p>Luckily, I could always use the excuse of getting inspired about sword technique if she was angry. It should mollify her. </p><p>Meanwhile, I found a nice concealed corner, leaned against a rock wall, and started using Meditation to gather mana. </p><p>To my surprise, it was slower than using the monster parts to refill my mana. Considerably so, but it didn’t take long for me to understand the reason. I barely ran the technique for a minute before the Mana density around me had dropped considerably. </p><p>That hadn’t been a problem with the monster parts. I could always shatter more. </p><p>I stayed like that, absorbing more and more mana, while the density around me continued to drop.  Reaching back up to three digits took more than fifteen minutes. There were certain ways to increase Mana density, that much was common knowledge, but guessing how effective they would be was something else. </p><p>”Alright, that explains why mages don’t stick around in small towns,” I said. That fact alone had changed multiple plans I had about my future. However, that didn’t mean my experimentation was over. Instead, I broke a few silver coins even as I dug a pit and snapped a few branches. </p><p>I was just about to reflexively reach into my pocket when I remembered I had a more convenient way of creating fire. And, casting a spell was faster than slowly releasing it back. </p><p>I raised my hand, ready to lose a hundred mana. </p><p>[-68 Mana]</p><p>“Alright, that was interesting,” I muttered even as I noticed the relatively small drop in the number. But, I didn’t need to think about the reason. </p><p>Even as the spell was in progress, it started pulling Mana from the environment as well, faster than I could manage with my meditation. Not only that, the spell had actually gathered faster, almost four seconds rather than full five. </p><p>Interesting concept. </p><p>It also explained why they couldn’t defend the town with Maria. I had assumed that it had been just the cost of Mana regeneration items, but clearly, it was also about resource efficiency and casting speed. </p><p>“Ignore the implications,” I said even as I threw the broken silver coins into the fire and melted them, and bled on them with my Health, followed it with mana. </p><p>[-85 Health]</p><p>[-9 Mana]</p><p>“It doesn’t work,” I muttered even as I had attempted a few times. But, the same experiment that had allowed me to create a Mana alloy for the first time didn’t work when there was some Mana in the atmosphere. </p><p>Even following the System recipes were harder, forcing me to isolate the environmental mana. It was doable, but even that was slower. An environment without external interference was much better. </p><p>I stayed in the concealed spot for one more minute, draining my remaining Mana in the form of a Mana Blow. For that, environmental Mana had no impact. Mana simply stuck around the blade until it lost its cohesion.</p><p>I practiced until I had made enough progress to support the excuse for my sudden inspiration. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 73 -&gt; 76]</p><p>Then, I paused, thinking if there was any other experiment I needed to run. I did not. </p><p>But, I had an observation I wanted to make. On the way back, I drifted near one of the farms that supplied the town with most of its fresh produce. </p><p>“Hey, this is private property,” someone warned as I walked toward the nearest tree. </p><p>“Don’t make a big deal. I’m feeling peckish,” I said. He looked ready to fight, but when I flipped a silver coin his way, he was quick to change his attitude. </p><p>I went to the nearest tree, and snapped an apple. Meanwhile, I just wanted to examine the tree from close up. The tree was draining some Mana from the environment. Very slowly, probably not amounting to more than a point every hour, but looking carefully, the movement was clear. </p><p>A stronger evidence was the greenhouses deeper into the farm. Unlike open fields, they had multiple guards around them, who wouldn’t have appreciated my presence, no doubt. However, I didn’t need to get closer. Even from a distance, I could see the way Mana gathered toward the building. </p><p>They likely had some kind of enchantment to increase Mana density. </p><p>Of course, I watch not just the greenhouses, but also the way some of the night workers operated, trying to get  a better sense of the process of farming. I didn’t learn anything other than Mana also playing a significant role in farming, but it was a good exchange for a silver coin. </p><p>Also, the apple was delicious. </p><p>When I reached the door, the guards didn’t allow me inside because of the curfew. I could have mentioned Eleanor’s name and entered, but it made a good excuse for my disappearance, so I just shrugged and walked back. </p><p>While I didn’t think I could avoid stepping into another peace field forever, I didn’t want to do that. Not before I could properly process the realization that I had been magically drugged for years. Though, the scariest thing had been the effects. </p><p>And, how easy it had been to excuse any stupid decision, staying in the town and working obediently, waiting for a convenient break rather than doing everything I could. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t some kind of fear that kept me away. I knew that, after three years of exposure, another night wouldn’t be harmful. However, going back into the town also meant talking with Rosie.</p><p>And, that woman was far too sharp to deal with such a thing. </p><p>I wanted to browse some of the Basic and Common skills I wanted, and maybe purchase a few of them, but it wasn’t critical enough to force myself. For once, I decided to be lazy and indulgent, rather than being drugged to behave so. </p><p>While waiting for her, I pulled my sword once more to practice, this time without killing the monsters. It was still more relaxing than calming exercises and ordinary meditation. I hated sitting around doing nothing. </p><p>Eleanor returned almost an hour later, and when she did, I was much calmer. “Hey, where were you?” she asked. </p><p>“Sorry, I know I was supposed to be joining you, but I had been hit by a sudden bit of inspiration,” I said, trying my best to sound excited. “It increased by three whole points, reaching seventy-six.” </p><p>Luckily, Eleanor was far more excited about the prospect to question the tone of my voice. “Wow, that’s amazing news!” </p><p>I was strangely glad when she drew her sword and charged at me, and we started sparring. It was even better than practicing, as it forced me to focus fully. We sparred for almost twenty minutes before she reluctantly pulled back. “I still have a meeting at the camp about the construction of the second layer of the town. We need to go back,” she said. </p><p>“Alright,” I said. “How was the meeting?” </p><p>“Typical, filled with more bean counting than I’m happy with; but we do what we must,” she said. </p><p>“And, how did Rosie react to my situation?”</p><p>“She didn’t,” Eleanor replied, which surprised me. “Since you didn’t come, I assumed you changed your mind about revealing that to her. We can go back and tell her if you want.” </p><p>“It’s not really that important,” I said. “We can always meet the next time.” </p><p>“But, it means that you flew for nothing. I know how you … don’t like flying.” </p><p>“That’s true,” I said, amused by her attempt to tiptoe around my almost crippling fear of flying. “But still, I benefited from the visit more than I expected. It’s worth it.” </p><p>“You’re right. Three points of proficiency in a couple of hours, particularly when it reaches seventies, is no joke. It’s worth a little distress.” </p><p>It was not what I meant, but I wouldn’t have corrected that even if I wasn’t intentionally trying to mislead her. Instead, I joined her on the griffin. </p><p>For the first time in my life, I was actually looking forward to flying. Any distraction from the shocking revelation was welcome. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I followed Eleanor, I did my best to ignore the giant question about having something called calming field over every single town. I failed. Somehow, it nauseated me worse than that horrible flight experience. </p><p>I tried to ignore it, but failed. Something was bubbling inside me. For the first time, I wanted to feel like raging. Worse, now that I knew that there was something to look for, I could feel that anger draining out of me slowly. The weaker my anger got, the smoother the draining had become. Soon, even though I knew what to look for, I couldn’t identify the effect. </p><p>I couldn’t handle the idea. </p><p>“Actually, do you mind if I go kill a few monsters? It’ll calm me better,” I managed to squeeze between my clenched teeth. </p><p>“I understand the feeling. Go ahead. I’ll be at the Broken Tankard,” Eleanor said. </p><p>I nodded thankfully before I turned and started walking away. The darkness, I welcomed as I moved away from the town, ignoring the road, which was safer — but not safe — as I cut directly toward the nearest woodland. </p><p>It was one of the hunting areas maintained for the low-leveled people, with an hourly access fee. At least, during the day. </p><p>It was too unpredictable during the night. Exactly what I needed. I wanted to destroy things without being observed by anyone. For the first time in my life, I wanted to lash out and destroy. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was the reason for my state, obediently sending applications to the new research groups without taking initiative. </p><p>One of the guards shook his hand. “Hey, buddy. You can’t come here during the night —” he started. </p><p>I just threw him a gold coin. An abject waste of money, but I didn’t want to talk with him. With my hands shaking with anger, I didn’t know how he would react. </p><p>“Alright, but if you have any problem, I didn’t see you,” the guard said as he put the coin into his bag before walking away. </p><p>I ignored that as I delved into the forest, my blade dancing to cut and skewer any monster that was stupid enough to come close. I moved deeper and deeper, killing more and more. It didn’t make me any less angry, but gave me a sense of control, enough that I could start processing my anger.  </p><p>While the idea that I might have wasted three years of my life was a horrible realization, it wasn’t the reason for my rage. </p><p>Not even close.  </p><p>I was furious, because having a calming field effect going on constantly was nothing less than a true disaster. Of course, there were many reasons it was a horrible disaster, like potential impact on brain chemistry, but on those, I didn’t know enough to make a judgment call. </p><p>I could only make a certain judgment from the perspective of a sociologist. And, that judgment was clear. </p><p>It was a disaster, which had the potential to be worse than the Calamity itself.  </p><p>Though, I was glad that I didn’t have to tell someone else about that. I doubted that I could realistically convey the significance of it to someone that was not an expert. And even then, it wouldn’t be a simple conversation.  </p><p>In a way, stress was like gravity. Without it, thinking that we would be jumping happily was a good dream. In reality, our bodies would turn into malformed abominations with countless defects, because every little biological function we had depended on gravity to shape it. </p><p>Stress had some function for our minds and the society. </p><p>Just like gravity, there were many harmful effects caused by stress. Chronic health problems, impact on productivity, leading social conflicts, aggressions, damaging relationships, burnouts, and many other effects that would take too long to list… </p><p>Yet, it was a proven fact that stress, in moderate doses, was a critical aspect of motivation. It sharpened focus and drove the individuals to become better. From a certain point of view, it was also the reason most successful people had been maladjusted — a list that included me, if I were to be honest. </p><p>It drove people to adapt, grow, and innovate in unpredictable ways. Without that drive, people could still push themselves and excel, but they rarely became exceptional. In a way, it generated excellent accountants and gym teachers, but not many true scientists or record breaking athletes.  </p><p>That alone explained why most people didn’t even think of pushing the limits of the System but obediently followed the easiest path to improvement. </p><p>Of course, fighting constantly against monsters was a stressful activity, but it didn’t make people innovate. Too much stress impacts creativity in a completely opposite manner, stifling it and forcing people to stick to their traditions and habits even more. Especially habits like killing more monsters to get stronger, which was an obvious choice. </p><p>It didn’t exactly happen like that for me … but then, I could hardly call myself a normal, well-adjusted human being. I was the reason my psychologist had been able to send her child through college without student loans.  </p><p>“I hate it,” I growled as I destroyed another monster. “We are dealing with a magical disaster and literal monsters, yet we’re still our worst enemy.” </p><p>I wasn’t exaggerating. Just by stopping people from experimenting, those calming fields might have killed more people than the first wave of Calamity. A massacre of grand scale.  </p><p>That alone would have been horrible enough. But, there were many other critical functions of stress in society. For example, it played an incredible role in social bonding. Stress drew people together, both seeking comfort of the group, and trying to overcome the challenges together. </p><p>Yet, people had been living in relative, forced calm, then went out to fight against monsters to get an enhanced dose of stress, not just from the fact that they were fighting for their lives, but it was likely that they also suffered withdrawal effects from leaving the calming field, at least to a level similar to trying to quit smoking. </p><p>Which meant, any group that worked together had turned even more close knit and loyal. A good thing during a fight, as people weren’t afraid of being abandoned by their fellow fighters. But a horrible thing from a societal perspective. </p><p>“Codependent” was a word that people loved to throw around, but it was a dangerous thing. It made people stay in cults that drained their money and linger in abusive relationships until it killed them. </p><p>In our current situation, codependent was an understatement —  </p><p>“Fuck, that explains why everyone follows people with Charisma like lost puppies,” I growled even as I punched the nearest tree, leaving a deep indent. It didn’t break my gauntleted hand. I wish it did. Not only had people turned more loyal, but Charisma was probably able to replicate that effect, at least partially. </p><p>Which meant that anyone with Charisma was essentially microdosing people constantly when they had been struggling with addiction symptoms. </p><p>Combined, it was even more devastating than ordinary. It meant, every guild was some kind of a frat house on steroids, led by what was essentially a cult leader. </p><p>It also explained one of the biggest questions I had, the strong drift on social values and ethics. While I had some theories, I had always been weirded out by how quickly a world built on the idea of freedom and individuality — at least, to some degree — had been able to regress back to medieval principles in less than three years. </p><p>The peace fields presented a much better explanation.</p><p>I reacted that badly, because I had already studied the concept before Cataclysm. </p><p>The idea of artificially adjusting people’s emotions and drives to create a ‘better’ society wasn’t exactly a new idea. The CIA had famously experimented on the impact of the drugs, not to mention many famous science fiction books examined the concept as a thought experiment. </p><p>Of course, as a famous sociologist that could actually model impacts of such concepts, I had sufficient access to some of the studies that hadn’t been revealed to the public yet. People often underestimated the number of contingencies that the government had for any kind of an emergency, from disease outbreaks to a sudden nuclear attack. </p><p>Ironically, even the Cataclysm was prepared for … technically. A total collapse of electrical infrastructure along with a hostile invasion sufficiently fit the theme. Of course, it didn’t help even a bit when the Cataclysm hit, because, ultimately, those plans needed to be implemented on time. </p><p>However, they weren’t the only ones that commissioned such studies. There were many eccentric rich people that tried to solve every problem the world had through their sheer genius. Of course, those genius ideas were often one-liners like building a huge underwater city before leaving the ‘easy’ part to the experts. </p><p>I remembered it, because I had been harassed by a particularly annoying one years ago. It was called Horizon Institute, and they had been obsessive enough to harass me for a month, offering me a frankly ludicrous amount of money to work for their genius founder. </p><p>But, no money was worth working for a bunch of crazy people, especially since I had been more than comfortable with my finances thanks to a few peripheral projects I had done for tech companies. A few startups had paid in shares, which then appreciated more than I expected, freeing me from the necessity to indulge them. </p><p>It was particularly satisfying to throw the gold watch they had given me as an apology to the garbage. It had been less satisfying when I actually went and paid for a replica to be made when the dean started to nag me about upsetting important donors. </p><p>“Those were the days,” I muttered even as I continued to kill, going deeper and deeper into the forest, letting my anger drain out of me while I let my skill lead me. In a way, it was like Meditation. </p><p>A very violent variant. </p><p>I continued, spending some more time before I started to walk back. ”It is ironic that the conspiracies about chem-trails had suddenly turned real,” I said, but my chuckle sounded dark even to my ears.   </p><p>Not a surprise, considering what would happen if I tried to convince people about my conclusions. I didn’t know if the peace fields were some kind of intentional conspiracy to somehow manipulate humanity, or if it was something they used simply because it helped people in power. Ultimately, it didn’t matter. </p><p>It took decades of fighting to limit tobacco usage, where the industry lied, cheated, bribed, used legal troubles, and that had been only one recreational industry. Trying to convince the people that were actually fashioning themselves as feudal city lords and medieval nobles that one of the fundamental aspects of their power was harmful…  </p><p>There was only one question about what would happen if I tried. Would I be treated as a madman and dismissed, or quietly assassinated?</p>",

    "content": "<p>When I returned to the town, enthusiastic about testing the limits of the improved core skills, Eleanor was already waiting for me. This time, she didn’t say anything even before she drew her sword and attacked. </p><p>“Good evening to you as well,” I called even as I drew mine and countered her attack, even parrying hard enough to push her back. </p><p>“I thought that it’s better to check whether you’re slacking,” she said even as she attacked again. I countered her easily. This time, it was less about her holding back, and more about where we were fighting. A tight corridor, which was far more advantageous for Stalwart Guard. </p><p>Of course, that advantage wouldn’t be enough for me to win against her if she started fighting seriously, but the fact that she had to take me seriously in the first place was enough to show how much I had grown. </p><p>We fought for two minutes before she pulled back, clearly satisfied. I barely added ten points since our spar, but considering the increasing difficulty of upgrading a skill, it was still incredible. Believably so. </p><p>“I heard that you managed to hunt a lot of insects today,” she said. </p><p>“Yes. Trying to take them in one blow is a good trick, especially with the stone shield trick,” I replied. “The second floor is not as hard as I had initially feared. Giant ones are even easier to deal with a hammer. Though, it was hell to maintain the little contraption I made. I had to repair it maybe twenty times.” </p><p>“That’s what you get for trying to rely on machines rather than proper skill,” she said. </p><p>I strongly disagreed with her absurd statement. No matter how convenient the skills were, it was not an excuse to not to attempt recreating technology in some way. However, I kept my mouth shut, not wanting to annoy my boss … or was she technically my business partner. Maybe a client? </p><p>Then, I shrugged. Regardless of her exact title, she represented my access to the dungeon. I could humor her. “Unfortunately, I need the money to recruit when the caravan arrives. So, unless you have a couple thousand gold coins you want to lend me without interest, I have to play with these devices.” </p><p>“Good point,” she said. “I would have, but I have put everything I have to bid for the dungeon along with Lady Maria. We even borrowed some from the family. Or, I would have done that easily.” </p><p>I thought about asking her just how much it cost, but I held my mouth shut. Being too nosy was not a good idea. “Any plans for the night?” I asked. </p><p>“I need to go back to the town,” she replied. “I have another meeting with that b — Rosie. Do you want to come?” she corrected, her tone signaling that they weren’t getting along. A change from the earlier attitude. My best guess, Eleanor was getting annoyed at Rosie’s business acumen. Not that I blamed her. </p><p>Rosie was a dangerous opponent across the table. </p><p>“Depends,” I said. </p><p>“On what?” </p><p>“On how much Rosie actually knows about the dungeon, and how invested she is in its success,” I said. “There’s no way a beard and a new skill would make her believe that I’m a new person.” </p><p>Eleanor nodded, clearly not having considered that. “She is the one that found us the suppliers for the skills, and she was the one that found the new blacksmiths. Also, she invested a lot in her new guild here. Don’t you trust her?” </p><p>I paused for a moment, considering. Before, I would have said that I trusted her immediately. While she had always looked out for herself, that was not a bad quality in a dangerous world. She had a reputation for sticking to the deals she made.</p><p>I knew that intimately. When I was still using her to collect data about the surrounding towns, I had carefully analyzed the data she provided to make sure it was not fake. Faking data, even with people with Intelligence, was not an easy job, especially against me. </p><p>After a decade of reviewing papers for various journals — a terrible, thankless part of academia — I was pretty familiar with how fake data looked. Just to be on the safe side, I even ran some statistical analysis to make sure everything was acceptable. </p><p>While it was not conclusive evidence, it was a strong positive mark to her case. Combined with her significant investment to the town, it was fair to assume that she could be trusted … with my identity. Not anything else. </p><p>Especially since there was a good chance that she would be moving here to operate her new guild. Revealing my identity was easier than playing hide and seek. And, with her being aware of my identity, I could start making purchases through her once again. </p><p>The best thing about it was that she was too used to my weird purchases, so a few potentially risky subjects should just go under the radar. </p><p>“Fair, let’s go,” I said, hating myself that I was actually volunteering to fly. However, I needed to do so, because I had too many things to do in the town. I wanted to buy new skills, experiment with environmental mana, and even see if I could hire some people to work for me.</p><p>Then, I froze, remembering an important fact. “Actually, do you have anything that can block Identify?” I asked. “We don’t want anyone checking my class.” </p><p>“Good point. Wait here,” she said as she brought me a bracelet. “Be careful, though. It doesn’t last long. Only activate when you’re suspicious, and turn it off once the situation passes,” she said. </p><p>“How does it work?” I asked as I looked at the ugly gold bracelet with emerald and ruby studdings. </p><p>“Just hold it in your hand and focus, it’ll trigger,” she said. “But, be careful. It’s an active enchantment, and it’s already mostly drained. It can probably last only for ten more minutes.” </p><p>“Alright,” I said, ignoring the temptation to just start examining it. I tried that on the camouflage ring, only to end up disappointed. The ring itself was a boring Mana alloy, and everything was done with Mana. </p><p>Which, it had a limited amount of, with no way to refill — at least no way I could figure. </p><p>Still, it didn’t bother me, I had a good feeling that I could actually block someone’s mana if they tried. I just needed to be careful if someone tried to touch me, and that was it. The bracelet, I just needed as an excuse. </p><p>“Let’s go,” she said. I nodded, </p><p>Merely ten minutes later, I had been cursing that decision as I grabbed the griffin, scared out of my mind.  I had been a passenger on Eleanor’s griffin twice, and both had been pleasant experiences — as far as it could be when one flew on top a giant mutated bird with a stupid lion legs that couldn’t even manage to flap its wings smoothly; an opinion I held with absolutely no bias. </p><p>Unfortunately, one of those trips had been between the town and the dungeon, which was a very small distance with constant patrols keeping the wild monsters away. During the other trip, we had Maria dealing with the monsters with her flame attacks. </p><p>Without her, Eleanor was the one to handle them. In melee range. </p><p>It wasn’t the monsters that scared me. I trusted Eleanor to handle them, and even if I didn’t, I could have used Stalwart Guard to protect myself. </p><p>No, it was the fact that our Griffin had been dealing with most of the attacks, which made it jerk and twist, worse than even the worst turbulence. Without strength, I wouldn’t have been able to hold on. </p><p>Eleanor said something, but I wasn’t able to process it as my ears rang, spots appearing in my eyes. I recognized the panic attack easily. I took deep breaths, but it didn’t work. </p><p>I closed my eyes, repeating myself that I wouldn’t actually die if I fell. With Health to recover from, a fall from terminal velocity wouldn’t be deadly unless I landed on my head. Unfortunately, that didn’t work any better than repeating the plane accident statistics in my mind had before the Calamity. </p><p>It was torture. </p><p>Not even the sudden change in environment as we entered a mana rich atmosphere had helped me. When we landed, I threw myself on the ground, my legs trembling badly. “Are you alright?” Eleanor asked. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” I answered, not even in the mood for a lie. </p><p>“Come on, let’s bring you to the town,” she said even as she presented her arm. I grabbed it, and let her drag me toward the gate. However, halfway in, my shakes started to disappear. </p><p>Faster than I was used to. It was not normal.  </p><p>“What’s going on?” I asked. </p><p>“We have just stepped into the peace zone,” she said. </p><p>“Peace zone?” I asked. </p><p>She paused. “I sometimes forget that you don’t really know a lot about big stuff,” she said. “Is it possible that you forget that I even said that?” I didn’t even bother answering her. </p><p>“Alright, but keep your mouth shut. It’s a small addition to the formation of every town. It radiates a weak calming effect to prevent stress build up, making sure people don’t go around fighting every day. However, the effect is too weak to actually stop people if they are aware, so it’s not exactly announced. Too bad we can’t really afford it for our town yet. They are cheap, but in our case, we can’t afford to supply it with mana.” </p><p>“A reasonable precaution,” I said, glad that I had the excuse of being sick to explain the utter disgust in my tone. A permanent calming effect, affecting my mind. Constantly in the air. </p><p>I couldn’t even begin to explain why it was a bad decision to keep people under a constant mind-altering effect. Even assuming that there was no side effect — debatable — one thing had been scientifically proven. </p><p>A certain amount of stress played an important role in any kind of innovation, or drive to succeed. </p><p>Looking back, I couldn’t help but wonder if it explained why I had lost three years of my life, limiting myself to sending applications while trying to collect some meager data rather than doing … anything else. I had always assumed that it was just my old world habits. </p><p>But, was it? </p>",

    "content": "<p>Forging a completely new set of gear had been an exciting prospect. Even if the skill didn’t give me a better variant of the anti-corrosive alloy with some silver mixed in, the difference between sixty points and a hundred points was incredible enough to make it worth the effort.</p><p>After all, such a radical jump didn’t just bring with it more materials, but completely new techniques to use. Some of those techniques revealed new ways to use Mana to manipulate the underlying material, while the others were purely physical methods like folding the metal more and more to manipulate its crystallization structure.</p><p>However, I didn’t choose to forge the best weapon that was offered, for one simple reason: It required a long and delicate forging process, requiring me to turn the metal into a sheet before folding it back again and again for hours for every ingot.</p><p>While it would have made the resulting weapon considerably better, I didn’t have a week to forge a weapon and a month to forge a piece of armor.</p><p>No, a set that used most of the silver I had while still being forged in under one hour was the best option. I compensated for some of the weaknesses by using an excessive amount of mana, while the others stayed in place.</p><p>Even this was only possible thanks to Creative Forging and Mana Control, a combination that allowed me to bypass a lot of restrictions inherent to these techniques, though the quality suffered significantly.</p><p>I wondered just how incredible my weapons would have been had I chosen the Masterwork path, but it was just an idle curiosity. Ultimately, my new set was more than enough to handle the challenges offered by this dungeon, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>“Still, it had been an interesting experience,” I muttered as I spent ten minutes, and used the last of the available silver to make the shell removal device I had been trying to make. It worked beautifully, but it was not commercially viable.</p><p>Simply because it was too precious. The device I had envisioned last night had many moving parts out of necessity, and they didn’t work very well. Instead, what I forged was essentially three small thin knives with an absurd elasticity and even sharper edges, perfect to scoop under the shells.</p><p>Unfortunately, its materials were too precious, which would be suspicious.</p><p>“I can always keep it with me while showing the prototype,” I decided.</p><p>I needed the money it would bring.</p><p>Technically, with my current abilities, there were far better methods of making money. I could go and start forging mana alloys in a mana-dense location. I didn’t know how much a silver mana alloy would go for, but ten gold coins for an ingot was far below the actual price.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t know a way to do so without suddenly becoming a ‘guest’ to one of the stronger families. After all, I didn’t just offer rare resources, but a chance to replicate, which was the kind of thing that needed to be monopolized to maximize its impact.</p><p>“Hunting insects is more than acceptable,” I decided. Maybe I could try something better once I believed myself to be strong enough, but I still had a lot to do before that step. Even with all the things I had solved, I was still three years behind schedule.</p><p>Even as I started walking toward the fourth floor, I started thinking about how to close that gap. The most urgent step was obvious. Before reaching level fifty, I needed to find a way to improve my class skills to the next stage.</p><p>Which, in turn, would give me a better class once I reached level fifty. Hopefully.</p><p>Of course, I couldn’t exactly experiment blindly. Even with the Mana variants of my two skills, I had a solid direction of where to go. I had worked with mana alloys, and Maria had helped me by infusing mana into the metal. Even then, only the coincidence of being in a mana dead zone allowed me to make that jump.</p><p>For the other possible improvements, I needed direction.</p><p>For direction, I needed information.</p><p>And, for information, I needed money.</p><p>“Let’s hunt,” I said, even as I delved into the fourth floor. I had achieved a lot, but I still had some time. And, I wanted to see if the improved equipment helped me against the giant insects.</p><p>The short answer, it did. Immensely.</p><p>Before, I still needed to use a combination of spear and hammer styles against giant beasts, climbing on top of them before using the hammer. It wasn’t slow by any means, taking less than ten seconds.</p><p>But, the difference between ten seconds and one blow was too much. Suddenly, I was able to push the spear art to the limit as I ran through the bog without even slowing down, each blow killing a giant insect. Most of the time, I didn’t even bother changing my path to kill one of the smaller ones.</p><p>The increased speed had paid off greatly. When I finished the time I had allocated to pure leveling, I had already improved further.</p><p>[Level 38 -&gt; 39]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>[Level 39 -&gt; 40]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>On the way back, I shifted to the sword, trying to replicate the mana attack.</p><p>To my shock, it took only three tries for me to succeed … somewhat. It was a combination of a minute amount of silver conducting mana better than I had expected, my new Mana Control perk allowing me to control the flow better, and a greater understanding of how to shape it to get an approximation of a cutting edge.</p><p>[-2 Mana]</p><p>I stopped using the sword once the skill proficiency reached the low seventies, which I had accomplished easily by killing a dozen insects. I slowed it down, once again trying to stay within reasonable bounds.</p><p>With my spear and hammer skill in place, the only function of the sword skill was to impress Eleanor.</p><p>However, as I passed near the dried remains of the tree I tried to raise, I decided that I still had time for one more experiment. And, with the small plantation in place, even if Rare skills proved harder to improve than I initially assumed, I could always go the slow way.</p><p>I went back to the third floor, once again refilling the small pond. Then, I grabbed the Rare skill stone, and absorbed it.</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 100 -&gt; Nurture (Rare) 1]</p><p>“That’s a big drop,” I muttered even as I started using the rare variant, trying to see how it changed, trying to compare it with the other variants.</p><p>The first thing I noticed was that it was far more effective when it came to dealing with the poison aspects, easily cleansing it from the sapling with a little bit of mana. That had been incredible enough, but also the growth effect was more pronounced.</p><p>Then, there was the final result. The saplings that had been enhanced by the Rare variant looked far more healthier. Its branches were smoother and thicker, and the leaves were brighter. It actually looked like a tree rather than a sorry excuse.</p><p>The only disadvantage was that the skill was slower to grow. The poisoned tree trick had been able to push the old skill to eighties easily, while the Rare variant slowed down at below fifty. Though, considering it was functioning better at that level, it was hardly a drawback.</p><p>“And, it’s not like I don’t have a method to handle it,” I said even as I uprooted another tree, refilled my health by eating — glad that my Vitality made that process even faster — and went back to the fourth floor.</p><p>“Let’s see how long you’ll be able to survive,” I said as I buried the tree that was as tall as me. I injected it with a burst of Health.</p><p>[-22 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Rare) 42 -&gt; 46]</p><p>“Excellent,” I said, and repeated the trick, curious just how much I would be able to push it before it died … but it didn’t take long for me to realize I had made a slight miscalculation.</p><p>The rare variant was better at dealing with the poison aspect … to a significant degree. Which meant, the tree wasn’t slowly corroding, but actually growing, a pattern that had started to get more and more obvious.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I was looking for a giant tree that towered above me, taller than twenty yards. An important detail, because I could see its branches without being blocked by the dungeon mist. Interesting.</p><p>[Nurture (Rare) - 82]</p><p>“How curious,” I said even as I walked back, only to realize my vision range still included the tree. Only when I walked back, I realized that, effectively, there was a second bubble around the tree, which overlapped with mine. The moment I walked away sufficiently, the mist blocked the way.</p><p>Since I needed to keep things going, I moved back, wanting to add seven more trees around the dungeon gate. Having a better vision around the gate would have made my life much easier.</p><p>Raising seven more trees allowed me to raise Nurture back to nineties, which took another half an hour. A nice surprise. Another surprise followed soon after.</p><p>The insects avoided the fully-grown trees.</p><p>Another fascinating little detail.</p><p>“Incredible,” I said, but while I wanted to play around, it was also true that I needed money. A lot of money. For that reason, I went back to the third floor, and used a combination of shell extraction device and the new silver spear with great efficiency.</p><p>Thanks to the device, it took less than a second to extract the shell without damaging it, which was an incredible activity. Extracting a thousand shells took barely more than an hour, traveling took more than the task itself, and even then, it wasn’t much.</p><p>The third floor was teeming with monsters, which gave me more than enough prey. I might have even extracted more, that would have been suspicious even with the extraction device.</p><p>With that, I piled everything onto the cart, and started going up.</p><p>When I arrived, the guards looked at the cart with a shocked expression. “Wow, that’s an … incredible haul. Particularly since you’re alone.”</p><p>“Nothing too much,” I replied even as I smiled. “A good friend of mine made this for me. It’s a bit of trouble to maintain, and I paid a hundred gold for it, but it’s worth it.” It was not without reason I gave such an absurd number. It needed to look like something that was not affordable.</p><p>“Really, what does it do?” the guard asked.</p><p>“It helps extract the shells,” I said. “Also, I was lucky to find a swarm or two, and a few good Samaritans were kind enough to exchange weapons with me so I didn’t have to return every hour.”</p><p>“Wow, really,” he said.</p><p>“Of course,” I replied even as I raised my sword, and told a quick story about how I achieved it while also showing my sword skills. An explanation … and if someone was having some thoughts, a warning.</p><p>When I left the dungeon, I was thirty gold coins richer. It would have been thirty-two, with some spare silver, but the extra, I left as a tip.</p><p>Well, I let them record as such, at least. Currently, they weren’t paying with coins, but giving some kind of credit, which could be used for services. It had to be redeemed in the town, after all the expenses from repair fees to guild rent had been paid.</p><p>Still, a reputation for generosity wouldn’t harm. Especially when, tomorrow, I would probably borrow at least twenty swords to make things more believable, which was technically against the rules. Everyone could borrow three swords, and had to bring them back in an acceptable condition to get a new one.</p><p>Getting twenty swords would eat into my profits even more, but I didn’t need Eleanor to start wondering if I discovered some kind of resistant alloy this early on.</p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 21</p><p>When I woke up, my body was still aching somewhat, reminding me that using Health from the System to heal wasn’t exactly perfect, or painless. </p><p>“I can’t believe I was that reckless,” I muttered, my body reminding me of the cost of trying to use a skill without understanding it fully. It was arrogant of me to self-experiment without properly assessing the situation. I had assumed a mere one point of mana wouldn’t be a problem. </p><p>At least, instead of a painful injury, I had received some upgrades to my skill, as well as a valid way to rapidly improve it. Curious to test, I went to the forge, and intentionally damaged one of the swords before repairing it again. </p><p>“Wow, controlled flow is amazing,” I muttered as I repaired the weapon. It allowed me to somehow nudge the enchantment to the side while repairing. It didn’t have too much of an advantage when I was repairing the sharpness enchantment, as I had long learned how to bypass it. </p><p>Instead, I had pulled a broken weapon from the pile Eleanor had provided for me to experiment with, one with a simple durability enchantment. I wasn’t able to repair those before, because the enchantment was shaped more like a web, making it difficult for me to work on the metal without breaking the enchantment. </p><p>Now, with my ability to nudge the enchantment to the side without destroying it, I was actually able to repair it. It was a slow process, taking almost an hour of my time before I could even reach halfway. Theoretically, mana blow might have been usable, but with each blow requiring at least one point of mana, it was not something I could test. </p><p>I quit there, because I had nudged too hard, and the enchantment had destabilized. </p><p>However, that was not exactly bad news. A small mana cloud appeared as I destroyed the enchantment. It was less than what had been revealed by destroying the ingot, but with my improved Meditation, it was just enough for me to capture it. </p><p>[+1 Mana] </p><p>“That’s a nice surprise,” I muttered, my smile growing. The broken weapons that were here for my experiments were not as valuable as the bronze ingots, meaning I didn’t have to choose between improving Repair, Forge, and Meditation. It was good news. </p><p>“Now, to the not-so-good one,” I said as I prepared myself to repeat the same reversal trick. I needed to see if my newest perk would help me reduce the pain somewhat. However, this time, I first went to my bedroom. </p><p>I didn’t want to be caught by a visitor. I closed my eyes, focusing on the flow of the mana, reversing the rotation of the orb as I pushed the mana out. The pain hit, but it was far less than I had expected. </p><p>[Meditation (Common) - 11 -&gt; 13]</p><p>[-85 Health]</p><p>“Success through self-mutilation. My psychologist would have had a field day with it.”For a moment, I wondered if he was still alive, but that was just a momentary thought. Thinking if the friends from before the Cataclysm were alive or not was a quick road to ruin. </p><p>Especially for someone like me, who had the misfortune to experience the disaster while traveling for a conference on the East Coast, and was caught halfway, surviving only because I chose to drive rather than fly … away from everyone I had ever known, lost in a town in the middle of nowhere. </p><p>“Focus,” I muttered even as I went downstairs once more, picked some more broken weapons, and started destroying their enchantments for extra mana, only to push said mana out of my body. </p><p>Every repeat damaged my body somewhat, but I ignored the potential risks. It was not my usual careful attitude … but what had following my careful attitude for three years given me? A pile of rejections while I eked out a pathetic living, barely able to afford a room that I could keep my books in. </p><p>No, some risk was inevitable. </p><p>With that in mind, I repeated the same trick. As meditation reached twenty, I was required to exude three points of mana to increase Meditation once, but considering the damage it created had already dropped to single digits, it had become an acceptable tradeoff. </p><p>By midday, I had reached the point I had been searching for. </p><p>[Meditation (Common) - 24 -&gt; 25]</p><p>[Perk Options — Efficient Absorption / Contained Flow / Enhanced Sensing] </p><p>“Oh, a difficult choice,” I muttered as I examined the benefits. Contained Flow was clearly the next step of Controlled Flow, and taking it was tempting. But, in the end, I chose Enhanced Sensing. </p><p>The moment I did so, my ability to read the mana patterns had increased. I could see some surface-level details on the enchantments … which were naturally incomprehensible, like trying to understand how a computer worked by opening the casing. </p><p>Still, it was better than looking from the outside. </p><p>I broke another enchantment, and confirmed the same thing was true for the mana cloud. Rather than seeing a featureless fog, I found myself looking at … a fog with slightly more discernible features. </p><p>Well, it was still only a Perk to a common skill. </p><p>The same was true for the absorption. I could see that, as the ephemeral sphere rotated, the mana patterns turned slightly more discernible. And, that allowed me to reverse the rotation smoothly. Three more attempts, and I had succeeded once more. </p><p>“No pain,” I said happily. Finally, I was able to repeat that trick without hurting myself. </p><p>Of course, now that I had cleared the next threshold, the improvement of the skill would slow down noticeably. I doubted that I could get it to reach thirty even if I destroyed every weapon and material I had in here, including the forge. </p><p>An acceptable loss, as being able to improve a mana skill in a location with no environmental mana had already been pushing it. I just needed to return to the town, and meditate in my room safely to increase it even further. </p><p>Honestly, a part of me was telling me to quit and go back to town, maybe even migrate to one of the cities with a better environment, preferably with a System Shop. But, one thing prevented me. </p><p>I didn’t know if I would be able to actually use the System Shop. Every city had certain rules when it came to using those shops, as not everything was sold without limit. Eleanor had already revealed that the bronze mana ingots had a certain quota every day. </p><p>No, even if it slowed down the improvement of my newest skill, the opportunity to push my two production skills higher was too valuable. Not to mention, quitting suddenly would anger my new bosses, which was not exactly smart. </p><p>I could always change my mind once I had taught the other blacksmiths how to repair the weapons. </p><p>With that, I returned downstairs, forging another dagger to test the benefits of Meditation and my newest perk. “Beautiful,” I muttered. </p><p>Having meditation didn’t change the way I forged the weapon based on the skill, which was not surprising. It was clear that the autopilot of the System was working with far better detection than what it allowed me to access. </p><p>Technically, it meant that Mana Forge drew no benefit from increasing Meditation. It looked like the only reason that I received that skill was to gather mana, and trust Mana Forge and Mana Repair to use it. </p><p>Not exactly a rare event. The origin and the objective of the System were a mystery, but the working principles were not. It clearly expected every user to follow its guidance to rapidly improve. It had certain benefits to it, as I had experienced with my external combat skills. </p><p>Of course, there was the skill upgrade aspect, a great reward for overcoming those limitations, which made the subject a little murkier. </p><p>“Either way, it doesn’t make my new perk any less valuable,” I said to myself as I continued forging. Meditation might not benefit Forging directly, but my newest perk allowed me to observe the process even better. </p><p>Especially when I stopped occasionally to use Inspect, which gave me a completely new set of information. With multiple methods of observation in place, I was able to watch the process of the skill more carefully, learning more and more. </p><p>And, observation was the cornerstone of science. It was the seventeenth century when humanity discovered the existence of bacteria, and it wasn’t because we suddenly became more intelligent. No, we simply invented the microscope, revealing the existence of a whole new world. </p><p>From there, many mysteries had been solved one by one. That had been true for X-ray, radar, and heat sensors … every time our observation methods increased, the developments followed. </p><p>No, I didn’t care if increasing meditation didn’t suddenly enhance my Forging abilities. It made me learn and discover faster, which was all I needed. All I needed was to work with full focus and discover more and more secrets. </p><p>However, when the door opened, I immediately interrupted my work, even smashing the dagger hard enough to ruin my work. I guessed it was not Eleanor, as she didn’t bother keeping the sound down. Meanwhile, servants opened the door carefully, trying not to disturb me. </p><p>Unfortunately, inadvertently, they still ruined it. I immediately threw the dagger into the fire, letting it melt completely. Instead I pulled another sword, acting like I had been repairing them. </p><p>I didn’t want others to realize just how much of my time I spent experimenting on unrelated subjects. I expected another servant to walk forward … instead, it was a mana cloud. </p><p>A nasty surprise. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 22</p><p>I was glad that I chose to fake repairing a sword, as it meant that I could cede control to the skill while I observed the approaching mana cloud … one with a roughly humanoid shape. Considering they had to open the door to enter, it was less likely to be a spell. </p><p>What was more likely was that they were someone under an invisibility spell. Someone that was most likely holding a weapon, considering the mana cloud on the right was a foot longer than the one on the left. From a purely technical perspective, I didn’t know if the intruder was an enemy. </p><p>After all, there might be a perfectly reasonable explanation for someone sneaking into my forge while I was busy, holding what was most likely a dagger. </p><p>I spent a second glancing toward him, and was barely able to catch some kind of outline. The mana fog didn’t cover it despite overlapping, because despite the way my mind interpreted it, it wasn’t exactly a visual object. </p><p>Once I caught that outline, the figure of a bearded man became visible, like it was one of those pictures with a visual illusion. Some kind of camouflage spell that I would have never caught without Essence helping me. </p><p>And, even with Essence, I would have missed it if the camp hadn’t been in a mana-dead location. The fog of mana that clung to him was weak enough to mix with the background, had the background not been clean. </p><p>I barely held back a gulp as I started going through my options. There were only two. I could raise an alarm and hope that the reinforcements would arrive faster than he could kill me, or wait for five seconds, and deliver the first blow. </p><p>The first option, I might have chosen if it wasn’t for one fact: Hammer of Might was a style that was designed for overwhelming offense. Good at fighting against monsters, but not as good at fighting against another man who might be stronger than me. </p><p>No, I had no choice but to go with the second option. That was where my advantage lay. He was walking directly toward me, with no attempt to stick close to the walls or otherwise avoid me. Clearly, he had no fear of being detected. Not a bad assumption, considering only a chain of flukes allowed me to detect him in the first place. </p><p>He was walking slowly, whether it was the limitation of the spell he used or his arrogance, I didn’t know, but either way, it meant I would have the chance to deliver one free blow. One that was too valuable to pass. </p><p>Even as my mind churned those options, my body was moving under the control of my skill, maintaining the illusion that everything was going well. The only exception was my heartbeat, getting faster and faster as I realized that I had to kill. </p><p>Again. </p><p>One of the worst things about the post-Cataclysm world was that murder had turned far more acceptable. I had to kill twice, both against muggers thinking to make a quick buck over my corpse … before the discovery of the repair spell ruined my business and I was one of the richer people of the town. Both times, I hated the feeling. </p><p>But, I didn’t hate it enough to let someone assassinate me. </p><p>My hammer repeatedly landed on the surface of the sword as he closed in the distance. He was one step away from me when I flicked my wrist and threw the sword toward him. It was a very effective distraction, as the sword was hot enough to glow red. </p><p>Even with the System, it was nearly impossible to avoid a point-blank attack, particularly if the target didn’t expect it. He still made a valiant effort to lean to the side sharply, his movement ruining the spell protecting him. </p><p>I didn’t even wait until I used my work hammer to attack him. Unbalanced, he wasn’t able to dodge, and the attack landed on his head. </p><p>And, killed him before he could even make a sound, unlike his head, which shattered loudly. I shivered even as he collapsed to the floor. </p><p>Health cured a lot of things, but a destroyed head was not one of them. I started shivering even as I looked at the door, waiting for the guards to arrive, but they did not. I breathed hard, trying to process the fact that I had just killed someone else. </p><p>I hated the feeling. </p><p>A minute passed, and the trembling of my hands subsided. Still, there were no guards. For a moment, my mind went in a conspiratorial direction, wondering if the guards had been a part of the issue. Then, a simpler possibility occurred. </p><p>They probably ignored the sound. The forge already had good noise isolation, and the constant sound of crashing was easy to ignore. </p><p>I was about to shout when I finally paid attention to the bearded man’s outfit. It had the sigil of a griffin, like the ones the guards had been wearing before Thomas took all of them away. Worse, it was more complicated than what the guards had, and similar to what Eleanor had been wearing. Not exactly the same, but both included enough silver. </p><p>That couldn’t be good news, I realized even as I changed my clothes before walking to the door. One that I couldn’t handle alone. </p><p> When I opened the door, I found the assigned guards squatted in a corner, playing dice. </p><p>As much as I wanted to curse them for their lack of vigilance, I did not. If someone wanted to enter the forge while invisible, they would, and their lack of vigilance only made them more confident. “Yes, sir,” the guard said, looking panicked. </p><p>“There’s a small issue with the forge. Please go and get Eleanor. Tell her that it’s very urgent.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” the guard said. I nodded. “Your funeral,” he said, then looked at me. “It’s not about … this, right?” he asked, looking at the dice game they were playing. His partner looked equally scared. </p><p>“I don’t know what you are talking about,” I said with a wink. They looked relaxed. </p><p>I returned, the ordinary discussion calming me down somewhat. I didn’t touch the crime scene but tried to come up with a story to tell. The general events had no problem. Ultimately, I didn’t need to explain why I killed someone who had snuck up on me invisibly. </p><p>But, I couldn’t tell her that I had noticed the mana. </p><p>“The steam,” I muttered. It was a good excuse, one that could explain the timing. Quenching a sword created a thick cloud, and claiming that it was a lucky shot came from panic was enough. It just changed the facts slightly, turning into an accident rather than an intentional choice. I actually let some of the steam appear, in case she would be careful enough to check that. </p><p>I doubted it, as Eleanor wasn’t that attentive, but it was better safe than sorry. After it saved my life, I was even less reluctant to reveal my ability to use mana. </p><p>I waited in the corridor, ready to block anyone but Eleanor. Luckily, at this point, she trusted me enough to arrive herself. She looked harried and exhausted. “I don’t know how you heard it already, but yes, there won’t be any new ingots for a while. You have to stop experimenting for a while.” </p><p>At any other time, that statement would have earned a bigger reaction. “It’s not that, and we’ll talk about it later. Follow me,” I said as I walked to the main forge. She saw the body and tensed. The sharp aura was back. </p><p>“Explain,” she ordered. </p><p>“It was an accident,” I started. </p><p>“An accident?” she asked. “How? And, why was the steward here talking with you when he was supposed to be gone already?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” I said. “He was invisible when he entered.” </p><p>Her eyes widened, showing that she understood the implication. “Traitor,” she growled. It was a scary word, even when her gaze was firmly on the corpse as she said that. It was scarier when she started looking at me. “Invisible, or camouflaged.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I have no idea. I just noticed some kind of weird movement in the steam when I quenched the sword and slammed down my hammer. The aim was … an accident.” </p><p>She looked at me for a moment, before she walked to the corpse, and started to examine the body. “A nice blow,” she said, which was not exactly what I was expecting for killing a member of their house, but I was glad to take it. A tasteless compliment was much better than being turned into a scapegoat. </p><p>Her compliment showed that she had accepted my version of the story. I was glad that I didn’t touch the body, which made my version much more credible. </p><p>“Don’t tell anyone what has happened!” she warned as she crouched down, and started to go through his belongings. </p><p>“Of course,” I replied. At this point, it was clear that the success of the dungeon operation was linked to some kind of internal political battle, the kind that made assassination and bribery the first tools to be used. </p><p>I wasn’t necessarily happy that I was a part of it, but the moment I killed him, I had become too involved. Now, even if I managed to convince Eleanor to terminate my contract — which was not a given — I couldn’t get away. Not after killing one of their members. </p><p>For better or worse, I was a part of the conflict. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 23</p><p>Finding myself mixed in a conflict I had no idea about was not a pleasant feeling, but it was far from the worst case. I certainly didn’t expect to end up as a primary assassination target as the sole blacksmith. </p><p>However, the flip side of the problem was equally interesting. Since their conflict was bigger than I had expected, it meant that they would be willing to accept some demands that might otherwise be assumed to be excessive. The more problems I solved, the more I could ask for. </p><p>Assuming, of course, I didn’t reveal my upgraded skills. That particular secret was still too volatile to reveal. </p><p>Since I had decided to show off, I decided to focus on the biggest problem while she continued to examine his pockets. “Would I be wrong assuming that he’s somehow behind our most recent supply problem?” I asked. </p><p>“Supply problem?” she asked, surprised. </p><p>“The bronze ingots. You mentioned it when you arrived before I showed you the body,” I said. </p><p>“Ah, right,” she said, then paused. “Yes, that’s correct. He was here to refuse our latest request. Apparently, there had been some problems with the System Shop.” </p><p>“What kind of problems?” </p><p>“We have purchased the swords and the bronze from the same System Store. It’s in the middle of nowhere, and it’s currently defended by four families. Our Griffin family is one of the five families that have shares in that System Store, which meant we could purchase some of the limited stocks every week. But, the traitor here informed us that there was a dispute about the shares, so the next delivery will be delayed.”</p><p>“Supposedly,” I said. </p><p>“Right,” she said. “Since he proved to be a traitor, that might have been a lie,” she said, looking relaxed. “Maybe there’s no problem. I just need to fly and check. It’ll barely take a few days.” </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, then passed. “Or, there’s actually a problem, and he’s deliberately underselling the importance of it to prevent you from seeking an alternative solution until it’s too late.” </p><p>I wasn’t entirely honest in saying that. If the problem was as serious, he wouldn’t have tried to assassinate me. From their perspective, I was just a blacksmith that could work a little faster. I would have been useless without bronze. </p><p>Not a nice thing to do, but it wasn’t the first time I fibbed some of the details to get a bigger grant. </p><p>Still, thanks to a lack of remote communication, it would take a few days to check the situation, and meanwhile, I could use that as an opportunity to push for some new experiments. It wouldn’t be with that particular bronze alloy, but it was a sacrifice I was willing to make. </p><p>“You’re right,” she said, looking tense. “We have enough stock to keep us going for a few weeks, but if we are delayed, we will have to stop just as the dungeon starts operating. I need to fly there myself.” </p><p>“Maybe that’s not a good idea,” I said, happy to delay things a bit more. “You’re the strongest person in the camp. What if something happens in your absence.” She looked thoughtful. “And, wouldn’t it be better if you kept the fact that you’re suspicious of him a secret? I don’t know exactly what you are dealing with, but I’m sure it’ll be helpful.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” she said. “He died in our camp while trying to assassinate someone.” </p><p>“Did he?” I asked. “Or, did he leave the camp and disappear?” </p><p>“What do you mean?” she repeated. </p><p>“You mentioned that he had already left. Did you watch him leave, or did you just assume?” </p><p>“I watched him leave on a griffin an hour ago,” she replied, then paused. “I see. Since he had already left, and he returned under invisibility, we don’t have to explain anything. We have dozens of guards who would swear that he had left safely. Wilderness can be dangerous, even for someone at level sixty-seven.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but tremble when she mentioned that number. “That high?” </p><p>“Yes. He bragged about it a lot during our meeting. You were really lucky.” </p><p>I gulped. I was lucky indeed. If I didn’t follow Maria to that leveling trip, I would have been dead. A good reason to get even stronger. “It makes sense. I’m sure Rosie will be happy to confirm the situation at that shop for a price. She’s good at finding out stuff like that,” I said. </p><p>There was no harm in sending some work for a nominal ally, especially since I needed her goodwill. I had a lot of questions to ask her during our next meeting. </p><p>“A good point,” she said. “Still, it doesn’t solve the main problem. If there’s a problem with the supply, we’ll be in trouble.” </p><p>“What if we can find an alternative to bronze swords,” I asked. </p><p>“No. We tried everything. That’s the cheapest alternative we can purchase that doesn’t just melt completely. Anything weaker, and the weapons get destroyed completely. And, anything that’s too strong to resist the effect completely is not enough to make it economically feasible. We calculated them ourselves.” </p><p>“That’s probably true, but that’s not what I was talking about,” I replied. “What if we forge something ourselves?” I said. “I’m sure there’s a mine nearby, and even if there’s not, there’s too many ways to buy ordinary metal. And, we have a dungeon next to us, providing us with a lot of excess material. As long as we use them to forge weapons, we don’t have to deal with a long and dangerous supply chain.” </p><p>“We already thought of that. The dungeon has no material that can be used to make any alloys, let alone one that could resist the corrosion of those damned monsters,” she countered. </p><p>“No, that’s not correct,” I said. She looked confused. “There’s no material with a recipe that’s already included in the skill,” I corrected. “We can experiment and see if there’s an alternative,” I said. </p><p>“Would that work?” </p><p>“Maybe,” I replied. </p><p>“What do you mean, maybe?” she said. </p><p>“It’s an experiment. I can’t guarantee you results, certainly not in such a short time,” I said. Admittedly, I was more interested in the opportunity to experiment endlessly in the next five days than the possibility of success. “But, either way, it’s not a big investment. Some ordinary metal, and a lot of material that you get from the dungeon. And, it’s not like I’m too busy,” I said. </p><p>“Makes sense,” she said. </p><p>I paused for a moment as inspiration hit. The opportunity was actually greater than I had first realized. “Actually, there’s something else we can do,” I said, hoping that she would buy the idea. </p><p>“What?” </p><p>“Well, it’s clear that your opponent wants to prevent Maria from succeeding in her mission. It’s inevitable that they’ll have some spies, and they might do something more excessive if we make any progress. And, we still need a better story for the death of our traitor.” </p><p>“He died in the wilderness. It’s good enough.” </p><p>“As an official one. But, the one that sent him here knows better … unless, of course, there’s a better explanation.” </p><p>“Spill.” </p><p>“We frame it like I have died, and during the process, the forge somehow exploded, burning the building. You can say that there was a second unidentified corpse. Meanwhile, we bring the forge to a basement that people can’t access, where I work alone, hidden from anyone but you,” I said. “That way, you won’t have to dedicate a team trying to save me from assassins.” </p><p>“And, you would be alright living in a basement without getting to go outside?” </p><p>“It wouldn’t be the first time I locked myself in a dark room trying to solve a problem,” I said. “And, there’s a lot of people that walk around wearing helmets. I can always disguise myself as another newly hired guard. A beard and some hair dye should solve everything.”</p><p>She looked at me with a frown. “You come up with that plan quickly,” she said. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk, my mood was admittedly too good for someone who had been just assassinated. But, the idea of a private lab where I can actually experiment to my heart’s content was a good tradeoff. Still, I wasn’t above using guilt to push the limits of science. “There’s something about being assassinated by invisible people that really inspires me,” I snarked. </p><p>“Good point,” she admitted guiltily. After all, the defense of the camp was her responsibility. If I was found dead with no assassin around, it would be a big black mark against her. Not to mention, without my teaching, there was no guarantee the other blacksmiths could discover the repair trick in a reasonable timeline.</p><p>In both ways, I had saved her ass. </p><p>She pulled a ring from the dead man’s finger and threw it to me. “Put this on, and don’t make any sudden movements,” she said. A little morbid, but I still put that on. A weird, fuzzy sensation covered me even as my skin started to show what was behind me. </p><p>An interesting effect. </p><p>I walked a little, careful not to make any sudden move. “Good, now follow me,” she said. I did so, staying behind her to not run into anything or anyone. We stayed near the walls, and soon, we were at the center building, which functioned both as a headquarters and a residence for the two. </p><p>Interesting choice, but considering it was the most defended building, it made sense. </p><p>I pulled the ring from my finger and put it in my pocket. It was a beautiful survival tool for emergencies. Eleanor said nothing, too distracted by the next steps to care about an item with limited effectiveness under most circumstances. </p><p>For me, it might be the difference between life and death. </p><p>“You’re familiar enough with the building,” she said, clearly unhappy about the fact. “Go to the basement and pick a room that we can fit a forge into. I’ll return in an hour.”</p><p>As I walked toward the basement, I couldn’t help but think that she was right. I was too chipper for a man who had just survived an assassination attempt. </p><p>But, the payoff made it worth it. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 24</p><p>“And, that’s the last piece,” she said as she placed the forge. Thanks to its nature, it had been easy to carry, though how she excused its extraction from the forge building, I didn’t know … or care. All I needed was to connect the fire to the building chimney, and that would be enough. </p><p>“I’ll start working immediately,” I said, looking at the pile of dungeon materials. A lot of crystals, and some herbs, but the most attention-grabbing thing was the pieces of a large shell. “Is this from the dungeon creature?” I said. </p><p>“Yes. That’s the most common enemy. Some kind of distorted bug with a few weak points, that releases some kind of acid spell when dying. It destroys the weapons.” </p><p>“And, I’m guessing using hammers is not an option.” </p><p>“No,” she replied. “If the shell is broken, the System Store doesn’t take the purchase,” she said. </p><p>“Do you mind if I quickly check something,” I said. She nodded, and I touched the object. Thanks to the meditation, I could feel that the shells contained quite a bit of mana in them. </p><p>“Good,” I said, smiling as I examined it. </p><p>“What do you mean, good?” she asked. </p><p>“It's good material. High tensile strength, probably stress resistant as well,” I said. “Promising for experimentation.” </p><p>That was patently not true. I was excited because I could use those shells to practice my skills. I didn’t feel guilty or felt like I was really cheating them. I could always pay them back by reducing the repair time even further. To their knowledge, it was still around eight minutes. </p><p>“Don’t expect to have a lot of them,” she said. “They are the greatest income source of the dungeon. The System store purchases them without a limit.” </p><p>“For how much?” I asked. </p><p>“Twenty silver coins for now,” she said. My eyes widened. That was good money. “Hopefully, it won’t drop too much once the number of shells increases.” </p><p>“The shops do that?” I asked. </p><p>“Sometimes,” she replied. “They can be difficult to predict. Sometimes, the price drop is permanent, and sometimes it just fluctuates.” </p><p>“Do you mind if I try something?” I said, curious how the mana would react. I broke a corner, only for a small plume of mana to burst out. However, the pieces still maintained their mana content, That was good news. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>“I have to break them for my experiments,” I said. “So, you don’t have to bring me the intact ones. Just bring me the damaged ones. The more, the better.” </p><p>“Do you really need that many samples?” she asked. </p><p>“Edison had run more than ten thousand tests before inventing the lightbulb,” I replied. It was a gross misrepresentation of the real process, but fibbing the history of technology wasn’t the worst thing I had done today. </p><p>“Alright, the broken shells should still be near the dungeon. I’ll make sure to arrange their delivery. Same with the metals.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, not bothering to hide my happiness. Once she disappeared at the end of the stairs, I was alone in the basement. My smile was even bigger as I destroyed a small corner of the shell. Its mana content was far denser … but I noticed something interesting. </p><p>The mana from the monsters was a little cloudy. I only noticed that while meditating. Absorbing took almost four times longer, the meditation skill separating some kind of chaff from it. I had no doubt that it would be very inconvenient for a mage, who’d spend a lot of mana fighting. </p><p>For me, it was a benefit, as that cloudy effect made the mana stick together longer. When I destroyed a bronze ingot, I was barely able to absorb a tenth. With the shell, I was able to absorb more than half before it dispersed. </p><p>[+1 Mana]</p><p>Excellent efficiency. “Maybe I’ll be able to improve the process even further,” I muttered. However, as tempting as it was to start playing around, I decided to delay it until the broken pieces had arrived. I needed to look like I was working. </p><p>A tidy workspace was a good first step … a good step that had paid off in an unexpected way. A familiar surge from Mana Forge skill gave me a recipe for a new alloy, which used two of the crystals, the shell, and one of the herbs to be mixed in for some reason. </p><p>It also required a lot of mana for every ingot, which meant it couldn’t be done in the dead zone efficiently. </p><p>“What an interesting coincidence,” I muttered. Along with the recipe, came a lot of information. Information that included some kind of anti-corrosion property. It would have helped the profitability of the dungeon immensely. </p><p>Too bad I had no plans of revealing my mana forging to them as it touched my secrets. </p><p>“But, that doesn’t mean I can’t try to replicate a weaker version of the effect,” I replied. After all, they didn’t need a perfect solution, just a workable one. If I could come up with an alloy that didn’t require mana, the other blacksmiths could replicate it easily. </p><p>It shouldn’t be impossible. The System didn’t include any such recipe, but it didn’t matter. It was just like repairing the edge. The System didn’t include any direction that couldn’t be defined as perfect. </p><p>But, even an imperfect copy wouldn’t be easy. I would probably need to start with creating a few ingots to understand the nature of the alloy, not just its final properties, but also the in-between steps. </p><p> Then, I need to turn that into a dagger and test it on the dungeon beasts, as well as the other weapons to understand exactly how the corrosion effect impacts the metal, and see if that could be achieved without mana. </p><p>Which would be followed by hundreds of attempts as I tried to come up with a stable alloy that didn’t shatter immediately and resisted corrosion. </p><p>Still, I was hopeful, mostly because I didn’t need anything that was close to usable in any other context. It can be brittle enough to shatter after a dozen blows, which would have been unacceptable for any other condition. </p><p>But, not here. As long as they could kill four to five beasts without shattering the weapon, it would be profitable. </p><p>“Excellent,” I muttered even as I continued to tidy the workshop. The best thing, even if their bronze supply was not cut, it would make sense for them to continue funding my experiments. The money I would consume would be nothing compared to their potential benefit. </p><p> Even better, once I found a method, I could release multiple versions of the same metal, slightly improving its performance every time. </p><p>That trick had been good enough for the academic papers. It would be good enough for this as well. </p><p>“If all goes well, I should be able to make enough money to get a position in the research institute.” </p><p>Bribery was not something I wanted to resort to, but it was better than the alternative. However, I didn’t want to hurry up. My previous failure had taught me a good lesson about the importance of emergency funds.</p><p>As much as it rankled me to delay my return to the scientific community, I had learned my lesson. “And, it doesn’t mean I have to delay my research. I can always pay Rosie to collect some data for me, and focus on exploring the System in the process.” </p><p>I smiled happily as I got the fire going while I systematically destroyed half of the shell, carefully absorbing the mana that was let out. </p><p>[Mana 14/160]</p><p>For anyone else, that was not a notable amount of mana. For me, it represented my first opportunity to forge a mana alloy. Not even a full ingot, but barely a piece as big as my thumb. </p><p>It was a copper alloy, which was a happy occasion. Copper was one of the easiest metals to process, which was why it had been the first metal humans had used en masse. </p><p>Of course, it was also soft and brittle enough to incentivize the first primitive attempts at metallurgy, forcing the ancient people to actually experiment until they discovered bronze, which fueled our first real civilization, an ancient bronze civilization that sprawled across the Mediterranean sea, with the first global web of trade between Egypt, Hittite, Greece, as well as other European and Asian civilizations, all to ensure a steady supply of tin and copper. </p><p>Unfortunately, once international trade collapsed, so did those civilizations… The Bronze Age collapse was one of my favorite periods to study as I tried to map the impact of a similar collapse on our civilization. </p><p>Three years after the Cataclysm, I was ready to acknowledge the irony… </p><p>“Less pondering, more working,” I spoke to myself even as I started working on forging a copper mana alloy, following the suggestions from the skill as I melted the copper. The process had been relatively simple. The recipe included two different crystals, both finely ground, one herb, and a coarsely ground shell of the dungeon monster. </p><p>Mix the first crystal to molten copper, then burn the herb right underneath and let the crystal absorb the energy it radiated. Let it cool down to a red-hot state before starting to temper the metal and fold a few times, then start to add the coarsely ground monster shells while folding the metal, using the mana to keep the process stable and grow the crystals, keeping the metal merely red hot at the process. </p><p>The second crystal was to be mixed with the water, and used to quench the metal once the forging was complete. </p><p>A simple process that failed spectacularly, which was not a surprise. Not only did using the recipes from the system not always guarantee success — the level of the user, in particular, impacted the results quite a bit due to benefit from the stats, and skill level played an even bigger role — but also I wasn’t following the recipe completely. </p><p>The full recipe required me to make one standard-sized ingot, and I didn’t have the mana to do it. Adapting it to a smaller piece was not a trivial process, as it changed many important details, from the speed the metal cooled to the folding patterns. </p><p>But, that failure meant nothing as I started taking notes, incomprehensible to anyone but me. </p><p>I was already in love with my new working space. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 25</p><p>“You look tired,” was Eleanor’s first words when she visited me the next morning, pushing a huge cart that was taller than her with ease. It weighed at least three tons, but stats were useful for more than just fighting. </p><p>“I want to make sure I don’t disappoint you,” I said, which was once again not exactly the truth. However, keeping the supervisor unaware of the intricacies of the experiment budget was never a bad idea. </p><p>I was simply lost in the excitement of experimentation. The man from the solitary shell only allowed me to make two more attempts, and only with smaller pieces. Both had been abject failures, but they provided enough data for me to gather some clues. </p><p>I had enough of the first blue crystal and the herb to start experimenting. It wasn’t enough to even get close to success. For now, anything that managed to stabilize was roughly as strong as a sandcastle, but I wasn’t after the end result. </p><p>No, I needed to understand the process of crystallization and the shape of macrostructures. That was only the first step before I could start the real experimentation. Too bad I lacked the necessary background, and relied on a knowledge base that was cobbled together. </p><p>“Good. I hope they will be useful,” she said as she pulled the cover of the cart, and showed that it had not only contained all types of metals but also piles and piles of broken shells. “Would that be enough?” </p><p>“Not even close, but it will be good enough to start,” I said, not willing to turn down my only mana source. She looked surprised. “I can try to ration them, but using them excessively would allow me to process them faster. Since they are garbage, what’s the harm.” </p><p>She frowned. “Bringing them here might be suspicious,” she admitted. </p><p>“You’re the commander. I’m sure you can find a good reason,” I said, already touching them to test their mana content. A slight frown appeared on my face as I noticed some of them had much less mana than the others. The smaller they were, or the dirtier they looked, the more mana they had lost. </p><p>I realized why the System shop only bought the undamaged ones. The moment they shattered, they started to leak mana. </p><p>“Something wrong?” she asked. </p><p>“No, it’s just that the older ones look like they have decayed somewhat. The fresh ones would work better,” I replied. </p><p>“Should I not bother with the old ones?”</p><p>“No, the more, the better,” I said. “Maybe there’s some benefit to using decayed ones.” It might even be the truth. Using organic materials for alloy making was not exactly a topic that science had covered. Even if someone explored it, it was probably nothing more than a niche field. </p><p>How I wished I still had the internet. </p><p>Once she was done with the delivery, I expected her to leave, but I noticed that she was still waiting with a smirk on her face. “What’s going on?” I asked. </p><p>“I have another delivery,” she said as she threw me a backpack. I opened it, only for my eyes to widen. It was filled with papers. Mostly magazines, with several journals mixed in. I pulled out the first journal, flicking it with excitement that I had never shown before the Cataclysm. </p><p>Most scientific articles were boring, derivative articles that merely introduced a fraction of new knowledge while they pandered pointlessly, only minutely different from a hundred other articles I could find with a quick query. </p><p>But, with that option gone, every article represented the crystallization of human ingenuity, with ideas I could never come up with on my own. </p><p>I flipped the first article, reading the abstract out loud. “A two-dimensional mathematical model for a process of solidification of a binary alloy in the presence of an electric field as a free boundary problem.” </p><p>“So, useless?” Eleanor asked. I turned to look at her, and she flinched and took a step back. I took a deep breath, realizing that I might have got … a tad angry. “Not useless?” </p><p>“Of course not,” I said. </p><p>“But, there’s no electricity anymore. It doesn’t work with mana, even in the dead zones.” </p><p>What she had said was true. During the first year of the Cataclysm, there had been a lot of attempts to restart technology. Three main targets were steam, gunpowder, and electricity. </p><p>Among the three, electricity had been the one that had been abandoned first, for a very simple reason: Mana didn’t get along well with electricity. Once they mixed in, the results were unpredictable. Sometimes, it fizzled and melted, sometimes it exploded. I didn’t know if anyone properly completed those experiments in mana dead zones, but considering monsters let out mana when they died, I didn’t know how much it would have mattered. </p><p>The gunpowder and steam had been abandoned for simpler, logistical reasons. </p><p>Ironically, the reason gunpowder had been ignored was the reverse of the process it had led to its adaptation. During the fifteenth century, gunpowder weapons were less powerful and less accurate than the bow and arrow, yet it had been adapted because training an archer took years, it required immense strength, and making arrows was much slower than making small metal balls. </p><p>The exact opposite was true for our circumstances. With the System, a decent archer required mere days to turn into a marksman that could comfortably compete in the Olympics, the physical strength came from leveling up, and ammunition could be simply purchased from System shops, and reused for a long time. </p><p>That had been true the first few days, and it was even truer now. At this point, where people could heal from a lot of wounds, gunpowder weapons simply lacked the necessary stopping power. </p><p>The steam engine, on the other hand, could have been technically useful, but a simpler fact stopped it. While steam and fire weren’t as volatile as electricity when interacting with mana, it was still enough to make the idea of a steam engine made of ordinary metal useless. </p><p>The alloys that the blacksmiths could forge could be useful, but that meant a radical increase in cost. A steam engine had to be large to be useful, which meant at least five tons of metal. A ridiculous amount, considering a sword required less than four pounds, and the ingots the System sold were usually between one and two pounds. </p><p>A steam engine took enough metal to arm a whole town. Hardly an acceptable tradeoff, particularly since anyone with high strength could match the power of a steam engine. </p><p>It was for a reason our old technology had been abandoned, which I was more than alright with. It was how technology worked. </p><p>What truly rankled me was abandoning the process of science with it. </p><p>I took a deep breath, suppressing my desire to deliver a long explanation. “It doesn’t matter if electricity doesn’t work. We can’t use the process described in the articles in any case. They are not exactly manufacturing plans. I need them to give me ideas to try.” </p><p>“And, it’ll work?” </p><p>“It worked to drop the repair time to eight minutes,” I said, ignoring the temptation to inform her that I had already reduced it even more. No, that part could wait. I needed it in case my other experiments failed. “But, as I said, I can’t promise results, not until I can find a proper direction.” </p><p>She looked unconvinced, but after a while, she shrugged. “You’re, the expert, professor,” she said before turning and walking away. </p><p>I could see that she was trying to annoy me by tackling that last part, but I didn’t care. I was more interested in going through all the books. Not all of them were about material sciences, but related topics. Mechanics, control systems, thermodynamics… None of them were particularly useful for a blacksmith, but I was still happy about their presence. </p><p>More information was not something I would turn my nose to. Just because they weren’t immediately needed didn’t make them useless. </p><p>My first real disappointment was about the condition of the material. Not all books were intact. Some of them were half-burned, while the others were missing pages, moldy, or dirty enough to make reading a chore. </p><p>It was clear that whoever had them treated them as garbage. “What a disappointing loss,” I muttered even as I carefully went through every book and journal, categorizing the information they contained. </p><p>Once that was done, I started reading the first article, a summary of the performance of two different industrial casting processes of aluminum with regard to their final tensile strength.</p><p>The actual conclusion part of the article was useless. First, I didn’t work with aluminum, and even if I did, I was hardly at a point of caring which of the two methods would be more useful, when both processes were optimized to create several tons of metal for every batch, for plants that probably created a thousand tons each day. </p><p>The sense of scale between our old and new world was worlds apart. </p><p>I read it carefully, because the article went quite a bit in detail about the merits of various types of water cooling, and, in the process, went into a lot of detail on how hydrogen bubbles could damage the integrity of the metal, and how a certain combination of iron salts could be used as a solution. The process was roughly similar to the impact of the second crystal. </p><p>By comparing the information provided in the article with what was provided by the System, my mind was churning a lot of new ideas. </p><p>Before even finishing the article, I had six experimental setups I wanted to try, and that was merely the first article.</p><p>“We’re going to have a lot of fun,” I said as I looked at the rest of the books. Mathematical sociology might be my one true love … but sometimes, there was no harm in straying. </p><p>Not when I could feel another revolutionary development ahead of me. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“ … Try again. The concept behind the spear needs to be as merciless as a volcano exploding, yet as unpredictable as a snowflake dancing in the midst of a blizzard —” I shouted as I deflected the spear with a casual palm strike. </p><p>I was planning to continue longer, but I had received a message from my formation. Janassa had just submitted her updated recipe for the Foundation Establishment pill. </p><p>I had been initially planning to practice with them more, but letting Janassa advance to Foundation Establishment was considerably more important than practicing with them for another day. Especially since, after a week of continuous reinforcement, the spiritual pillar had finally recovered enough that I didn’t have to observe every time they shared some of their essence with it. </p><p>Especially since I managed to keep the concept of the spiritual pillar and their essence closely aligned. </p><p>It was already paying off. Earlier, their essence was as weak as an empty essence when it came to practice, and after a week of steady effort, it was several times stronger. Of course, that improvement meant that it was still weaker than Everdawn, let alone the other essences that were reinforced by Dao, but I could see the improvement, which was the important part. </p><p>“It’s enough sparring,” I called even as I pulled a lever, and a second glass platform rose, one that held the secrets of the breakthrough for the Blood Essence realm. “Your essence is finally solid enough to allow you to break through. Continue practicing what we have learned and study the breakthrough method, but don’t try to test it before I return,” I warned them. </p><p>I didn’t fear them ignoring my words. Not only did they treat my word as gospel, but even if one of them ignored it, I had formations in place to detect and interrupt it. I didn’t want them to attempt it without me to assist it. </p><p>The reason for it was simple. While the Burning Blizzard technique explained the process of breakthrough in great detail, that process of breakthrough was reliant on the strength of the essence. Without me to assist with my alchemy, it was impossible to complete the breakthrough as is. </p><p>There were three ways to solve it. One was to let them repeat the current status quo for years — maybe decades — as they slowly repaired the Symbol with their weak feedback. It was the simplest method, requiring no intervention, but I simply lacked time to wait for it. </p><p>The second was to find tens of thousands of martial artists and raise them to Connate Realm to increase the feedback process, which was the method that the conspiracy seemed to mainly embrace, though they were probably aiming to use millions. </p><p>I didn’t want to use that method, because it risked corrupting the spiritual pillar. I had put a lot of effort into making sure the hundred I had hired maintained a cohesive perception of Burning Blizzard essence, and scaling it before the Symbol recovered somewhat was not reasonable. </p><p>As a result, I chose to embrace the third method, the forced breakthrough, using alchemy to resolve the side effects. However, I suspected that the conspiracy also wanted to use a forced breakthrough method to support the second path, which explained why they were so excited when I joined them under a false identity. </p><p>While they studied the technique of the breakthrough, I ignored my desire to start studying the spiritual pillar in detail — still afraid of damaging it — and instead went back to Markas. A quick change later, I wasn’t the old and lofty apothecary that could raise an army of Connate Realm martial artists alone, but the poor, unlucky servant trapped in the mystical realm, about to make another pot of tea.</p><p>But, not before a pitstop, where I kept my five prisoners. Four of them were studying various techniques, though I noticed that they preferred techniques like artifact refining and alchemy over others. </p><p>A reasonable choice, and considering my need for assistance on those topics as well, I saw no reason to change it. After all, it was just a proof of concept. As long as it didn’t trigger a great disaster, I was willing to expand it. </p><p>Maybe even without the prison aspect. </p><p>I didn’t spend much time with them. Instead, my focus was on the fifth cultivator, which was being an opaque screen. He had managed to break through to Foundation Establishment using the pill, and he was currently in the process of recovering from the internal wounds it created. </p><p>I activated the recording I had taken, finally observing the process of the breakthrough. It was, for the lack of a better word, violent. </p><p>The Foundation Establishment pill had two functions. The first, and the relatively pedestrian function, was to protect the dantian, which was the first target of the transformation, as the breakthrough was rather violent. </p><p>The second, and more important part, was to activate the Immortal Root. Admittedly, that activation was more like creating a spark against a pile of paper that was ready to burn. The rest was handled by the Immortal Root, working almost independently of the cultivator. </p><p>My formation skills were ultimately at Qi Gathering Realm, which meant there were things it couldn’t detect, like Providence. But, knowing what to look for, I was certain that providence somehow played a role in the process. </p><p>Ultimately, the Immortal Root had transformed and turned into a part of the dantian. Its transformed form was able to metabolize Qi far faster, saving the cultivators from the limitation of their immortal root, which increases their effective Qi output several times. </p><p>The recording had been interesting, but ultimately, I wasn’t able to learn much. Whatever that was going on with the Immortal Root was a mystery. Still, what I saw was enough for me to have the confidence to save Janassa in case of a problem, I counted that as a victory. </p><p>Once that was done, I went to see Janassa, brewing a pot of tea before I walked toward her. “You look chipper, mistress.”</p><p>“How many times do I have to tell you, to call me Janassa,” she corrected. </p><p>“I’m sorry, m — Janassa,” I corrected as I approached her, placing down the tea along with the rewards she had requested. “What’s the recipe?” I asked. </p><p>“My last task. The recipe of the Foundation Establishment Pill.” </p><p>I made a show of looking shocked. “How? I thought the great sects don’t allow anyone else to learn it.” </p><p>She shrugged. “I don’t know much about the great sects. It’s not something small cultivators like us could wonder,” she said. </p><p>Even with all my practice acting, I wasn’t able to keep my smile. The true source of her ‘nameless’ alchemy technique made that statement deeply ironic. Too bad I couldn’t tease her about it. “Too bad I don’t know it,” I sighed. “It would have helped greatly once I get out.” Then I passed dramatically, reflecting my ‘pain’. “If I get out.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, you will,” she consoled. “Come here. I’ll teach you,” she said and started explaining the technique. And, once the class came to an end, my System notification popped free. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Pity Bonus - 70 (Capped)]</p><p>[130x Return - Foundation Establishment Pill Recipe - Earth Medium-Grade]</p><p>The reward surprised me, as I didn’t expect to get a reward at Earth grade, but the system must have rated the incomplete recipe higher than I expected. I left Janassa alone and activated it, my mind once again filling with many combinations. </p><p>And, with an Earth Grade recipe in hand, refining the Foundation Establishment pill hadn’t been particularly difficult. Not with my talent. Once I finished, I was looking at a dozen pills, the weakest at Black Low Grade, and the best was Black Peak Grade. </p><p>I tried a few times, but despite having several advanced recipes, I wasn’t able to breach it, the low material quality holding me back. </p><p>I had several ideas to collect high-quality materials, but that wasn’t as easy. And, not to mention, Janassa didn’t actually need a better one. Ultimately, as I had seen before, the Foundation Establishment pill was merely there to assist, while the Immortal Root did most of the work. </p><p>Janassa was too capable for it to hold her back. </p><p>I could have done so, but I decided to test my alchemy knowledge, and actually tried to come up with two new pill recipes based on the foundation establishment pill, separating two effects. One was to protect the gates and recover damaged cultivation, while the other was there to hasten the cultivation process. </p><p>Both, I passed to Janassa, and another quick study session gave me two new rewards. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Pity Bonus - 70 (Capped)]</p><p>[130x Return - Dustless Renewal Pill Recipe - Yellow Peak-Grade]</p><p>[130x Return - Radiant Rainbow Pill Recipe - Yellow Peak-Grade]</p><p>I activated the recipe, and realized Radiant Rainbow Pill was designed to enhance the cultivation of Foundation Establishment cultivators by hastening the growth of their transformed Immortal Root, while Dustless Renewal helped to recover from internal cultivation injuries. </p><p>I refined several of them, before adding all three for Janassa to purchase through the inventory interface for reasonably low merit points, giving her the courage to attempt a breakthrough without risking herself too much. </p><p>With that, everything was ready for Janassa’s breakthrough. I once again stepped on my flying boat and flew away. </p><p>The rest was up to her. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>As I asked for a volunteer, several hands rose, and I picked one that looked the calmest among them. “Walk forward,” I said even as I invited her right in front of the spiritual pillar. I was as tense as them, as I had a feeling that, a mistake here might have disastrous consequences. </p><p>As she stood in front of the pillar, I raised my hand, activating the formation to hide us from the view. I didn’t want any of them to start copying what we were doing. </p><p>“I’m ready, sir,” she said. </p><p>“Good,” I replied as I waved my hand, and the acupuncture needles spread over her body. Even then, I walked to her and stood at her back, ready to use my massage talent together with alchemy to make sure her essence circulated correctly. </p><p>More importantly, I wanted to make sure the conception of the burning ice stayed exactly the same as the spiritual pillar. I couldn’t risk it drifting away to turn into yet another martial arts that was blocked by the mysterious mist. </p><p>“Now, I want you to focus on the conception, and ignore everything else. Only after you’re fully focused, I want you to throw the first punch, and do it perfectly,” I ordered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said as she closed her eyes. I knew she followed my order, as even she focused, I could feel her flickering essence moving. Ironically, it reminded me of a small spark of fire, trying to survive in the wind. Even with all her talent, it would have been extinguished without my help. </p><p>I was glad that I was using Qi and not essence to support it. If I tried to use essence, it would have tainted the conception. Qi acted like an insulated wrapping, keeping the essence alive without tainting it. </p><p>As she threw the first punch, her body started feeding the essence of her vitality. The flow had been intense. If the vitality of her body hadn’t been maintained even after I destroyed their martial arts, it would have been enough to drain her completely. </p><p>“M-my talent,” she gasped, unable to understand what was going on. It even broke her focus on the conception. </p><p>Luckily, I was there to protect the core of the essence and prevent it from being corrupted. </p><p>“I know, I remodeled and enhanced it,” I said. I hadn’t mentioned it, because I knew no warning would prepare for the great change. Her current talent was not too much below mine when I first arrived and took the System Enhanced pill. </p><p>That pill was Earth Grade, and while her current pill was only Black Peak Grade, the assistance of the alchemy pushed it closer to effectiveness. And, back then, I was able to break into the martial arts by merely throwing a few punches, which nearly starved me. </p><p>“Now, eat this, and wait,” I said as I passed her an essence pill. Without martial cultivation, it would have killed her if left alone, but she still swallowed it without hesitation. </p><p>I once again used Qi to help her digest the energy and absorb it gently. What was supposed to be a deadly threat was nothing compared to my alchemy talent. I said nothing until she absorbed the energy completely. “Now, punch once again, but don’t let your focus drift away,” I said. </p><p>She punched, and I controlled the flow of the energy. Her new essence slowly channeled through the hint of essence she had received from the spiritual pillar, threatening to drown the small flicker without my intervention. </p><p>That one punch let her grow her essence greatly, and immediately reach the peak of the Muscle Reinforcement stage. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I fed her another pill, and repeated the process. Another punch, and she was at the Skin Refinement. One pill, and three more punches, and she reached the peak of the Bone Forging. Another punch, and she was at the peak of the Connate realm, all her gates activated and linked to her meridians, allowing her to freely control her essence however she wished. </p><p>“I-it’s …” she gasped. </p><p>“Much weaker than you expected, right,” I said. “Don’t worry, it’s just a beginning. That’s the nature of the ancient martial arts. We need to maintain the purity of the essence, and not the power. That will arrive later.” </p><p>“Yes sir,” she said. </p><p>It was the time for the next step. “Now, bleed on the symbol again,” I ordered. She followed it, but I once again controlled the amount of essence she let out. The connection had been established, but this time, it was her essence that had been taken by the symbol. </p><p>I wasn’t experimenting blindly. The manual I had received also described the way to repair the spiritual pillar if damaged. Of course, the amount of damage they expected was much lesser, forcing me to go into a lot of trouble just to make sure I didn’t shatter the symbol while trying to repair it. </p><p>Once again, it was like trying to feed a weak flame. </p><p>It was a tiny bit, and even then, it was a challenge for the weakened symbol to absorb. It did, but only because of the purity of the feedback. Even then, I could feel the symbol straining.</p><p>Then, I met with a very interesting surprise. As the symbol absorbed the essence, it also consumed some Qi from the air. It was a tiny amount, one that I would have missed without formations giving me absolute control of the area. </p><p>It surprised me, because the technique I had received mentioned had no mention of Qi absorption. I wondered if it was a deliberate misdirection or something they weren’t aware of. After all, I wouldn’t have noticed without my unique circumstances. </p><p>But then, learning new things was why I experimented, and this discovery wasn’t enough to make me stop it. </p><p>“Good, now, go back and start reading the technique again. No practicing without my order. But, don’t hide your cultivation.” </p><p>With that, I raised my hand, and the screen had fallen. The rest shuffled when the volunteer returned, her martial cultivation of Connate realm enough to shock them. They were practiced enough to recognize the signs, but even for a genius apothecary, that was too much. They would assume that the spiritual pillar played a big role, so it was important. </p><p>They still didn’t know my identity as a Qi Cultivator. </p><p>“Now, the second volunteer,” I said. I repeated the earlier process, but this time, I didn’t block the view. And, with the existence of a mortal rising to Connate Realm in less than five minutes, she wasn’t shocked by the extent of her remodeled talent. </p><p>I repeated the process for every single one of them, making sure that they had maintained the stability and purity of their conception even as they focused on generating the Burning Blizzard essence. And, I fed the spiritual pillar with their essence, each time it took just the tiniest bit of Qi from the environment in the process. </p><p>I didn’t dare to peer into the structure of the spiritual pillar, afraid of dispersing it with my probing. </p><p>“Congratulations on your first, tiny step to the great path of ancient martial arts,” I shouted. “Connate Realm is nothing but a speck in the form of true martial arts. Soon, you’ll be entering the Blood Essence realm, able to fight even the immortals in equal footing. However, before that step, you have to enhance and reinforce the Burning Blizzard essence. It’s going to be hard work, but in the end, you’ll have the strength to follow your Queen to the land of immortals!” </p><p>“Now, go back and read the technique again,” I ordered. As much as I wanted them to start practicing, I knew from experience that martial learning didn’t only rely on talent but cultivation. More importantly, the effect was almost like a multiplicative effect, which was why the organizations valued talent even if they had the resources to easily create an army of Connate Realm martial artists. </p><p>Once they read the technique several times, I ordered them to gather together, and guided them. I didn’t practice the technique myself, as I wasn’t ready to take the risks. Currently, the Burning Blizzard essence supported by the drawing was too weak for it to matter. </p><p>I preferred to watch and see if there was any side effects before I committed to it one way or another. </p><p>However, the experiment was important enough that I decided to stay here for the foreseeable future, making sure that the conception of the essence stayed true to the representation of the giant drawing. My time was split between correcting their moves. Well, the conception behind their moves, as the physical aspect of their moves was pretty much perfect. </p><p>And, occasionally, I controlled as they slowly fed the symbol with their martial essence, triggering its recovery. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel excited as I watched them. </p><p>The experiment was going well. I could already feel that my own martial arts wasn’t too far away. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Here are the volunteers, sir,” one of the hidden guards said to me as I stood in one of the hidden training rooms under the palace, looking at a hundred young women, each in the Skin Refinement Realm. </p><p>I was once again dressed as my apothecary identity, so their reverent gaze was understandable. </p><p>“Are you sure you want to volunteer,” I asked. “This is your last chance to refuse the opportunity. If you accept, you’ll be living in isolation for a long time, and there are chances that you won’t see civilization for years, waiting for the opportunity to save the kingdom.” </p><p>“We are ready to serve our Queen,” they declared, their devotion incredible. I wasn’t too surprised by their devotion, as they had not only been hopeless commoners before they had been chosen as a part of the secret guard forces, which elevated their social status to an incredible degree, but they had also watched Aisnam take down a Foundation Establishment cultivator with their own eyes. </p><p>It was the kind of achievement that turned into stories generations later. </p><p>The young woman in front of me was the first time I had picked for the experiment. I found their devotion excessive, therefore their decision was suspect. </p><p>I didn’t feel guilty using that devotion, the experiment wasn’t as bleak as I led them to believe. Most likely, they had to live in isolation for merely months rather than years, and if everything went well, they would have the opportunity to reach the Blood Essence realm, attaining power enough to challenge Foundation Establishment cultivators. </p><p>Only to be defeated, even against the weak ones, but considering such a cultivator could kill hundreds of Connate Realm martial artists with ease, it was still an incredible improvement. </p><p>And, even if the martial arts were problematic, I had the ability to cleanse their bodies of the essence and start fresh. My alchemy level reached a degree that, as long as they were in a formation with a strong defense, I feared nothing. </p><p>“One last chance to pull back. You won’t be punished in any way,” I reminded them still. None of them chose that option. I looked at their captain. “You may leave,” I said. She nodded before following that order. </p><p>When she left, I triggered a formation, and they all fell unconscious at once. A little creepy, but I didn’t want them to realize they had even left the capital. I loaded all of them onto the flying boat and brought them to the misty mountains. </p><p>Particularly, to the mountain I discovered the Burning Blizzard Martial arts, which was a combat style that primarily relied on spears, with some kicks and punches mixed in. It gave me the sense that it was a foundational art. </p><p>It had been three days since I had discovered the mountain and the secrets behind it, and I had been busy in the process. Most of my time, I spent translating the martial arts manual. Luckily, unlike the letter written by that hack who thought himself a calligraphy genius, the rest of the manual had been written by a true expert, with enough intent lingering behind the words for me to translate. </p><p>Once that was complete, I created a few fake transactions and confirmed that it indeed didn’t register on the System. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the only thing I had done during those three days. I had also refined a hundred Martial Aptitude Pills. I couldn’t recycle them through the System since my plan was to feed them to my experimental subject, but with my abundant materials and improving alchemy skills, I was still able to maintain a consistent output. </p><p>With the assistance of a few formations and guidance from the Kartpa Alchemy Technique, I managed to forge a hundred Black Peak Grade martial aptitude pills, and it merely took half a day. </p><p>Mass production for the win. </p><p>That was not the only thing I had refined. I also refined a huge batch of essence pills to provide them with energy. However, I didn’t refine any other supporting pills, not before understanding the difference between ancient and modern martial arts more in detail. </p><p>The other thing I had done was to remodel the mountain completely. The cave, I had turned into a giant underground complex with no entry and exit, but with enough amenities to make their stay comfortable. </p><p>Comparatively, the remodeling outside took more time. I had turned the mountain into a giant garden, even going as far as transplanting a lot of spirit plants from Markas, providing enough Qi I could use for emergencies. </p><p>I took their security seriously. </p><p>Luckily, that abundance of Qi meant that I could easily use alchemy to remove hints of their old martial arts and remodel their talent. Then, I fed them the martial talent pill and used the medical knowledge that came with the alchemy to channel that efficiency perfectly. </p><p>Combined, their talent should reach an incredible degree. </p><p>Essentially, I was repeating what the conspiracy trying to do, but I was doing it far better. </p><p>Once everything was ready, I had brought them to the main training room, which I had deliberately made look like the earlier training room, giving them the impression that they hadn’t been transported, but just fell asleep. </p><p>There were three differences. The copy of the door they entered was just a piece of wall carved to look like a sealed door. There was a large glass platform that contained the translated version of Burning Blizzard martial art, but only to the peak of the Connate Realm, radiating the conception of a burning volcano wrapped in a blizzard. </p><p>Then, behind them, on the wall, there was the original spiritual pillar symbol. The essence conception it radiated was nothing compared to my writing, but it wasn’t why it was there. </p><p>No, it was here, because it was necessary to practice Burning Blizzard technique. </p><p>That had been the biggest difference between Everdawn Arts and the Burning Blizzard. Everdawn Arts just required the martial artists to devote themselves to the empire wholeheartedly, meanwhile, Burning Blizzard required them to periodically visit the spiritual pillar to establish a connection physically. </p><p>I didn’t know enough about the ancient martial arts to reliably deduce whether it was about the quality of the martial arts, the difference of nature between the empire and the sects, or something else. I could only blindly guess. </p><p>Hence the reason for experimentation. </p><p>The trainees all woke up, looking shocked. “My martial arts,” a few of them gasped. I even saw a few of them preparing to practice in panic. </p><p>“Stop, and don’t practice,” I warned them. “I have erased your martial arts to enable you to practice the true power of the ancient martial arts, which had been lost in the great disaster. First, cut your hand and bleed over the spiritual pillar, then start reading the technique. Don’t practice before my order.” </p><p>They looked hesitant, but they still followed my order. I had carefully examined them as they did so, formations giving me every detail about their bodies. The moment their blood touched the drawing, the drawing weakened even further. </p><p>At the same time, a small essence flickered in their dantian, one that would have gone unnoticed if it wasn’t for my own martial talent enhanced by a Heaven Grade pill, making me extremely sensitive to even the weakest flicker of essence. </p><p>Technically, with that, they had reached the Initiate stage, but only theoretically. Practically, that essence meant nothing. </p><p>Seeing the softness of the energy, I was sure that whatever plan they had for this base, would have failed if anyone other than me had discovered the secret compartment. It was clear that the spiritual pillar had weakened by the passage of time, and only a cheater like me could revitalize it. </p><p>However, even as I watched, I was glad that I had chosen the first batch of experiment targets from the royal guards, who already worshiped my apothecary identity. As the old wise man who had created hundreds of Connate Ream martial artists in a few months, my prestige was second to Aisnam. </p><p>That earned me enough respect that they followed my orders even if I destroyed their martial cultivation. </p><p>I let them read the text several times, making sure that their understanding of the unique essence deepened. If it wasn’t for their remodeled talent, we would have required months before they could even understand the complicated essence. After all, the conspiracy had been working for longer than a month, and despite the fact that Everdawn Essence was far stronger than the ice and fire essence, they were yet to reach the Blood Essence realm. </p><p>But, they didn’t have an expert of my ability to guide them. I still waited until they finished reading the text multiple times. I even asked them to recite certain portions with their eyes closed, testing if they memorized every detail perfectly. </p><p>Admittedly, the memorization part wasn’t as critical. I just needed them to focus every word with their full attention and let the calligraphy do the rest. </p><p>However, soon, it was time to act. “I need a volunteer,” I called, ready to raise my first expert in ancient martial arts… </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>As I walked through the third floor of the dungeon, I felt even more enthusiastic. I wasn’t able to see Eleanor in the morning, but thankfully, she hadn’t forgotten to drop the maps of the first three floors. </p><p>She even marked the doors to the fourth floor — with a note warning me to stay away for my safety — which meant I didn’t need to search the entirety of the huge area. And, that area was truly huge. Almost thirty miles in radius. Combined with the limited visibility, it would have been torture to search through it. </p><p>I truly needed it. After realizing that my plans of setting a forge on the fourth floor were more infeasible than I had realized, I decided to move my small forge to a new spot. And what better location than the gate that was farthest from any entrance. </p><p>Having a real map made moving easy, and I was strong enough to pull everything — including the large crucible — with me easily. This time, knowing I had to move, I brought it with me. </p><p>I didn’t need to leave the cart on the first floor after taking over the gate protection and maintenance. And, having the cart with me, I didn’t need to waste the material from the beasts I killed, piling the broken shells into it. </p><p>When I arrived at my destination, I picked a hilltop a mile away from the gate leading to the fourth floor. After some effort to set everything at the forge, I started digging a small pool not too far away from the gate, and covered its bottom with anti-corrosive metal. It was a thin layer, but it should be enough to maintain it. </p><p>Then, I forged two large buckets, but I didn’t bring them with me. </p><p>Instead, I changed into my combat set, took the spear and hammer with me, and jumped through the gate. After experiencing the sudden onslaught at the other gate, I was prepared for the challenge. However, being prepared didn’t make the challenge easier, particularly since I had been doing my best to rip the broken shells. </p><p>I needed a lot of material for my setup to improve Nurture. </p><p>Since I wasn’t trying to push through the monsters, I filled my oversized buckets before going back, carrying some of the stuff. Several trips later, I had enough water to swim in if I wished, which meant I could experiment as I wished. </p><p>I filled one of the buckets with the best fertilizer with the least poison I was able to come up with, and brought it near the forge. Behind the hill where I set up my forge, there was a small deep valley. One that was perfect for growing an experimental orchard. </p><p>“Let’s try it,” I said as I set twenty cuttings from half-dead shrubberies, and fed the first one with a drop before flooding them with enough Health to satisfy the requirement of the skill. </p><p>[-22 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 34 -&gt; 35] </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, happy to see a response from the System. I was even happier to see that the sapling had grown considerably, sprouting almost two inches. Not exactly a great amount, but considering it only took a smidgen of health and a drop of poison-fertilizer, the growth was incredible nevertheless. </p><p>While using dungeon water allowed the dungeon plants to grow outside, the actual growth was next to negligible compared to what I had achieved inside the dungeon.</p><p>I repeated the process even as I grabbed one of the vitality-dense bars I had brought along — this time with enough presence of mind to leave them on the third floor — to replenish my Health slowly, once again amused that a Blacksmith could increase the skill level faster. </p><p>[-410 Health] </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 34 -&gt; 49] </p><p>Still, whenever I repeated it, I focused on the sensation of Health leaving my body, doing my best to get familiar with it. I had already been planning to learn how to use Health directly, to see if I could push Repair and Forge higher by using just silver — as finding a sufficient amount of gold to forge weapons seemed to be a challenge — and Eleanor’s attack had only intensified that desire. </p><p>It was a dangerous world, and having an extra weapon was always welcome.</p><p>After several rounds, my Nurture had stabilized in the mid-fifties. Which would have been an easy pattern. </p><p>Instead, I returned and mixed another fertilizer, this time both the poison and fertilized effect stronger. However, for this batch, I also mixed the purest fertilizer I could manage. After playing around, I realized the best way was to use a stronger poison effect. </p><p>While, at the same time, giving the plant enough material to trigger its growth. </p><p>“It can’t be that easy,” I muttered as I replicated the same process with a sapling I had brought from outside for this exact purpose. It … died. </p><p>Terribly. </p><p>“Not a surprise. It doesn’t have any inherent resistance,” I muttered. “Maybe if it’s stronger,” I said. I used some water from outside I had brought for this exact purpose and carefully enhanced its growth. Soon, I was looking at a sapling that was two feet tall and looked far healthier than the others. </p><p>It cost me almost ten minutes, and three hundred Health. And, it didn’t even increase my skill. </p><p>Then, I used the cleanest dungeon fertilizer I had discovered. One drop had been enough to make it wilt helplessly. I tried to reverse it, which cost me even more. </p><p>[-219 Health]</p><p>To make it even more annoying, there was no skill improvement. </p><p>“Alright, it’s clear that the dungeon plant has some kind of resistance to the poison aspect,” I determined. The mechanics were no doubt interesting, but I didn’t have the equivalent of Repair to properly analyze it.</p><p>“It looks like the theme of the day is pointless repetition,” I said even as I increased the number of saplings. Soon, I was feeding them with stronger and stronger fertilizer first, pushing them to a certain size before I poisoned them. </p><p>My Nurture skills climbed higher and higher. Then, noon arrived. I had depleted the small pool I had created, but it was not for nothing. I had reached my glorious point of success. </p><p>“Beautiful, “ I said even as I looked at my small, unambitious tree plantation. None of the trees were taller than my height, and they were the ugliest little things I had ever seen with crooked branches and thin, listless leaves. </p><p>But, it represented two things. One, unlimited fuel for my forge. </p><p>Two, another beautiful experiment. </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) - 72] </p><p>“Let’s see if you’ll be able to survive the poison,” I said even as I used the shovel to carefully uproot it from its place while I stuffed my mouth with some extra food. Then, I brought the tree next to the gate. </p><p>I left the tree behind as I went down, killing the monsters around the gate — their presence wasn’t as intense, but I still had to kill several giant monsters. Then, I broke their shells into a mixture of small and big pieces and picked a small spot near the gate that wasn’t submerged in water. </p><p>The wet mulch wasn’t too difficult to dig.</p><p>Then, I returned to the third floor and brought the small, ugly tree I had brought with me. The moment it arrived, it started to wilt. </p><p>I immediately put my hand on its surface, pushing as much as Health as I could manage in short bursts. </p><p>[-42 Health] </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 72 -&gt; 74]</p><p>Unfortunately, despite that, the tree started to wilt rather than grow. I repeated the attempt multiple times, each attempt slowing down its demise to some extent. But, ultimately, it ended up as a dead, dried tree, and my current health was insufficient to resolve the issue.</p><p>However, while it was a sad loss, there was a great benefit to it as well. </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 99 -&gt; 100]</p><p>[Perk Options — Growth / Harvest] </p><p>“Excellent,” I muttered even as I went back to the third floor, once again going back and forth until I had refilled the pool. Not only that, but I had also added a hundred more saplings to my little tree plantation. </p><p>With the skill already at its peak, I was able to grow those saplings far more efficiently, both in terms of Health required and time. Raising a small orchard didn’t even take enough time to reach midday. </p><p>Now, it’s time for another forging experiment,” I said. I cut ten of the trees and used them to create a nice cozy fire, capable of easily melting and cleansing the limited silver I had. </p><p>This time, I tried to engage Nurture to push Health directly to the molten metal, followed by slowly feeding mana. It worked enough to hold the material. Unfortunately, suddenly, it was my speed of releasing mana that was a problem.</p><p>“Luckily, it’s not a big problem,” I said as I looked at the large pile of broken shells, each representing an incredible amount of mana I could directly use in the form of a mana blow. Especially since the new trees had been able to burn brightly enough to release the mana from the shells completely. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I said as I rapidly started to forge the smallest silver daggers I could manage, using the poisonous dungeon water to quench them, and then destroying them just as quickly. </p><p>Now that I wasn’t trying to ration the mana I was able to use, the skill started to rise rapidly once again. </p><p>When it was past midday, I was looking for a beautiful new text. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 99 - 100 ]</p><p>[Perk Options — Modify / Masterwork / Rapid Forging / Mana Control (Mana Manipulation) / Durable] </p><p>If there was a further variant of Creative Forging, it would have been a tough choice. Without it, Mana Control was the clear option. Maybe, with that, I might break the limit on my sword skills. </p><p>However, as much as I wanted to try that, improving Repair was more important. So, I forged the strongest, most mana-dense silver dagger I could manage before systematically destroying and repairing it until the skill reached its limit. </p><p>I didn’t even have to think before I chose to improve Advanced Inspect, as it was still my single most important Perk. </p><p>[Mana Repair (Rare) - 104 [Observe] </p><p>Mana Forge (Rare) - 102 [Creative Forging, Mana Control]]</p><p>“Beautiful,” I celebrated, ignoring the temptation to tinker with them even more. With the materials in hand, I had already reached the limit. For the next stage, I needed gold, probably in bulk, and likely even more mana than I could get from the broken shells of giant monsters. </p><p>So, as much as I wanted to play with them more, I decided that it was time to fight some more. </p><p>However, not before I completely reforged everything. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“What are you doing?” Eleanor asked the moment she entered the forge, her gaze immediately locking on the device in my hand. </p><p>“I’m trying to find a way to get the shells off the beasts faster,” I said. </p><p>The moment I said that her interest faded. “Already trying to make your guild more profitable,” she said, but I could sense a hint of disdain in her tone. I didn’t exactly blame her. Hunters were production classes just like Blacksmiths, but, unlike us, they had a reason to actually be outside. </p><p>That meant that finding Hunters above level twenties was far easier than finding high level Blacksmiths, which meant they didn’t need to deal with the same problem. And, unlike Warriors, they would be more than happy to work in a low-risk, low-pay dungeon. In a world where skills could increase by killing monsters rather than working for years, the value of labor was not much. </p><p>And, more importantly, unlike Blacksmiths, Hunters would be arranged by the guilds, meaning it was not her problem. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I said. “It’s just a good way to test the elasticity of the metal while I work on trying to discover something that can resist the corrosion. It helps me focus,” I said even as I pointed at the various materials that were cluttered about, trying to convince her that I was focused on helping them. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she noticed the fresh sign of experimenting. I had used those to improve Nurture, but she didn’t need to know that. “How was your first proper day as a guild master? Anyone suspicious?” </p><p>“No. The story about an old friend deciding to set up a new guild works well enough. Altogether, very believable. The weapon change especially helped. No one should suspect a genius swordsman to be a blacksmith.” </p><p>“Genius? Someone’s feeling arrogant. Come, we need to solve it.” </p><p>I chuckled as I followed her. Her desire to have another spar was transparent. I wasn’t complaining. Not only did I want to impress her, but also watching her fight was interesting. I might always learn something from her. </p><p>I still couldn’t figure out how to use a mana attack with my sword. It would have been very helpful. </p><p>This time, she brought me to a sparring room, and threw me a wooden sword and shield. She just grabbed a sword. “It’s going to be painful, isn’t it?” I asked. With a real, enchanted blade, she had to hold back. With a wooden sword, she didn’t have to. </p><p>“I don’t know what you mean,” she replied. </p><p>“Well, no pain, no gain,” I said as I positioned myself, focusing on the technique. While being beaten painfully was not my ideal midnight activity, I wasn’t exactly complaining either. Sparring with her would be a good way to figure out a few new tricks. </p><p>At least, it wasn’t as ghoulish as constantly cutting myself to bleed on metal, which had been the method I used to push Mana Forge and Repair. </p><p>“Attack first. I want to see just how much you have improved,” she said. I attacked, not bothering to hold back the slightest. After all, for that reason, I hadn’t pushed my Stalwart Guard to the sixties. Her eyes widened as she took a note of my improvement, which was the only sign of distress. Her blade still easily blocked everything without even taking a step. </p><p>It felt intentional, so I started to rely on my shield more than it would have been reasonable in another situation. “Fine,” she growled as she took a step back, then lunged forward. </p><p>Her sword lashed, but I managed to avoid it … barely, and only by somehow mixing the Fleeting Step into the mix. It allowed me to avoid her attack. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 58 -&gt; 59]</p><p>It was a fascinating feeling. It felt like something clicked for a second, before disappearing. And, it was equally clear that the System had acknowledged it. It was very difficult to improve skills through sheer practice, especially after pushing them higher. </p><p>Her eyes widened once more. “That’s not a part of the Stalwart Guard,” she said. </p><p>“I guess not. It was just a stroke of inspiration,” I replied. “I tried to copy the way you moved, and it … worked. </p><p>“You truly have talent. Too bad you’re not a warrior,” she said. “Still, once you reach level fifty, I’ll gift you a Rare skill.” </p><p>“Is this what’s needed to use Rare skills?” I asked. </p><p>“Indirectly,” she said, and I looked at her. “Unlike uncommon ones, where you just need to have the Stat in question, rare skills have higher Stat requirements. Not all of them are the same, but the ones that are worth using usually require a hundred at their Primary stat. There are very few strength-based styles that would fit your style well.” </p><p>“That would be excellent,” I said as I nodded, more than happy with the prospect of a hard-to-get Rare skill that would fit well with my style. Especially since it would just replace the Stalwart Guard rather than occupying a new slot. </p><p>“One condition. I want you to bring the proficiency to at least eighty before you reach level fifty.” </p><p>“I think I can bring it to a hundred,” I replied, deliberately acting proud. After all, since the aim was to impress. </p><p>She just snorted, clearly not believing it. I didn’t blame her. If I hadn’t been abusing the way skills overlap, there was no chance that I could even get close to it. What followed was an hour of non-stop sparring that had been as intense as I had feared. I tried to mix Fleeting Step in as many times as I could manage. </p><p>It didn’t work as much as I wanted, but considering the impressed expression on her face, even that was exceptional. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 59 -&gt; 66]</p><p>“Actually, you might be right. You are learning even faster than I expected. You might reach a hundred, easily. Maybe I shouldn’t wait until you reach fifty.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked. </p><p>“When you push a skill at Common or above to its limit, it gives you a perk,” she said. “Usually, it’s not worth going through all that effort for an external skill, but there’s a benefit. When you have a Perk, it brings the requirements down for the next tier skill. That way, either you can get a Strength focused one early, or go with a different Rare skill.” </p><p>I made a show of looking surprised. “Then, wouldn’t it be better to learn the Common skill before upgrading it step by step?” </p><p>She chuckled. ‘Unfortunately, no. Upgrading a skill through a skill stone resets it,” she said. “The perk goes away.” </p><p>“Even for class skills?” I asked as it was not my experience. “Not that it’s really relevant for us poor Blacksmiths.” </p><p>“Yes, even for them,” she replied. Interesting, as in my experience, the Perks stayed. However, maybe there was a difference between making the skill evolve directly and using a skill stone. </p><p>Of course, even if that Perk disappeared, I wasn’t exactly willing to write it off as a loss. It still taught me a lot. </p><p>I decided to change the topic. “I’ll still try to bring it to a hundred. It teaches a lot,” I said. “Do you mind if I use the other floors to practice?” </p><p>“Go ahead, if you think you can handle it,” she said. </p><p>“Of course, I can,” I replied. “Actually, why don’t I clean the gates for you. I can easily deal with the giant ones. After all, I have a hammer to slowly break their legs.” </p><p>She frowned. “Are you sure? Ranged attacks can be troubling to deal with, especially with the corrosion effect.” </p><p>I smiled. “That’s easy. I just need to make a shield out of stone to defend myself against the ranged attacks. Then, I can just discard it and make a new one.” </p><p>“Still, it can be dangerous,” she muttered. “Try to defend against this,” she said as she took several steps back. I waited, expecting her to pick some stones or other ranged items. Instead, she had raised her sword. When she brought it down, some kind of energy cut through the air, targeting me. It was a thin, weak blade. </p><p>I raised my shield to block it. Before it even landed on my shield, she attacked again, this time moving slower. I defended myself to the best of my effort, doing my best to rely on dodging rather than blocking, which got even harder as she started moving around. </p><p>“Alright, you can defend yourself,” she cleared. “You just need to be careful if there are multiple giant insects on the third floor. It’s not likely, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.” </p><p>“Good point,” I replied. “Still, having stronger enemies should help me to raise my skill faster. And, once I do it, I can take over keeping the gates secure. I owe you one, and you’re too busy to waste a full day there.” </p><p>“You would do that?” she asked. </p><p>“Of course. As I said, I owe you,” I replied, acting like having access to lower floors wasn’t a treasure for me. “However, I’ll need the maps for the second and the third floor. I shouldn’t get lost.” </p><p>She nodded. “Easy. Now, let’s spar some more.”</p><p>“Before we start, may I ask what that attack was? Some kind of mana attack?” I asked, despite knowing it was not the case. I wasn’t able to feel any mana in her attack. Yet, it was somewhat familiar. </p><p>“No, it’s a special attack from a class skill,” she said. She didn’t mention the perk name of the skill name, clearly intending to keep it a secret. </p><p>“How does it maintain its shape without mana?” I asked. </p><p>“By using Vitality, of course,” she replied, which surprised me. I didn’t even think that such a thing was possible. </p><p>“Really?” I asked. “Do you mind if I examine how it works from a close range?” </p><p>“How?” she asked. </p><p>“I think I can use my Analyze skill to properly examine it,” I replied. I wasn’t faking my enthusiasm. While it was a big request since it potentially touched the secrets of her skills, the possibility of learning from it was more important. </p><p>“Alright, but never reveal anything about it to anyone else.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I stood next to her, and grabbed the hilt together with her, my fingers over hers to catch the movement of Vitality. She froze, and I noticed that her face was red. For someone of her level to be exhausted, she must have had a tiring day. “Go ahead,” I said. </p><p>“A-alright,” she stammered as she swung the sword. Meanwhile, I kept my eyes closed, using my best to stretch my Advanced Inspect to the limit to carefully examine the way the sword shifted. The way Vitality had been shaped inside the sword had been fascinating. </p><p>The best part, unlike the complicated patterns of mana, it was easy to understand … well, relatively. At least, I had a rough idea after she had repeated it a dozen times. </p><p>“I think that’s enough,” she pulled. “I … I have a long day tomorrow.” </p><p>“How about the spar?” I asked, but she was already walking away. </p><p>“I’ll just take a rain check,” she replied and walked away. </p><p>“Whenever you want,” I called, which was a completely genuine reaction. </p><p>Why shouldn’t I be, when that meeting had solved three serious problems at the same time. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>An hour after I had passed through the gate, after killing almost five hundred giant insect monsters, and even more smaller insects, I finally stopped pushing forward, and started to retreat. I might not be physically exhausted, but it was not true from a mental perspective. </p><p>But, being under constant siege by monsters had grown exhausting despite the relative tedium. </p><p>I wondered if it was an ordinary problem, or if it was what happened to a dungeon that had been left unattended for a long time — Eleanor explicitly mentioned that she wasn’t coming down to the fourth floor to cleanse. </p><p>However, the reason didn’t matter in the short term. Either way, it meant that I had to delay my plans to move my forge into the fourth floor. I might have to spend an even longer time than I had expected. </p><p>Still, even as I retreated back to the gate, I wasn’t feeling defeated. The incursion might have been exhausting, but it was also profitable. I was holding almost a dozen Rare skills, and even more Uncommon ones — unfortunately, all of them were either unusable for me or another copy of Nurture. </p><p>Then, there was the other, even more concrete benefit. </p><p>[Level 37 -&gt; 38]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>And, they were not the only discoveries. Some of the rocks I touched reacted to my Forge talent. They contained iron. It wasn’t dense enough to make it worth my while to collect it. Even the richest rock had an iron content of barely more than five percent, which meant that collecting and processing them would have taken a lot of time even if I wasn’t attacked by monsters every second.</p><p>The trick with the carts was far more efficient. Still, it was always pleasant to have an alternative path. Also, it was convenient enough that I didn’t need to go back to the forge or destroy a part of my weapon to forge a large bucket, bringing water and soil samples together. </p><p>The main objective was to test it for forging, to see whether it could be used for quenching the weapons I forged to cool down, freeing me from the need to use mana to compensate. But, that was not the only purpose I had in mind for it. </p><p>I wanted to test its effect on Nurture as well, which was why I didn’t scoop just water, but also the mulch from the bottom. Considering how the other materials worked, it was worth a try. </p><p>It was not a suggestion from my skill that led me to that decision, but my common sense. Well, that, and the memory of my considerable success, using silver and gold to push my Forge skill higher. There was no reason it wouldn’t work on Nurture. </p><p>It wasn’t the first experiment I did. I had already tried that with a half-dead cutting, but the constant corrosion effect had destroyed it before I could even start my experiment. Luckily, it didn’t affect flesh. </p><p>“Now, let’s try it,” I muttered even as I dug a small pit, and put a palm-full of mulch and water. Then, I followed up by putting another cutting, ready to fill it with Health through Nurture. </p><p>It failed. </p><p>“Alright. Even that’s too much,” I muttered. This time, I decided to reverse the direction slightly. I put another cutting into the ground and flooded it with Health until it started showing signs of growth. </p><p>[-182 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 5 -&gt; 6] </p><p>Once again, a wasteful burst, barely able to turn the cutting into a sapling. But that was the fate of experimenting. I reached into my pocket, ready to take a concentrated food pill … only to find they had been already destroyed by the corrosive attacks. “Alright, that was an oversight,” I muttered. I hadn’t expected it to work that way. </p><p>The leather pouch survived, but the signs of degradation were still obvious. </p><p>However, the map I created had been destroyed as well. </p><p>Luckily, my memory was still fresh, and I was confident I could go back without being touched, or I would have been in big, big trouble. </p><p>It looked like moving to the fourth floor wouldn’t have been as easy as I had expected. </p><p>However, without the ability to refresh my Health, I needed to stop my plans of pushing Nurture to its limit. “One last experiment,” I muttered even as I took a drop of water, and put it in the roots. The small sapling had immediately started wilting. </p><p>I put my hand to its surface. A flood of Health counteracted the corrosion. When it ended, the sapling was slightly taller. Not enough to be worth … in terms of growth. </p><p>[-133 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 6 -&gt; 9] </p><p>Increasing the skill was a far more valuable benefit. “A note, bring a lot of food to replenish health tomorrow,” I said, curious about how far I could push Nurture here, and whether it could grow a small woodland for me to actually benefit from it. </p><p>Also, it was finally nice to discover a trick to improve Nurture. Disseminating it alone would solve a lot of problems Farmers faced. I just needed to find a way to spread that without ending up being assassinated. </p><p>Or, one that would trigger a bloody labor dispute. Empowering workers and lower classes historically had been a bloody affair, and that was before the people with power had the ability to cut metal and summon lightning. </p><p>No, it required a lot of finesse. </p><p>“I know what I will be experimenting on tonight,” I said. I had turned the bucket into an anti-corrosion metal, but I made sure to cover it with a more ordinary alloy. </p><p>From outside, it looked like an ordinary water can, which meant, no one would pay attention to it. It was important. While bringing some water samples was not wrong, it would also reveal that I had gone deep enough to reach the fourth floor. </p><p>I still stopped by my forge and buried it with a layer of dirt to keep its presence a secret, and left my other set there, including my spear. However, while I did that, I still broke a thick stick of wood and roughly shaped it until the System started to treat it as a spear. </p><p>Fleeting Step would be useful for getting out of the dungeon. </p><p>Running full speed without slowing down, it didn’t take long for me to reach the gate to the first floor. Just to be on the safe side, I spent ten minutes hunting, collecting enough broken shells to fill the cart, enough not to be suspicious. </p><p>“It’s such a pity,” I muttered even as I examined the broken shells. I would have received more than twenty gold for them if they were not broken. However, I didn’t have the ability to remove them without causing damage. Even if I had, carefully removing it would have been too challenging. </p><p>“What if I create a small device for it,” I muttered, my mind already working on how to do it. The skill didn’t have any such plan, because it didn’t include any device with moving parts, but as long as I come up with a working design, it should be doable to make a hand-powered device, maybe one with a simple crank and multiple blades… </p><p> On the way back, I chatted with the guards. When I arrived back at my temporary residence, however, I didn’t start playing with it. While I had a general idea, I didn’t know how long it would take to create a working copy. </p><p>Or, even if I could. </p><p>As much as I was tempted, pushing Nurture to the next stage was a better idea. </p><p>I once again picked three pots, one with an herb from the dungeon, and two others. While I made the preparations, I ate a quick meal, which replenished my Health, even faster than I had been used to. Still, it took time. </p><p>The first result from the experiment, using the water from the fourth floor made the dungeon herb react. That alone was an interesting output, showing that it was possible to grow those plants outside the dungeon. </p><p>Whether it was worth the effort was a completely different thing. The empirical result was … underwhelming. Meanwhile, even a small drop of it had been enough to kill the other two plants, and Nurture was not enough to save them. </p><p>“Progress,” I said still. In the next step, I used some of the materials I had prepared for forging, mixing them with a drop of swamp water. I didn’t have to work hard or think, because my experiment methodology was essentially a rough version of my anti-corrosion material experiment. </p><p>Some of them, I even flooded with my mana to see if it helped. That, it didn’t. I continued to experiment. </p><p>Was it absurd to try and make a fertilizer almost the same way I tried to prepare an alloy? It certainly should have been … but an hour into the experiment, I was looking at an empty water bottle and a dozen herbs with various states of growth, which disagreed with the absurdity of my methodology. </p><p>What I had managed to make was more of a poison than a fertilizer. It was certainly not worth the effort from any productivity angle. </p><p>But, from a System enhancement angle, it was a completely different story. </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) - 34] </p><p>Amusingly, I had a feeling that what really improved the skill was not the growth aspect, but the poison aspect, while curing it pushed the skill higher. Unfortunately, the water I had brought with me was gone, preventing me from experimenting further. </p><p>I needed to return to the fourth floor for more material first. </p><p>Luckily, I had a lot of other things to do … including my first prototype of a shell removal machine. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>“And, stay down, ugly bastard,” I said even as I pushed my abomination of a spear through the skin of an even uglier giant insect monster, feeling excited and satisfied at the same time. </p><p>After all, I had just brought a skill from nothing to its limit in less than half an hour. </p><p>[Swift Spear (Uncommon) 98 -&gt; 100]</p><p>[Perk Options — Fleeting Step / Charge] </p><p>“I wonder if that’s a record,” I said even as I ripped the shell of the giant monster I had taken down, and started my trek back to the forge. Now that the skill had reached its limit, I could create a more fitting weapon than the ugly monstrosity I had created to abuse the mismatch. </p><p>Just like Hammer of Might required a proper heavy-headed hammer to show its benefits, Swift Spear required something tall and with a decent elasticity to properly show its power. </p><p>While I probably couldn’t create something that would show the full potential of the technique without high-grade wood — as there was a limit to the elasticity that could be shown by a pure metal handle — I should still be able to replicate it somewhat. </p><p>However, while I was on the way, I made sure to choose a perk option, one that didn’t require even the slightest thought. Fleeting Step. </p><p>After all, I had my Hammer of Might for situations that required power, and Stalwart Guard was excellent when I needed to defend myself. Meanwhile, Swift Spear, true to its name, focused more on mobility. It wasn’t exactly my strongest suit, but considering the effort it required, I was still more than happy to take it. </p><p>Fleeting Step transformed the skill somewhat, giving me an even better ability to dance between the attacks. But, even as I tested it, I could feel that, somewhat, it was my stats that weren't supporting it properly. </p><p>My guess was that my Dexterity had been barely enough to allow me to learn it. </p><p>“Not that I’m complaining,” I groaned as I charged among a small swarm, intentionally letting them surround me, yet dodging them with ease. Not even a splatter of a ranged attack landed on me. I could have dealt with them easily, but instead, I let them attack me, while I limited myself to deflecting their mandibles. </p><p>Just because I had a skill at its limit didn’t mean that I could use it well. </p><p>The skill was fascinating, especially with Fleeting Step mixed in. It allowed me to dance among the attacks from the monsters with the elegance of a dancer. It didn’t make me run faster at longer distances, but it actually helped me to climb the cliffs and other surfaces. </p><p>I couldn’t simply climb a ninety-degree surface, but anything with a rough surface was a fair deal. If a mountain goat could climb it, I had a fair chance. “Fascinating.” Of course, in a world where people could actually fly, it wasn’t as fascinating, but that was just the reality. </p><p>It meant I could actually ditch the swarms by using the natural impediments, which was a good thing. That way, I didn’t have to kill the monsters in the first two floors, which should keep the others from getting suspicious about the lack of monsters in a certain direction. </p><p>“And, that’s not the only benefit,” I muttered as I switched weapons, and started engaging with monsters using Stalwart Guard. I had already used my lessons from the hammer technique to improve it, and when it came to it, sword and spear had much more in common regarding the fundamentals. </p><p>Which was why, the progress I had made when I  had arrived back at to forge was only to be expected. More than enough to impress Eleanor. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) - 57]</p><p>The best part was that I hadn’t even pushed it to the limit. But, for once, I decided to slow down. I wanted it to look impressive, not unbelievable. </p><p>Once I forged myself a new, seven-foot-long spear, I decided to leave everything but my hammer in my forge. Searching the gate for the next floor while running as fast as I could manage seemed like a fitting task. </p><p>One particularly great advantage I had was my Strength, allowing me to break the shell just as easily without waiting for the beast to attack. It was even a better fit for hunting on the first floor without damaging the shell as long as corrosion wasn’t a concern. </p><p>But then, without the corrosion effect, a lot of things were easier. </p><p>As I faced my next challenge — four giant monsters in one horde — I was suddenly glad that I decided to add the spear to the mix. Hammer had the necessary power to take down the beast in one hit as long as I could hit a weak spot thanks to Shattering Blow, but reaching that weak spot had been the problem. </p><p>With Fleeting Step, I could simply climb on top of them, the corrosion effect uselessly crashing against my metal greaves. </p><p>Suddenly, the fights were less like a deadly struggle, and more like an action movie. Cheating was truly fun. Once I climbed to their back, all I needed was to switch to the hammer. One blow and the giant insects died. </p><p>Too bad piling four of them together still granted me with an Uncommon skill, one that I couldn’t even use. </p><p>I had been hoping for a Rare one. </p><p>“Maybe next time,” I muttered even as I continued my dedicated dash, not even slowing down to pick up the shells or the crystals. The only thing I slowed down for was to take note of the various geographical features to prevent myself from getting lost. </p><p>No, I just wanted to find the gate, and while the density of the giant monsters had given me a direction to search, it was not exactly a compass. And, the twenty-yard vision range wasn’t exactly making it easier.</p><p>The dungeon fog — which was not a real fog but a weird energy — was a mixed blessing. Its existence was an inconvenience to be sure, but only because it was there, I had dared to set up a hidden forge. </p><p>“Finally,” I shouted in celebration when I arrived at the gate I had been searching for. Around it, there were eight giant monsters, which had been not exactly inconvenient to deal with with the trick of combining two skills at their limits. </p><p>I was able to kill all of them in under one minute. Throwing them together had been the bigger challenge. </p><p>They were not exactly small. Even with my strength, I couldn’t casually pile them. </p><p>“It’s worth it,” I said when I found a skill that had been glowing in an unfamiliar pattern. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Rare)]</p><p>I examined the skill. It was rare, yet it didn’t have any kind of qualifier. I wondered if it was something that could happen for all skills. Was there an inferior version of Mana Forge that I could get from dungeons, or was it only something that was relevant for the Nurture skill… </p><p>Frankly, it wouldn't be the first way the System discriminated against the Farmer class. </p><p>I was tempted to absorb it, but I decided not to. It was tempting, but it was far from the most urgent task I had in mind. I put it in my sack before I turned toward the next challenge I wanted to face. </p><p>The gate. </p><p>“Unto the breach once more,” I said as I took a step forward, finally ready to face the next batch. It was a risky step, one that I would have been far more reticent to take without Swift Spear and Fleeting Step. But then again, it wasn’t the first time the dungeon offered a nice solution to the problem it presented. </p><p>As I landed, the first thing that caught my attention was the mist. Not just the dungeon energy we referred to as such, but a real one, enough to make the vision even more difficult. </p><p>That meant I had no idea how many monsters I had to deal with. But, I could already count six giant monsters mixed with a true swarm. </p><p>They charged. </p><p>I jumped. </p><p>Frankly, I didn’t know what I could call the following encounter. It was a baffling mixture of boring and exciting. My conscious mind treated it as a disaster, wave after wave of insects popping out of the mist to overwhelm me, like I was in a desperate last stand. </p><p>But also, it was boring. The only thing I really paid attention to was keeping track of the death of the first monster of the pile while they routinely disappeared because I had been using them as a platform to fight rather than letting the bog close around me. </p><p>But, their disappearance was not a waste. As, without exception, they all faded into Rare skill stones. Two of them were Nurture, which I recognized without touching. The others were a mystery. However, the endless wave of attack continued, preventing me from checking it. </p><p>The monsters continued to appear endlessly, showing me the reason why Eleanor regularly cleansed the first two floors. </p><p>It was truly endless. I fought and fought, the battle slowly turning into something as routine as forging another weapon. </p><p>I would have complained if it wasn’t for a very welcome notification. </p><p>[Level 36 -&gt; 37]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +2 Dexterity]</p>",

    "content": "<p>For the second trip, I didn’t destroy the cart completely. While it was a good way to get some extra iron, it would be suspicious if I brought back every single one with significant damage. </p><p>Instead, I spent some time reforging the parts. There were several thick metal bands, which I melted and reforged with a stone core. It was too much effort for something that could be purchased for three copper coins, but the opportunity cost was too critical. </p><p>Only after I was finished with the cart and arrived at the second floor, I actually absorbed my newest skill. My first real magical one. </p><p>[Fire Bolt (Basic) - 1]</p><p>Did I expect it to be useful in any kind of combat situation? Not particularly. Basic skills were basic for a reason. But, I was sure that it would be situationally useful during my smithing. The ability to reheat the metal locally, for example, could be really useful. </p><p>But, the real objective was to give me an idea of how to use mana. </p><p>I was tempted to start playing with it immediately, but I managed to hold myself back until I arrived at the third floor, afraid that someone would stumble upon me. Throwing fire bolts around was not exactly a good way of progressing. </p><p>Still, before trying it for the first time, I made sure to clean my surroundings. I didn’t want to be interrupted. With that, I looked at a rock thirty feet away, opened my hand, and triggered the skill. </p><p>The first time using a new skill was always weird, and it had been even more true for the fire bolt. The mana burst out of my hand, with an intensity I could have never imagined. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>I tensed even as I felt the mana take shape in my hand, rotating and transforming in a complicated pattern that I couldn’t begin to understand. I had already assumed that the mana blow was complicated. Watching my mana reshape under the control of the skill was nothing less than a true miracle. </p><p>A fire appeared from nothingness and collided against the rock with an eerie precision. </p><p>Well, at least, it was the perspective of my scientist side. </p><p>From a tactical perspective, it was just garbage. It took almost ten seconds for me to channel the spell. It consumed a truly ridiculous amount of mana, and for all of it, I had nothing to show but a projectile attack that moved slower than an ordinary arrow, which could easily be dodged. </p><p>I was glad that I hadn’t wasted a skill slot for Ice Blast the day before. </p><p>Of course, its tactical uselessness meant nothing. I could already imagine a dozen different ways I could use it for my experiments. But first, I needed to push it to the limit and see if I could glean any insights that I could apply to my sword attack. </p><p>My first instinct was to stop and see if I could modify the skill somewhat. With the perks from multiple skills allowing me to interact with mana, it felt like a worthwhile experiment to run. However, I still remembered how trying to do that with Meditation blew on my face. </p><p>“Maybe not now,” I muttered even as I searched for another monster. After a few quick takedowns followed by absorption, I was ready to cast again. A few more times, I targeted my skill at the rocks, but there had been no improvement. </p><p>Just like any other skill, it required a lot of repetition. Unfortunately, unlike other skills, every repeat required a lengthy pause as I refilled my mana. Luckily, it took less than five minutes to hunt the necessary monsters and absorb them. </p><p>Before the perks, filling my Mana reserves took closer to half an hour. </p><p>The next step was to target the monsters, but I wasn’t in a hurry to do that. I wasn’t able to even walk while trying to cast the spell, and ten seconds was too long to deal with the monsters. Instead, I stopped by my temporary forge, dropped the new batch of iron I had brought with me, and changed into the anti-corrosive set. </p><p>Even then, I didn’t attack a monster immediately, but searched for a specific opponent. </p><p>What I was looking for was one of the creatures with the ranged attack. I cleaned their immediate surroundings and used the shield to block their attack, which gave me the leisurely ten seconds I had required. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>[Fire Bolt (Basic) - 1 -&gt; 6]</p><p>“Wow, that’s a nice jump,” I muttered. Targeting stronger monsters always helped, not to mention improving basic skills was easier than their better variants. “Now, let’s see what changed.” </p><p>Another attempt, once again targeting a ranged monster. This time, the spell gathered faster, something like eight seconds, not to mention flew faster and burned brighter. A nice range of benefits, though mostly incremental. </p><p>A few more repeats and I soon reached the improvement limit. </p><p>[Fire Bolt (Basic) - 23 -&gt; 25]</p><p>The casting time had dropped to just below five seconds, which was barely enough to attack the giant beasts. I tried that just to be on the safe side, but it didn’t go up. </p><p>It turned out that people were right about the limits of the Basic skills. Worse, there was no Perk. </p><p>A pity. An extra perk would have been useful. </p><p>Once it reached the limit, I decided to test a few other things. I wasn’t able to move while casting, because it was somewhat anchored in the air. However, my experience with the camouflage ring showed that such requirements were rather arbitrary. </p><p>But, breaking it was a mission for another time. At first, I attempted interrupting spells. It was not as hard as I feared. Nothing like the disaster reversing the meditation technique had triggered. It was easiest when I interrupted once I let out all the mana, but interrupting halfway was also safe. </p><p>It just gave me more resistance, but at this point, I was used to interrupting skills exactly when I wanted to. Three years of practice was truly useful. </p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t learn much from the way the mana moved. Despite what I had hoped, it wasn’t the exact same pattern every single time. While it had roughly the same shape, even getting a rough sense was next to impossible. </p><p>Suddenly, I understood what Maria meant by it being impossible to sketch properly. Truly, what she was able to draw was leagues more complicated than what I had been able to even comprehend. </p><p>“Alright, now I understand why they need Intelligence,” I groaned. It probably required Intelligence to direct and control the mana, which was a level of multitasking even a skill couldn’t handle alone. </p><p>Well, at least, that was my current working theory, one that I couldn’t examine one way or another. One that I wanted to push more, but could not. </p><p>The trick with the sword was far more important. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a sword technique that was anywhere close to anything I had in my forging techniques. Though, there was a chance it existed, but I wasn’t able to access it. </p><p>Another arbitrary restriction. </p><p>A spear, on the other hand, could be classified as a chisel if one squinted enough. There was no reason for it not to work. I still needed a skill, but that could be mixed with the search for the dungeon door for the next floor. All I needed was for me to slow down slightly to make sure the monsters I killed connected. It didn’t take too many small monsters to make sure every giant bug dropped a skill of Uncommon variety — which now I could distinguish thanks to a quick talk with the skill vendor. </p><p>Previously, I wasn’t able to get much information on it, with most people hiding the information. Understandable, as when I had the money to buy skills, they were still rare enough that even common ones had required connections to acquire. </p><p>And, once they started to get more common, I was poor enough to be treated as a nuisance. In that regard, my current stage showed a significant difference, in which I looked like an adventurer with a lot of money to throw around. </p><p>Of course, it was still nothing more than a reasonable hypothesis. I fired up the forge once more and started creating a multitude of different chisels, ignoring the limits set by the System. And, if at one point, those chisels had started suspiciously like short spears, it was surely an accident. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I waved around my ugly chisel made entirely of metal, with a thick wedge at the front. </p><p>“Now, all I need is to set a search pattern,” I said as I moved a while. It didn’t take long for me to realize that the density of giant monsters varied greatly based on the direction I picked. Eleanor had already mentioned that the giant ones were mostly spilling from the next floor. </p><p>“Probably the right path,” I muttered even as I shifted to my hammer, angling myself to avoid the charge of a giant monster while making sure the second one had been blocked by the first. It was challenging enough even without factoring in the ordinary monsters making things more complicated. </p><p>Luckily, the new armor was allowing me to block the corrosion attacks, or dealing with the combination of monsters would have been a messy challenge. </p><p>But, while it had been difficult, I made sure to slowly immobilize the giant ones first before it disappeared. </p><p>The reward had been equally impressive. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Swift Spear (Uncommon)]</p><p>A short but painful absorption period later, I concentrated, targeting the nearest stone, treating it as a target I needed to shape as a grindstone. The mana pattern appeared in front of it. At this point, switching between attacks was a common trick. </p><p>[Swift Spear (Uncommon) 1 -&gt; 7 ]</p><p>“Marvelous.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Wow, they are burning better than I had expected,” I said as I settled a crude crucible on top of the hearth that held the fire, the iron it held had already turned into a white hot liquid, ready to be purified. Nearby, there was an anvil that was cooling down. </p><p>I was so happy that I could cheat with mana, as otherwise, I would have had to work hard to set up a proper blast furnace. I still might if I wanted to increase my production rate, but for the moment, this was sufficient.</p><p>“Now, let’s gear up,” I said and used the available metal to make myself a full set of gear, including full body armor, a large tower shield with sharp edges and a spike that I could drive into the beasts, a war hammer made of pure metal, and a thick, stout sword that was designed to work perfectly with Stalwart Guard technique. </p><p>According to the information my skill had provided, all of them were perfectly immune to corrosion. </p><p>A small part of me couldn’t help but feel disappointed. Letting everything be handled by a skill was very underwhelming, but considering the potential benefits, I was more than ready to ignore that detail. </p><p>It had been merely three hours, which was an incredibly short amount of time; but then, having my Mana Forge skill that high had provided me with many benefits. It would have been even faster, but … </p><p>I lacked water to quench the metal, which meant I needed to use mana to compensate for it, slowing the process. Luckily, with my increased Meditation, I was able to refill my mana far faster, allowing me to bypass my biggest problem.</p><p>At least, for the moment. For the future, I needed to find a reason to bring some more water inside. Maybe I could set up a small garden on the first floor, arguably to test whether I could create a sustainable setup for myself to get some extra Health. </p><p>It wasn’t a novel idea. The current dungeon was hardly the biggest one imaginable. There were other, bigger dungeons, and for some of them, it was more efficient to set up gardens to provide food rather than transport them from outside. </p><p>I doubted that it was the case for our dungeon, considering the desert environment surrounding it, but I just needed an excuse. Between that, and going to the fourth floor just to bring some water, a fake garden was clearly the better option … once I had others in my guild that could handle that. </p><p>My new, nameless guild. </p><p>“Actually, it might be easier to test the fourth floor first,” I said even as I put my finishing touches to the set. After all, the whole point was to stay hidden. It would probably avoid attention for a while, but sooner or later, people would start poking around. </p><p>Still, I didn’t need to hurry up. Actually, it wasn’t even certain that I would be able to find the way to the fourth floor. Not with the way my sight was blocked. </p><p>“I’m trying to handle too many projects,” I said even as I started moving. I collected my tools, and left my equipment buried, but left the forge uncovered. I wanted to see if the monsters would attack and destroy it. </p><p>They shouldn’t, but it was better safe than sorry. It wouldn’t bother me if my current setup had been destroyed, but it wouldn’t be the same if they attacked equipment I had worked harder to put together. </p><p>“But first, let’s see if I can get a renewable source of wood,” I said. The plants I used didn’t have any seeds, but trying to grow plants using saplings should have been sustainable. </p><p>It worked … after a fashion. </p><p>[-280 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 3 -&gt; 5]</p><p>“Nice jump in skill level,” I muttered. It was a nice surprise, but maybe the damage to the plant had affected the skill development, just as the quality of the weapon affected Repair. However, I didn’t start experimenting immediately. </p><p>I was not exactly happy with the amount of Health it took, and the resulting limited impact. But then, I was trying to force growth in a dead land, lacking any kind of water. Hardly an efficient method. While some interesting ideas popped into my mind, I ignored them. </p><p>“Nurturing Nurture is not a priority,” I said, then groaned, glad that I was alone. It was not a pun I was proud of. </p><p> I moved away from the forge, letting the monsters gather around it again, to see if they would attack it. Luckily, it stayed untouched even when I deliberately drew a small-sized swarm near it. It was excellent news, as this meant that my plans to create a new forge on the fourth floor were viable. </p><p>As long as I confirmed the anti-corrosive Mana alloy worked as well as my skill suggested. I spent an hour cleaning the immediate surroundings of the forge, collecting skills, other dungeon materials, and various samples, but the real aim was to test the anti-corrosive Mana alloy under repeated stress. </p><p>It passed perfectly, even when I deliberately hacked at a giant bug multiple times to push it to its limits. It not only resisted the effects of the smaller insects but also the giant ones’, which had been far easier to deal with without worrying about the destruction of the weapons. It meant that I could slowly hack them to death using my sword and shield combo, the stronger enemy once again speeding up the growth of Stalwart Guard, finally passing the fifty proficiency mark. </p><p>My attempts to figure out the mana attack, on the other hand, didn’t work as well. </p><p>A talk with Eleanor seemed to be necessary to push it to the limit as I had done with the hammer skill. But, that required an opportunity. Maybe after Maria had returned, during another dinner... Assuming, of course, they would continue to invite me. </p><p> However, even as I tested those advantages and made plans, I couldn’t help but wonder about why the dungeons existed. More importantly, why were they so convenient? The biggest challenge the current dungeon provided was the corrosion effect, and it had all the materials needed to solve that. </p><p>And, the recipe it required was conveniently included in a Rare skill, a classification that was supposed to be easy to attain for other classes according to Maria’s ramblings, mentioning categories such as Legendary casually. </p><p>“Maybe I should keep a lid on this anti-corrosive material a bit,” I decided. My success was making me a little nervous. It wasn’t always good to be too successful. </p><p>Ironically, that immediately changed my plans in an interesting way. While I hadn’t promised Eleanor that I could invent anti-corrosive material and openly warned her that it might fail, I was very much aware that she took that as a certainty. </p><p>Meaning, I needed to preemptively counter any loss of goodwill she might get from it. The most obvious way … improving my abilities with the sword. </p><p>“A little trip upstairs is in order,” I said even as I cut the trip a little short, even suppressing the temptation to test the shells I took from the giant monsters. It was frustrating because I was looking forward to discovering the differences between the two, curious whether there were any differences other than their mana density. </p><p>I wanted to change the carts and get more metal, and not just because I wanted to prepare for the future. No, I wanted to forge swords of different shapes and sizes and see if they would work. At the same time, as I climbed up, I was examining the Sharpness enchantment on the sword, wondering if it would give me a clue. </p><p>The mana blow from the forging was more like a thick, confusing web that reminded me of a complicated knitting pattern, but the details were a mystery. </p><p>Mana was essentially still a black box for me. </p><p>As I climbed up, I tried to channel the Mana discharge in multiple thin lines, trying to replicate sharpness enchantment in some way. </p><p>I refilled my mana almost ten times during the long trip between the third floor and the first floor, only to fail at every single attempt. It didn’t even give me a new skill point in anything. Not even in Meditation. </p><p>It was the flip side of forcing skills to grow unnaturally. There was no easy benefit to be gained from the routine activities. </p><p>“I’m so lucky that I don’t have to ration my Mana,” I muttered even as I arrived at my broken cart, and filled it with mostly random garbage. I dragged it out of its hiding spot, dragging it back to the main area. </p><p>“Hey,” I said as I waved at a familiar guard. </p><p>”It looks like your trip has been a little unlucky,” he said. </p><p>“Unfortunately,” I replied even as a couple of workers arrived to pack them to be delivered to the town. Another service I could use for a limited time. “Why don’t I get a new cart for the second trip.” </p><p>“Sure, but I can’t waive the penalty,” he said. “It doesn’t matter that you brought the cart back. You still need to pay five silver.” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” I said as I looked around, only to notice a stall nearby. “What’s that?” I asked. </p><p>“A few people trying to sell the skills they got from the dungeon. A total ripoff,” he said. </p><p>“Well, it’s better than going back to town,” I replied. “Is there anything useful?” </p><p>“Maybe if you want to change your sword style for more efficient hunting, but I don’t think a Common skill is worth it,” he said as he pointed at my bulky shield. It wasn’t as big as the tower shield I forged, but it was still big. </p><p>“No. It’s not like I’m going to spend my days killing monsters. I’m here to laze around and watch others make money for me.” </p><p>“That’s the dream,” the guard replied. However, even as we chatted, I went to the skill rack. Everything they were trying to sell was common and basic. Understandable. While I was able to get uncommon skills, I had to kill a lot of monsters at the same time for it. </p><p>However, it did give me a sad confirmation. I wasn’t able to learn anything above basic when it came to magic skills. The lack of Intelligence stumped me once more. I still spent ten silver there, purchasing one of every skill. </p><p>Including one that I had been trying to get all day. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Fire Bolt (Basic)]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The moment I stepped through the gate, I got charged by multiple monsters. I could easily count forty of them around me, making it a challenge. That would have been dangerous enough, but a few of the insect monsters had stopped their charge to spit out some kind of discharge. </p><p>Eleanor had mentioned that their attacks only damaged armor, but I wasn’t willing to test it. Instead, I dodged them first before I turned the momentum into a charge, shattering the armor of the first beast. I was glad that I didn’t rely on the mana blow to deal with them, as it would have made dodging the insects far more difficult. </p><p>Instead, I let expertise from the skill handle the challenge, limiting my involvement only to a strategic level, dealing with the ranged attackers first. Ordinarily, it would have been a bad idea to jump into the middle of a horde of monsters even if they were weaker. </p><p>But a combat skill at its limit was truly wondrous. </p><p>“After dealing with that attack, I understand why exploring new dungeons is such a perilous journey,” I muttered even as I took a deep breath. Just trying to get into a new floor was difficult, and that was after it was cleaned by Eleanor just yesterday. </p><p>I couldn’t even imagine the difficulty of facing a completely new dungeon, with no idea of what it might hold. It also explained why they had spent all that money to defend the other side of the entrance. </p><p>“Still, not all is bad,” I said. With traversing between floors even more difficult than I had expected, people shouldn’t walk around carelessly, meaning my forge was even less likely to be discovered.</p><p>Only once I dealt with the monsters, did  I decide to examine my immediate surroundings. Just as Eleanor had stated, the mysterious mist was blocking more of my sight. I walked, however, halfway in, I pressed my hand on a herb and used Nurture. </p><p>[-9 Health]</p><p>This time, it worked. I moved deeper. The same attempt didn’t work when the plant was outside the dungeon. </p><p>However, while that was another interesting experiment to run, it didn’t have any priority. I needed to discover the entrance to the third floor first. </p><p>I pulled a piece of paper, carefully mapping my surroundings, not wanting to get lost. It was a slow, laborious process, the limited visual range making it far more difficult. I didn’t want to get lost. </p><p>However, as I walked away, I noticed that it wasn’t too much of a problem. Even as the mist had covered the dungeon gate, I could still see its glow. I considered it to be of interest, as it hadn’t worked that way from the other side. </p><p>I wondered if it worked the same way for the main entrance. If it did, the walls had been thick enough to block the sight. </p><p>I walked directly to test its limit, only stopping to kill the monsters — and spending some time piling them to get better skills. One ranged attack, I deliberately let it deliver a glancing blow. It hurt somewhat, but nowhere strong enough to actually qualify as damage. </p><p>[-5 Health]</p><p>However, it damaged the armor and weapons even more than the feedback corrosion effect. </p><p>“Huh,” I exclaimed, but before making a move, I started searching for the gate to the third floor. Amusingly, it had been easier than expected. I just needed to follow the path with the least amount of monsters, making a careful note of every milestone on my way to make sure I wouldn’t get lost, only slowing down to replenish my mana completely. </p><p>Going through the third floor would be even more difficult. </p><p>While walking, I found a lot of crystals and herbs, far more than I could use in a short period. After all, it clearly took a while for them to grow, and the first floor was too crowded for them to be found regularly. </p><p>Maybe I could make a stockpile near the forge. Once I revealed the anti-corrosion metal, they would be far more valuable. Which was true even if there were other blacksmiths with the same recipe. </p><p>It was better to be prepared. </p><p>Following Eleanor’s path, finding the third gate hadn’t been that difficult in terms of practical matters, but I was confronted by a swarm twice. Three hundred monsters had managed to slow me down somewhat, but I was at the next gate almost an hour later, and that was with stopping enough times to create a map. </p><p>I was not exactly a cartographer, but creating a guide for myself wasn’t that difficult. </p><p>“Now, the real challenge,” I muttered as I twirled my hammer. At the next gate, there would be a giant bug, which would have been a troubling encounter even without mixing it with the other beasts. I was tempted to return, and try to convince Eleanor about having a second location to experiment. It would be much safer. </p><p>But, that was my pre-Calamity perspective talking. I tried to stay safe for three years, and where did that get me? </p><p>Nowhere. </p><p>I took a deep breath, tightened my grip on my hammer, and prepared myself for a fight, already making plans on how to handle a giant monster depending on its size and position. Eleanor had mentioned them to be rare, but I wanted to be prepared for the worst case. </p><p>As I stepped to the third floor, I found myself facing another swarm that had gathered around the gate. There were about fifty of them, a mixture of ranged and melee variants, but there was no giant variant. “Excellent,” I muttered even as I dealt with them rapidly, slowing down just to kick them into a pile. </p><p>That way, I received Common skills rather than Basic ones. Unfortunately, I had two more Common Nurture skills, one common spear skill, and another that didn’t react to me. </p><p>How annoying. </p><p>“I wonder how rare the giant insects are,” I questioned as I tightened my grip further, and started walking forward, once again careful not to lose my way. The second floor was larger than the first, and the third was larger than the second. </p><p>About a mile away from the gate, I faced the first giant insect. “Hey there, buddy,” I said while circling the monstrosity, testing its speed. In a straight line, it was faster than its smaller counterparts, but it was slower to turn. </p><p>I approached it from the side and smashed one of its legs. It shattered temporarily, but I could already see it was recovering from the damage. Meanwhile, I could feel my hammer degrade far compared to when I dealt with its smaller counterparts. </p><p>“That’s annoying,” I muttered even as I rotated around it, and used Inspect to check the damage. It was a good thing I did, as not only was it damaged more, but there was also a persistent effect that stuck around. A burst of mana stopped it. </p><p>[-1 Mana]</p><p>I deliberately circled it twice, testing its limits. However, I avoided its back, afraid of a nasty surprise. My concern only got stronger once I noticed it trying to reverse direction. Carefully, I rotated around it, testing it a while longer, making sure I wouldn't be met with a nasty surprise while switching skills. </p><p>[-12 Mana]</p><p>I might not push more than a couple points of mana outside with meditation without killing myself, but things doing that was much easier under the command of the Forge skill. It settled around the hammer, ready to smash the nonexistent metal into pieces. </p><p>One that turned my strike devastating as it landed. The hammer was protected, while the leg stopped recovering. I struck it again and it stopped moving. Another blow and its mandible had been broken. Three more blows, and it stopped moving. </p><p>I pulled back, waiting for it to disappear, not even trying to pull its shell. There was no need to take the risk in case it was playing dead or had another nasty surprise. </p><p>There was none. It faded, leaving behind another skill.</p><p> [Skill Stone: Nurture (Common)]</p><p>“Nice,” I muttered even as I twirled it in my hand. Not because I needed another Nurture skill, but because it was the first time a higher rank skill dropped from the monsters without piling them together. Confirming that the giant monsters weren’t too hard to deal with was another benefit. </p><p>After testing my attacks on a few of them, it would probably be much easier. I was immediately struck with a desire to hunt another, this time to rip mana-dense sections of its shell to see if it had other uses. </p><p>But, that was for later. First, I continued moving deeper and deeper, searching for a nice hidden spot for my forge. </p><p>In the end, I found a sharp cliff with almost nothing. One that I could dig a deep hole to set up my forge, and bury whenever my work gets finished. However, I didn’t have anything to dig with. </p><p>Luckily, I was a blacksmith who could forge with mana, and one thing I didn’t lack was mana. I quickly forged a huge pick and an equally large shovel, both designed to put my strength advantage to use. They weren’t as good as it could have been without a proper fire, but mana was a good way to compensate. </p><p>As I dug a pit, I learned the reason for not damaging the dungeon. The more I dug, the more monsters swarmed toward me. Which was excellent news.</p><p>After all, I needed a lot of mana. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 16</p><p>My dreams of sleeping until noon had been ruined by a sudden stirring. Panicked, I opened my eyes, only to see Eleanor looking at me with a sharp expression. “Explain!” she ordered. </p><p>I froze. I hadn’t expected to be discovered, not after spending the whole night cleaning. Could it be that Maria had revealed something and Eleanor managed to connect the dots. </p><p>One good thing about being forcibly woken up by a scary woman with an even scarier aura that felt like a sword, my exhaustion had dispersed quite easily, my mind working overclocking in panic. The first question was what exactly she knew. </p><p>I had many secrets. Some mild, like the fact that my Forge skill had a perk it shouldn’t have, and some significantly more radical, like my Forge skill, wasn’t just Forge anymore. Answering the wrong question would only make the problem more troubling. </p><p>I decided to pick the safest option first. “I’m sorry. I have used more bronze ingots than we had agreed upon, but Lady Maria said that —” </p><p>“I’m not talking about it,” she growled, her aura tightening further. I knew she wasn’t talking about it, but the challenge was to know what she was talking about. “Tell me, what are your intentions towards her?” </p><p>This time, I didn’t need to fake my expression of shock. I truly didn’t understand what she was trying to say. “Is this about wasting her time by asking for her help?” I probed, confused. </p><p>She said nothing, examining my expression. I had no idea what she was looking for, but she must have found it because her aura receded once more. “Good, you know your place,” she said. </p><p>“Of course, ma’am,” I replied, a hint of military respect feeling appropriate. I didn’t know what it was, but nodding in acceptance seemed like a safe bet. </p><p>“Good. Now, prepare. You’ll be leaving with Maria soon. No funny business. Understand?” </p><p>With that, she left as sharply as she came. Her sudden intrusion into my living space was annoying, but the camp was similar to a military operation. And, there was no privacy in the military. Especially when I was the weaker party. </p><p>I quickly donned my armor and took my helmet. I touched them, enjoying the wave of new information provided by Mana Repair, allowing me to enjoy the intricacies of the products even more. Multiple enchantments overlapped, creating a confusing outlay, one that I doubted that I could handle even with my current abilities. But, if I could find a workaround — </p><p>I stopped that line of thought. As much as the idea of playing around with them was fun, I couldn’t afford to do so. Unlike the swords I brought to repair, my new armor and hammer were not disposable assets. Damaging them would attract undue notice. </p><p>And, even if I was willing, I didn’t have time. </p><p>“Ready for another day of adventure,” Maria greeted me cheerfully. </p><p>“Always,” I replied, this time, not even faking my excitement. I was looking forward to clearing the first threshold, curious what I would find. Not to mention, I had many questions that needed to be answered, and Maria was the best candidate. She was strong and came from a strong family, which meant she knew far more secrets than I did. Combined with her careless approach to secrets — at least minor ones that didn’t matter to her — she was the best target for probing. </p><p>I had thought about asking Eleanor, but her erratic behavior this morning had changed my mind. </p><p>For the first part of the flight, we played chess. Maria crushed me even harder than usual, though I was happy. Between moves, I managed to wheedle some stories from her. Mostly stories of previous battles, mostly about how she single-handedly managed to save the day. </p><p>She was clearly bragging, but that didn’t make her stories untrue. I had seen her destroy thousands of monsters without breaking a sweat. I couldn’t even imagine just how impressive she was when she actually faced a threat requiring her to push herself. </p><p>“ … And then, I created a wall of fire, enveloping the monsters as I hit from the side, saving the elites of the guild from certain destruction,” she finished another story. </p><p>“Wow, fascinating,” I said. “You must have been really proud. I wish that I could fight just as well, saving people rather than … being a worker.” That was so far from my true sentiments that it wasn’t even funny. While I envied the benefits of the stats granted to others, the last thing I wanted was to spend my days on the battlefield, risking myself every day. </p><p>I much preferred staying in my forge and tinker. It was not a replacement for a proper research project, but it was far better than going around fighting like another grunt. The world had enough of them already. </p><p>“If only I could change my class,” I baited. Faking sorrow wasn’t too hard. I just focused on the fact that I was thousands of feet above the ground, and started shaking. </p><p>Maria noticed my distress as she shifted in her seat, hugged me, and patted my back. A surprisingly kind move from her, which made me feel guilty about manipulating her. Still, I was already committed. </p><p>“Too bad the class promotion is not triggered by external skills. You would have made an excellent warrior with your determination,” she said, revealing a piece of information that I had been searching for. </p><p>“Yeah, it’s a pity that it only works with class skills,” I said, acting like it was something I knew all along. “Worse, it’s impossible to get skills for Production classes.” </p><p>“Not impossible, but very difficult,” she responded. “There had been one auction for Uncommon skill, though ultimately we weren’t able to afford it.” </p><p>“You couldn’t afford it?” I asked, shocked. </p><p>She blushed. “Well, only because this operation is … well, complicated. Our budget is limited, so ultimately, we decided an Uncommon Repair skill was not worth paying for.” </p><p>“May I ask how much it went for?” </p><p>“Two hundred platinum coins,” she replied, which shocked me. A platinum coin was worth a hundred gold coins, making that skill worth twenty thousand gold. I thought myself rich just because I had fifty gold coins. </p><p>The new economy didn’t make sense. Though, it was inevitable when money was generated by killing monsters, and used in mysterious shops with even more mysterious goods. </p><p>“Are all uncommon skills that expensive?” I asked. </p><p>She snorted. “Not even close. My own Rare meditation skill had merely cost four platinum coins. It’s just the rarity driving up the price. Some groups are trying to find a way to trigger upgrades for production classes. It’s a waste of effort.” </p><p>“Why?” I asked. </p><p>“Because a rare skill is a minimum requirement to trigger a class upgrade,” she said. “People worked very hard to trigger class upgrades for production classes during the first days of Calamity. </p><p>“Before we discovered the System Shops,” I completed. </p><p>“Exactly. With the shops in place, the production classes are pretty much useless —” she started, only to freeze. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that!” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. I can’t blame you for telling the truth,” I said, once again looking despondent. But, I was very happy with her unintentional insult. It meant that she would be looking for an opportunity to change the topic. “Too bad we can’t upgrade the skills ourselves, right?” I asked. </p><p>“Yeah, it would have been nice not to depend on dungeon drops for rare skills, not to mention anything higher,” she muttered in frustration. “You can’t believe how long I had stayed in a dungeon just to get my epic skill.” </p><p>“I’m sure there’s a good story there,” I responded, changing the topic once more. Her words already confirmed to me what I needed to know. I could ask further, but I decided not to appear too curious. </p><p>I had already received my most important answer. Rare production skills were either unheard of or their existence was suppressed. </p><p>I didn’t know which. There was a possibility that I was the only one that achieved it in the whole world. If I said that to someone else, they would certainly feel like it was arrogance. However, I couldn’t discount the possibility due to a combination of several unique factors. </p><p>First, the fact that I was a genius was an undisputed fact. Otherwise, I couldn’t have been one of the leading figures in my field before my peers could even finish their education. </p><p>Then, there were the three years I spent constantly working as a Blacksmith, which gave me some unique insights that proved very useful. </p><p>In addition, I had been lucky. Extremely so. If Maria hadn’t been a fire mage, if I wasn’t working in a location without environment mana to interfere, the experiment would have failed. </p><p>Yet, the biggest differentiator was a difference in belief. Everyone was dazzled by the benefits of the System, too ready to discard the learnings of the past. Maybe because technology had failed us, they believed science did as well. </p><p>A mistake. Technology was just a tool. If it was broken, you could always just develop a new one. Science, on the other hand, was a way to dissect and understand the world. It helped our ancestors to understand the mysteries of thunder and the seas. </p><p>I had no reason to believe it couldn’t do the same for the System. </p><p>But, ironically, my discovery had given me a reason to keep my head down. Science had allowed us to understand the world, but it didn’t always end well for the scientist in question. Galileo was almost burned at the stake, and Giordano Bruno was actually burned. Many other scientists had been killed, ostracized, or otherwise ruined for revealing the truth. </p><p>Particularly if that truth affected the established economic benefits. </p><p>No, as much as I wanted to reveal the truth, I didn’t dare to. </p><p>“Amazing. Then what,” I muttered, not paying attention to Maria’s story other than knowing when to nod and encourage — an ability I perfected in endless department meetings — while I charted the next stage of my strategy. </p><p>“Then, we gathered together and …” she said, then paused. “Too bad we have to stop. We have reached our destination,” she asked. </p><p>“Of course,” I said, then looked around, and realized it wasn’t the same location. “We’re not at the same place, right?” I asked. </p><p>“No,” she replied. “Since you are already at level twenties, I decided that we can handle a more dangerous location.” </p><p>“Whatever you say. You’re the expert,” I said. I wasn’t entirely happy with it, but trying to argue against it was pointless considering she didn’t even ask my opinion in the first place. </p><p>I twirled my hammer. It was time to fight. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 17</p><p>The moment we landed, monsters gathered around us like moths to the flame. Then, Maria took action, turning that into a rather unfortunate pun. </p><p>While she fought, I tried to feel the mana around us, but failed. I had managed to feel the presence of mana when I had been working, but that was only through a combination of two of my skills. Without activating them, I couldn’t sense the mana around me. </p><p>I wondered if it would have been different if I spent my time practicing yoga — or other activities that I wrote off as nonsense — instead of working on science, but I didn’t really care about it. Too bad I couldn’t just get a skill like Meditation without corresponding Stats.</p><p>However, even as I moved the first wounded monster, I was thinking of ways to cheat. Luckily, I had my multipurpose hammer with me along with the warhammer. I looked toward Maria, and saw that she was busy with the next wave of monsters. </p><p>It was the best time to experiment. I pulled my multipurpose hammer, and tapped against the surface of my armor, doing my best to activate my Mana Manipulation perk. </p><p>As I did that, the head of the hammer worked like a magnet, some mana gathered to its head. I maintained my focus even as I smashed it against the wounded monster. It dispersed before I could kill the monster. </p><p>“No matter,” I said as I moved to the next wounded creature, repeating the trick again and again. My increased Strength allowed me to kill them with much more ease, though my faithful hammer was struggling under the blows. </p><p>Success, however, was fleeting. I was familiar with switching between the effects of the two skills. I had pulled that trick between Forge and Repair many times. Unfortunately, back then, I was pulling that trick between swings, just as a way to check the designs. </p><p>Now, I was trying to maintain the mana around the hammer, which was significantly more challenging. Switch too soon, and the mana dispersed. Switch too late, and the System didn’t register it as a use of Hammer of Might. </p><p>Worse, I was under a time crunch. The first wave of the monsters was the most dangerous one. Distracted by it, she wouldn’t notice my trick with the hammer, but that wouldn’t be true once the number of attacking monsters dropped to a manageable level. </p><p>Just as I was fearing I would have to stop before I could finish my experiments, I managed to switch just in time. The monster died under the blow, and a notification appeared. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 7 -&gt; 13]</p><p>Success. Well, technically, partial success, as the skill didn’t suddenly turn into a mana variant, but what I got instead was one of the reasonable results. The external skills and the class skills were different, so the lack of an upgrade was understandable. </p><p>This meant that the best-case scenario was out, but that didn’t make the experiment useless. Not only did it confirm the viability of the skill upgrade method for other skills, but also gave me a chance to upgrade my sole combat skill far faster. </p><p>Ordinarily, improving combat skills faster required fighting against more dangerous monsters, just like how repairing more valuable weapons improved repair faster. However, it had certain limits, particularly for someone like me with little experience in combat. After all, killing a wounded beast in one blow didn’t improve it as much as a deadly fight where one pushed oneself to the limit. </p><p>The jump of six skill levels for one blow, when the target was lying helplessly, was incredible enough. It meant that I had a rapid way of increasing my combat skills, which mattered a lot. I might not like fighting, but it was far better to be good with a hammer and not need to use it. </p><p>The post-Cataclysm world was filled with dangers by default. Having a better skill was certainly worth it. Every point mattered, particularly for an uncommon skill, which was harder to improve. Improving six points with one blow was incredible indeed. </p><p>While Maria was distracted, I killed fifty monsters with mana blows successfully, though I attempted many more. Technically, I could push my luck more, but factoring in diminishing returns and increasing risk of getting caught, I decided against it. </p><p>The rewards were rather fascinating. </p><p>[Level 22 -&gt; 23]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity]</p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 13 -&gt; 53]</p><p>As much as confirming that external skills not granting any perk even at proficiency level fifty was a bummer, I was very happy with the gains. With an uncommon fighting skill at level fifty, I was actually qualified as a decent fighter, the kind that the expedition groups would try to hire rather than me trying to join them. Combined with my improving Strength, I was actually confident of defeating the monsters that were attacking us. </p><p>Well, one by one, with breaks in between. If I dared to come to a location like this without Maria’s assistance, I would have been shredded into pieces easily. </p><p>Ignoring the dreams of enacting the life of Conan the Barbarian, I shifted back to using the warhammer, and started demolishing the immobile monsters. Not an epic tale of cutting through the wilderness, but the steady effort of a workman, smashing again and again. </p><p>“How is it going?” Maria asked as she approached. I felt a sense of mana invading my body, one that disappeared just as quickly. “Level twenty-three, very good,” she said. </p><p> I realized two things in quick succession. Her identification spell didn’t work on skills, just levels, or she would have reacted in a much more extreme manner. And…</p><p>I had just experienced a very close call, one of neglect. I never faced it, but it was not impossible for the others to have skills or spells that could see through not only the level but the other details. </p><p>“A quick question. How does your Identify skill work?” I asked. </p><p>“Nothing too fancy,” she replied. “It just shows the level of the target, and nothing else. Unfortunately, a basic one has its limits.” </p><p>“Are they even harder to find than Production skills,” I asked, always happy to learn more. </p><p>“Basic ones are, but the better versions are much easier to find,” she replied. </p><p>“Really?” I asked. “That doesn’t make sense.” </p><p>“It does when you factor in the requirements,” she said. “The basic one only requires Essence stat, but the common one needs both Essence and Perception. Not exactly a common combination,” she replied. </p><p>I nodded, feeling slightly more relaxed. It meant that I wasn’t facing the risk of revealing all my secrets immediately. Especially since it was rude to use Identify on people so it shouldn’t be too big of a risk. </p><p>Still, I made a note not to walk around in the camp. The last thing I needed was to get caught by a spy. </p><p>Inconvenient.  </p><p>“So, are you ready to pass the threshold,” she asked. </p><p>“Frankly, no. I don’t even know what I need to do.” </p><p>“First, you need to prepare yourself for horrible pain,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked, chuckling. She wasn’t a good liar. </p><p>“Yes, when the mana hits, it feels like fire going through your veins. It’s the kind of torture you can’t imagine,” she said. I gasped in fear, acting like I believed her. She started giggling. “Don’t worry. You don’t need to do anything. It’s like getting a new perk. Once it hits, you get a choice.” </p><p>“Even if I have only one option,” I asked. </p><p>“Yes. It’s probably a safety measure. Once you trigger it, you start absorbing mana from the environment immediately, which can trigger the approach of monsters. Worse, you can trigger it in the middle of a mana-dead environment. It wouldn’t be pleasant.” </p><p>“Is it safe to do it here? Should we go back to town?” </p><p>She chuckled. “Don’t worry. With me defending you, there’s no risk,” she guaranteed. “Do you think there’s a monster in a ten-mile radius that can threaten me?” </p><p>“No, you’re amazing,” I said, enjoying the way she blushed. For a rude young woman, she was certainly weak to compliments. </p><p>“I … shut up and continue working. That’s enough for a break.” </p><p>“As you wish, my lady,” I said, giving an exaggerated bow. She smiled. Now that she warmed up to me, she was easy to deal with. </p><p>[Level 23 -&gt; 24]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity]</p><p>“Another level,” I called, after another fifteen minutes of steady monster killing. Working in a more dangerous location was paying dividends. Another twenty minutes later, another notification arrived. </p><p>[Level 24 -&gt; 25]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity]</p><p>[Class Upgrade: Blacksmith / Mana Mender / Mana Crafter / Mana Blacksmith]</p><p>“Well, that’s a surprise,” I muttered, once again cursing the necessity of a blind choice. And once again, I was making a choice with little information, solely based on the impressiveness of the name. </p><p>Mana Mender felt like a name for a class that focused on repair work. Carrying the indicator of Mana made it seem more impressive, but it was still enough to be eliminated. </p><p>Mana Crafter felt like a better option, but the existence of a mender implied that it would focus on the production side. More tempting than turning into a repair expert. The ability to mass produce weapons would have ensured a living for me without revealing myself. </p><p>However, ultimately, I chose Mana Blacksmith. The only reason I was able to discover the secrets of the skill upgrade was because I was able to play around with two skills, combining the information they offered. Choosing to prioritize one seemed like a bad idea. </p><p>Especially when level fifty didn’t seem too far away. </p><p>As I chose, another notification appeared in front of me. </p><p>[Class upgrade - 01%]</p><p>I wasn’t able to feel the movement of mana around me, but it must have been intense, as I could actually feel the air reacting with it, slowly circling me. Monsters at a distance started to move more vigorously, only to fall to Maria’s flames. </p><p>She even maintained enough control to leave them wounded. </p><p>“No need to stand still, go kill them,” she said. “It’ll make the process go faster.” </p><p>“I much rather try to feel what’s going on with my body,” I said. “It’s fascinating.” </p><p>“Sure, but it’ll last longer,” she warned. I ignored her as I closed my eyes, feeling the mana flow to me. I might not feel it outside my body, but it was a subtle stirring feeling once it reached my body. Merely a tickle and nothing more. </p><p>I decided to follow her suggestion and start killing monsters. Mostly because I didn’t want to make her suspicious. What if better classes required more time to change? By killing monsters, I could muddy that number more. </p><p>By killing monsters, it took ten minutes for class change to complete, and I was barely able to generate an impression of the process. A lost opportunity, but not enough to ruin my mood. </p><p>Not with my new class abilities in front of me. </p><p>[Mana Blacksmith - Level 25]</p><p>[Health 660/750] [Mana 0/120]</p><p>[Vitality 50 / Strength 50 / Dexterity 37 / Essence 13]</p><p>[Skills (4/9)</p><p>Mana Repair (Rare) - 25 [Inspect]</p><p>Mana Forge (Rare) - 25 [Intuitive Forging, Mana Manipulation]</p><p>Meditation (Common) - 1</p><p>Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 53]</p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 18</p><p>“Congratulations,” she called as the mana around me calmed down. “Now, you belong to a new tier. How does it feel?” </p><p>I killed another beast and realized that my movements were noticeably smoother. For a moment, I thought that it was my increased Dexterity, but her reaction suggested that there was another reason. “Smooth, like I weigh much less,” I said. </p><p>“That’s because stepping over the threshold makes you get more aligned with your stats. It’s very helpful,” she said. “You’ll notice the difference even more as you push yourself,” she said. </p><p>“Certainly a welcome change,” I answered even as I moved on to the next monster. “It feels amazing.” </p><p>I wanted nothing more than to sit down and absorb mana now that I actually had the ability to do so. However, I ignored that temptation, for one simple reason. The moment I gained Essence, the world had shifted slightly, giving me the ability to perceive mana. Meaning, that Maria would notice easily if I tried to absorb any. </p><p>It was almost visual, though it didn’t suddenly distort the world with a blanket of blue or something equally annoying. I could just … perceive it. The quick way I could dismiss developing a completely new sense was a good indicator of just how ridiculous the System was. Miracles lost their quality of wonder once they became commonplace. </p><p>I killed another beast, focusing on other changes. Compared to other things, the slight increase in my Dexterity was less notable, but certainly welcome. A lot of complicated forge work required fine motor control and timing. Dexterity helped with both. </p><p>However, the real surprise was the sudden appearance of the new skill: meditation. The Skill mages used to collect mana. </p><p>I wondered if the appearance of it meant that it qualified as a class skill, or it was just an external skill. I would have questioned Maria about it, but I had already asked too many questions about some potentially sensitive topics. I didn’t want to alert her. </p><p>Especially since I just needed to raise my meditate to level ten to figure that out. No inconvenient questions were necessary. I just needed to show a little patience. I killed another wounded monster instead of using the skill I wanted to use. </p><p>[Level 25 -&gt; 26]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>Double points in Dexterity, which was less impressive than getting a point in Essence. It looked like these points arrived in an alternating pattern. Not a particularly useful information, but it was always better to know more. </p><p>Speaking of knowing more, I had one more thing I needed to learn: how Identify worked. Previously, the only thing that I felt was a subtle whisper. I wanted to see if anything would be different now that I had the ability to perceive mana. </p><p>“Look at my level,” I declared to Maria proudly, almost smugly. </p><p>“Another upgrade, congratulations,” she responded, but I was more interested in the line of mana that stretched from her to me, tickling as it touched me … and nothing. There were no complicated mana structures that appeared whenever she cast it. Just a touch. </p><p>Then, maybe it made sense. After all, it was a skill, so it made sense it worked similarly to my Inspect perk. That didn’t require any mana either. Mana just being there to create remote contact while the skill handled the rest was an easy assumption to make. </p><p>Whether that assumption was true, I didn’t know yet, but it was how science worked. Make assumptions, design experiments, and then validate. </p><p>“Level twenty-six. Impressive,” Maria said, easily checking my level without any further mana fluctuations inside me. Still, it was good that I could detect if someone used it on me. Well, unless my assumption was correct. Then, I would need to be careful when touching anyone. “We might bring you to somewhere around thirty-five as long as we work hard.” </p><p>“Well, I’m a hard worker, not to mention I have endless stamina,” I declared proudly, mostly to play off her enthusiasm. It might have been the biggest benefit of the System. I hadn’t been a fan of exercising before the Cataclysm, so getting some external help was certainly welcome. </p><p>“You do?” she said, but I noticed a blush on her face. Maybe it was due to exhaustion. She must have been pushing herself harder than I had realized. </p><p>“C3,” I called, once again starting a chess game. Since she was getting exhausted, I better provide her with some entertainment to keep her going. </p><p>More levels meant more safety. We changed locations multiple times, moving once the monster density had decreased, but as the place was starting to get dark, I reached level thirty-two. Not exactly as high as Maria wished, but more than incredible for my purposes. </p><p>But, before leaving, I wanted to try one more thing. “Hey, do you mind letting one go without wounding it? I want to see if I can take it down unassisted. And, a little combat practice with my new abilities wouldn’t be amiss.” </p><p>“Good idea. Skills improve faster when you fight directly,” she said as she looked at the horizon. “And, we can still stay around ten minutes until it starts to get dangerous.” Then, she frowned. “I’m not ready to listen to another lecture from Eleanor.” </p><p>I chuckled, amused that she cared more about Eleanor’s words than the significantly increased danger factor from monster attacks. I had to admit, being strong had its advantages.</p><p>“Thanks,” I said. “Do you mind letting go of something strong but slow?” </p><p>“I have just the monster,” she answered as she adjusted her spells, and soon, one that looked like an animated tree stump lumbered toward me. </p><p>“Excellent choice,” I said as I moved toward it. Slow with incredible endurance, the target was truly a good choice. Especially since I had misled her about the aim of my practice a bit. While I wanted to practice, the aim was the opposite of what Maria had thought. </p><p>I had two objectives. First, I wanted to get used to holding back. Bringing any skill to even twenties was supposed to be a significant hurdle. Bringing it above fifty in less than a day was flat-out suspicious. So, I wanted to get used to sandbagging my physical prowess. And, as an added bonus, if I had to reveal it, I could mention that I had been working hard during my leveling trips. </p><p>It would make a good cover story for anyone but Eleanor. I doubted that anyone but her would go to Maria and ask for the exact time I spent working on my skill rather than leveling. </p><p>“Come on, buddy,” I said even as I circled around the beast, my hammer raised high. It lashed against me with one of its branches, but was met with a blow of my hammer. The beast was strong, but I was stronger, easily parrying the attack. “Wow, it feels good not to be thrown away,” I said. Blacksmith might not match most Warrior classes in Strength, but we weren’t too far behind them. Double stat points were still respectable. </p><p>But, Strength didn’t exactly translate to combat capability. An Olympic Weightlifter could lift more than a heavyweight boxer, but that wouldn’t have prevented them from being demolished in the ring. Skills were that important. </p><p>And, now, that was not a problem for me anymore. I swung my hammer with a perfect, eerie accuracy, parrying the next two attacks, before I reflexively took a step forward and smashed the trunk twice. Hammer of Might showed its name, demolishing the tree. </p><p>“Damn,” I muttered in frustration. I wasn’t planning to take it down that easily, but I wasn’t able to hold the skill back. The sudden improvement had affected me more than I had expected. I looked at Maria, expecting a suspicious gaze. </p><p>“Very good,” she just said instead. “All that killing really improved your skill, right?” </p><p>“Yes,” I said, more than happy to be underestimated. “How about if you let out something slightly faster?” </p><p>“One large bear, coming up,” she said cheerily as she allowed it to pass. </p><p>I chuckled at her callous attitude, like she wasn’t letting forward a beast that would have killed me easily in several blows before my little discovery with the hammer skill. I dodged and parried its attacks easily. </p><p>Multiple times, the skill pushed me to lunge forward to take down the bear. Just as the name suggested, Hammer of Might was a very aggressive style that focused on leveraging the benefits of the Strength to the max. </p><p>Luckily, thanks to controlling my Repair skills for three years, I was familiar with how to ignore the suggestions from the skills selectively. It was harder to apply during a combat scenario, but as I practiced against the bear, I was getting the hang of it. I managed to stretch it to one minute before I killed it. </p><p>However, I did receive a nasty blow while doing my best to keep back. Recovering from it took quite a bit. </p><p>[-42 Health] </p><p>“Careful,” she warned. “Do you want to stop, or…” </p><p>“Nothing more than a flesh wound,” I said, ignoring the fact that, without Health to help me recover, it would have likely killed me from internal bleeding. “We only have a few minutes. Let’s not waste too much time.” </p><p>“Good point,” she said. A few more fights, and I was having a much easier time controlling it against active targets. From here, all I had to do was to practice alone for a while, and it would give me what I needed. “I think that’s enough for the day,” I called. “It has been another amazing day. Thank you very much. You’re amazing,” I said, leaning a bit heavily on the compliments. </p><p>But, she certainly deserved it, helping me progress that much. </p><p>“My … pleasure,” she said, her voice surprisingly stilted. </p><p>She must have been really tired of stammering like that. I made a note to find an appropriate gift for her. She deserved it. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 19</p><p>For once, I was smiling even as I pulled myself to the back of the griffin despite my trembling hands. The trip had been productive enough that even my phobia couldn’t ruin my excitement. </p><p>[Mana Blacksmith - Level 32]</p><p>[Health 960/960] [Mana 0/160]</p><p>[Vitality 64 / Strength 64 / Dexterity 48 / Essence 16]</p><p>[Skills (4/10)</p><p>Mana Repair (Rare) - 25 [Inspect]</p><p>Mana Forge (Rare) - 25 [Intuitive Forging, Mana Manipulation]</p><p>Meditation (Common) - 1</p><p>Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 53]</p><p>“Do you mind if I ask you a question about a skill you have,” I asked. The moment I did, she tensed up. Understandable, as it was rather rude to ask such questions. Of course, using identification magic on people without permission was even ruder, but I wasn’t entirely surprised by her double standards. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I had dealt with the upper crust. </p><p>“Which one?” she asked, her tone deceptively calm. </p><p>“Just meditation,” I replied quickly. “That’s how every mage absorbs their mana, right?” </p><p>“Just the ones too poor to afford a better variant. Meditation kind of sucks,” she said with a haughty chuckle. I didn’t care about her unintentional insult. I much preferred that to a tense Maria who would second guess every question. “Why do you ask?” </p><p>“I was thinking of the mana alloy experiment we tried. Maybe if I know how mana behaves, I can develop some new experiments.” </p><p>“About that…” she muttered. “I will be busy for the next few days. The caravan bringing the new recruits is passing through a dangerous spot, and I have to go defend them.” </p><p>For a moment, I considered volunteering, tempted to spend some time in a location that didn’t lack mana, but that thought went as quickly as it arrived. Just because I had gotten somewhat stronger didn’t mean I should turn into a barbarian throwing myself into potential danger. </p><p>Slow and steady. </p><p>“Even better,” I said, which surprised her. And, I even saw a hint of hurt on her face. “I need some time designing new experiments and working on some theories. If I prepare enough, I can make sure I don’t bore you with repetitive stuff. Science can be somewhat monotone,” I rapidly explained. </p><p>That earned a chuckle. “Don’t worry. I don’t find your company that offensive,” she said. “I would have loved to spend more time, but with this damnable challenge —” she added, then cut herself. “Anyway, you were asking about meditation.” </p><p>“Yes. How does it work?” </p><p>“Hmm, it’s hard to describe it to someone lacking mana sensitivity. But, the easiest way to say that, the mana outside our bodies is different, reluctant to interact with us. Meditation allows us to align with the mana outside our bodies and pull it into our bodies.” </p><p>“That’s it?” I asked. “Any other use?” </p><p>“No, that’s it,” she answered. “It’s a fundamental skill, but that’s it. The rarer variants have more advantages, like selectively absorbing different types of mana and such, but at its core, it’s limited.” </p><p>“Interesting. And, are there any patterns as you pull it similar to the structure of the spells you use?” </p><p>She paused for a moment, thinking. From her attitude, I could see that she hadn’t spent a lot of time pondering about it. A waste, but I wasn’t surprised. Almost everyone was like that. Just like most people didn’t know how electricity actually worked before the Cataclysm, most people didn’t really care about the finer mechanics of skills. </p><p>A waste. </p><p>“It’s … softer,” she finally replied. “The spells usually work in hexagonal patterns at the center, surrounded by more complicated mana structures. Meditation lacks that. It’s more like a gentle spiral.” </p><p>I wanted to ask a few more questions, but I could see that her frustration was already building up. “Thanks, it helps,” I said, ignoring the temptation to ask more. “B3,” I called instead. </p><p>“Interesting start,” she said as she responded, her mood shifting in an instant. </p><p>“Well, I have to keep you on your toes. Sooner or later, I’ll win,” I replied, more than happy to distract her from her earlier failure. I knew that she didn’t like to look weak, and she was proud of her, well, Intelligence and intelligence. She would ponder on the question I asked if only to dazzle me the next time. </p><p>It would work far better than bombarding her with questions she couldn’t answer on the spot. </p><p>Even as we played chess, I could see that it was working. Many times, the mana around her stirred and started flowing to her, only to cease its flow and reverse. Unfortunately, while Essence allowed me to see the way the mana moved, it proved supremely useless to glean anything. No more than I could understand a hurricane by just looking from the outside. </p><p>The mana just gathered around her in complicated patterns before disappearing into her body. </p><p>Still, I was hopeful that, once we landed, she would have interesting insights for me. Too bad those hopes were dashed the moment we landed, and found Eleanor waiting for us. She glared at me. “We have an emergency meeting, my lady,” she said. </p><p>“Sure. Devon, do you want to join?” she asked. </p><p>“He has some emergency repairs he needs to finish,” Eleanor cut in. I was pretty certain I did not, considering the halted state of the dungeon operations, but her glare was easy to read. </p><p>“True. I need to stay ahead of the curve until the other blacksmiths join in,” I replied, not willing to antagonize Eleanor just to join their important meeting. </p><p>“Alright,” Maria said. “Have a good night,” she said, and I went back to my workshop. A lot of damaged weapons were waiting for me there. A quick count confirmed their numbers at eighty. I could easily repair them in under five hours, even lower if I pulled some new tricks thanks to my improved skills. Enough to finish everything before going to sleep despite my exhaustion, but I did not do that. </p><p>First, Eleanor was still under the impression that it took me just under ten minutes to repair a sword, so it would be suspicious if she arrived only to find the order was complete. More importantly, I had yet to test my Mana Repair and Mana Forge skills properly. </p><p>I had been too busy trying to get rid of any evidence regarding my success to test them properly. </p><p>Of course, I had used them to make a few new weapons and fix a few others, but it was mostly following the directions of the System. Certainly not something I would call a proper test, let alone experimentation. “First, let’s gather some more data,” I muttered even as I started repairing the weapons. </p><p>Previously, I wasn’t able to see mana. The Inspect skill gave me a good idea about what I had been doing, but the difference was stark. In contrast, Essence didn’t give me the ability to see the mana trapped in the metal, but I could use it alongside Inspect to change that. Previously, I was using an X-ray, and currently, I was using a combination of X-ray and MRI, giving me a lot more information than I had expected. </p><p>And, with that information, far too many tricks to fix the weapons came to mind. I wondered if I could figure out some kind of cold forging trick with mana. Without a need to continuously heat up the swords, the repair would take even less time. </p><p>Intriguing, and utterly useless for the current situation. After all, the whole reason they needed blacksmiths to repair the weapons rather than using repair spells was the lack of environmental mana. </p><p>Technically, it was not correct. I knew that repair spell took a hefty chunk of mana. I didn’t know the exact numbers, but I had seen mages at work. They had to stop and mediate after a few times. Hard to guess the exact number without knowing their levels, but I would be shocked if it cost less than a hundred mana. </p><p>Depending on how much mana I would need, technically it could still be sustainable even without environmental mana. Of course, that was just a theory. I still didn’t know exactly what a point of mana represented, how much it would take to repair a sword, the cost of mana supplements, the speed of repair… </p><p>Ultimately, however, it was nothing more than a thought exercise. Regardless of the result, I couldn’t use it here, because I wasn’t planning on revealing my rare skills. I continued to repair the swords, trying new tricks thanks to my ability to better view the structure. </p><p>A routine task, but not without its rewards. </p><p>[Mana Repair (Rare) - 25 -&gt; 26]</p><p>Seeing my class skills improve had always been a nice thing, but it turned into something truly wondrous now that I was aware of the benefits. So, I was more than happy to stretch the work to try new tricks with the hopes of gaining more points. It meant I was once again pushing myself to work instead of sleeping … but it wouldn’t be the first stretch when I neglected sleep. </p><p>Too bad it made me crave a hot cup of steaming, bitter coffee. Or several. </p><p>I ignored that desire as I worked, discovering some new tricks thanks to my enhanced vision. Some of those tricks even triggered some nice responses from my Repair skill, allowing it to improve far faster than I had expected. As midnight came, I had merely finished repairing ten swords. </p><p>But, the other benefits made it worth it. </p><p>[Mana Repair (Rare) - 26 -&gt; 34]</p><p>One of my class skills had improved significantly. Now, it was time to see if I could repeat it with my newest skill. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 20</p><p>I took a deep breath in preparation for using my Mediate skill, my gaze already turning toward the only source of mana available. </p><p>The ingots. </p><p>I knew that what I was about to do was wasteful. It was like destroying a brand new phone for its materials, so far below its value it was borderline disrespectful. I still didn’t have a good idea of how much mana each ingot contained in terms of mana points, but if I were betting, I would be betting on single digits. </p><p>Low single digits. </p><p>“Doesn’t really matter,” I muttered as I reached the first ingot, heated it up, and started to destroy it methodically. It wasn’t the first time I was trying to extract mana from the ingots, so I was familiar with the process. At first, I destroyed a tiny portion, hoping that it would be enough to trigger the skill. </p><p>It was not. The little mana I managed to generate dispersed no matter how much I tried to interact with it. I repeated the process again, doubling the size of the pieces, but I failed every time. There was not even a response from my Meditation skill. It didn’t even engage with the mana. </p><p>I focused on the remaining half. First, I heated it up more, not just turning it red, but even melting the edge. Then, I raised my hammer, took a deep breath, and demolished it as quickly as I could, turning it into a liquid potty. </p><p>Then, I closed my eyes, and engaged my new skill once more. This time, I felt momentary feedback, similar to the instructions I got when I tried to repair it. I crossed my legs and took a position, but unfortunately, those instructions disappeared before I could pull some mana. </p><p>“Close enough to show viability, but not enough to actually work,” I muttered even as I heated up another ingot. The skill required a really strict pose and flow, very different from the ease Maria had displayed while she was gathering mana, but I couldn’t compare myself to her when it came to mana manipulation. </p><p>Not when my skill was just at one point. </p><p>“Let’s try again,” I said as I positioned myself perfectly before I destroyed the ingot. The mana radiated freely, and I let the skill run, not bothering to ponder on its impact or process. I just let the skill do its job. Most of the mana still dispersed, but I didn’t care about it, not when a small part of it stuck around me, grabbed by the skill.</p><p>The mana slowly circled around me before it started to approach closer. It took more than a minute, but I was fascinated with the process. The tendrils of mana circulated around me, getting closer and closer as if they were planets orbiting the sun. </p><p>Then, they touched my skin. From there, they disappeared with a soft tingle, replaced by a notification. </p><p>[+1 Mana]</p><p>I tried to understand process. I tried to touch the reservoir of mana in me, but it failed utterly. Not a surprise. I had Health for three years, and I could barely channel it, and I needed to injure myself beforehand to trigger the flow. </p><p>“Now, let’s see if I can use it,” I said as I raised my work hammer, and used my Mana Blow perk. A glow appeared on my hammer as I felt a tingling sensation travel through my hand. </p><p>[-1 Mana]</p><p>I tried to absorb it back … but it just dispersed. All my effort had just evaporated in one blow, but I didn’t let that bother me. Ultimately, it was just another experiment. One that was more expensive than I would have liked, but an experiment nonetheless. </p><p>I destroyed another ingot, once again letting the skill catch some of the mana while the rest dispersed. This time, I paid more attention to the movement of the skill, feeling a sense of rotation inside me, similar to how I felt whenever I used to inspect. </p><p>The mana pulled toward me. It was a slow, painstaking process, too complicated to understand with just one attempt. I let the mana seep into my skin once more. </p><p>On the next attempt, I tried to interrupt halfway. It worked to give me a better understanding of the process, but the mana that was under my control had dissipated before I could absorb it. A waste, but considering I wouldn’t have been able to do anything with a few points, not exactly a big one. </p><p>I thought about using the last five ingots, but I decided against it. Every ingot represented a chance to improve my Mana Forge skill, which was more important than another ineffectual experiment. I had already understood the basics, and while I wanted to experiment more, I needed hundreds, maybe thousands more repeats. One more repeat wouldn’t help. </p><p>I just needed to decide what to do with the sole point of Mana I had. “I wonder if I can release it by reversing the meditation technique,” I said to myself. It seemed like a reasonable risk. I closed my eyes, trying to visualize the same effect, wanting to see if I could control it like my other skills. </p><p>Unfortunately, I failed to engage the skill. Helpless, I destroyed another ingot, the presence of mana allowing me to trigger the skill. I tried to replicate the same effect, but pushing the mana instead of pulling. An operation that was much harder than the summarized description would have suggested. </p><p>But, I did it —</p><p>[-1 Mana]</p><p>[Meditation (Common) - 1 -&gt; 8]</p><p>Any other time, I would be very happy to see seven points of jump in my new skill. But, right now, I had other priorities. Like, the worst pain I ever felt hitting me hard, like someone had been ripping my insides. I pushed my Health overdrive in panic, trying to fix whatever I had ruined even as I vomited blood, dazed and shivering. </p><p>The discomfort lasted for minutes while I laid on the ground, somehow managing not to shout, but it was a close call. I kept my voice suppressed, and only because I could feel that whatever damage that was done had recovered. </p><p>[-582 Health]</p><p>“Well, that was a way to improve,” I muttered as I stood up, realizing just how close I had pushed myself to death. It seemed that I had become arrogant in my recent chain of successes. It was a close call. I had lost almost two-thirds of my Health in one mistake, and that was with all my leveling up. </p><p>I didn’t even want to imagine what such a botched attempt would do to a mage. Most of them didn’t have Double Vitality to absorb the damage of accidental self-harm. And, that was only one point of mana. </p><p>Even though I had improved my skills far more than I had been expecting, I wasn’t entirely happy. The pain had been horrible, and the damage had been devastating. I stood up to go to the small attached pantry, cooking a large piece of monster steak. It would slowly recover my lost Health, but it would take a while. </p><p>So, before eating it, I took one of the emergency concentrated potions designed to replenish Health, filling it completely. Luckily, a workshop was a dangerous place with a lot of fire and sharp objects, so keeping a stock of health potions was always a smart idea. </p><p>A chain of notifications appeared, showing the slow recovery. Even with the potion, it wasn’t exactly an instantaneous process. </p><p>[+1 Health] … [+1 Health]</p><p>At the same time, I grabbed a second one, preparing myself for another attempt. Painful and risky as it might be, the ability to rapidly increase my Meditation skill was too valuable. Not only did I need to support my two skills, but I also needed to discover its secrets as fast as possible. </p><p>I wanted to see if I could improve it to a higher grade before reaching level fifty, and see if I could get a new class. The risk was acceptable, especially since this time I had brought a second potion, ready to assist. </p><p>First, I destroyed another ingot, using Meditation to absorb it. The initial pattern stayed the same. Some kind of illusory orb inside me, spinning while it captured a point of mana into its orbit, slowly dragging it close. However, the higher skill level allowed me to absorb mana faster. </p><p>[+1 Mana]</p><p>I crossed my legs, taking a deep breath to prepare myself for the torture … and reversed the flow. </p><p>[-1 Mana]</p><p>[Meditation (Common) - 8 -&gt; 11]</p><p>[Perk Options — Efficient Absorption / Controlled Flow] </p><p>As much as I would have loved to ponder on the new stats, I was too busy vomiting blood as I trembled. For ten more minutes, I lay down, trying to catch my breath as Health did its job. </p><p>[-519 Health]</p><p>“The damage wasn’t as bad,” I muttered as I forced myself to accept the pain. It was a good sign. Maybe, someday, I could repeat it without almost killing myself. </p><p>I drank the potion as I stood up. I pondered on which perk to choose, but after a while, I settled on Controlled Flow. Once again, if it turned useless, I could just use a Perk Reset stone. Then, I destroyed one last ingot, absorbing the mana. There was a slight increase in absorption speed, but not enough to be about a new perk. </p><p>Then, I used my Mana Blow perk, and noticed the gathered mana was easier to control. “Excellent,” I muttered. Control was a much better perk than faster absorption for me; both as a blacksmith and as a scientist. </p><p>And, if it made my reversal trick less suicidal, even better. </p><p>I wanted to go and sleep. Depleting my Health twice left me even more exhausted than I had ever been, and the mental load of a close call with death wasn’t any easier to swallow. Yet, before going to bed, I cleaned the forge twice, making sure I got rid of all of the evidence. </p><p>No need to ruin everything due to a bout of carelessness. </p><p>My bed looked even more inviting than I had remembered. I threw myself to its depths. The darkness claimed me before I could hit the bed. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“That’s intriguing,” I said even as I approached to the cave that supposedly led to the ruins, surprised by the lack of savage beast attacks even as I isolated the whole mountain. Previously, even the smallest disturbance of the ruins had triggered their reaction. Right now, there was nothing. </p><p>It wasn’t just the lack of existence, as I could sense the hints of essence, one that reminded me of the Snow and Volcano essences Elsana and Lannayin had mastered. It meant I was at the right location. </p><p>“It means the mist doesn’t actively protect anything but Everdawn Essence,” I guessed even as I approached the small cave that led to the sect. </p><p>And, I found myself at a large cave, which was filled with the remains of many buildings, but they were long decayed and lost any discernible quality. The only thing that was still intact was a drawing on the far wall, which carried a hint of essence. </p><p>I ignored the drawing for the moment and instead focused on the ruins. They had been destroyed due to the passage of time, but most of those ruined buildings still show human-inflicted damage. Maybe Elsana and Lannayin were responsible for the damage. Or, maybe, someone else had done it. Either way, even after I searched with the assistance of formations, I failed to find anything. </p><p>However, even without finding anything, I was able to make some deductions based on the size of the enclave, and the way it was designed. It was almost certainly a hidden auxiliary base, and if I were to guess, I would say that a martial sect had been established during the battle between the Everdawn Empire and the rebellious sects. </p><p>Whether they were a part of the rebellion and were trying to save their heritage in case of a defeat, or they were a small sect trying to get away, I could hardly guess. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the giant drawing. </p><p>I didn’t approach it directly but cleaned it by using formations. It was an interesting drawing, showing the stylized conception of a snow-covered active volcano. From that drawing, I could sense a hint of essence, one that seemed to be shifting between two concepts freely.</p><p>I carefully examined the essence, and compared it with what I had seen from Lannayin and Elsana. To my surprise, the essence at the door was different from the Snow and Volcano essences I had learned from the two. </p><p>Similar, but certainly not the same. I couldn’t help but remember my own Forest Dance martial art, which I had enhanced based on the concept of growth I had learned from the Spring Palace while I was trying to impress Aisnam. </p><p>It was merely a few months ago, but it felt like years had passed. </p><p>“Focus,” I admonished myself as I continued to examine the essence from a distance, using an unnecessary number of formations as a protective layer to carefully probe the drawing. </p><p>Its existence alone was an interesting phenomenon. The mist hadn’t damaged the drawing, but it didn’t support and enhance it like it was doing the Everdawn essence. That neutrality surprised me, particularly since when I had first arrived at the mountains, I had tried to use both Volcano and Snow essences when I had first visited the misty mountains.</p><p>Mist had suppressed both essences, but the one on the drawing continued to exist. If I had been less experienced when it came to martial arts, I would have explored whether the balanced mixture of the two essences could push away the effect of the mist. </p><p>But now, I knew that it was something simpler. Just like I had used the conception of the Spring for the Forest dance — or the conception of the savage rabbit for the sprinting martial arts — they had used the conception from the drawing to develop their own martial arts.</p><p>And, such a similarity was not a coincidence. The development of new techniques and styles was not an accident. While the others didn’t have the System to help them improve their skills quickly, it didn’t mean that they received no help.</p><p>Every time a skill had reached Perfection, it was accompanied by the Dao glow. Improvements after Perfection created even more commotion than a mere glow as my experiences had shown — such as the mysterious gate that still stayed at the heart of my base. </p><p>And, since there was such feedback for later breakthroughs, it was not impossible for the earlier breakthroughs to have a similar, but weaker mechanism. </p><p>I hadn’t noticed something like that, but to my defense, it was hard to notice a few random insights among the flood of comprehension given to me by the System return. </p><p>It was a reasonable theory, one that explained how the techniques I had managed to invent could attain a spiritual pillar. However, it raised many more questions. </p><p>Like why the mist attacked the martial arts that was created with the assistance of the providence. </p><p>Suddenly, I was far more glad that I had gone through all that trouble to get a Foundation Establishment pill recipe. Kartpa Alchemy technique was still my only tool to understand providence and Dao, meaning pushing it above Perfection had suddenly turned even more critical. </p><p>I needed a deeper understanding of Providence. </p><p>Meanwhile, I started examining the drawing and everything around it even more carefully. Soon, I noticed one of the stones behind it was radiating a certain kind of energy, one that was integrated with a subtle essence-based trap that would destroy its contents. </p><p>Unraveling it had been easy. All I needed was to create a facsimile of the same essence that had been displayed in the drawing. I had a feeling that the intent was to make someone practice the technique until they could generate a pure essence, but I bypassed it by faking it through formations. </p><p>I didn’t want to go through the trouble of cleansing my body again. </p><p>That was enough to trick the mysterious mechanism, and soon, I was holding a book, each page etched into gold. A good material, which resisted the ravages of time, but could easily be destroyed by even a hint of flame. </p><p>I was glad that I had gone all that trouble to learn the old language of the Everdawn Empire, as it allowed me to read the document. The first page alone was incredibly interesting. </p><p>’To the fated person who had discovered the last remains of the Order of Burning Blizzard, </p><p>You who had found this ancient scroll, I greet you from beyond the veil. You have displayed the true balance of fire and ice, and deserve to carry the legacy of our martial fire. Our bodies had long turned to dust, but our souls were still weeping with the pain of betrayal. </p><p>We have fought hard for our future, but ultimately, we failed. We have risen to save our world from the merciless dominion of a crazed Emperor, only to fall when the outsiders stabbed us in the back. However, don’t try to take revenge. </p><p>Not before you can find the true treasure of our sect, and elevate the soul of our sect to the next level. Study our heritage and understand the true balance between ice and fire, and it’ll illuminate your path to discover the slumbering martial soul of our sect.</p><p>Embrace the duality of its existence, and follow your heart, </p><p>May your journey be filled with both triumph and adversity. May you honor the legacy of the Order of the Burning Blizzard.’ </p><p>“Well, that’s annoying,” I growled in frustration even as I finished reading the first page. Fucking cultivators — Qi or Martial — and their desire to be enigmatic. Why couldn’t they just write it openly? Their desire to be enigmatic meant that I learned very little from that letter. </p><p>It didn’t help that my command of their language was not perfect, so I was basically guessing half of the words. The general gist was accurate, but the nuances were lost. For example, I had no idea what they meant by the world. Were they referring to the whole world or just a figurative way to refer to their country? Who were the outsiders? When they referred to slumbering martial soul, were they talking about something real, or was it just a fancy way of saying their heritage. </p><p>Worse, whoever wrote the first page was not a calligraphy expert. Oh, he certainly thought himself as one, but he was a hack. As a consequence, the meaning behind his words didn’t linger enough to give me any clue. </p><p>Still, even though it was frustrating, it didn’t change one very important fact. </p><p>I finally had an intact martial technique in hand. I had no intention of cultivating it directly, but I didn’t need to. I just needed to learn and study it to design one of my own.</p><p>I didn’t start reading it immediately but returned to Zaim Kingdom. </p><p>I was going to have to do a lot of experiments with the System, and what better location than where I could mobilize thousands of martial artists with one word. </p><p>I didn’t forget why I was going all this trouble or searching for a new martial art. </p><p>Martial arts that the System didn’t register, allowing me to improve my power without sacrificing the System multiplier. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I did the right thing by not trying to purchase it myself,” I muttered even as I examined the pavilion from a distance … from a great deal of distance, examining the formations around it. </p><p>When I had first visited to exchange for Aisnam’s pill, I wasn’t able to understand the true value of the protection. But, now that my formation had increased significantly, I could see more. And, what I could see scared me. </p><p>It wasn’t that the formation itself was complicated. It was merely a straightforward defensive formation, complicated but standard. However, the way it melded to the pavilion directly rather than working as an overlay was scary. </p><p>In many ways, it was more like the flying boat I used everywhere than just a building protected by formations. I wasn’t an expert on the artifact aspects, but the formations were different. I could understand the details much more. </p><p>And, they scared me. The formation design was ingenious, but it had also been simplified expertly. It was subtle, and if it wasn’t for my incredible formation skill, I might have dismissed its elegance. The formation had been designed by a true genius, and it had been simplified to make sure the lesser cultivators could apply. </p><p>That detail alone was to further enhance the danger level the place represented, which was why I decided to arrange my current plan. </p><p>I had created a fake ruin near the edge, brought the many Everdawn artifacts I had collected, and let a solitary peak Qi Gathering cultivator discover it, betting that he would use it to purchase Foundation Establishment pills. </p><p>It was why I was near the market as well. I was watching him from a distance, watching as one from that group had just left the Treasure Pavilion, trying to look ordinary. However, his caution wasn’t enough to conceal him from others, as four others started to follow him secretly. </p><p>His caution was understandable. The supposed peace of the market wasn’t enough to protect me when I sold the talismans, and at that time, the reward was nowhere near as valuable as a Foundation Establishment Pill. </p><p>He soon realized that he was being followed, and started dashing toward the misty mountains, clearly wanting to use the mist to ditch his enemies. The other four followed. I stayed near, just to make sure that they wouldn’t destroy the pill in their chase. </p><p>I could have taken them down, maybe even destroyed their cultivation … but, why should I. They were not my enemy. The opposite. </p><p>“It’s time to create another mystic land,” I decided even as I started creating a formation right in the mist, and activated it when they entered it. They fell down, unconscious, and then destroyed the land around to give the impression of a desperate battle. If anyone wanted to check, it would look like a desperate battle that had gone out of control. </p><p>I brought them to Markas, but created a different prison for them, one that kept them unconscious for the moment. I planned to create another mystic land for them, but before I made that commitment, I wanted to decide on what to learn from them. </p><p>Artifact forging was a tempting idea, but I didn’t have a technique for it. Maybe once I find the necessary technique. </p><p>I didn’t feel any guilt for kidnapping them. I could always give them an option to leave once they woke up, but I had a feeling that they would not. Especially if I could offer them Foundation Establishment Pills in the process. </p><p>“Now, let’s examine you,” I said to the pill in the box. I unwrapped it, and started to probe it carefully through my formation. It was a Foundation Establishment Pill, but its quality left a lot to be desired. It was merely a Profound Medium Grade. </p><p>Admittedly, a part of it was me acting spoiled. For any other cultivator, Profound Medium Grade was already an amazing treasure, especially since it was a rare pill like the Foundation Establishment pill. </p><p>I carefully examined its structure, trying to deduce its recipe. It wasn’t exactly a simple process. Since it was a Foundation Establishment level pill, my Umnim technique was almost completely useless, leaving only the Kartpa Alchemy Technique. </p><p>It shouldn’t have been enough as well, not merely at Major Familiarity, but luckily, I could cheat. My knowledge didn’t just cover Foundation Establishment, but also Golden Core and Nascent Soul. I might not be able to practice those stages due to a lack of cultivation, but the knowledge was still there. </p><p>After a few experiments, I was able to come up with a decent recipe. I didn’t have all the materials, and I had no doubt I would fail many times if I tried to refine it, but it didn’t matter. </p><p>I added the recipe as a bonus task through the interface I created for her, promising a Foundation Establishment Pill as a reward, the final quality dependent on her speed of success. It was an extreme reward, so it wasn’t shocking that she stopped doing anything to study the recipe. </p><p>With that task in hand, I decided to leave her alone until she completed the task. However, since I was back in Markas, I wanted to do something else than just take care of the plants and replenish my seed reserves. Two tasks were of premier importance. </p><p>First, I used it to visit the fake mystic land I had created to distract the sect cultivators, using the tunnel I had created to approach closer. </p><p>I didn’t just reinforce the formations, but also added several pills and talismans to it. The rewards themselves weren’t enough to tempt the sects, but they were impressive enough for Qi Gathering cultivators, even sect ones. </p><p>I didn’t want anyone to get impatient and demolish it. Luckily, while cultivators had many unappealing qualities, impatience was not one of them. Or, even if they were impatient, the way they perceived time was different after spending most of their lives meditating. </p><p>At the same time, I created another beautiful, convincing mystic land for the imprisoned cultivators, and even created a library of basic techniques for them, covering every topic, from music to artifact forging. However, it was exclusively auxiliary techniques. There was no combat or cultivation technique there. </p><p>I needed to improve the breadth of my abilities more than adding yet another technique I could use to defeat people in direct combat. </p><p>The design of the new fake mystic land was interesting. I had created a set of floating cells, which would keep each cultivator imprisoned safely even as they cultivated. Meanwhile, cultivators could turn the center wall opaque or transparent as they wished, but only when it was transparent, they could read the techniques at the center. </p><p>The design allowed me to appear or stay hidden as I wished. I had two aims for it. First, I wanted to create a nice spot for my prisoner to break through to the Foundation Establishment, a process that would be recorded by my cultivation, so I could see if there was anything I needed to do to protect Janassa. </p><p>Second, I wanted a group of people who would work hard to improve their abilities, yet I could interact without being too suspicious. </p><p>All I needed to was to mix while disguising myself as another prisoner. </p><p>As one last touch, I added a poem. </p><p>‘Sword's might, false gold; art's grace, eternal in the world. Conflict buns, creation stays; paint remains where blood boils.’</p><p>And, I made sure to embed a sense of peaceful development in every brush stroke, pushing my calligraphy to the limit. I pushed myself because it was the only way I could convince a bunch of itinerant cultivators who spent their lives robbing and killing to study seriously. </p><p>I left them alone to wake up. </p><p>Everything was ready. All I needed was to return to the misty mountains and search. Too bad that I had no clue about the location of an old martial sect — </p><p>“Damn it,” I muttered even as I slapped my head. I remembered that I actually had a clue. One that I learned almost at the same time of my arrival. </p><p>Elsana and Lannayin. More accurately, the mysterious place where they had discovered their unique martial arts. They were yet to return, but I still had someone I could question. Marana. </p><p>Unfortunately, the questions were too sensitive to ask directly, so instead, I sneaked into the city, and questioned her under the hypnosis — the combination of alchemy and formations made it a very good truth serum, particularly when targeted to a martial artist.</p><p>It was a mean thing to do, but what I was doing was too sensitive to be revealed. I liked Marana, but not enough to take any chances with such a dangerous question. </p><p>From her, I listened to the story of how Marana had saved the two. And, more importantly, where. </p><p>With her explanation to limit the search area, it merely took a few hours for me to find the sect in question, which was on the outskirts of the misty mountains and could be easily walked. However, it was hidden in a mountain, which kept it a secret. </p><p>I prepared several defensive formations to make sure the inevitable stampede would stay hidden.</p><p>But, to my surprise, when I created the formation, there had been no stampede, as if the mist didn’t even register the presence of the ruins as important. </p><p>Interesting. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“… And, another checkpoint complete,” I muttered even as I put the finishing touches on another formation, about to fill with more plants letting out constant Qi that could refill my boat. Since I needed them to accumulate Qi, I decided to add ten of them in a row before I started expanding them horizontally. </p><p>It was a long, tedious work, even with the formations, one that took a month. It was long, backbreaking work, and even with my formation, alchemy, and spiritual plant tending to work in tandem, I didn’t come anywhere near matching the output of a spirit vein. </p><p>No wonder cultivators didn’t bother to grow endless plants and forests made of spirit plants. Killing each other to take over spirit veins was far more efficient. </p><p>Unfortunately, even as I spent a month exploring the misty mountains, I wasn’t able to find a lot. I had learned more about the Everdawn Empire, added details to the map I had in my possession, and discovered several fragmented martial arts manuals that were based on Everdawn intent that could be used as reference material, but that was it. </p><p>Of all the gains, the increasing command of their language had been the biggest. </p><p>I had a feeling that to find something more useful, I needed to go deeper. However, my priority wasn’t to discover a higher grade Everdawn style, but material from the intact sects. I had already been reluctant to use the Everdawn Essence considering how I had first received the Everdawn Saber, but then I had discovered the truth behind the stone gate. </p><p>Everdawn Essence was tangled with the concept of the province too much for me to dare to tangle it even if it wasn’t somehow linked with the mist and and the ongoing conspiracy. </p><p>Three excellent reasons not to use it directly. Still, it was valuable as a reference material, particularly the way it focused on the purity of the Essence. The other martial arts did not, including the Black Tiger Onslaught I had received as an improved reward. They relied on practice and strength, while the essence grew and purified on its own. </p><p>That difference was why I was searching for the rebellious sects. I need to see if their style was closer to the Everdawn Empire, or the modern martial arts. </p><p>Unfortunately, discovering an intact sect wasn’t as easy. I had discovered a few locations based on the historical documents, but considering I found those locations in reference to the glorious victories of the Empire, destroyed even before the mist had descended, the lack of useful material was not a surprise. </p><p>When it came to discovering the direction of an intact sect, it was not simple. Considering they were in hiding even before the mysterious destruction of the Empire, it would probably take months. I didn’t even have a clue about their fate. Whether they had been destroyed, or they had simply joined with the Qi cultivators and turned into martial arts school, I couldn’t even make a guess. </p><p>I might need to build some kind of giant formation to search, but Qi spending was a problem. Such a formation would have to stretch for a long distance, which was difficult even if I didn’t have to add a lot of auxiliary features to keep it reasonably hidden. </p><p>It would have strained the capacity of the spirit vein, let alone the gardens. Unfortunately, transferring or channeling all that Qi was also a challenge. </p><p>It was another reason I wanted to create all those safe houses. I wanted to collect enough Qi to use searching formations on a local scale. </p><p>Luckily, not everything going as badly as my fruitless search. The conspiracy was growing slower than I expected, with them focusing on raising their new recruits to the second realm. However, it was a slow process. None of the recruits had managed to break through the limits and reach the Connate realm, and they had consumed multiple martial aptitude pills — mostly Profound Grade, with a few Yellow Grade mixed in for the best performers. </p><p>It was a valuable detail. The conspiracy was one of Kartpa Valley — unless it was a giant false flag operation — and I was very aware of the potency of their Alchemy technique. Even if Heaven and Earth Grade pills were not easy, mass producing Black Grade pills should be achievable. </p><p>The fact that they could not suggest that either the conspiracy wasn’t an important activity to assign resources, or whoever arranging it couldn’t afford to mobilize the true extent of their resources. </p><p>Either way, it was better than trying to face one of the four overlords directly. </p><p>Speaking of Alchemy, I had managed to make some progress with the Kartpa Alchemy Technique, finally bringing it to Major Familiarity. A part of it was Janassa’s rapidly improving cultivation. Her understanding of her gate transformation technique was solid enough, and the limitless Qi I provided to her allowed her to reach the Ninth Stage, and comfortably focus on the next stage. </p><p>In comparison, even with the notes she was redeeming from the ‘mystic land’ the improvement in her alchemy technique was slow. </p><p>Well, slow from my perspective. Since people considered reaching to Beginner Stage a great achievement, any improvement in less than a month was a great achievement. Since increasing her capabilities in such a short term was not an option, I decided to focus on the easier path.</p><p>Helping her reach the Foundation Establishment. </p><p>The higher her cultivation, the higher my multipliers would be, and her comprehension increasing would be a bonus. Together, I should be able to improve the technique to Perfection without wasting years. </p><p>It was not just my impatience that drew me to act. I didn’t have years, not with the conspiracy in progress, putting a timeline to my activities. I certainly had weeks, and probably still had months. </p><p>But I didn’t have years. </p><p>And, I had a huge advantage. Janassa’s cultivation technique included a method to establish her foundation, which meant I didn’t need to spend months to help her learn one. It was good, as finding the necessary techniques had proved challenging. </p><p>I failed to find any in the cultivator market. Even getting one from my prisoner didn’t work. Unlike his sword technique, he seemed determined not to blab about his foundation, even as a casual insult. His attitude showed that internal cultivation was treated as a true secret, while external techniques were only strategically critical. </p><p>That led me to wonder just how depressed Aisnam was when I first met with her for her to share the secrets of her gate transformation technique. Or maybe, it was just negligence, assuming that a martial artist could never understand the true depths. </p><p>Of course, if I didn’t have more urgent tasks, I could have probably discovered the necessary technique and arranged for someone to teach me. With the System, there were many methods. But, since Janassa had her technique, it wasn’t critical. </p><p>The critical part was to find the recipe for the Foundation Establishment Pill, which proved to be very elusive. </p><p>It was not a surprise. From what I had seen, sects controlled the smaller cultivation families through two methods: occupying Qi-rich locations and limiting the number of Foundation Establishment pills on the market. For cultivation families, Foundation Establishment was the peak, while sect cultivators clearly treated that as a point of entry. </p><p>The easiest way to achieve that was to limit the number of Foundation Establishment Pills on the market and make sure that they created a monopoly so that they could ‘reward’ the loyalty of their followers. </p><p>It was still more inefficient than just taking over their territory, which seemed silly at face value, but the more I understood providence thanks to the Kartpa Alchemy Technique, the more I realized there was a deeper intention. </p><p>When cultivators said they didn’t want to be tainted by karma, they were being serious. </p><p>However, their indirect method of control meant that finding even a fragmented recipe on the market was impossible. Apparently, when sects banned something, they took its eradication seriously. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t actually need a recipe. I had the ability to reverse engineer a pill thanks to the Kartpa technique. It should be more than doable. Then, all I needed was to launder the recipe through Janassa to get the improved version, and I could refine as many pills as I needed. </p><p>Of course, I couldn’t just sell them. The sects would hunt me down at the mere suggestion. </p><p>Not that it mattered. One thing I didn’t lack was things to sell. It was finding the market I could sell without being killed was the challenge. </p><p>Speaking of it, I had three options to get the pill. I could try to find and rob the cultivation families. I might try to sneak into my fake mystic land, which had several sect cultivators still exploring. Or, I could purchase one from the Treasure Pavilion. </p><p>The first was out because I didn’t even know where I could find the cultivation families. Finding their secret bases would be challenging, and discovering their treasury would be even more difficult. And, even then, there was no guarantee that they would have one. </p><p>At face value, trying to get one through the sect disciples at the mystic lands was doable. It was safer than going myself and buying one from the Treasure Pavilion. At first, I had just assumed the Treasure Pavilion was an opportunistic seller. But, the more I learned about the cultivation world, the more intimidating it became. </p><p>Why they were only purchasing the remains of the Everdawn Empire. And, why the sects allowed it to operate even when it sold items like Foundation Establishment Pills?</p><p>No, if the choice was between trying to trick a few spoiled sect disciples and potentially entering the radar of a mysterious organization by bringing them a lot of treasure they had been searching for, I would have chosen the former without blinking. </p><p>Luckily, that wasn’t my only option. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I let my mind wander even as I moved with the group, walking toward the dungeon, easily matching their pace even as I walked on foot. </p><p>High Vitality meant that running while wearing thick armor barely counted as exercise. </p><p>Using Nurture had reminded me of the plight of the Farmers, which had distracted me. There’s not much I could do for them now, but that wasn’t true for the future. I just needed to experiment more. All I needed was to find a way to upgrade their Nurture skill like I had upgraded my Forge and Repair skills. </p><p>Well, that, and find a way to teach people without getting myself killed in the process. People in charge loved small, incremental developments they could control, but they didn’t like systemic changes.</p><p>At all. </p><p>It was why I revealed my improvement of sword skill easily even though it was exceptional, while keeping Mana Forge desperately hidden. Nothing would change even if all Blacksmiths turned into excellent warriors. At most, we would match a common warrior, operating under the same restrictions. </p><p>Mana Forging already had the potential to reshape the current economic landscape, but I couldn’t imagine what would happen if all Farmers suddenly had better classes. </p><p>While I was not a historian, as a sociologist, I had studied many social shifts in history, enough to know that people didn’t really like it when people upset the apple cart. And, while I didn’t fashion myself a Revolutionary desperate to reshape the world to my vision, I also wasn’t stupid enough to miss how others would see me. </p><p>And, people with such radical ideas didn’t exactly end up well off. They either died in a variety of unpleasant ways, or fought with the society until they won, and ended up in charge. The former was obviously what would happen, but the latter didn’t sound any better. </p><p>It was impossible, of course, but even if it did happen, it was a horrible choice. Despite everything, I was a scientist. There was nothing more satisfying than understanding how the world truly worked. While at first, I hated the System for ruining that, I was slowly coming around. </p><p>It was just another mystery to solve. One that conveniently came with its own toolkit. </p><p>“So, a new guild,” one of the guards asked, distracting me from my thoughts. “I thought you were a guild representative. What changed?” </p><p>The guards must have been gossiping. Understandable, as a new guild, one that had been escorted by Eleanor was notable. We didn’t try to hide it, as we decided that an old friend of Eleanor from a dungeon was a good, uncomplicated story most people would buy. </p><p>Unfortunately, that came with a lot of gossip. No one gossiped like patrolling soldiers. </p><p>“I was, but after seeing the dungeon, I realized that it was a good opportunity to make some money, especially since it’s ruled by an old friend. I had some money saved up, which was enough to pay the penalty and still rent a nice piece of land.” </p><p>“You’re a more daring man than I am,” the guard responded. </p><p>“No risk, no gain,” I replied. For the rest of the way, I chatted with the guards. Well, they chatted while I listened. While none of the topics they had been talking about actually interested me, as long as I looked vaguely interested, most people were happy to carry the small talk. </p><p>Another trick I had learned during my decade as a professor. No workplace was free of intrigue, but the academy was particularly egregious on that aspect. Inevitable with a bunch of overachievers fighting for very limited budget and acclaim. </p><p>Trying to keep your head down and focus on your research never worked. Maintaining a friendly distance with the custodial staff paid well for me, since most of my coworkers were more than happy to treat them as invisible. </p><p>Having a few casual acquaintances among the guards would only cost me a few free drinks. </p><p>We continued to chat even as we passed through the dungeon gate, and arrived at the encampment inside the dungeon. “Are you sure you want to go alone?” one of the guards asked even as I moved inside. “It’ll be easier with someone to distract them and get the shell. They won’t take it if there’s even the slightest crack.” </p><p>I shrugged. “Not exactly a problem. I don’t care about a few silvers. I just want to explore the floor and select which part of the dungeon is the best place to set up an operation once I start hiring,” I said. </p><p>“Good point,” he said, laughing a bit excessively to look friendly. Jokes of rich people always landed better for some reason. </p><p>Acting like I had no financial difficulty was another calculated choice. I didn’t have a lot of money — forty five golds sounded like an incredible amount, but it wouldn’t last long once the guild started operating. </p><p>But, having a reputation for being rich was a good way to stay under the radar once I started buying some weird skills. </p><p>I still picked a cart to bring with me, the biggest one available. “Wow, that’s an ambitious choice,” the guard called. “Someone is having mixed feelings about not needing money.” </p><p>Of course I needed money. And, I would have loved to fill the largest cart available with a thousand shells, which would have given me a nice payday of forty golds. Without the need for repair, it would have been an excellent investment. </p><p>But, there were two problems with it. First, I couldn’t explain why I didn’t need to repair my sword. While I could rent them — there were already a small pile of familiar swords in the corner, which people could change for pristine ones for a price — it would cut into the profit.</p><p>It wasn’t Eleanor’s fault. I was familiar with the process, I knew that they were already running it near the cost. I had discovered many ways to make the process faster, but that only solved the urgency aspect. Ultimately, it still consumed the same amount of mana alloy, which was more than ninety percent of the cost. </p><p>And, while I could repair the swords myself, bringing a thousand shells without exchanging swords would have been noticeable. </p><p>Of course, that wasn’t the only reason. The real reason was that I couldn’t kill a thousand monsters on my own. Not without damaging the shell. </p><p>Unfortunately, I still needed the cart. More exactly, I needed the material of the cart. It was a mixture of iron and wood, both the cheapest alloys. For me, they represented far more than what they were valued on the market. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I said. “I plan on getting some samples from the environment. Broken rocks, soil samples, things like that. You never know what can be discovered in a dungeon.” </p><p>“Be careful. You know how the beast could be when we start damaging the dungeon too much,” he said. </p><p>“Thanks,” I said, happy with the warning. Because, I didn’t know how they could be. “By the way, how much do we need to pay if the monsters destroy the cart?” </p><p>“Five silvers,” he warned. My eyes widened, but he misread the reason. “I know, it’s a rip-off. They cost something like eight coppers. But that’s how the dungeons work. Everything is a ripoff.” </p><p>He was true about overcharging, but I didn’t care about it. For me, it represented the easiest way I could get some metal for the forge I was planning to build. While I had the most fundamental tools, I still needed an anvil to experiment properly. A proper fire pit would help as well. </p><p>Dragging a cart or two with significant damage that coincidentally broke off their most metallic parts was easier to explain. </p><p>“True, but that's life,” I said. “Maybe one day we can get strong enough to monopolize a dungeon.” </p><p>“That’s the dream, but it’s impossible without accessing a good dungeon to level up first,” the guard replied. “That, or trying to level up in the wilderness like a crazy person.” </p><p>“A wise assessment,” I said as I turned my back and left. He had a point about the wilderness. Unless escorted by someone like Maria, trying to level up in the wilderness was a very dangerous affair. </p><p>As I left the small fort, I moved deeper. A monster attacked while I was still in the range of others. I could have pulled my hammer and killed it in one blow, or at least, I could have disoriented it with my shield. </p><p>However, I did neither. Instead, I moved around the beast, relying on the sword attacks to keep it distracted before I picked a moment to stab it through its mouth. </p><p>Having a reputation as primarily a sword user was another part of my new identity. One that was probably even more important than anything else. Connecting an expert swordsman to a poor blacksmith was even more difficult. </p><p>That’s why I took it down, but when I ripped the shell with my bare hands, I saw a lot of people wince. It was a good display, but it still damaged the shell enough to make it useless. </p><p>“What a waste,” I heard one of the hunters murmur. </p><p>“Rich people, man. They are all the same,” the other replied, though his whisper wasn’t as weak as they first thought. </p><p>I smiled as I walked away, feeling confident that my new identity would hold. Still, even as I moved, I made sure to stop multiple times in the view of the others, getting soil samples, broken rocks, even dried plants, wanting to sell my commitment to understanding the dungeon even more. </p><p>That way, they wouldn’t question when I returned midday to replace a damaged cart. </p><p>With that, I pulled the cart deeper and deeper, until I arrived at a concealed spot that was not near any of the five gates that led to the second floor. I didn’t want anyone to start wondering where I was. Then, I damaged the cart and ripped more than half of its metal, spending some time reforging the edges to make it look like it was destroyed by a monster attack. </p><p>Then, I walked toward the gate farthest away from the entrance. Eleanor’s map helped me immensely. Too bad she didn’t give a map for the second floor as well. It would have made moving around without risking myself far easier. </p><p>With that done, I cut a direct path toward the second floor, the immediate surrounding of the gate empty. </p><p>I switched to my hammer, and stepped through the gate. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“This is your new house,” Eleanor said. “You have until the return of the caravan to make it a livable place and move here permanently.” </p><p>“Beautiful place, very airy,” I said teasingly. Not an unfair comment, considering I was standing in front of an empty stretch surrounded by a thin wooden rail. I needed to build a building from scratch. I deemed two of my new home’s details to be the most important. </p><p>The first thing was the location. It was outside the walls. However, it was neither a slight nor a revenge attempt. At a distance, I could see a secondary wall building. Apparently, once the caravans arrived, they wanted to push anyone that wasn’t directly employed by them to an outer town, which was a common practice. </p><p>Reasonable as well. While mana dead locations were not as valuable, a large dungeon was still enough to vitalize the place, especially since the loot could be sold directly for silver. There was less potential, but also less danger. I was sure there would be people who would appreciate the opportunity. </p><p>The second, even more shocking thing was the size of the compound that had been given to me. It was larger than I had expected. A large rectangle, almost ten thousand square-feet. </p><p>“You have my trust that you can make a nice place,” she said. “I already asked workers to build a small wooden cottage with a stone cellar in addition to a wall around the compound. The rest is up to you.” </p><p>Another benefit of impressing her with my sword skills, I guessed. “Sure, as long as you keep the fact that I’m a blacksmith a secret. I don’t want to lose my head to another assassin,” I said. </p><p>“Sure, we can say that you’re a Fighter. You certainly fight well enough to be one,” she said. “Since it’s our town, no one would check it. Still, just in case, don’t walk around too much until we have other blacksmiths with your quick repair trick.” </p><p>“Yes. And, as long as I wear a helmet while teaching, everything will be fine,” I said. Maybe it was excessive, but one assassination attempt had done wonders to make me a more paranoid man. Luckily, the conditions of the attempt had been rare enough that it shouldn’t be replicated even if my fake death had been discovered. </p><p>They couldn’t simply send another combatant as capable as Eleanor immediately, and anyone weaker would be relying on an invisibility trick, unaware that I could see them. </p><p>No one would expect me to have Essence stat. </p><p>With that done, we returned to the part of the town that wasn’t under construction. “Are you going to go to the dungeon tomorrow as well?” she asked. </p><p>“I plan to,” I replied. </p><p>“Make sure to rest well, then. Dungeon visits can be surprisingly exhausting.” </p><p>“Fair point,” I said, but once I arrived at my temporary residence, I headed straight to the forge. </p><p>Once I had returned from the dungeon, I immediately started working. I had three immediate objectives, sorted from the most exciting to least. Playing around with Nurture, practicing Meditation, and forging myself two new sets of tools. </p><p>I started with the least exciting option. Forging two sets of new tools. The bigger set was for my own forge, made of iron alloys. Not many blacksmiths could make them, but some could. Most blacksmiths had to make do with such equipment, unable to afford anything better.</p><p>Of course, I had plans of making something more impressive, made of mana alloys, but if I did that right now, Eleanor would rightfully assume that I had used her stock — which was better than the truth. I still needed to build a proper fire pit and some other stuff. </p><p>But, an anvil, and hammers of varying sizes, and metal tongs were critical. </p><p>Still, I had four days to forge them. I did not finish them as soon as possible, because they were here as a cover for the second, more portable set. One to be hidden in the dungeon. </p><p>Eleanor already suspected that I had made progress with anti-corrosion material, and she might actually decide to check my things, even after I moved to my new residence. </p><p>My solution was simple: Just build a forge on the second floor of the dungeon. </p><p>Her explanation was clear, no one would be there, and as long as I picked a nice concealed spot, no one would really discover it. It wouldn’t be a complicated, fancy forge, but I don’t need anything complicated. I could simply use mana to bypass some of the requirements. </p><p>Once that was done, I moved to the next topic: meditation. </p><p>During my dungeon trip, the thing that slowed me down the most was my Mana reserve. Draining  Mana from monsters had been the slowest part of the process. It had been bad enough while fighting, and it would slow me even more once I started to forge mana alloys. </p><p>It would be even more important once I got a skill for magic. But, I wanted to start practicing with a fire spell. That way, even if it turned useless in every other way, I could still use it for smithing. </p><p>“Now, let’s start,” I muttered even as I smashed the first shell, absorbing it greedily. </p><p>[+2 Mana]</p><p>Then, I reversed the flow, pushing it out. </p><p>[-2 Mana]</p><p>“Not bad. Let’s try to increase the intensity,” I muttered to myself, curious if I could trigger the growth by using more. However, I didn’t dare to. I still remembered how much damage one mana could cause. I didn’t want to lose control and end up dead. </p><p>Instead, I repeated the same trick again and again, going through all the shells. Luckily, it was not a waste, as the broken pieces could be eventually used for anti-corrosion alloy.</p><p>Twenty minutes and almost three hundred points of Mana later, another notification appeared. </p><p>[Meditation (Common) 42 -&gt; 43]</p><p>“Excellent,” I said, and continued practicing, ignoring the temptation to pull and release more mana. As long as I could bring Meditation to the next threshold before morning, it was enough. I wanted to have Efficient Absorption at a minimum. </p><p>It was already dawn when I finally reached my target. </p><p>[Meditation (Common) 49 -&gt; 50]</p><p>[Perk Options — Efficient Absorption / Augmented Flow / Purification] </p><p>“Thank god that Perk Reset stones exist,” I said even as I looked at the unexpected third entry. After spending all night trying to absorb mana from monsters, I was almost entirely sure that Purification referred to the act of isolating that excess energy from monster mana. </p><p>I picked that. </p><p>“Jackpot,” I muttered after I broke another shell. Previously, draining the mana from a destroyed alloy was almost four times faster than draining it from the broken shell. Draining from monsters was still slower, but this time, it was a far more reasonable difference. About twenty percent, I guessed. A more accurate assessment required several experiments. </p><p>“Too bad I have very little time left to test my new skill,” I muttered. I only had half an hour before the first group left the town for the dungeon, and I wanted to join them. While understanding how Nurture worked was important, it wasn’t as important as trying to set up a second forge in the depths of the dungeon. </p><p>An idea that had only appeared in my mind because monsters didn’t attack abandoned objects as long as they didn’t block their path, as proven by the cart I brought not getting damaged. </p><p>“Later,” I decided even as I looked at three objects that were in front of me. A seed, a broken branch, and a small herb from the dungeon I brought along, each in a separate pot. </p><p>First, I put my hand on the broken branch, and started feeding it with Nurture. As my Health started to slowly disappear, the leaves of the broken branch began regaining their green, but that had been the full extent of the change.</p><p>[-16 Health]</p><p>I continued to feed it, feeling that I could still push, curious of the change. I pushed more and more. And the branch stirred while a small root grew into the vase. The skill was controlling the movement of the Health, which moved in an incredible, impossible to understand pattern. </p><p>I couldn’t even begin to comprehend the movement, and I couldn’t use Inspect to compensate for it either. After all, it was not made of metal, and the System didn’t trigger, no matter how much I tried. </p><p>[-184 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 1 -&gt; 2 ]</p><p>“Not bad.” While I hadn’t thought about using Nurture before, I had collected a lot of information about it. While bringing a plant to optimal condition was easy, forcing growth took too much Health, making it economically unfeasible. </p><p>And, most farmers couldn’t casually throw hundreds of Health to a single plant. I moved to the dungeon plant, trying to push it to an optimal state. </p><p>It didn’t even react. Something was missing. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said as I moved on to the seed, flooding it with my Health aggressively until a tiny sapling appeared. Incredible, but not when factoring in all the mana I had forced into it. </p><p>[-462 Health] </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) 2 -&gt; 3]</p><p>Forcefully improving a skill by just spending a lot of Health rather than finding a clever workaround was not as fun, but I still managed to grow it faster than most farmers were able to do in a week. The difference in Health was simply that important. I ate a quick meal before I sat down, picking another seed, this time feeding it slowly. </p><p>The pattern of feeding a seed had been far simpler. Maybe I could get a better idea if I practiced enough. </p><p>However, even as I focused on it, my mind wandered. Mostly to the unfortunate plight of the Farmers. </p><p>While all production classes were unlucky to some degree, none was as unlucky as the Farmers. They were by far the most common production class, which was never a good thing. The more common a skill was, the less valuable it became. </p><p>To make the situation even worse, they received only one Vitality with each level up and nothing more. Their only skill was Nurture, and without Strength, the only combat skills they could learn were the basic ones. </p><p>They should have still been able to make money, especially with the amount of food the world consumed. </p><p>However, the biggest problem was that monsters were drawn to the vitality of the plants. The bigger the farm, the more monsters it drove. It prevented them from just picking a nice mana dead location with weak monsters and working independently. </p><p>In the end, they ended up gathering together near the big cities, working in the huge greenhouses that supplied the consumption while being protected by others that took all the profit. With the food critical to replenish Health, the amount a city consumed was truly incredible. </p><p>Still, there were always more Farmers than was needed, driving the money they could earn even lower, most of them below level five as they labored hopelessly, working hard to keep with their individual quotas.</p><p>Of course, theoretically, the solution to that problem was simple. All it would take for the stronger people was to just decide to support the weak properly. Just let them access a friendly dungeon, and bring them up to a higher level. </p><p>But, similarly, all the problems with Capitalism would have been solved if billionaires were nicer, Communism would have worked if the officials were not corrupt, and Monarchy would have worked too if the kings cared about peasants more than they cared about their glory. </p><p>As a sociologist that had spent my whole life trying to understand how human behavior had worked in aggregate, I knew that it was hopeless. Solitary humans might be merciful and fair, but humanity was not. Or, we wouldn’t have waited to ban slavery until it was financially unsustainable. </p><p>Humanity was selfish, and the individual power given by the System made it only worse. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Do you think anyone would recognize you?” she asked. </p><p>“I don’t think so,” I said. “To their knowledge, the blacksmith you brought along is already dead. And, I didn’t interact with many people. As long as my beard grows a bit more, no one should.” </p><p>“Good,” she said. “Then, we’re going to register you as a guild representative of that wretched woman.” </p><p>“Rosie?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes. Her guild is already registered here?” </p><p>My eyes widened. While Broken Tankard had always been a very good business, Rosie had never shown an interest in establishing a guild. The sudden change was interesting, but not entirely in a good way. Eleanor and Maria were dangerous on a battlefield, but the same wasn’t true for anything else. </p><p>Rosie was much sharper. Keeping things secret from her would be far more difficult even without being in her employ. </p><p>Guilds were weird entities. Their exact legal standing differed from town to town, especially since every town operated independently, at least when practical matters were concerned. It meant that the legal system was long gone, and disputes were handled in an informal manner. </p><p>Our town, for example, had something similar to an elder's council, where respectable — meaning strong or rich — citizens took collective decisions. I hadn’t interacted with them much, but I had observed the decisions they took. </p><p>More often than not, those decisions showed that they were more than happy to treat the guilds as independent entities, accepting the way they disciplined their members as long as it wasn’t too excessive; and their definition of excessive didn’t exactly match with mine. </p><p>No, I didn’t want to suddenly put myself under the authority of Rosie. </p><p>Technically, I did that with Maria — and indirectly, Eleanor — but it was a mere business relationship. I had no doubt that, if I taught their blacksmiths about how to repair fast before disappearing, they would just wish me luck. </p><p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” I said. “If I work for her, she could easily find out everything I bring out.” She looked at me suspiciously, probably about the fact that Rosie had introduced me. </p><p>“Really? Didn’t you work for her?” Eleanor asked, surprised. “Don’t you trust her?” </p><p>“No, I worked with her,” I said, quick to highlight the difference. I realized that Eleanor assumed the relationship between me and Rosie was more similar to hers with Maria. Knowing Rosie, it was something she implied, but never openly said. </p><p> “She isn’t my employer, but a business partner. I had purchased her services many times before I … fell to hard times. I trust her as a business partner, but it doesn’t mean I want to declare my loyalty to her,” I said. “Oaths of fealty are serious things.” </p><p>They were not, but Eleanor was clearly more inclined to that feudal mode of thinking. I wondered if it was the impact of hanging around people with Charisma, or just the natural inclination of seeing a new order in chaos. </p><p>Either way, one good thing about living in a small town, people with Charisma didn’t deign to live in such a small place. </p><p>“Of course, loyalty is a serious thing,” she said. “But, that means we don’t have an easy solution.” </p><p>“Don’t we?” I said. “With the guards gone, I’m sure you’re interacting with a lot of new guilds. Register me under a new one,” I said. </p><p>“Really, you have a Guild Mark?” she said. </p><p>It didn’t feel like a random question. “What do you mean?” I asked. </p><p>“It’s an item that drops from the dungeon, like skill stones. It allows guild members to connect,” she said. </p><p>“Really? I never heard of them,” I said. “And, I’m pretty sure the ones in our town don't have any.” </p><p>“It has a lot of benefits while operating in a dungeon,” she said, then paused. </p><p>From the way she paused, I could see that she didn’t know about those benefits either. So, I didn’t bother asking more. “I’m guessing it’s not exactly cheap?” </p><p>She chuckled. “Of course not. You need to destroy a dungeon to acquire one. I didn’t even hear of one being sold.” She paused again. “Actually, I’m not even sure they can be sold.” </p><p>“Then, I’m sure that, as the commander of the camp, you can arrange an unofficial guild for me, and I’ll be the leader.” </p><p>She paused, thinking. “Alright, but only temporarily. I won’t let you get everything you want just because you can repair weapons.” </p><p>“How about this: I’ll do my best to train the blacksmiths for you like I promised, and in the meanwhile, do my best to handle the overflow. You just need to arrange the delivery for the guild hall secretly until the training is complete, so I won’t get assassinated. And in exchange, you’ll arrange a guild hall that I can use both as a forge and a small team. You won’t have to fund my experiments going forward, and, after three months, I’ll start paying rent just like any other guild.” </p><p>She looked surprised. “Are you sure? Even without a Guild Mark, establishing a guild is a serious thing. It feels sudden.” </p><p>It was, but only because I didn’t actually expect her to allow it. Letting a guild to be established in town, even a budding, troubled one like their camp was a serious affair. She must have been even more impressed by my fighting ability than I assumed. </p><p>Every other time I asked anything, she had been acting like I was begging for free food. But now, she was actually treating me as a peer. </p><p>“Alright. I’ll even give your guild one person access for a month, but you have to pay tax like everyone. Take it as a gift from me. But, if you want to expand your guild, you have to join the weekly bidding like any other guild.” </p><p>“Sounds fair,” I said. </p><p>“And, I’ll take the forge away the moment the other blacksmiths arrive. We don’t have a spare. You have to source your own equipment.” </p><p>“Tough, but manageable,” I said. “But, I still need to use it occasionally to experiment.” </p><p>“Only if you’re willing to pay rent and mix in with the other blacksmiths,” she said. </p><p>“What about the supply risk?” I asked. </p><p>“I thought about it, and I don’t think it’s an acceptable risk,” she said. A sudden change. She must have realized that I had exaggerated the risk to get more material. </p><p>Admittedly, she would be right. I didn’t think they would have tried to assassinate me if they could cut supply. </p><p>It would have scared me before visiting the dungeon. But, now that I had a better understanding of what was going on inside of the dungeon, I was confident that utilizing forged corrosion-resistant equipment was more profitable than importing mana alloys. </p><p>If I played my hand right, I would make enough money to fund my experiments. And, the best part, I was doing something that would benefit them. </p><p>I just needed to make some serious progress beforehand. </p><p>“Fair,” I said. </p><p>“You must be really confident that you can find a way to invent a new material,” she said. </p><p> It was a reasonable suspicion. “Fifty-fifty,” I said. “Of course, I’ll be willing to sell it to you for a reasonable price. Maybe for permanent access spots?” I asked. </p><p>“Sure. We’ll discuss it based on the material’s performance,” she said. “As long as it doesn’t cost more than double, I’m willing to pay for it.” </p><p>As I followed her, we started talking about other formalities, which I could handle easily. I had managed too many projects as a professor to be slowed down by little details. </p><p>However, the more I discussed, the more I realized her opinion about the new alloy I promised to develop. She was certain that I could actually develop it — which was true — but she also had very strict assumptions about its limits. </p><p>Since it was not provided by the System, it had to be strictly inferior. </p><p>That approach irked me, but I wasn’t in a hurry to change her mind about it, and ruin her mood in the process. Since she believed that I was certain to succeed, she could have insisted that developing an alloy for them was a part of the contract, and I couldn’t sell. </p><p>Her goodwill was valuable. It was also the reason I was pushing things at an uncomfortable pace. I didn’t want to miss this opportunity like I had done before. All it would take was another dungeon drop with some stupid new enchantment to ruin my budding business, and I needed to make some money beforehand. </p><p>Of course, while I wanted to make money, it wasn’t the only reason. After everything I had discovered, having a space that truly belonged to me was vital. </p><p>Important enough to push some limits and look suspicious. Luckily, I had excuses in place to distract others from my real secrets. Maria had helped me level up, and Eleanor provided me with multiple valuable skills. Together, they went a long way to explain any casual questions people might have, especially since no one had any reason to interrogate them about the details. </p><p>There were still some risks, but those were acceptable. </p><p>So, I said very little once I stood behind Eleanor while handling the registration details. Though, my eyes widened when I learned when they were purchasing the undamaged shells for only two silver. </p><p>I expected a hefty cut, but that still surprised me. </p><p>“You can always not sell and bring them to the System Store yourself,” she countered mockingly. She had a point. They had to be transferred by a caravan, and the nearest System Store was almost two weeks away. “Just one silver,” she said, then added. “Even if they are broken.” </p><p>It worked for me as well. After all, I wasn’t planning to bring most of them out in the first place. </p><p>Still, it was a successful trip. Not just in terms of gains, but it actually made Eleanor warm up to me. And, that meant I could actually do a lot more than I was initially planning. </p><p>I couldn’t help but appreciate the irony. I had so much to offer, but the two greatest opportunities I had gotten in this Post-Cataclysm world had nothing to with it. Maria helped me far more than necessary because I was good enough to entertain her playing chess, and Eleanor was impressed by the rapid improvement of my sword skills. </p><p>I didn’t expect to end up like one of those useless rich kids that only got the job because they played golf with the CEO. </p><p>Life was unpredictable. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Eleanor arrived as I was in the middle of another fight. She walked toward me rather than running, but I could see her freeze for a moment even as I fought against the monster, throwing it around easily. </p><p>It was hard to pinpoint the skill level without some direct tests, but a rough guess was far easier. Even a conservative estimate would put that over thirties. I said nothing as she approached, stabbing the monster through its mouth after a fight that lasted about half a minute. </p><p>“Wow, incredible performance,” she said. I was surprised, not by her words, but her smile. It was the first time I saw her lips stretching that much. “How did you pull that off?” </p><p>I smiled, curious if I could leverage it for another advantage, but in the end, I decided to stick to the familiar excuse. While revealing what was possibly a secret rankled me, I was almost certain that it was common knowledge for people at her level. </p><p>There was no way the whole world had missed something that straightforward for three years. “A little luck, a little skill,” I replied. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked. </p><p>“I’m sure you noticed that a skill improves faster if someone has been more competent if they were familiar with the subject,” I said. </p><p>“Of course,” she said as she shifted her stance. “You can’t believe how glad I am for picking fencing as a hobby even before the Cataclysm,” she said, her sword shifting to a familiar stance, yet lacking the smoothness of a skill. </p><p>It might be the first real personal information I had from her. </p><p>“Exactly, that’s the part of the reason I improved quickly,” I said. </p><p>“Really, you did fencing as well?” she said. </p><p>“No, but I had visited my fair share of renaissance fairs, jousting and playing fake knight,” I said. She frowned, clearly not finding it reasonable. Not a problem, as that was just there for a later stage, when others failed to copy. “Though, the real benefit had been forging,” I said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, looking confused. </p><p>“Swinging a hammer for three years taught me a lot about how to swing heavy objects the best way, especially with my Hammer of Might as a template,” I said even as I used a shield attack. It was an aggressive downward swing, one that was most similar to the movement of a hammer. </p><p>“I see, clever,” she said, but I could see her smile fading to a look of boredom. She was not really interested in it. Understandable, as what I had revealed would only be effective for beginning. Three years ago, it would have been extremely valuable, but currently, there were easier ways to increase skills. </p><p>Like finding a dungeon that fitted well with the skill before starting to kill, like the insect monsters and the hammer skill. </p><p>“Of course, I still managed to raise it to forty-five. Even with the similarities, it should mean that I have a talent for the sword,” I added, curious whether it would make her interested. Her earlier reaction convinced me that it was a safe move. </p><p>“Forty-five, in eight hours? Impressive,” she said even as she raised her sword. “Let’s see how good you are. Defend yourself.” </p><p>With that, she dashed forward. She was faster than I had expected, but not enough to keep me from pulling down my shield to parry her attack. I drew my sword as well, defending myself under her repeated attacks, getting faster and faster. </p><p>I didn’t hold back. I couldn’t, not when I had to act reflexively. She started moving faster, her hits getting harder and harder. “You’re relying on blocking too much,” she said as she moved her sword faster than I had expected. </p><p>If she had been aiming for my neck, it would have killed me. Health was useful, but it didn’t cure decapitation. Instead, she aimed for the center of my shield, trying to push me back. She succeeded, and I stumbled back. </p><p>“Interesting, you’re better than I had expected,” she muttered, then her eyes widened. “Of course, double Strength. It pairs really well with Stalwart Guard.” </p><p>“Probably,” I said. “It’s really good for a blacksmith. With it, I’m confident I can defend myself longer against the next assassination.” </p><p>“Good to have confidence, but don’t overestimate yourself, nor underestimate any opponent,” she said even as she attacked again. This time, rather than trying to break my guard, she moved around me. It took three attacks for her to press her sword against my throat. </p><p>“Noted,” I said, making a show of gulping in fear. I already knew that she could kill me easily, but showing some fear was not a bad idea if it would make her feel better. </p><p>After all, she still controlled my experimental budget. </p><p>“Put on your helmet and follow me,” she said. She started walking, and I followed her. “So, did you manage to collect enough for your experiments?” </p><p>“Enough for three days, maybe a week if I try to be conservative,” I said. </p><p>“Really?” she asked as she looked at the cart, which had been filled with a lot of broken shells. </p><p>“I can stretch it further, of course, but it’ll slow down the experiment,” I replied. “Instead of that, why shouldn’t I return tomorrow for another collection.” </p><p>“I can’t ferry you with me. I only visit the dungeon once every five days to clean the lower levels to prevent an overrun.” </p><p>“You don’t have to. There’s teams moving between the dungeon and the town constantly, right?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, once every four hours,” she said. “It’s mostly to transport the gains.”</p><p>“And, would it be suspicious if a guild representative assigned his house while he tested the dungeon? We can even move the forge there,” I said. She looked reluctant. Understandable after the assassination attempt. </p><p>Luckily, I had already seen that she wasn’t very happy with Maria spending time with me for some reason. “And, that way, I won’t be living in the same building with Lady Maria. It’s improper,” I said. </p><p>“Good point, but I don’t have time to arrange a new residence,” she said. “We’ll say that you’re going to stay as a guest in the main building. I’ll set up a new place before Lady Maria returns.” </p><p>“Just make sure that we have an excuse to bring in and out a lot of materials,” I said. </p><p>”Don’t be too greedy,” she warned. </p><p>“I’m not,” I said. I was being greedy, of course, but it was not a good idea to say it. “But, while the other blacksmiths learn how to repair faster, I might still need to repair swords. If I have a way, your job will be easier,” I said. </p><p>“Good point,” she admitted again. </p><p>I was tempted to give her some more ideas, but I could see that I had already pushed her to the limit. “If you don’t mind my asking: Why do you have to come here every five days?” I said. </p><p>She looked at me, surprised. “You know what a dungeon overrun is,” she said. </p><p>“Yes. It’s what happens when a dungeon is left unattended too much, and the gate breaks,” I said. </p><p>“It also happens between floors,” she explained. If the bottom floors left to grow, sooner or later, monsters burst out. </p><p>“I see. That sounds dangerous,” I said. “But, why don't the guards clean the lower floors? Is it that dangerous?” </p><p>“Not particularly,” she said. “It’s just inconvenient.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked. </p><p>“The second floor is similar to the first, but it has two differences. The vision range is merely forty yards, and there’s a second kind of insect with a ranged attack.” </p><p>“Is it deadly?” I asked. </p><p>“No. It doesn’t hurt the skin,” said. “However, it damages the weapons and armors significantly. A lot of families tried various combinations, but it’s still unprofitable. The lack of mana makes things too hard,” she said. </p><p>My mind already went to the corrosion resistant material I could make based on the Rare recipe. Suddenly, that had turned even more valuable. I decided to keep it a secret. </p><p>“How about the other floors?” </p><p>“The third one is even worse. The mist is even thicker, and there are occasional giant insects that are even more dangerous.” </p><p>“I’m guessing that they are worth more.” </p><p>“Yes. They go for a gold, but it doesn’t matter,” she said. “They are not common enough to make their hunting profitable, but still strong enough to kill anyone unprepared. A bad combination.” </p><p>“How about the fourth floor?” I asked. “Or are there only three floors?” </p><p>“No, there are at least four floors,” she said. </p><p>“What do you mean, at least?” </p><p>“Because it’s not a desert but a bog, constantly rotting weapons and armor. Even high level weapons would be damaged by it.” </p><p>“Really, is there no way to resist?” I asked. </p><p>“Not any that makes any financial sense,” she said. “It would have been different if the dungeon granted any rare skill, but it’s not worth it. Rare Nurture would have been useful, but the dungeon is too weak to grant anything above basic in a default state. It’s not worth the effort to get the Rare variant.” </p><p>Interesting, I thought. Her words implied that my trick of piling the monsters together was well known trick. That, or they had better methods to do the same. Either way, it didn’t really matter. I decided to ask another question. She was in a good mood after I had displayed my sword skill, and I didn’t want to waste it. </p><p>“How about the risk of overrun?” I asked. “What if there are even bigger monsters?” </p><p>“Not a risk,” she said. “Even if there are stronger monsters, they would first fill the third and second floors. I would catch them long before they reach the first one,” she explained. </p><p>She had just confirmed that no one would go down to the fourth floor because it would be a waste. Not for me, not with my corrosion-immune alloy. </p><p>Suddenly, I was glad that I kept my shut about the possibilities. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After killing another three hundred monsters — half with their shells ripped, half left intact — I had received three rewards, with ascending importance. I had collected six skill stones. I had reached level thirty-five. </p><p>And, I gathered enough data to reinforce the idea that the intact monsters had a higher likelihood of dropping a skill stone. I received two stones from the first group, and four from the second. It could still be a coincidence, but the numbers were still reliable. </p><p>At the same time, I noticed that whenever a skill stone appeared, the glow had been slightly brighter. “Let’s try something else,” I muttered even as I found another small group. This time, when I killed them, I made sure to pile their corpses together. </p><p>I expected them to disappear in sequence, but ten of them had disappeared at the same time, leaving a skill stone behind. “I wonder if that's a coincidence.”</p><p>It turned out that, it was not. Whenever I piled at least ten monsters together, there was always at least one skill stone. Even better, they were not exclusively basic, and there had been some common mixed, but the results were tempting. I wanted to try increasing the number, but there was a limit to the number I could pile alone. </p><p>The moment the first one reached the time limit, they all disappeared together. </p><p>For that, I needed to go deeper. </p><p>“I’m probably trying to discover something that’s already known,” I pondered even as I moved farther away, not even bothering to bring back the shells I collected. Instead, I just demolished them to replenish my mana as an insurance. </p><p>With an uncommon skill maximized, I wasn’t afraid of the risks of the first floor, but that was not an excuse to be careless. </p><p>This time, I didn’t stop until I found an even bigger swarm. The mist prevented me from counting the full numbers, but their distribution pattern suggested that there were at least five hundred of them. “At least another level,” I muttered, but I didn’t attack them directly. Instead, I searched for a nice, defensible spot with a solid rock behind me. </p><p>There were two reasons for it. Fighting without worrying about attacks from behind was more fitting to my style. And, with the monsters attacking en masse, I didn’t need to waste any effort piling them together. </p><p>Once that was done, I went to attack the first one. The swarm reacted as one, chasing me to the spot I had picked. What followed was a man against a thousand monsters, a daring and incredible fight … or, at least, it should have been. </p><p>Instead, it was no different than repairing a hundred swords at once. Interesting trick, but once it was discovered, the process was almost routine. Mostly, I dealt with them using the standard Mana Blow trick, and whenever the numbers turned tricky, I relied fully on skills, Shattering Blow easily solving the trouble. </p><p>I just needed to let out a point of mana to prevent the backlash from damaging my hammer. </p><p>In the end, I killed almost a thousand monsters, yet gained merely one level, showing that I was already reaching the limits in terms of gaining a level. I doubted that I would be able to gain even one more level today. </p><p>However, I didn’t care about that, and collected the skill stones. I had another fifteen skill stones in hand. Most of it, I wasn’t able to properly read. But what I had received from the largest pile I had managed to gather — thirty-eight insects — had already reinforced my assumption. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Uncommon)]</p><p>I wondered if there were any uncommon skills in the mix. Too bad I wasn’t able to read most of them. I decided to keep them separate and ask Maria later. Better safe than sorry. </p><p>However, the Nurture skill, I absorbed. I had no reason not to. Unlike common skills, I already knew that uncommon ones could grant a perk, and as long as I act creatively, I should be able to raise it to its limit and get a Perk. </p><p>[Nurture (Uncommon) - 1]</p><p>And, while having a combat perk was convenient, it didn’t fascinate me as much as getting another trick that relied on production skills. The synergy possibilities were incredible. </p><p>Assuming, of course, I could make it work. </p><p>Curious about how it would go, I moved to one of the rare half-dead thorny plants, and put my hand on it. I felt a familiar energy move inside me, and went through my finger. It was a subtle feeling, one that I would have missed if I hadn’t been playing around with my Vitality for the last three years. </p><p>To my shame, I was not making any progress. The best trick I had been able to discover was to imbue my blood with Health, which only came useful due to sheer coincidence. I never even thought about acquiring a Nurture skill to test. </p><p>Mostly because, up until I had combined Forge and Repair, I hadn’t even thought about using skills to improve each other. </p><p>Sometimes, all it took was a new look to a paradigm shift to open a completely new path. </p><p>As I used Nurture, I could feel my Health moving in a smoothness I could never replicate even as it departed my finger and disappeared into the plant. I repeated multiple times, wasting some of my Health, all without getting any feedback other than the leaves getting greener. </p><p>[-92 Health]</p><p>“That’s enough experimentation,” I said even as I left the plant behind. I wasn’t annoyed with my lack of success, as it was only the first impression. It wasn’t even a proper failure. The talk I had given Eleanor was not just for show. </p><p>I was used to tangling with a complicated problem for months without getting a result, persisting. “Looking back, it was the mistake that led me stuck in that dead end job for three years, ignoring the obvious,” I pondered. I was so used to succeeding when I had put my mind into it, I didn’t even bother working for the alternative path even as I decided to join the budding research organizations. </p><p>Though, I wondered what my old therapist would say. Maybe something about unhealthy focus on achievements, or something about seeking comfort in familiarity in face of disaster. </p><p>“Maybe one day, I’ll learn,” I muttered, wondering if she was alive. A thought that I abandoned once I started killing monsters once again, but with a twist. </p><p>This time, I focused on using the sword. Technically, it was a good piece of equipment, because it stunted my performance significantly. In three hours, I could kill at least three thousand with the hammer, maybe more if I was lucky and find a larger swarm, which would give me not only enough materials to keep going for a long time, but also help me gain at least another level or two, even with the rapidly lessening effect of the weaker monsters. </p><p>However, it wasn’t worth the suspicion it would generate. I couldn’t show an incredible improvement in both techniques during the same day. Showing off my sword skill was not the safer option, but there were certain advantages. </p><p>Like asking her some questions on how to use a sword. Even if she didn’t have the ability to use mana, she still had at least a Rare skill. Any insight she provided might help me improve my second skill even further. </p><p>Also, I had to admit, trying to come up with new ways to deal with the giant insects was more fun than I had expected. I was getting more and more used to weaponizing my shield, and I had the advantage in pure strength as long as I didn’t just try to tank their charge. </p><p>A few shield bashes put them in an unbalanced state, slowing their attack, giving me the chance to deliver a killing blow. </p><p>The only problem with the style was the weapon degradation. It damaged them far more than the method the others had been using. Considering the price and rarity of the ingots that were used for repairs, I would have been operating at a loss even without factoring in the taxes and various expenses. </p><p>However, not caring about making ends meet was truly a luxury. I just repaired them directly while using ingots. I didn’t even need to start a fire, just used mana directly to merge the alloy ingots with the shield and the sword. </p><p>Raising Mana Repair over sixty had opened up a lot of new opportunities. Of course, I still pulled several bushes and set a small fire, just enough to mislead Eleanor. </p><p>I could have repaired them even without using the material I brought along, but that would have required a real fire, intense enough to soften the metal so I could infuse it with mana once again, which was not exactly easy to set up. </p><p>A smirk appeared on my face as I imagined myself in the dungeon, with a huge forge setup, swatting monsters and repairing weapons. A nice dream, but a little bit too noticeable for my taste.</p><p>I continued killing monsters while practicing the skill, but I only managed to gain four more points, showing that I had already depleted the benefits from my other combat skill. So, halfway, I changed focus and started trying to figure out how to use mana attacks. </p><p>Though, once I depleted my mana, I stopped. Eleanor might return early, and I didn’t want to get caught playing with Mana. I still didn’t know if she could use — or at least sense — mana, but until I was sure, I would go around with empty mana reserves. </p><p>I didn’t have any success, but toward the end, I managed to time it perfectly to at least protect the sword. It was probably useless, as anyone that could use mana would have been targeting more profitable dungeons. While this dungeon had been a source of fortune for me, ultimately, it wasn’t really anything worthwhile in the grand scale. </p><p>Or, they wouldn’t have used it as a tool for a bet. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I walked around the battlefield, collecting the skill stones. Not that it took a long time, as there were merely fifteen of them. It meant, about only one in thirty of the beasts had dropped a skill. </p><p>Of those fifteen skill stones, nine of them didn’t react, showing that I lacked the prerequisite conditions to activate them. And, since the dungeon didn’t drop anything truly rare, I guessed it was related to missing stats rather than anything I could match. Perception, Charisma, Wisdom … and, my biggest achilles heel, Intelligence. </p><p>That, or they might be some commonplace spell schemas or construction recipes that required a specific ability. Then, I started examining the six that I received. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Overhead Strike (Basic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Ice Blast (Basic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Basic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Basic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Swipe (Basic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Stab (Basic)]</p><p>Ice Blast had immediately caught my attention among the available skills. A magic skill, something incredibly tempting in more ways than one. However, no matter how tempting it was, I didn’t absorb it immediately. </p><p>A dungeon wasn’t the best place for starting a new experiment. It was better to focus on the one I had in front of me. </p><p>The other five skill stones weren’t as interesting. Nurture was the sole class skill of Farmers, which was a class that was even more unfortunate than Blacksmiths. Not only were they limited to receiving only one point of Vitality, but they also received only one class skill, which could be used to hasten the growth of the plants. </p><p>One that used their Health in return. </p><p>They almost exclusively worked in greenhouses, growing food. While monster meat could be used as a food, metabolizing the enhanced food they produced was faster. The basic variant, in particular, was useless at this point. </p><p>Of the three combat skills, two of them were worthless. At this point, the basic skills were plentiful enough to be picked for a few copper coins, and even a common combat skill wasn’t too different. I hadn’t changed mine before, mostly because I hadn’t been planning to go to the trouble of improving my proficiency from the start. </p><p>Actually, absorbing Stab was tempting as well. Just like how Overhead Strike was a basic hammer skill, Stab was a basic spear skill. Adding another weapon to the mix was an alluring idea, particularly after confirming that I was able to gain a Perk from improving external skills. </p><p>A simple perk, maybe, but only through the existence of my Perks was I able to break through the limits of the skills. </p><p>“One step at a time,” I said even as I collected the skill stones, not absorbing any of them. </p><p>Before absorbing them, I needed to confirm that the rapid improvement trick actually worked with weapons other than hammer, which was not a given. </p><p>“Let’s see if it works,” I muttered even as I retreated back toward my cart. On the way, I had killed a few insects, but I didn’t bother using any mana. Instead, I focused on collecting their shells to put on the cart. It was better to be safe than sorry. </p><p>When I arrived, the cart had been untouched. I put the shells I collected there as well as all skills except three — Stab, Nurture, and Ice Blast — before I changed my weapons to sword and shield. It was finally the time to test the skill properly. </p><p>I attacked the air. My movement was direct, straightforward, and most importantly, incompetent, which was inevitable. One point of proficiency didn’t mean much, and the glaring mistakes were even more obvious after bringing another combat skill to hundred. </p><p>I ignored them, and instead tried to use mana in my storage to attack. It would be easier to use than Mana Blow. </p><p>[-2 Mana]</p><p>It failed. </p><p>“That’s not good,” I muttered. I was very confident that I could use the mana to enhance the attack, but it didn’t even take hold around the sword. I tried the same thing multiple times, trying to modify the shape of the mana. </p><p>Even when I depleted most of my mana, it failed. My unfamiliarity was not helping. “I need to watch a swordsman use mana attacks,” I deduced, which was not exactly easy to find. I didn’t know if Eleanor was capable of using mana. She might be depending on the class, as there were multiple hybrid classes. But, I didn’t see her use one. And, I couldn’t ask her about it without looking suspicious. </p><p>She wasn’t like Maria, willing to entertain my random questions. Nor was she careless enough not to realize she would be revealing potential secrets. </p><p>Waiting for Maria was the easiest way. It was likely that she had a melee external skill that she could use for emergencies. I remembered that she carried a dagger. However, I needed to wait almost five days for her. There were other ways to handle things. </p><p>“And, I don’t need mana for the first step, do I?” I said to myself. Just because the mana trick didn’t work didn’t mean I didn’t have any other option. </p><p>I made a simple forward attack with the sword a few times, then switched to hammer, replicating the attack. Of course, the weapons were really different, but so was the difference between one point of proficiency and a hundred. </p><p>More importantly, there was a lot of overlap between two melee skills, just like there was a strong overlap between Repair and Forge. The concept of balance, momentum, maintaining a distance … all had been a relevant part of it. </p><p>It took merely five swings to improve my skill once. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 1 -&gt; 2]</p><p>I was more than happy to discover another way to improve the skill. Clearly, it wasn’t too effective, barely matching the speed of killing monsters, especially with the momentum lacking. I practiced for ten minutes. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 2 -&gt; 11]</p><p>The improvement was nice, but not as high as it could have been. It slowed down significantly once I passed the ten point mark. It was barely enough to fight against monsters. </p><p>However, I didn’t rush to fight against them immediately. I only had one shield, and I didn’t want to ruin it with a mistake. </p><p>“Speaking of shields,” I said even as I paused, focusing on the skill once more. I referred to it as a sword skill, but it wasn’t, was it? It was a sword and shield skill. Once I reached ten proficiency, several moves that included the shield in a more offensive manner had opened up. </p><p>That put a big smile on my face for one, good reason. In terms of momentum, a shield attack was more similar to a hammer than a sword. ”Let’s try it again,” I said. I started another round of practice, this time focusing on shield attacks over sword ones. </p><p>The skill continued to rise. Half an hour of practice had been enough to bring my skill to a new stage. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) - 25]</p><p>“Cheating is fun,” I said even as I started moving deeper once again. While I had been fighting, I had been interrupted by the occasional monster, but I chose to deal with them using my hammer. It was the first time I was going to use a sword. </p><p>I approached an insect, trusting the skill to do its job. When the beast attacked, I took a step to the side, and slammed it with my shield. Unbalanced, I followed with multiple attacks, a combination of shield and sword, relying on the direction of the skill. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) 25 -&gt; 26]</p><p>The reward was nice, but the damage to both my sword and shield was considerable. No wonder they dealt with the monster by distracting it. </p><p>Still. It was a reasonable sacrifice. The damage to weapons would explain how I was able to improve the combat skill that quickly. An improvement I wanted to reveal, at least to some degree. It would be less suspicious than suddenly defending myself with incredible proficiency if the need arose. </p><p>“Now, the next trick,” I said as I tried to time my attacks with a mana burst. </p><p>It wasn’t like the mana blow. It didn’t impact my attack. However, it managed to interfere with the corrosion effect, preventing the weapons from slowly getting damaged. It was another trick, but not a particularly valuable one. Simply repairing them was easier. </p><p>“Still, it’s always better to know more rather than less,” I said, more than happy with my performance. </p><p>After killing a few more beasts, I started experimenting once more, doing my best to correct the skill based on the feedback of the hammer attacks. I occasionally switched weapons just to refresh my memory. </p><p>Soon, another dozen insects fell under my attacks, and I ripped their shells before they faded. Though, even as I repeated the attack, I noticed an interesting detail. The ones with their shells ripped didn’t seem to drop skills at the same rate. </p><p>“Interesting. Too bad it’s not statistically significant,” I pondered. I needed to kill a lot of beasts and test it that way. However, first, I wanted to finish improving my sword skill. I continued killing, not only collecting shells, but also improving the skill high enough to — hopefully — impress Eleanor without alarming her. </p><p>[Stalwart Guard (Uncommon) - 41]</p><p>“Impressive, but not groundbreaking,” I finally said. The best part, the way I improved it was actually replicable. She could test it with another hammer expert, and they would get some results. </p><p>Not at the same level, but enough to keep her from getting suspicious. </p><p>I returned to the cart to drop my sword and shield along with the excess shells. Then, I moved deeper, hammer in hand, feeling strangely excited that I would be able to run the experiment myself. The day had been filled with fascinating discoveries. </p><p>Maybe that had been my mistake all along, I decided. I relied on others to collect data, rather than doing it myself. </p><p>I had another experiment to run. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I took down a few monsters while Eleanor walked away, still holding back, ripping the shells carelessly from their bodies. I didn't absorb the mana from them, both as a test of my abilities without mana assistance, and as a precaution in case she was still nearby. </p><p>Naturally, there was no reaction from the System. The insects were decent enemies, but not enough to help someone around level thirty to level up immediately. By spending about a minute each monster, the leveling efficiency would be much lower than trying to fight outside. </p><p>Then, there was the weapon destruction effect. While it wasn’t as much as directly plunging into the mouth of the beast, every hit to the shell degraded the weapon somewhat. It was impossible to notice it with the naked eye, but with the Advanced Inspect, I could easily watch the damage. That effect got even stronger once a shell was cracked. </p><p>It was some kind of spell, sticking to the surface of the metal to worm itself to the surface, almost working like acid for a second before fading away. </p><p>It was interesting, but I couldn’t focus on it as much as I wanted. Watching one of them bite a huge rock into two was enough to remind me that this operation was not without risk. Maybe I could spend more time testing it if the guards capture and immobilize one. </p><p>For now, it was time to improve my combat skills, and maybe gain a few levels. I first pulled the cart behind a rock. The monsters didn’t seem to care about inanimate objects, but even if they did, I didn’t care. Instead, I moved deeper into the rocky area, holding a broken shell in my hand. </p><p>Once I was sure that no one was around, I smashed it aggressively, and drained its mana. </p><p>[+3 Mana]</p><p>“Well, that was much less than I had hoped,” I muttered. Normally, I would be able to drain almost twenty mana from a similarly damaged shell, but it was without the dungeon absorbing it back. Not that I cared much. </p><p>Then, I pulled the map Eleanor had given me, and examined it. The map only showed the first floor — as there were similar glowing passages that led to other floors — which was roughly circular. </p><p>With a radius of ten miles. </p><p>And, as if the idea of a pocket universe wasn’t fascinating enough, I also knew that ten miles was relatively small as far as dungeons went. Truly fascinating. </p><p>Too bad I was here, inside an incredible miracle, only to kill monsters like a barbarian rather than exploring it as a proper scientist. </p><p>The map showed the patrol areas and the safe spots clearly. Eleanor had given it to me to keep me from getting into trouble, but I had the exact opposite intention. For me, it represented the best areas to operate. </p><p>“But first, a test,” I muttered as I moved toward another monster, and pushed the mana to the head of the hammer. Though, once again, I was able to repeat the trick of mana attack only when I thought of the hammer as a forging tool. </p><p>Though, even as I faced the monster, and barely dodged the attack, I realized a small problem. Focusing on my Forging skill meant that the reflexive footwork didn’t arrive. I was barely able to switch skills before throwing myself to the side, rolling painfully. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 53 -&gt; 55]</p><p>“Note to myself, be careful about switching skills,” I muttered as I looked at the corpse of the monster. If that blow didn’t kill it in one hit, it wouldn’t be that easy. </p><p>I sat on the ground, watching the mangled remains of the beast. The mana blow, even if it was just worth three points, increased its effectiveness against the shell significantly. It had turned the loot completely worthless. </p><p>More importantly, since its shell had been destroyed completely, the mana cloud around it was much thicker. More than enough for me to catch some using Mana Blow. Meaning, I could deal with multiple monsters without the need for stopping to replenish my mana. </p><p>I was still stuck near the cart for almost half an hour, hunting the monsters until my mana reserves were full, and killing twenty more insects in the process. Without holding back, I was able to shatter their shells in merely four or five hits even without using mana. But, without mana, there was no rapid skill increase.</p><p>Absorbing Mana was a slow process, but even half an hour was only possible because of my high Meditation skill. If it was below twenty five, I wouldn’t have been able to take even a drop of mana from the greedy pull of the dungeon. </p><p>I fully intended to use the Mana Blow trick to kill the beasts rather than using my stored mana, but wasting an hour was acceptable for additional safety. </p><p>“It’s time,” I muttered even as I moved forward, my hammer flipping in my hand as I left the safe area behind, and moved toward the edge of the dungeon. </p><p>The landscape got rockier and rockier, but I didn’t care about it. I was more interested in the density of the insects. I deliberately positioned myself so that multiple monsters moved toward me at the same time. </p><p>The first one, I killed using my reserves. Unlike trying to reverse the flow of Meditation, mana leaked out of my body smoothly to land on my hammer head. </p><p>[-4 Mana] </p><p>A single blow, and the target had been dealt with. This time, knowing that it would die in one blow, I hadn’t thrown myself to the side in panic. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 55 -&gt; 57]</p><p>Instead, I shifted back to Mana Forge, which allowed me to gather the mana around my hammer far faster than I could with Meditation. A step forward, and another beast died. Killing them unassisted allowed my skill to improve far faster. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 57 -&gt; 59]</p><p>“Let’s go,” I muttered as I moved deeper recklessly, especially once I realized that using mana blow prevented the erosion effect from their shell sticking to my hammer, preventing durability loss. </p><p>A dungeon where I didn’t need to share with others was an incredible treasure, especially one that fit my skill configuration perfectly. It was the perfect environment to use the benefits of the System. So, when I drifted away enough to see a swarm of insects, the count easily reaching hundreds, I moved forward. </p><p>The only thing that I paid attention to was not to be surrounded by the swarm as my hammer danced, my movement getting smoother and smoother. </p><p>Once my hammer skill reached seventies, it only started to increase once with every kill. At around eighty proficiency, it started going up once in several monsters. A pity, but not a big one. Having an external combat skill in the eighties was already fascinating enough. After improving my skill so much, I was able to shatter the shell with one hit, even without using Mana. </p><p>The skill didn’t increase my Strength, but it gave me many new tricks to create an unbelievable sense of leverage, which was only possible due to Dexterity helping my body move. </p><p>As I destroyed the insects, their bodies continued to disappear. However, not all of them had disappeared into nothing. Several of them had left glowing orbs behind. Skills.</p><p>However, I didn’t have time to stop and take them, since I was dealing with a swarm of huge insects. Instead, I continued killing, and counting. </p><p>As my skill proficiency passed the hundred and fifty mark, an even more welcome notification appeared. </p><p>[Level 32 -&gt; 33]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>I started moving smoothly. It was even more efficient than leveling with Maria’s help. Experiencing it directly, I could understand why people were charging for dungeon access. Fighting against only one type of enemy made things far easier. </p><p>As I fought, I realized an unexpected situation. As I continued to kill, the surrounding monsters started to get antsy. Still, I wasn’t deep enough for it to be a risk, so I merely decided to deal with the mess. </p><p>I fought for almost twenty minutes without interruption, which was a challenge that would have exhausted any warrior. But, that was another benefit of being a Blacksmith. There were some classes that didn’t even receive Vitality, while most of them only received one point. Blacksmith received double, giving us a considerable endurance even without burning Health to reinforce the muscles. </p><p>As I fought, another reward arrived. </p><p>[Level 33 -&gt; 34]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>When the onslaught was over, I had killed a total of five hundred and forty six monsters, though there was no sign of it other than a few glowing orbs, the rest had long disappeared. However, I didn’t bother gathering the skill stones just yet. </p><p>While I was curious to check them and see if there was anything useful, something else was far more important. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 100]</p><p>[Perk Options — Shattering Blow / Smooth Step] </p><p>I was as happy to learn that there was an unexpected benefit to leveling external skills as much as I was happy about leveling once more. </p><p>Too bad it seemed to hit its limit by reaching hundred, not improving further. Another choice.” Smooth Step was tempting. It was clearly related to dodging, which was helpful. However I chose Shattering Blow. </p><p>I already had a new skill focused on defense. For the moment, trying to focus on my strength seemed like a better idea. </p><p>That way, even without mana, I could deal with a horde, an ability I could reveal to Eleanor. Not today, maybe, but it would be convincing after a few more trips. It would still be hard to swallow, but I could always spin a tale about discovering my aptitude toward fighting with a hammer, maybe mixing with some kind of desperate battle against ten thousand bugs.</p><p>It was well known that the desperation of death helped skills improve faster. </p><p>It would mean potentially revealing a secret — that external skills granted a Perk once they reached proficiency one hundred — but I wasn’t afraid of it for multiple reasons. First, I had a feeling that it wasn’t a big secret. I was sure that bigger organizations had long discovered it. </p><p>Unlike my Mana Skill upgrade, its discovery was far more straightforward. Meaning, it was a secret I could give up safely to improve her impression of me. </p><p>I made a note to proudly declare that I had already reached sixty today. A good lie benefited from a good foundation. </p><p>Then, I started walking toward the glowing skill orbs. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Don’t forget to keep your helmet on, just in case,” Eleanor said even as we landed. Only when the movement of the griffin stopped, I opened my eyes once again. “Your beard is impressive, but let’s not take a risk.”</p><p>I scratched my beard. Forcing it to grow faster was one of the pointless tricks I could do with Health. I just needed to keep it focused on my face, and it quickened the hair growth. A little bleach, and I comfortably looked like someone in mid-forties rather than thirty-one.</p><p>Not all disguises needed to be elaborate. </p><p>“Sure,” I said even as I looked around, taking note of the environment. The first thing that caught my gaze was the gate made of glowing energy, about ten feet tall and half as wide, enough for two people to pass at once. </p><p>Dungeon Gate. The biggest problem Earth had ever faced, but also the biggest source of our growth. Talk about a mixed bag. </p><p>Interestingly, contrary to my expectation, there was no mana around the glowing gate. I had always assumed that they were dense in terms of mana. Another curiosity I wanted to explore, but it was not the time. </p><p>Around it, was a fortress to defend it, garrisoned by merely twenty guards. It was one benefit of mana dead location. The monsters around were much weaker, though inability to employ mages for anything other than emergencies reduced even that advantage somewhat. </p><p>It wasn’t a fully fledged camp, but more of a keep, with merely a few buildings in its limits. From the open gate, I could see a secondary wall outside, currently holding several carriages, probably there to transport the gains to the camp. </p><p>Looking outside, I could see why they hadn’t simply built their frontier camp next to the dungeon. It was on top of a hill, making any large-scale construction difficult. On the flipside, it was easy to defend against the monsters. A benefit, as it was a well known fact that monsters had a tendency to attack dungeon gates from outside. </p><p>A defensible location made a dungeon more valuable. And, one advantage of a mana dead location was that the number of monsters was considerably lesser. No wonder they continued to operate the dungeon even after Thomas took the official guards away. </p><p>However, it was clear that the fort wasn’t relying just on an easily defensible position. It had four large towers, each holding three siege weapons. Large ballistas, to be exact. Their presence was rare, but they were still a part of defending towns. </p><p>I couldn’t help but sigh as I looked at them. The existence of the siege weapons had been another problem that prevented the growth of the Blacksmiths. </p><p>They were just rarely used. A part of it was the cost. I didn’t know for sure how much they cost, but considering our town only had a dozen of them to defend a much larger area, I guessed that they were valued based on platinum coins. Their ammunition was equally expensive, but effective, perfect for taking larger monsters that threatened the stationary defenses. </p><p>Ironically, their use case prevented the blacksmiths’ growth even more. </p><p>One problem was making them. There was no recipe for making siege weapons in our Forge and Repair skills, something that continued to be true for my mana variants. Which meant, no easy construction. </p><p>If that had been the only problem, it could have been bypassed. Ultimately, the design of a ballista wasn’t exactly the most complicated thing. Even if we couldn’t make them as good as the other weapons, as long as blacksmiths could forge them for cheaper, the quantity could be used to cover up quality. Once the walls were covered up with hundreds of ballistas, the towns would be even more secure. </p><p>The real problem with that strategy was that using siege weapons didn’t trigger the System. It meant, no matter how many monsters had been killed by siege weapons, there was no System feedback, meaning no leveling up, and no upgrade of skills. </p><p>And, since the monsters’ attack on the town was one of the safest ways people could level up, the blacksmiths that tried to develop that direction had been quick to abandon that path. It was another reason to believe that, in the larger scheme of things, Blacksmiths were truly useless, even among the other production classes. </p><p>A fact I had also believed up until very recently. </p><p>Maybe I would try my hand on making some ammunition. Making an actual ballista was equally tempting, but since I either needed to coordinate with a woodworker, or forge it purely out of metal, which would take too much material.</p><p>Not to mention, I could hardly hide it when someone visited. </p><p>“I know it can be stressful to enter a dungeon, but please focus. You’re representing your guild,” Eleanor called, pulling me out of my pondering, also reminding me that I was supposed to be an employee for another guild. </p><p>“I was just checking the quality of the defenses,” I said loudly. “We need to make sure the dungeon won't be any trouble.” </p><p>“Not to worry. We’re very careful to defend both sides,” she said. “Now, follow me.” </p><p>I did, and stepped through the glowing gate. A brief vertigo hit me as I was enveloped by light. </p><p>The next time I was on the ground, I was in a land of twilight, surrounded by a thick mist. At the edge of the mist, tall walls rose, far thicker than the ones outside. Sixteen towers rose high, tall enough that I couldn’t see their top, but I had no doubt that they held multiple ballistas. </p><p>As I examined the defenses, I was starting to believe that I might have misunderstood the true power of the Griffin family. It wasn’t just the number of siege weapons. I didn’t know much about the dungeons, but I knew that not many organizations dared to establish permanent encampments inside the dungeon. </p><p>It made the operation far more efficient, but it also required a significant commitment to defend. It explained why Thomas taking the family forces away troubled them so much. Without the encampment, they would have been able to just reduce the number of trips but still work with a somewhat high efficiency. </p><p>Now, with their forces split into three different encampments, they had to keep their operation slow until the caravan could arrive with the new recruits. </p><p>No wonder they were losing money despite the incredible sales price of a shell. </p><p>I began to pay more attention to the operation as I followed her. </p><p>Unlike the other side of the camp, there were no buildings inside, just several open carts and a few workers currently piling them with bloody shells. “For now, you can use our fortress as a staging ground, but when your guild gets here, they need to establish their own fortress near ours,” she explained loudly enough for the others to hear. “For now, you can borrow one of our carts, but you have to drag it yourself.” </p><p>“That’s agreeable, Lady Eleanor,” I replied, playing the role even as I grabbed one of the carts and pulled it with me. It was not a challenging job for a blacksmith. </p><p>We didn’t say anything more as she led me outside, and I dragged a cart with me. Meanwhile, she passed me a small bundle. “In here, there’s a map, and multiple flares. It shouldn’t be any risk unless you go too deep, as the monsters can’t move fast enough to keep up with you, but be careful,” she said. “I won’t be able to stay with you. I have a patrol to lead.” </p><p>That was not a surprise. Dungeons were treated as a prime leveling spot, mostly because the risks inside were predictable, especially near the gate. Assuming, of course, there were regular patrols deeper to keep the monster density manageable. </p><p>I didn’t answer her immediately, but instead watched a scene at the edge of my vision. At a distance, there were two warriors, facing against an insect that was about two feet tall and five feet long, including the dangerous looking mandibles. One had poked it with a long spear, made of ordinary wood. The moment it poked against the shell, the wood started degrading. </p><p>The monster attacked him with a surprising burst of speed. He dodged the attacks multiple times, carefully leading it to his partner, waiting for an opportunity. Only when he caught the monster in the middle of its attack, he stabbed, sinking the blade to its mouth. </p><p>When he pulled, a sickly glow was around his sword, looking ruined. He probably could use it once more, but it would be the limit. However, the monster was not dead yet. </p><p>It required another stabbing, which turned the sword mostly useless. The two warriors managed to take an insect down in tandem in less than a minute. When it died, a small cloud of mana appeared. It dissipated even faster than usual. Even with my Meditation far higher than usual, I shouldn’t be able to absorb a point. </p><p>I smiled. While meditation wouldn’t have worked, the same wasn’t true for the mana blow trick I had improvised. It latched it to mana directly, so it should allow me to catch some mana. </p><p>I continued to watch as the one that had been playing the bait pulled a few weird looking implements, and used them to pull the largest piece of shell while keeping it pristine.</p><p>Interestingly, once the beast died, touching the shell didn’t cause any damage. </p><p>The shell piece they took was the biggest one, but it was still just a small piece, roughly round, from the center of its back. “They only take one piece?” I asked. </p><p>“That’s the only piece that can be sold for eight silver,” she replied. “The other pieces merely go for a silver, and it’s hard to extract them on time.” </p><p>I didn’t ask what she meant. When they pulled back, the monster started fading into some kind of weird blue and white light that matched the dungeon’s entrance. </p><p>Another feature of the dungeons. Absorbing the dead monster back. </p><p>Merely two minutes of work, and they were eight silver richer. Of course, minus all the costs, the fee for the access rights to the dungeon for access, and the cut the guards of the System Store would take… Still, not a bad profit. </p><p>“Looks easy,” I commented. </p><p>“It is, when they are alone,” she answered. “When they are more crowded, properly taking them down is very troubling.” Then, she looked at my hammer. “Not for you, of course,” she said as she led me away from the camp. </p><p>We walked about half a mile, before she brought me to a rocky area which limited mobility significantly. “This is the best place for you,” she said. “Our hunting teams don't get near here because it’s hard to properly bait them without a proper movement area.”</p><p>“But, it’s perfect for me,” I said even as I moved toward the nearest monster. It attacked me, but stepping sideways had been easy. I smashed my hammer down and retreated from the path of the attack smoothly. </p><p>My skill might be offensively oriented, dodging was still a part of it. It still took ten blows to bring the beast down, almost a minute. </p><p>Of course, that was without using mana. </p><p>“Excellent. You have eight hours before we return. Don’t get too far away, or do something stupid,” she said before she walked away. </p><p>I twirled my hammer. For the first time, I was feeling excited for a fight. </p>",

A few times, I tried to practice my combat skill, but without an enemy to target, its progress was very limited. </p><p>I had dispersed my attempt to devour mana and instead grabbed the paper in front of me, making a show of taking notes. </p><p>[Mana Blacksmith - Level 32]</p><p>[Health 960/960] [Mana 0/160]</p><p>[Vitality 64 / Strength 64 / Dexterity 48 / Essence 16]</p><p>[Skills (4/10)</p><p>Mana Repair (Rare) - 62 [Advanced Inspect]</p><p>Mana Forge (Rare) - 59 [Creative Forging, Mana Manipulation]</p><p>Meditation (Common) - 42 [Controlled Flow, Enhanced Sensing]</p><p>Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 53]</p><p>I had to admit, I was fascinated by the development I had made. The only thing that lagged behind was my level, which would have to stay where it was until Maria returned to accompany me for another trip. </p><p>Eleanor returned, pulling another huge cart, but looked shocked when she looked at the pile in front of me. “You have already used more than half?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, yes,” I replied. “I told you, experimentation can be expensive. Besides, does it matter? I thought all of them were useless.” </p><p>“That might be so, but they are not unlimited. We barely have two more deliveries like this, and we run out of that stock,” she said. </p><p>“We can always break intact ones,” I said. </p><p>She looked unhappy about that. “We can’t waste our only source of income, not when we’re already running in the red,” she said, cutting sharply. “You have already wasted enough. Any more, and you’ll have to hunt them yourself.” </p><p>I was about to reveal some kind of partial success, when I stopped. “Wait, is that an option?” I said. </p><p>“Normally, I would have said no, as you don’t have the Dexterity required to stay out of their path but…” </p><p>“I don’t need to hit their weak points. I don’t need the shells to be intact,” I completed. </p><p>She nodded. “Actually, that might work. You still have the ring of camouflage, right?” she asked. </p><p>I nodded. </p><p>“Good, you can use that to leave the camp with me. And, once we get there, you can disguise as a guild member here to check the dungeon, thinking of joining the camp. That way, we can excuse the broken shells as some kind of sample your guild requires. There are several spots that you can use alone easily, especially with your Hammer of Might. It’s not a permanent solution, but we’re already operating under the dungeon’s limit until Lady Maria returns with the new recruits, so there’s no waste.” </p><p>“Excellent. That way, I can also observe those monsters destroying the weapons. It might give me a better direction about my experiments.” </p><p>“Nice point,” she said. ”Unfortunately, even the safe spots are relatively dangerous. You need to increase your hammer proficiency further before you can move alone.” </p><p>“It’s already at twenty seven, is that enough?” I asked. It was half of the real number, but even that was an absurd number. </p><p>A good choice, as her surprise was apparent, but not the point of shock. “Already,” she said. “I underestimated you. Let’s give you a new set of armor, pick a couple extra hammers, and we can move,” she said. </p><p>“Do they destroy the blunt weapons as well?” I asked. </p><p>“Not at the same rate, and the lack of an edge makes them last longer, but eventually, they get destroyed as well. Still, four hammers should be enough to take down about forty, which should be what you can take down and bring in.” </p><p>“Excellent. I just need to bring a few ingots so I can repair my weapons,” I said as I followed her. </p><p>“Can you do that without a forge?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes, but it’ll be slower,” I said, which was a bit of misrepresentation. Technically, there was a way I could do so, but it would be pointlessly inefficient. I wanted to bring them because I wanted to see if I could use mana forging as a cold forging method. “By the way, do you have a sword skill I can use,” I added. “Something that focuses on defense. I love my hammer, but I don’t think it’s a good weapon to use against an assassin.“ </p><p>“Hmm, you receive one point to your Dexterity, right,” she said. I nodded. “I have an uncommon skill called Stalwart Guard that focuses more on shield than a sword. We purchased several during the initial tests, but it didn’t work as well as we had hoped against the insect monsters.” </p><p>“Exactly what I need,” I replied as I followed her to the armory once more. She pulled that skill stone from a dusty shelf, showing it wasn’t touched for a long time. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Stalwart Guard (Uncommon)]</p><p>I immediately absorbed it, ignoring the pain and discomfort. While having two melee skills was a waste for most warriors, production classes received too many skill slots to care about that. Having a new style that could help me to defend against another potential assassin was worth using a slot. </p><p>Especially since improving it would take much less with my mana trick. </p><p>Once the pain of absorbing an external skill faded, I tested it a bit. One of the gladius-style short swords I had spent most of my time repairing worked wonderfully with it, but only when I had a shield ready. </p><p>“Not bad,” I muttered. Paired with a large shield, it could be used against someone with a larger armor. Once that was done, I slipped the ring back to my finger, activating the spell effect. Once that was done, I followed Eleanor, and sat behind her Griffin. </p><p>She said nothing at first. I grabbed the saddle desperately, wishing for a distraction. But, since I was supposed to not be there, I couldn’t say anything. The vertigo was even worse while watching my skin change color constantly. </p><p>Apparently, the camouflage spell didn’t count the back of a griffin as moving. A weird, arbitrary rule, but at this point, I was used to them. </p><p>“You can remove the ring,” she said. “ </p><p>“Finally,” I groaned as I put it in my pocket. </p><p>“You’re getting more used to flying,” she said. </p><p>“Y-yeah,” I answered, which was all I wanted to say about the subject. “Why don’t you tell me about the dungeon?” I said. While it was important, I was even more desperate for a distraction. </p><p>“Sure. You have been in a dungeon, right?” </p><p>“A few times, but merely for observation,” I said, which was true. Dungeons were truly fantastical. Self-sustaining closed spaces that didn’t correspond to their physical surroundings, constantly generating monsters that were capable of dropping items once killed like a video game. </p><p>Unfortunately, they were as fascinating as a venomous snake. They appeared without a rhythm. Some of them were easy to handle, and turned into a source of economic prosperity. The others were too dangerous to handle, requiring a dedicated force of experts to delve into the depths and destroy it. </p><p>And, some of them just went undiscovered, growing more and more until they exploded, spewing an army of monsters. </p><p>I had visited a few of them with hired escorts — when I was reasonably wealthy — to see what had been going on, but once I realized I lacked the tools to even start penetrating their mystery, I lost my interest. </p><p>The stars were fascinating as well, but I didn’t continuously look at the sky and hoped to figure out how a main sequence star worked. </p><p>“Really? Most people prefer to level up in the dungeons. It’s certainly more efficient, and drops help.” </p><p>Another fun detail. Only in dungeons, did monsters drop items. Outside, they just killed and died. </p><p>“No. I didn’t fight most of the time,” I said. “It’s rather new.” </p><p>“Nothing to be ashamed of. It makes your improvement even more impressive,” she said. “Now, the first thing you need to be careful of is that dungeons always have a mist that blocks the view. It depends on the type, but even the best one is merely more than three hundred yards. Our dungeon has a fifty yard range. Not exactly horrible, but enough to remove the probability of melee combat. We have some flare scrolls for emergencies, but you need to angle them correctly for the people to notice.” </p><p>“Understood,” I said. </p><p>“The monsters inside are not exactly fast, but they can turn and twitch surprisingly quickly, which makes hitting their weak spots a challenge. Also, be careful about their mandibles. They can cut through armor. And, once you kill them, you have less than a minute before their shell melts, which can be difficult solo.” </p><p>“Not for me. I can just rip a large piece,” I said. “How about the drops?” </p><p>“Nothing much. Their drops are pretty rare in the first place. Mostly some basic skills, a couple common ones, and a few spell schemas. Nothing that goes for more than a few silver, basically negligible with the current scale.” </p><p>“What about the crystals and the herbs?” </p><p>“Those grow on the dungeon walls, and the System Shop buys them. Some of them can even go for a gold or two.” </p><p>“I’m guessing they are rare, or they would be the main source of income,” I said. </p><p>“Yes. They grow on their own, and require constant exploration. Other than them, there’s not much vegetation in this dungeon. It’s more like a lifeless desert of stone, interrupted only by some shrubbery.” </p><p>“Sound drab,” I said. </p><p>“I prefer drab over complicated every day. Once, I fought in a jungle dungeon. Trees everywhere, hiding venomous monsters behind. It was pretty much hell.” </p><p>I shuddered. She was right. Lifeless desert sounded much better than a jungle. </p><p>“Luckily, it’s merely stuck in a constant twilight rather than darkness, so we don’t have to deal with torches. Now, about the movement of the monsters. The first thing you need to pay attention to is…” </p><p>Most of the points she mentioned were obvious, but I still listened to them with rapt attention. </p><p>It was much better than focusing on my current mode of transportation. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as I wanted to spend the next month reading every book Eleanor had brought and carefully learn everything I could, I knew that it wasn’t the best method to go forward. Improving my skills as far as possible by creating mana alloys was the far superior option. </p><p>The amount of information skills contained was incredible, and the perks were even more fascinating. </p><p>So, I restricted myself to reading material science articles that were relevant to my objectives, and merely skimmed the rest before I started to work on the forge. </p><p>This time, I had a large pile of broken shells to keep me going for several days. The best thing was that, it wasn’t really wasteful. I already needed to break them into small pieces to use for forging, so they wouldn’t be useless. </p><p>I stopped only when my reserves had been filled. </p><p>[Mana (160/160)] </p><p>Reserves weren't enough to forge one ingot, which meant I didn’t have the luxury of following the recipe directly. I could have easily compensated for it with my Mana Blow perk, but the lack of environmental mana erased that possibility. </p><p>Meaning, I had to try more than a dozen times before I successfully forged a piece as small as my thumb. Even then, I would have failed if it wasn’t for Intuitive Forging giving me some last minute burst. </p><p>“Regardless, a success,” I muttered as I flipped the small piece. It was a sign of progress. The first mana alloy I had ever forged. “Too bad the System didn’t reward me.” Still, it didn’t surprise me too much. What I had done was much harder than just using one of the bronze alloys to forge a dagger, but the System didn’t measure difficulty the same way I did. Sometimes, it helped. </p><p>But, not always. </p><p>For Repair, that had been about both the general value of the weapon, and the extent of the damage to an equal measure. But, the sequence of the recipes that had been revealed made me suspect the materials had played even more of a  role than I had first estimated. </p><p>Copper clearly didn’t move the needle once the skill passed level twenties, while the bronze alloy’s effectiveness had been dropped. “Maybe I should try working with iron,” I said as I walked toward the cart. </p><p>Even a partial success could push my skill higher. There was no harm in trying, afterall. </p><p>However, even as I reached for an iron alloy, I caught a more distinctive glint behind it. An ingot of silver. </p><p>“Surely not,” I said, about to ignore the idea the moment it occurred. Silver and gold were not exactly useful material when it came to practical applications, and they weren’t exactly common in the first place. Some people had collected a lot, trying to fake the System Currency, only to fail. Trying to make anything usable out of silver had failed the same way. </p><p>But then, none of those attempts had been done by a blacksmith that could use mana directly. I could have tried to mix the silver with the granules of shell and the other crystals, but I did not. Not when I had an easier option. </p><p>I cut my hand and bled on the molten metal, pushing some of my Health into my blood. </p><p>[-129 Health]</p><p>It was rather ghoulish. </p><p>I started to use Mana Blow, trying to taint the metal with my mana as I shaped it to a rough, thumb-sized cylinder. It was tricky without System directions, but my earlier successes had already taught me enough. Merely fifteen seconds later, I quenched it in water. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 25 -&gt; 29]</p><p>I was shocked by the ease with which I had managed to improve my skills. A changed attitude and a generous experimentation budget was working wonders. I sighed, realizing just how big of a mistake my earlier desire to seek stability had been. Luckily, it was not too late.</p><p>However, while the skill confirmation had been interesting, the ease with which I was able to embed mana into silver was even more interesting. It was able to crystallize around mana even better than bronze, taking almost ten times the amount of mana without any problems. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>“Let’s see if we can turn you into something useful,” I said to the silver as I started tapping it gently. It was a spectacular failure, shattering under my blows, but I didn’t care. I just melted it to cleanse it of my mana and blood, and repeated the process, stopping only to replenish my Health. </p><p>Of course, the experiment I was using was not cheap. The food I was consuming to replenish my Heath was not cheaper than using dungeon materials for forging, and the resulting metal was barely increased. But, the System counted it as a success, which was all I needed. </p><p>Two hours was all I needed to reach forty-five, and then, the gains slowed down. I could have slowed down there, but I did not. Instead, I went in a simpler direction and changed the material. </p><p>Gold. </p><p>There was no gold in the material Eleanor had brought, but it didn’t matter. I already have gold coins. I immediately melted five gold, forever ruining their ability to be used in System stores. Five gold coins barely gave me ten grams to work with, which, considering the density of the gold, was a tiny amount.</p><p>There wasn’t even any mana that bursted out, which was a pity. </p><p>Five experiments, all ending in failure. Probably, it wasn’t enough to trigger the System. I still noted the results as well as I could have managed. </p><p>It was frustrating, but not frustrating enough to slow me down. I was tempted to melt the rest of my coins, but a hundred grams was still not a lot of gold. And, it represented my current fortune, which I might end up having to rely on in case of an emergency. </p><p>I decided to delay that experiment, and try something else.</p><p>“Time to try changing up the experiment,” I said as I mixed that tiny amount of Gold into the silver, and repeated the experiment. It absorbed the mana even better, though similarly, it took more mana to count as a partial success. </p><p>I was glad that I didn’t try to experiment with silver or gold at first, or the System might not have upgraded my skill. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 42 -&gt; 46]</p><p>“Let’s see if I can turn you into a weapon,” I said. This time, the material had actually been malleable enough not to shatter while forging, though it was not exactly usable. But, it was hard to care when I was rewarded by another notification. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) 46 -&gt; 52]</p><p>[Perk Options — Modify / Masterwork / Creative Forging (Intuitive Forging) / Mana Control (Mana Manipulation) ] </p><p>A tougher choice, this time between Mana Control and Creative Forging. A better mana control was tempting, but considering Meditation was already helping me on that aspect, and that I needed to invent more materials for alloy variants, I chose Creative Forging. </p><p>They might not have been as useful for me, but it was critical for more funding. </p><p>Then, I passed as I put my hand on the silver. “Just like I suspected,” I muttered. Once I had reached fifty, some new methods had been unlocked. Some better bronze alloys, but also some simple silver alloys. None of them used pure silver like I tried to, and instead used a much more minuscule amount. </p><p>Checking those processes, I could easily deduce its function. Silver was excellent to hold more mana, allowing the weapons to be more dense. But, even a small dagger forged that way would require thousands of points of Mana to actually forge successfully, which was not something I could do without environmental mana.</p><p>And, that meant that failing to trigger the improvement with gold as my material might not have been about the amount, but the mana density of the alloy. An interesting problem, but one I decided not to solve immediately. The next perk was at proficiency level a hundred, and even with all my tricks, it was inevitable that it would require more mana than I could extract from the broken shells. </p><p>Which meant that improving Repair was the far more efficient option. “Let’s cheat the System again.” There was no suggestion from the System on how to repair the damaged dagger, but applying the information I had gathered from forging on repairing was even easier. All I needed to do was to keep the Inspect skill active, so that the System registered the activities as a part of the repair effort. </p><p>”Recycling is fun,” I muttered even as I repeated the same process again and again. The only thing I wasted was my Health-enhanced blood, which was certainly renewable. </p><p> Damaging and repairing the same dagger repeatedly was not a fun process, especially when I had to stab myself again and again, but it was easy to endure as I watched my Repair increase. </p><p>And, when I had reached the next threshold, I immediately picked Advanced Inspect as my Perk. The other options looked good, but with the way I used it, getting an even more detailed view of the internal structure of the metals was not a sacrifice I could make. </p><p>“Now, to understand mana better,” I pondered, wondering whether I could push my Meditation to the next threshold before Eleanor’s next visit. </p><p>Not taking advantage of all that source of mana would have been a waste. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 11</p><p>When the evening finally arrived, I had no plans other than eating before collapsing onto my bed. My day had been incredibly productive, but also exhausting. I just needed to sleep, wake up early, and come up with a new proposal that would convince Eleanor to provide me with more ingots to improve my Forge skill further. </p><p>I could probably excuse the disappearance of a few bronze ingots by failures and experiments, but I couldn’t use all of them easily. </p><p>But, those plans died when the workshop door opened and Eleanor walked in. “Lady Maria asks you to join us for dinner,” she said, her voice kind, but I didn’t miss the subtle threat in her tone like it was my fault. I had a sense of what was about to follow, so I decided to distract her. </p><p>“Does she want to listen to my report directly? Good, I have news,” I said, quick to distract her with a lengthy explanation of my improvements until her gaze became glassy. “In summary, I managed to reduce the repair time for a further three minutes toward the end.” </p><p>“Impressive, very impressive,” she said as she looked at me. “I didn’t know Blacksmiths could do that.” </p><p>“We don’t, because everyone is happy using their skills without changing anything,” I replied, unable to suppress a genuine flicker of anger. ”I understand why the quick improvement of the skills was more tempting. I use them to great effect as well. But embracing them to the point of abandoning everything we had learned while establishing civilization is absurd.” </p><p> I didn’t expect her expression to tighten. “Don’t tell me you’re one of them. I should have known,” she said, her attitude once again radiating the same sharpness she had revealed when she had faced Thomas. It was not good news. </p><p>I raised my hand in surrender. “I feel like there’s a misunderstanding,” I said calmly. “Who are … them?” </p><p>My surprise must have looked genuine because she calmed down. “You know, the Purists,” she said. </p><p>“I have no idea who they are,” I replied. “From the context, I’m guessing it’s some kind of political movement or a cult. But, I have been living in a godforsaken small town since the Cataclysm, and apparently, we’re not important enough for them.” </p><p>She looked at me carefully, trying to see if I was lying. Soon, the sense of sharpness disappeared, suggesting that she believed me. “They are not a political movement,” she replied. “They are a bunch of terrorists and murderers that believe that the System is some kind of curse that drains us completely. They are trying to kill everyone with the System, believing that by killing enough people, the System will disappear, and we can go back to civilization.” </p><p>“What a bunch of morons,” I spat out. “Even if they were right, what do they think will happen when the whole infrastructure disappears once again. Just more deaths. Unfortunately, Einstein was right when he declared that human stupidity is limitless.” </p><p>“Good. I would have hated to kill you,” Eleanor replied. I gave her a shaky smile. Being threatened by summary execution was not a fun time. I understood where she was coming from, but that didn’t mean I enjoyed it. </p><p>“Now that we resolved that minor misunderstanding,” I started, proud that I kept my voice from trembling. “You mentioned dinner.” </p><p>“Yes, follow me,” she said. </p><p>“So, I have a question about the supplies,” I said. “I believe I can improve the repair time even more, but I need to experiment some more.” </p><p>“What do you need?” she asked. </p><p>“I still need books about material science if possible. More information is always helpful,” I said. If it wasn’t for the tricky subject matter, I would have questioned her about why asking for old books didn’t trigger her suspicions, but praising the civilization did … but then, a viable answer popped up. Considering those Purists assumed mass murder was a good way to bring back civilization, I was sure that they didn’t bother working on the other part. </p><p>Another unreasonable cult, this time idolizing the past rather than a religion or a cult leader. </p><p>“I’ll try to prioritize it,” she answered. “What else?” </p><p>“I need to use the ingots during those experiments, and some of them will be wasted. I need your permission to use them. Also, having more materials and different types of weapons will be helpful as well. Maybe even some with different types of enchantments. Dungeon products will be useful as well.” </p><p>“Dungeon products are easy. We already have an excess of them. Ingots are a bit more problematic. We have some in excess, thanks in big part to your new repair method, and you can use one on ingot for every ten weapons you repair,” she offered. “But, that means you’ll receive your salary and bonuses based on the original contract.” </p><p>“That works,” I said. While I wouldn’t say no to more money, I was more enthusiastic about experimentation. “And, one last thing,” I asked. </p><p>“That list is getting a bit long,” she said. </p><p>“All of them are mutually beneficial,” I said. “The better I get, the faster I can repair.” </p><p>“Fair point,” she said reluctantly. </p><p>I was lucky that she wasn’t exactly a good negotiator. “I need a private forge,” I said. “Not now, but once the other workers join me. I can’t try new techniques in the middle of the others. It’ll distract them from their work,” I explained. </p><p>“I’ll try, but no promises. Even a small forge is not cheap,” she replied. “But, once the others arrive, you can still have two hours alone every day. The rest, I’ll try to get as soon as possible, but don’t expect much for at least ten days.”</p><p>“The next caravan?” I asked. </p><p>She nodded, and that was all we were able to talk about before we arrived at the dining room. It was once again unnecessarily opulent, with a long table at the center, but Maria was alone in the room. “Finally,” she said, raising a glass. Her tone was slightly slurry. Not exactly drunk, but definitely cheerful. </p><p>“Lady Maria,” Eleanor said coldly, though I had a feeling that I was the target. </p><p>“Come on, girl. You know I hate that stuff when we’re in private,” she said. Eleanor’s gaze sharpened. I flinched. I didn’t realize that I had already been promoted to the good friends category. Apparently, my attempt to keep her entertained worked better than I had expected. </p><p>“Yes, Maria,” Eleanor said with a sigh, and sat down. I sat down as well. </p><p>“Enjoy, Devon,” Maria said with a generous gesture. </p><p>Befriending her was a dangerous thing. But, as I poured myself a glass of wine — a luxury that I had been craving for a long, long time — I found it difficult to take long-term risks into consideration. “Delicious, but very complex,” I muttered. “Almost like a cocktail rather than wine. I’m guessing it’s not an old wine?” </p><p>“No, it’s from our newest winery. Alchemists can brew some fascinating wines,” Maria explained. </p><p>“True,” I admitted. While I still preferred a properly aged wine, the new one was certainly incredible as well. I took another sip. </p><p>“So, how was the first proper day of work?” she asked. “Also, D3,” Maria said, taking another sip. </p><p>“It was more productive than I had first expected,” I said, giving a detailed breakdown of the day, except my forging experiments and my unexpected perk, and explained my success. Playing a chess game at the same time was rather difficult. Maria was half-drunk, which made it slightly easier, but not enough to prevent me from losing miserably. </p><p>Losing repeatedly was far more annoying when it wasn’t there as a tool to distract me from the lack of solid ground under my feet. So, when her moves slowed down as she listened to my report, I was glad. </p><p>“You already reduced the repair time to twelve minutes. That’s good,” she said, her smile wide. “Can you reduce it further? That will allow us to get away with hiring even less Blacksmiths, right?” she said. </p><p>“We better hire the original amount we planned. We don’t know how far it’ll be reduced. And, having some extra capability won’t be too bad,” Eleanor replied. </p><p>“I’m confident that it could be reduced to eight minutes as long as I continue to work on it,” I said, careful not to over promise. Another trick, this time from publishing papers. It was always better to split any scientific discovery into multiple pieces and publish separately. That way, I could collect more rewards. </p><p>“That deserves a reward. I’ll bring you to another leveling tour the moment I have time,” Maria promised readily. It was an excellent offer. </p><p> “Only if I’m not preventing anything important. Otherwise, I can just join the dungeon parties to level up slowly,” I offered. It was easy to make sacrifices when I knew it wouldn’t be accepted. The message they had left in the workshop this morning already raised the possibility of an assassination. And, even without that, dungeons weren’t exactly the safest location for a blacksmith. </p><p>“Nonsense. Since Maria wants to help you, you should allow her,” Eleanor replied. </p><p>It further confirmed my assumption. They wouldn’t risk me. Even if they didn’t care about anything else I could potentially do for them, my life was critical until I could teach the other Blacksmiths how to repeat my methods. </p><p>I didn’t care too much about whether they would continue to treat me the same way once that part was done. I still had a week, which should be enough to get another perk from Forge and improve my Repair skill significantly. </p><p>From there, I could use that offer to make a deal with Rosie, ideally targeting the same dungeon. </p><p>And, most importantly, another leveling trip would bring me to level twenty-five, the first threshold, which would actually increase my class bonuses. </p><p>“A fruitful discussion,” Maria said. “It’s time for another game. C3.”</p><p>I managed to hold back my sigh as I responded, trying to prepare myself for a few more spectacular defeats… </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 12</p><p>I finished repairing another sword, and reached to my left, and pressed a button, triggering the primitive feeder I had constructed. Since the repaid time had been dropped to just below three minutes, walking to the damaged pile to pick a new weapon was actually slowing me down, especially when the first fifteen seconds were waiting for the sword to warm up. </p><p>The feeder not only brought the sword closer but also placed it at the edge of the forge so it started to warm up properly while I finished polishing up the sword in hand. </p><p>That, alongside other improvements, allowed me to drop the Repair time to three minutes. “Assuming, of course, this stupid device stops malfunctioning,” I muttered even as I turned to the side. There had been some trouble with the feeder despite its simple mechanical structure. </p><p>It was harder to make things without the convenient schematics from the System. </p><p>However, when I looked at the machine, I noticed something different. It didn’t feed, because there weren’t any. The swords had been repaired. All of them. </p><p>“Well, that was faster than I had expected,” I muttered. It had been barely five days since arrival, and not only was I able to meet the daily consumption but had also finished the backlog. Of course, that was only because the dungeon operations had been slowed down to a crawl once Thomas took away their best fighters. Once the new recruits arrived, I wouldn’t be able to meet the demand alone. Still, it was a fascinating achievement. </p><p>If I played it well, I could get some more concessions from Eleanor, who was mostly responsible for running the camp despite the fact that Maria was supposed to be the leader. A dynamic that I started to get familiar with since I had been invited to their dinners regularly. </p><p>Technically, I could bypass Eleanor and ask Maria directly. She was much more careless when it came to financial matters — one disadvantage of a privileged upbringing — which meant she would be even more generous. However, I ignored that temptation. Doing so would sour Eleanor’s feelings. Maria might have warmed up to me, but I doubted that it was to the point of ignoring her best friend’s negative suggestions. </p><p>No, I wouldn’t take that risk for a potentially miniscule reward. </p><p>Especially since my hard work came with some incredible rewards of its own that made any payment from them just a bonus. </p><p>[Blacksmith - Level 22]</p><p>[Health 660/660]</p><p>[Vitality 44 / Strength 44 / Dexterity 22]</p><p>[Skills (3/8)</p><p>Repair (Common) - 36 [Inspect]</p><p>Forge (Common) - 23 [Intuitive Forging]</p><p>Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 7]</p><p>My Repair skill had improved by another ten points as I had worked on the swords, which played a role in my increased performance. Too bad it was already slowing down. During the last work day, I merely gained a point for Repair. The benefits to my new process was slowing down, which meant that I would probably need weeks, maybe even months to reach fifty points. </p><p>Then, I chuckled. “It didn’t take long for me to get greedy, did it?” Just a week ago, I was expecting it to take a month to just improve from twenty-four to twenty-five, and now, I was looking for a similar timeframe to reach the next threshold and feeling as though it was going to take too long. </p><p>The sensation of getting better in three days in a way that should have required years of work was truly addictive. My improved skills had not only given me better instincts when using my tool, but also more information. </p><p>However, I wished that information was freely available rather than triggering when required. </p><p>“Now, what to do?” My Forge skill was yet to clear the threshold, but unlike Repair, it had been intentional. I had been hoping to do some research and see if I could find something about the conditions to trigger the unusual perk. </p><p>I didn’t ask Eleanor or Maria about it. Even if they knew such a thing was possible, I doubted that they would know the conditions to trigger it for Blacksmiths. They were not really interested in the process, just the results. </p><p>And, if they didn’t know, seeking such information might have made me even more of a target. </p><p>Maybe I was paranoid about not revealing it. It was entirely likely that Eleanor would confirm that it was a well-known fact among warriors of their calibers. </p><p>But there were too many ways it could go wrong, and I had already achieved too much, which had already marked me. I didn’t want to push my luck too much. </p><p>That left two options: I would either waste time trying to read the same dozen journals on material science, hoping to learn more … or I would take the risk to push Forge into the next threshold. </p><p>Pushing myself to the next stage would have been simple. Just by forging three more daggers, I would reach there. But, I was starting to have a different plan. One that depended on whether Maria would trust me enough to let me borrow an item from her. </p><p>Or even enough to reveal whether she had one in the first place. </p><p>The enchantments like sharpness, piercing, and resistance were relatively common. The System Shops held them in abundance. But, there was also much rarer equipment that increased Health and Mana capacity, which were invaluable for anyone fighting in the field. </p><p>There were also rumors of items that directly increased Stats … but that's all they were: rumors. Their existence certainly made sense, but ironically, that made it even harder to guess whether they were real or not. Even if they existed, they would certainly be too valuable even to borrow, and I couldn’t ask for them. </p><p>Luckily, for my plan, I didn’t need to ask for that. Just an item to increase Mana would be more than enough to test my theory. If it worked, excellent. If not, I wouldn’t lose anything. </p><p>I just needed to wait for the next dinner to probe for the opportunity. </p><p>But I wasn’t planning to waste time waiting for said opportunity. I grabbed a sword with Sharp enchantment. It wasn’t made of the mysterious bronze alloy, but a more ordinary type of iron, the kind that many people had. </p><p>I had purchased it from one of the guards, paying forty silvers for it. It would have been a steal if it wasn’t for its significantly damaged state. It wasn’t just the blade that was damaged, but also the enchantment, making it far less efficient. Forty silver was a significant overpay. </p><p>However, considering that I couldn’t risk ruining the bronze swords without annoying Eleanor, it was a good trade. For the last two days, I had been using my Inspect perk on it repeatedly, trying to get a better sense of how Enchantments worked. </p><p>I had been working on it for two days, poking and prodding the enchantment to understand how it worked, but to no benefit. To be fair, claiming that I had been playing around the enchantment was a better way to define it. I had no ability to manipulate the enchantment itself, so I had been deliberately breaking and repairing the metal, trying to get a better sense of how the enchantment worked. </p><p>I had spent quite a bit of time on it, and all I achieved was to weaken the enchantment even further. I felt like a caveman repeatedly banging a computer case hoping to learn how it was made. </p><p>But, I had to start somewhere. And, the caveman banging on a computer might have better luck if he could get a real-time view of all the internals. Every little bit counted. </p><p>I was lost in my thoughts when the door opened. I looked up, expecting Eleanor, bringing another batch of swords to repair. Instead, it was Maria. “Hello, boss,” I greeted her cheerfully. </p><p>“Did I finally catch you wasting time on the clock?” she asked, far too happy to do so. </p><p>I chuckled. My cheer was not just about the opportunity to ask for a chance to borrow her items. It was genuinely amusing to see her longing for a chance to tease me. Not due to any malice, but because for once, she wanted to be on the other side of the experience. Mostly, it was Eleanor trying to convince her to be more responsible and hardworking. </p><p>“Unfortunately, not the case, boss. I ran out of swords to repair,” I replied, more than happy to crush that particular hope, earning a cute pout back. </p><p>“Good, then I don’t need to plan anything before we go for another leveling trip. Let’s go.” </p><p>“Right now? We don’t have much time before it’s evening,” I commented. “Factoring in the flight time, we will have less than an hour. Do you think it’s worth it?” </p><p> Maria shrugged. “Maybe, but I have just finished dealing with that annoying woman, and I don’t have anything else to do. Since you don’t have any work as well, why not use it. Or are you afraid of losing again, professor?” </p><p>“Never,” I said, playing into her hobby of demolishing me in chess. “However, I have some experiments to run before the recruits arrive…” I started, knowing that she would ignore that. “Actually, since you’re here, I have a quick thing to ask.” </p><p>“Go ahead,” she said. </p><p>“May I borrow one of your items, one that grants Mana? I have a feeling that, by using it, I might actually figure a trick to bypass it.” </p><p>“No,” she said, her smile gone. </p><p>“Sorry if it was too much to ask,” I quickly said, not wanting to annoy her too much. </p><p>She shook her head rapidly. “No, that’s not it,” she said. “I said no because it wouldn’t work. Any items that grant additional Stats or Mana only work up to a percentage of the existing state,” she said. </p><p>“Meaning, it won’t work if you don’t have the original stat. I see,” I said, unable to hide my frustration. I had been very hopeful about that fact. </p><p>“Sorry about it,” she said. </p><p>“Not your fault,” I answered. It wasn’t like she was the one that decided how the System worked. Still, it was frustrating to see the plans I had worked for during the last few days had been ruined because of one detail. One that was quite common in her circles if the ease she revealed that was any indicator, along with the confirmation of the existence of Stat boosting items. </p><p>“I can try to help, I don’t have anything to do,” she offered, no doubt taking pity on my mood. </p><p>I was about to refuse … but then, I changed my mind. It might not work … but then, it might. </p><p>“That would be excellent, boss,” I said with a big smile. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 13</p><p>“So, what’s the plan,” she said, looking excited. </p><p>“We’re going to start with something simple,” I said even as I started thinking about what to try. I had already designed several experiments, but every single one of those relied on mana under my direct control as I played around with the broken enchantment. I had no idea how to replicate it directly. </p><p>A challenge. </p><p>“Like what.” </p><p>“First, let me warn you. Experimenting is a slow process. It might take hours and days before I make even the slightest progress,” I said. That warning could change her mind, but it was better than the alternative. </p><p>The last thing I needed was for her to blame me for misleading her. </p><p>“Don’t worry. Unlike what Eleanor claims, I’m not a child with poor attention span,” she replied. “Now, what do I need to do?” </p><p>The answer was simple. I pointed at the forge. “Can you imbue the flames with some excess mana,” I said. </p><p>She frowned. “I don’t know. I never tried. I usually try to cast more effectively, not less.” </p><p>“It’ll be a good experiment for you too, then,” I said. </p><p>“Sure, but why do you need it?” she asked. </p><p>“I’m wondering if I can forge a mana-infused ingot,” I said. </p><p>“Do you think you can do it?” she asked, even more excited than I had expected her to be. </p><p>“Maybe,” I suggested, careful not to feed her excitement even more. </p><p>“Good, because they are quite rare in the System Store,” she replied. “If you can figure out a way to do it, it would bring us considerable income.” </p><p>I frowned, though it was not about her already staking a claim on the results of a possible success. That, I was used to. In academic research, the results were usually split between the university and the organization providing the grant, leaving nothing but a couple papers for the researcher. </p><p>Also, the world was too dangerous for me to have sole possession of anything truly valuable. </p><p>No, I was frustrated, because she had lazily confirmed another thing that I had only theorized about. I had thought that I knew how much living in a small town had been holding me back. Learning the enormity of my mistake was not fun. </p><p>I ignored my spiraling frustration as I pulled an ordinary iron ingot, one of the many Eleanor had provided for my experiments. </p><p>While such ingots had been used a lot during the first days of Cataclysm — often to hastily forge piles of weapons that shattered helplessly against the monsters — lately, they were only used to make arrows, javelins, and other disposable items. </p><p>And, even then, they were used against weaker targets. Anything dangerous required a better alloy that had been forged with dungeon products. They couldn’t even be used to repair the weapons from the System. </p><p>Those ingots could be purchased from the System store directly — which was the cheaper method — but Forge offered a more expensive alternative, using some of the dungeon products to turn ordinary metal into alloys that could hold the enchantments; and, as a result, could be used to repair enchanted weapons. </p><p>However, it was not even popular before the repair spell started to become commonplace. After that, it had fallen completely out of favor. </p><p>During the last few days, I had used that method several times to forge a few different alloys, which only worked when I followed the System instructions to the letter, and any diversion easily ruined it. </p><p>Still, it hadn’t been a waste. I used Inspect every step of the way and reached some conclusions about how it worked. Essentially, those dungeon products dispersed across the alloy, which effectively functioned as foreign particle inoculation by allowing the metal to crystallize around it. Once the metal cooled around those particles, they dispersed, providing the metal some kind of extra energy that reminded me of Health. </p><p>Not exactly the same, but similar enough. </p><p>I wasn’t planning to replicate it using Mana. That much had been a mere curiosity. But, somehow trapping mana into ingots was the best way I could come up to leverage Maria’s sudden offer to help. It was a long shot, but maybe Intuitive Forge would help bridge the gap. </p><p>While Maria continued to experiment with her magic, focusing steadily on the small flame dancing on her palm, I pulled several papers and filled them with formulas. </p><p>Unfortunately, to my shame, they were less about representation — I still didn’t know enough about metallurgy to accurately model a completely new process — and more about convincing Maria that I knew what I was doing. </p><p>Hopefully, it would be enough to convince her that I was actually working for something rather than poking around blindly. </p><p>While I was scribbling the notes, Maria finally spoke, barely ten minutes after she started. “I have done it. One elemental spell, with extra useless mana. It’s easier than I had expected.” </p><p>“Only because you’re talented,” I said. I had no idea about the difficulty of it, but when it was doubted, going with a compliment felt like the safe choice. “Now, you need to make that flame larger and apply it  directly on the metal, infusing it with mana.” </p><p>“That sounds … easy,” she said. “That can’t be all, right?” </p><p>I chuckled. “Not even close. Do you want me to explain what we are doing?” </p><p>“Sure. I don’t have anything else to do. And, I can have a break from demolishing you in chess.” </p><p>A little bruised pride was certainly worth the assistance of a high-level fire mage. I didn’t even know how much I would have to pay if I needed to hire someone to do the same. </p><p>“Fair. Now, onto the lesson. Melting the metal could only be defined as a preparatory step. Only when the metal is properly melted, which is iron in our case, can the alloy-making process begin properly.”</p><p>“But, don’t we only have iron there? I thought alloys were a mixture of multiple metals.” </p><p>“Not necessarily. The common definition is a metal mixing with another substance. For example, steel is made from a mixture of carbon and iron, and the carbon comes directly from the coal.” </p><p>“Is this what we’re doing?” she asked. </p><p>“No. The first round is essentially a control group for our experiment. I want to see how iron and mana interact without any external factors. I’ll observe the process through my perk. That way, I will know how it works in its natural conditions. That way, I can measure the success of our upcoming attempts.” </p><p>“Can you detect mana?” </p><p>“Only when it’s interacting with a metal directly, like enchantments. But, it’s just the outer structure. Their inner aspects are inscrutable to me.” Well, that was not completely true after I received Inspect, but I didn’t mention that. </p><p>With that, I quickly shaped the molten metal into fifty coins, split into ten equal groups of differing sizes, five coins in each group. Maria looked like she was about to ask something, but I gestured for her to be silent. </p><p>Stretching my Inspect into multiple groups was not difficult, but I couldn’t split my attention. Instead, I quickly scribbled a long line of data. Only when the mana dispersed completely from all coins, I stopped. </p><p>“What was that?” she asked. </p><p>I smiled. “It’s simple. Each column represents one coin. The numbers are between zero and one. Zero represents no mana, and one is the moment you stopped infusing mana.” </p><p>“But, why are there five samples for each size? Is there anything different in any of them?” </p><p>“Basic scientific principles. Having multiple samples will give me a better idea of the underlying process, and make sure my conclusions are scientifically accurate.” </p><p>“Sounds like a lot of extra work,” she said. “Does it really make a difference?” </p><p>“Yes. It’s often that the underlying data has some unique problems that affect the process. For example, one of the metal coins could have an air bubble or some other impurity. Drawing the wrong conclusion could ruin everything. Duplicates help reduce the risk.” </p><p>“Sounds like a chore,” she said. </p><p>“It often is. That’s why I miss having my own students. That way, I could throw data collection to them, and deal with the fun parts.” </p><p>“Nothing about math is fun,” she replied heatedly. </p><p>I chuckled. “I feel like I’m about to agree. I still need to calculate the correlation and the confidence intervals. It’s going to be a chore.” </p><p>“I thought you liked math.” </p><p>“Not this,” I answered even as I jotted down the formula for how to calculate correlation. “I need to calculate this for every group by hand. Even the most basic analysis requires thousands of calculations. Without a spreadsheet program or a math engine, it’s going to take all night.” </p><p>“No, it won’t,” she said with a smug smirk. </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked, and she smirked as she wrote the numbers underneath each column. </p><p>“Here are the results.” </p><p>“What is — ahh, Intelligence,” I said. </p><p>“Exactly,” she said, her smile wide. “I told you, I’m amazing at math.” </p><p>While I didn’t treat anything that could be copied by a spreadsheet proper math, I wasn’t moronic enough to actually say that. Especially since she had just done the work of a computer with ease. “Yes, you are,” I said with a big smile. </p><p>“Good, now that you’re finished with the boring stuff…” </p><p>“Not exactly. We still have another experimental round,” I said, feeling far more enthusiastic. “But, first, do you want me to explain what exactly I’m trying to find?” </p><p>“Sure,” she said. </p><p>“I already told you that melting the metal and mixing the components is more like step zero. The real process starts when the metal starts to cool down. Just like how ice doesn’t melt immediately, all of our molten metal doesn’t exactly freeze at once. It starts with tiny seeds spread in its structure, called nucleation,” I started explaining. </p><p>She nodded, listening carefully. </p><p>“The second step is the crystal growth. Once the nuclei are formed, they start attracting the surrounding atoms, creating patterns in the metal. There are many factors for the shape of those patterns, from cooling methods to shape.” </p><p>“Is that what we are trying to do,” she asked. “Trying to trap mana in crystal patterns?” </p><p>“Somewhat. The process doesn’t stop even after the metal cools down. The metal continues to change even after cooling down, slowly settling down into a more stable state, usually affected by the chemical structure. It’s called solid-state transformation. Ideally, we need to make sure that the mana doesn’t escape even after that process is complete. But, you’re right. The initial objective is to trigger some kind of crystal structure that keeps the mana in.” </p><p>“Sounds complicated,” she said. </p><p>“Frankly, it is,” I answered. “If it wasn’t for my Perks and the help of Skills, I wouldn’t even dare to attempt it. Normally, discovering a new usable alloy requires the combined efforts of hundreds of people, state-of-the-art equipment, and years of effort. We’re using skills to bypass a lot of those steps.” </p><p>“Interesting. You’re really good at explaining. No wonder you’re a professor.” </p><p>”I wasn’t really good at the beginning, but that’s what a decade of experience gives you,” I replied. </p><p>She froze. “A … a decade. How old are you?” she gasped. “I thought you weren’t much older than me.” </p><p>I smiled. Of course, it was impressive that I started teaching that early. “I’m thirty-two, but I started teaching when I was seventeen, during the second year of my doctorate,” I said proudly. In a world filled with people obsessed with stats, it was rare that I found a chance to brag about my greatest achievement. </p><p>“T-that’s good,” she said, blushing slightly, but looked relaxed. Why her reaction had changed like that, I had no idea. But then, I shrugged. She looked happy enough, which was all that mattered. </p><p>I had experiments to run! </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 14</p><p>“… Nothing yet?” Maria asked even as I went through my notes. </p><p>I sighed. I could see that she was getting bored. While she had been interested in my lesson at first, as we reached the four-hour mark, she was getting bored. I couldn’t exactly blame her, not when her job was switched between acting as a forge and and a spreadsheet calculator. </p><p>Therefore, I needed to entertain her. Playing chess to help her pass the time would have been a nice option, as she was still entertained by demolishing me, but I couldn’t exactly split my attention between my experiment and playing chess. </p><p>It was already stretching my abilities to the limit. </p><p>I paused for a moment to compose an answer, one that I would give to a donor asking for another grant despite the failure of a previous experiment. And, the best way to do that was to sculpt even the most basic of results into something fascinating. “We have already made incredible progress,” I said. </p><p>“We did?” she asked, surprised. I didn’t blame her. </p><p>“Of course we did,” I said as I quickly scribbled some notes, which was essentially the summary of what we did, put in fancier terms. .”Look, we already have a good sense of how base metals behave. Copper holds mana longer, but has a lower capacity. Meanwhile, iron almost acts like a semiconductor when mana is concerned. Pewter helps to stabilize mana flow, while aluminum reflects. Those are critical pieces of information that we hadn’t previously possessed.” </p><p>“Really?” she said. “The numbers weren’t that different, none of them were able to hold mana longer than half a minute. Most of them were completely inert even before cooling down.” </p><p>“You’re looking at it the wrong way. We already know that various metals react differently. The reason, we don’t know yet, but we can start working on identifying it once the books on metallurgy arrive. It has to be something about their physical structure. The interaction between macro structures and atomic crystallization is promising ...” I said, and from there, I spun a rather lengthy explanation about how mana might interact with the material. </p><p>Some of that lecture was grounded on my observations about enchantments and weapons, but most of it was wild theories that sounded impressive but had no basis. </p><p>“I see,” Maria said, once again too proud to admit she lacked the context for half of my explanation. It was mean, but when facing the opportunity to experiment even more, I couldn’t refuse the chance. “Let’s continue. What’s the next step? Are we going to continue testing metals?” </p><p>Ideally, I would have continued to test the metals, at least for a month, maybe more. Even without the possibility of a lucky discovery at a certain point of mana density or cooling pattern, having a wider range of materials to test would have been incredibly beneficial. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had a feeling that if I said that out loud, her interest would evaporate immediately. I couldn’t forget the fact that while it was a very important experiment for me, it was nothing more than a way to pass the time for her. If we still had TV, she wouldn’t have even been here. </p><p>“Of course not. Now, we’re going to see how the alloys given to me by the dungeon products would work when holding mana,” I said, curious about the implications. “We’ll start with some of the common material and work our way up.” </p><p>“Are we going to do it for different sizes of coins?” she asked. </p><p>I wanted to, but once again, time constraints forced me to take some shortcuts I didn’t like. And, I much rather have a wide range of materials first before the dungeon products. “No, the earlier experimentation already gave us a good baseline for how the size affects the process. While there’s a chance for some unexpected interactions depending on the size, it’s better we work on a standard size first.” </p><p>With that, I started another set of experiments, creating hundreds of coins, each mixed with various dungeon parts based on the recipes provided by the Forge skill. </p><p>All failed, spectacularly, and obviously even without running any kind of statistical analysis. They functioned worse than ordinary metals. I thought about telling Maria that, but, at the last second, a glance at the pile of swords changed my mind. </p><p>I decided to use it as a sample. I grabbed a fresh ingot, and started smashing it with the express purpose of ruining it, every blow changing its structure. </p><p>With Inspect, I kept a careful note of every single change, trying to understand what had been going on with the process as I destroyed it slowly, section by section, stretching my Inspect to the limit as I tried to memorize the structures that let out of the mana, and comparing it with the results of the other experiments as far as I could remember. </p><p>Not exactly an easy job, even with all the guidance from the skill. I was once again fumbling in an area that I knew very little about, my three years of practice as a Blacksmith were not as useful as the few fragmented journals I was able to get. </p><p>I would pay a lot for a complete introductory book on metallurgy. Unfortunately, considering all the books I had came from ruins of the libraries, I wasn’t exactly teeming with options.</p><p>I had destroyed five more valuable ingots before I had managed to develop a decent idea of what was going on, not helped by the very complicated structure of the alloy. The ingots weren't uniform, filled with many different internal patterns, including orbs, hexagons, and diamond-like structures. </p><p>But, as I destroyed them repeatedly, I realized that the mana was exclusively held in the hexagon structures. Why, I had no idea. Maybe it was something about the shape, or maybe it was about the inoculation material it required to trap mana. </p><p>“We have a direction to experiment,” I declared. </p><p>“Really, that’s good,” she said excitedly. “Do I need to put in more mana into the flame?” </p><p>“Not yet,” I said. “Actually, you can even take a dinner break while I experiment on the structure.” </p><p>“No, it’s too exciting, I want to stay,” she said. “Maybe we can finish it tonight.” </p><p>It was certainly optimistic, but rather than trying to explain that to her, I started working once again, adding all types of dungeon products that Eleanor had provided me to help my experimentation. Crystallized monster blood, grounded armor plates, and all types of other stuff.</p><p>Some had formed the hexagonal structure I had been searching for, but not when mana was introduced. It just destabilized, refusing to form. “Can you explain to me how it feels to use mana?” </p><p>“In what way?” she asked. </p><p>“I don’t know, just general impressions. How does it feel? Is it a soft sensation, does it fight against your control. How does it feel to use mana through a skill, and how does it feel to use it directly?” </p><p>“And, you think that would help?” she said. </p><p>“Maybe. At least, it wouldn’t hurt,” I said. </p><p>She paused for a moment. “Alright. It’s a different feeling, particularly before and after using it. In the beginning, it’s like a soft current, or a calm ocean, still and waiting. But, once I touch it, it turns into a raging inferno, begging to be let out. But, a blast without control lets out nothing but an ineffectual flare.” </p><p>With a wave of her hand, she released a weak flash of fire. A second move sent a concentrated blast that melted the stone she had targeted. “Both attempts used the same amount of mana, but the first one was directionless, helpless. The second one was a concentrated blast, working on a pattern,” she said. </p><p>“Can you draw the pattern?” I asked. </p><p>“Maybe an outline,” she said, suddenly blushing. “I … I’m not the best at drawing. Too bad you can’t get magic skills as external skills,” she said. </p><p>“Why is that?” I asked. “Other than wasting a skill, of course.” </p><p>“It doesn’t work. Unless you have corresponding stat points, you can’t absorb the skill,” she explained. “Are you sure you want me to draw? It won’t look good.” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” I said, ignoring the implications of what she had revealed. It was another thing I hadn’t known. Instead, I examined the pattern she had drawn carefully. It was a complicated, confusing pattern, but I could see a vague pattern of hexagons at the center. “Does the mana flow from inside to outside?” </p><p>“Yes,” she confirmed, treating it as a casual question. It was not. A sudden inspiration hit me. Not the inspiration from Intuitive Forging — it felt distinct enough to be recognized — but a more ordinary kind, the same thing that I always felt when a mathematical model clicked in place. </p><p>“Once I reach that ocean, I give it a mental push, and the energy flows through the pattern, getting wilder and wilder until it suddenly transforms into fire.” </p><p>“Is it heat, or fire,” I asked. This time, it was to distract her as I cut my hand deliberately, bleeding some on the fire. Not just blood, but also as much Health as I could imbue, and the wound recovered immediately. </p><p>[-15 Health] </p><p>“Hard to say. How do you distinguish them —” she started, only to freeze as she sniffed. “Is that blood?” </p><p>“I was careless. A little work accident,” I said even as I showed my hand, the wound had already recovered. “Can you imbue the fire with mana as usual? Your explanation inspired me.” </p><p>“Fine,” she said, and I repeated the process. I mixed the Health I imbued into my blood as an inoculation agent while I let the hexagon pattern establish, working with a razor-sharp focus. I pulled the small piece of metal from the fire, and put it into water. </p><p>The moment I did so, I felt the familiar feedback from the System. One that confirmed my success even before I read the notification. I closed my eyes for a moment, enjoying the sense of triumph — </p><p>One that immediately turned into shock the moment I read the notification. I gaped at the result. </p><p>[Forge (Common) - 23 -&gt; Mana Forge (Rare) - 10]</p><p>I didn’t know what was more shocking: The fact that the skills could transform unaided, or the fact that they could jump two stages directly to Rare. Or that there were Production skills of that rank. Too many questions, enough to make me freeze in shock. </p><p>A shock that transformed into a different kind of shock when I heard the door open, followed by some kind of sharpness that threatened to drown me. I only calmed down when I realized it was Eleanor. “What’s going on … here,” Eleanor gasped, panicked, frowning as she looked at Maria.</p><p>At first, I thought it was because she had a bad day. Then, I followed her gaze, and blushed and turned away. Lost in my mind, I didn’t notice that her robe was rather disheveled. Understandable, as the forge was a hot place, but that didn’t make my blush any less intense. Her cleavage was rather … impressive. </p><p>“Maybe you should fix your dress, my lady,” Eleanor said pointedly. </p><p>“Sorry, it was just getting hot,” Maria replied. I avoided her gaze, not wanting to make it any more awkward. </p><p>“Yes, a fire mage got bothered by the heat. Very reasonable,” Eleanor said. Her tone sounded sarcastic, but I didn’t understand why. “Sorry Devon. There’s an emergency meeting,” she said as she dragged Maria away. </p><p>“Be ready for the leveling trip tomorrow —” Maria said. </p><p>“No. You have a thing. You can’t go,” Eleanor cut her even as they disappeared, leaving me alone in the forge. </p><p>It had been weird, but soon I pushed it aside. </p><p>I had a new skill to play with. </p><p>*****</p><p>— Chapter 15</p><p>I couldn’t help but frown as I twirled my hammer thoughtfully. The changes in my Forge skill were fascinating. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) - 10 [Intuitive Forging]]</p><p>Too bad it had come with some interesting but potentially dangerous implications. How dangerous, I had no idea, mostly because I didn’t know what was common knowledge, what was known but kept as a secret for strategic reasons, and what was genuinely secret among the elites. </p><p>I was glad that Eleanor’s awkward yet pointless intervention had been timely enough to give me a chance to come up with an explanation, bending the truth as necessary. </p><p>The first fact was the rank of the skill. The existence of rare skills wasn’t unknown, but every time I had heard about them, it was in the context of external skills, and exclusively as combat skills. That was true for basic and common skills, and especially true for uncommon skills. </p><p>There was a reason why Eleanor was able to give me that skill almost without thinking, yet failed to get even one Uncommon skill for their Blacksmiths despite their urgent need. </p><p>Rare production skills were hard to come by. </p><p>And, now, I had a Rare production skill. It would have been dangerous enough if it was an external skill. But, it was a class skill. </p><p>It was common knowledge that a common class skill was better than an external uncommon skill despite the latter granting more knowledge, for one simple reason. Class skills granted perks, while external skills did not. </p><p>This was why every warrior was obsessed with getting an improved version of their skill, improving their rarity, but still maintaining their Perk advantage.</p><p>I was aware that I didn’t know everything — a fact that was getting more and more clear with every passing day. Maybe external skills could grant Perks but require higher proficiency. Not many people focussed on improving their external skills. I was familiar with a few people with production classes who decided to focus on combat, and brought their external combat skills to forties without receiving a perk, but it was hardly conclusive evidence.</p><p>But, even if that was true and external skills began getting perks starting from level fifty, it would give my Rare skill two additional Perks, making it far more valuable than another skill. </p><p>And, in addition to all of those factors, my new skill allowed me to create mana-based alloys, which could be strategically very relevant even if the System Shop had been selling them for cheap. And, even if it was not, it was still valuable. </p><p>“Damn, what a complicated mess,” I growled. I should be feeling pure happiness rather than frustration. What happened with my skill was potentially dangerous for too many reasons. I decided to keep it a secret until I could interrogate Maria more about skills. That way, even if she didn’t reveal strategic secrets, she would reveal what was common knowledge. </p><p>“But, that’s enough gloom,” I said as I slapped my cheeks. “Let’s see what this new skill can do.” </p><p>I tapped into my skill by melting an ingot of ordinary metal, which offered me multiple recipes instinctively. Methods that only included the required materials but also a direct infusion of mana. </p><p>The first thing I realized was just how lucky I had been. My crazy weird method had apparently only worked because there was no environmental mana to interact with it when Maria infused the flames. The same technique would have failed if we were in a less hostile location.</p><p>Was that a lucky coincidence? Certainly, but I wasn’t the first scientist or inventor who had gotten lucky. Many products, from penicillin to rubber, had been discovered by accident. </p><p>Luckily, the skill had included many methods to actually use the mana present in the environment during forging, meaning I wouldn’t need to beg Maria in the hope of improving. It also meant that, as long as I was in the camp, I couldn’t do any mana forging, which was a bummer. </p><p>I wanted to play with my new toy. </p><p>”Patience,” I muttered even as I repeated the same treatment for other base metals. I had discovered about a dozen different mana ingots, mostly copper and bronze, each designed for a specific type. The variant that was used for swords was absent, and so was any iron-based recipe. </p><p>Clearly, my skill level was not high enough. </p><p>A problem that I could hopefully solve without mana. It would be very frustrating if it only improved by forging mana ingots from scratch. </p><p>Just to be comprehensive, I started by forging ordinary metal daggers. Naturally, there was no response. I spend my next three hours forging the standard dungeon-based ingots and using them to forge various small weapons. </p><p>My patience didn’t go without a reward. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) - 10 -&gt; 11]</p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I stopped using them. Ultimately, the aim of that exercise was to understand whether ordinary materials could improve the skill, or whether mana alloys were a necessity. Confirming that it was not, I happily reached for another bronze ingot and turned it into a dagger, though I still repeatedly touched the swords to give me direction. </p><p>This time, the forging process lasted much longer, more than an hour. However, I was more than happy ‘wasting’ time, because the resulting dagger was a fascinating work. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) - 11 -&gt; 16]</p><p>“A remarkable jump,” I said as I paused, processing the new recipes I had received, the number of them available to me ever increasing. “Should I delay or continue?” </p><p>For once, I didn’t care about wasting ingots. I had already wasted more than the allocated amount, but Maria’s involvement gave me a good excuse for how much I had used. After all, wasting a few extra ingots was better than wasting Maria’s day. At least, that should be convincing for Eleanor. </p><p>I stopped for a simpler reason.I was uncertain whether delaying reaching the next threshold would be a good choice. My previous success with Intuitive Forging suggested that the activities leading to the improvement impacted the perks, and the surprise improvement of the skill further confirmed it. </p><p>But, after considering it for some time, I decided against it. There were still perks I would be allowed to pick from at level fifty to consider if I wanted to modify it. Also, I had no idea what kind of perks it would offer in the first place, making it an even more complicated affair. </p><p>Then, I froze. If skills could change, and the perks at the thresholds could change, then, what about the classes? Was there a way to change them? Improve it, maybe? </p><p>A wild assumption that was supported by nothing, but not an impossibility. And, if it was true, I would learn it tomorrow when Maria escorted me to another leveling trip — unless Eleanor had her way. </p><p>“I hate testing theories on myself,” I said, but my frustration was rather meek. If my theory was wrong, it wouldn’t matter. I would continue being a Blacksmith. But, if I was correct … I didn’t even want to imagine. </p><p>Six more daggers later, I received the notification I had been looking for. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) - 16 -&gt; 25]</p><p>[Perk Options — Modify / Masterwork / Mana Manipulation] </p><p>“What an annoying reward,” I muttered. I had no idea what Modify meant, and while I knew what Masterwork was, I didn’t need it. Mana Manipulation was the best choice under the circumstances. </p><p>I wasn’t particularly worried. If worse came to worst and the perk turned out to be useless, I could always use the Perk Reset stone directly. The price of three gold, which had previously been hovering over me like an executioner’s blade, didn’t even register anymore. </p><p>“How quickly things can change.” I couldn't help feeling conflicted about it. All the benefits were also a warning. Things could improve … but also turn into disaster.</p><p>“Now, to try the next part,” I muttered and turned my attention to the available sources of mana. The ingots, and the daggers. After a momentary thought, I first turned my attention to the leftover ingots that I had destroyed during my experiments with Maria. They were already mostly useless, meaning I could play with them with ease. </p><p>A few smashes later, I had once again breached the mana they contained. However, unlike the previous time, the mana had stuck to my hammer, following it. It was a small, instinctive thing. Next to nothing. </p><p>But, next to nothing was far better than nothing. </p><p>“Let’s see if I can double-dip on the same trick.” I brought one of the daggers I had just forged, and started destroying a small section of it. When it was just a deformation, the structure could be repaired by ordinary methods. However, once the mana it had contained leaked, the suggestion of the skill had changed, needing new material to replace the section. </p><p>A suggestion I ignored. Instead, I started steadily demolishing another dagger, trying to use the mana from it to essentially reforge that tiny section with my mana. It had been a slow, wasteful process. Not only had I destroyed five daggers, but also wasted two more fresh ingots in the process. </p><p>Certainly a terrible method to use in a mana-dead location like the camp, but I didn’t care about that. </p><p>All I cared about was the notification that had appeared in front of me. </p><p>[Repair (Common) - 36 -&gt; Mana Repair (Rare) - 25]</p><p>“Success,” I said. The poetic thing would have been to throw myself into the bed with a happy smile. Instead, I scoured the forge, removing every sign of my successful experimentation. No need to ruin everything due to a bout of carelessness. I didn’t worry about oversleeping. Since my leaving trip with Maria had been most likely canceled, I had a rare chance to spend a morning in bed. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t have a nice cup of coffee to enjoy once I woke up. Sometimes, the loss of the small comforts hurt the worst. </p><p>Dreaming of a steaming cup, I continued to work. In the end, I barely managed to drag myself to bed, but as I slept, I was happier than I ever remembered being since the Cataclysm… </p><p>I had missed the sweet taste of success… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as I wanted to spend a long time in the ruins, I did not. The beast wave that had been triggered by my operations at the ruins was too big. I could have dealt with the beasts, but there were too many Golden Core cultivators around the region. </p><p>I didn’t want to risk facing them. </p><p>So, instead of staying in and examining the ruins, I just picked anything that I could feel an echo of Everdawn Essence, and anything with some kind of writing. </p><p>I needed the material to decipher the written language, which was different than anything that was included in the language jade I had consumed. </p><p>When I went back to the safe house I created, I removed the isolation ward, examining the sudden beast wave. It was interesting. Previously, the beasts had been rushing toward the ruins with a singleminded determination. But, once I had removed the isolation ward and the ruins reappeared, that determination stalled. </p><p>Instead, they did what a bunch of beasts that had been forcibly gathered would do. They started killing each other. Their fight had extended into the ruins, destroying it even further. </p><p>“That’s good news,” I said even as I worked hard to disassemble the safe house and bring everything with me, both the plants and the other things. It was good because it suggested that whatever control the mist had was less like a true intelligence, and more like some kind of automated problem. </p><p>At least, that was true at the outskirts. </p><p>I didn’t immediately go to my second safe house. Instead, I moved deeper into the mist and picked a second location for myself. One that I could turn into a more permanent base I could use to replenish the reserves of the flying boat. </p><p>My initial plan was to choose one of the five and reinforce it. Unfortunately, I couldn’t risk that someone else might visit me. </p><p>In the end, I picked a mountain that took almost two hours to arrive with my boat. Trying to walk would have taken months, and even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would take a few days to move. Only when I replanted the spiritual plants and started generating the necessary amount of Qi, I dug a deep cave.</p><p>And, carefully categorized everything I had acquired. Shards of pottery, some still carrying interesting designs, telling the broken stories of religious ceremonies or heroic battles. Now, it was a tomb for a civilization, its whispers muted by the wind.</p><p>“It’s weird how perspective can change,” I muttered. Just a year ago, I would have treated any museum as a pointless distraction that a bunch of snub intellectuals maintained to lord over others. However, now that I somehow found myself responsible for the safety of billions, it was different. </p><p>They turned into a warning, reminding me of the potential cost of failure. If I failed, billions of people might have ended up the same way. </p><p>“Depressing,” I said as I shook my head, and focused on more practical concerns. I focused on a large fresco, depicting what must be an Emperor, the symbol of Everdawn clear, his face noble and wise, his hand outstretched in a gesture of victory. </p><p>The writing underneath was a good basis for deciphering their language. Which was complicated, as translating a language without knowing a word was difficult. </p><p>But, not impossible. </p><p>Admittedly, the only reason I even thought I could decipher the language was my own calligraphy skill. It allowed me to, for the lack of a better word, catch glimpses of intent, particularly with the pieces that still had an echo of intent. </p><p>I knelt down, carefully brushing away the dust from various pieces as I tried to put together the language. Though, it wasn’t as easy. </p><p>It cost me a full week. </p><p>I had stopped by the base of the conspiracy, hoping that there was some kind of dictionary there, but there was not. All the material they had had been translated into the current language. </p><p>During that week, I visited Janassa a few times, getting a few rewards for the Kartpa Alchemy technique. It didn’t push it over Minor Familiarity, but it was to be expected. My other objective was to see whether learning techniques had caused the same fluctuation. </p><p>It did not, or at least, the fluctuation had been small enough to avoid my notice. </p><p>I was tempted to repeat the experiment on other objects, but I delayed for the moment, choosing to focus on exploring the ruins, which took most of the week. In the end, I managed to get not only a working understanding of their language but also a very rough understanding of the Everdawn Empire.</p><p>I was lucky enough to come across many history books in the ruins, which, even in their destroyed state, revealed a lot about the Empire, which gave me a better understanding of it. </p><p>I had already known that they had been huge before their destruction, but learning that they were large enough to cover up the whole oversized continent, and did so for thousands of years — at least what the scraps claimed — was even more than I expected. </p><p>There were rough mentions of occasional rival kingdoms popping up and being destroyed, but those had been merely in the background. There were many mentions of kings, but the context implied that they were some kind of subordinate to the Emperor, often family members. </p><p>I didn’t need to guess that it was a bad idea, as even the scarps of historical information I was able to gather had mentions of too many rebellions. Still, even with those, their aim seemed to be taking over as the Emperor rather than breaking the Empire. </p><p>Of course, those events had been classified as rightful heirs saving the Empire from traitors and corrupt emperors who lost their mandate, but I didn’t take those parts too seriously. It was clear that the books had been written for propaganda. </p><p>Considering the working principles of Everdawn Essence, I was pretty sure that the existence of a great number of historical records was not just about the ego of the Empire. Everdawn Martial arts required devotion, every single book reinforced the loyalty toward the Empire. </p><p>As I read that, one obvious strategy to get strong appeared in my mind. I could go deeper into the mist, and try to take over the position of the Empire. But, I ignored that thought the moment it appeared. It was too reckless for my taste. </p><p>Instead, I continued to patiently parse through the texts, trying to learn more. Despite thousands of years of history, the society that the books described had been strangely static, which would have been interesting if I hadn’t already seen the same thing with the cultivators and the mortal kingdoms. </p><p>The only other interesting thing was the mentions of the martial sects, but their presence had been contentious at best. Barely a few mentions, and always referring to them as traitors and betrayers. It made an interesting reading, mostly because the style of their mentions didn’t feel like they were written by the same people. </p><p>It was hard to describe properly. It was more of a subtle feeling I got through calligraphy, which was muddled further by the age of the books. But, those bare mentions of rebellion introduced a sense of discord across the text, like someone had picked an impressionist painting, and painted a fruit bowl to the corner in a different style. </p><p>Together with the other events, it gave me a better — though still dubious — understanding of what was going on. The Everdawn Empire was the dominant party, but not enough to completely unify the whole land. There were semi-independent kings, and even more independent martial arts sects, which, at one point, decided to rebel in a more wholesale manner. </p><p>I immediately made it a priority to discover one of these martial arts sects and see how their martial arts worked. </p><p>I needed to see if they were more similar to Everdawn Saber, or Tiger Fist. </p><p>So, the rest of my time, I spent trying to put together a more reliable map that described the local area, and comparing it with the old map of the Everdawn Empire, hoping to give me a better idea of how to find one of the martial sects. </p><p>However, even as I continued to dig through the historical records and other scraps I managed to discover, I noticed another suspicious point. </p><p>Nothing I had read had even a mention of Qi cultivators, immortals, or anything similar. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t have the time to focus on that yet. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>For once, I didn’t feel tense as I used my flying boat to cut through the mysterious existence that was misty mountains. With my new formation in place to isolate me from the effects, I wasn’t feeling tense as I went deeper and deeper. </p><p>My destination was the location of the first ruin, one that I had learned from my prisoner. Luckily, thanks to the primitive lie detection setup I had, I knew which locations had been genuine, and which destinations were filled with danger. </p><p>I still wanted to visit the dangerous ones, for one simple reason. Danger meant their exploration hadn’t been completed, and I could find more. But, at the same time, they contained dangers that intimated a Foundation Establishment cultivator who was experienced in exploring the ruins. </p><p>No, I wanted to start with the ruins that had been explored. I had multiple reasons for it. The obvious one was the risk mitigation, as the more people visited the ruin, the less dangerous it would be. While I should be stronger than anyone else who visited those ruins when the full range of my abilities factored in, I wasn’t ready to take unnecessary risks before I understood the true limits of the martial artists.</p><p>After all, the only information I had came from two incomplete techniques and nothing else. </p><p>However, another reason was that I was hopeful about the content of the ruins. While many visits from other cultivators meant that anything valuable had long been pilfered, I wasn’t looking for fortune, but information. </p><p>Anything. Random scribbles, letters between ordinary people, nonsensical historical records. </p><p>My ultimate goal was to discover the secrets of the Everdawn Empire, which would allow me to understand exactly what Kartpa Valley was trying to do, which then would give me an idea about how to counter it. </p><p>However, that was far from my only objective. I wanted to learn how the Everdawn Empire was destroyed and why. I wanted to understand why their techniques didn’t earn a response from the System. Were there any other lost techniques that had the same feature, or was it something unique to the Everdawn Empire? </p><p>And, the most important auxiliary mission, that whether I could use that feature to my benefit. The ability to get stronger without ruining my multiplier would have been an incredible advantage. </p><p>“Well, it’s going to be difficult,” I muttered once I arrived at the first location. Then my prisoner had mentioned ruins, I expected some kind of abandoned town, or some kind of poorly managed archeological site.</p><p>I was wrong. </p><p>It looked more like a warzone. The only thing I could recognize as manmade was the bricks of the buildings, and even none of those had been intact. Some had been crushed into pieces, while the others had been cut into pieces in a very deliberate manner. </p><p>“Well, it’s going to be fun,” I said to myself even as I set two layers of formations around it to temporarily protect myself from the mist, and started searching. Without using formations, I couldn’t have discovered even a scrap of information from the runs. </p><p>I ran a hand over the weathered bricks. “What a waste,” I said, trying to piece together what seemed like intricate carvings depicting some kind of heroic man, one that clearly told a story before it had been destroyed, with only fragmented remnants remaining. </p><p>I started examining the ruins, trying to come up with the age of the buildings. The destruction was quite recent, that much was obvious, but the original age of the settlement was harder to detect. However, even my most conservative guess started at thousands of years. </p><p>Clearly, the excessive distances and absurd population numbers weren’t the only troubling part of this new world. </p><p>I had spent half a day in the ruins, trying to find something worthwhile. The best I could able to get was a few scraps of writing, on a language I couldn’t read, and even those, I was only able to find based on some very tricky formations I had used. </p><p>With a sigh, I had visited a second ruin, once again failing to discover anything other than scraps of murals and writing. </p><p>“Alright, it looks like I can’t avoid the risk,” I muttered even as I moved toward the first ruins that my prisoner believed dangerous enough to kill me. For that, I had far more different plans. </p><p>First, I picked a nice valley near the ruins and added several layers of formations. Outer layers were the obvious parts, such as protection, concealment, and isolation from the mist. The inner layer, on the other hand, had been focused on spiritual plant care. </p><p>It was a good place to set my first checkpoint. </p><p>My initial plan was to visit the capital and use one of the martial artists to launder a great number of spiritual plant seeds to quickly set up a huge checkpoint. Unfortunately, feeling the fluctuations of providence when I had used to get the Heaven-ranked pill from Janassa had been enough for me to temporarily cancel that plan.</p><p>Especially after that chance encounter with the Nascent Soul cultivator. Even if his presence was unrelated to me — which there was no guarantee — I couldn’t just assume that he wouldn’t notice it. </p><p>I decided to temporarily add a few rules. Unless it was an emergency, not to use the System for anything but learning. Improving my capabilities permanently was worth the risk. </p><p>Trying to save time was not so much, particularly since I could use a combination of alchemy and formations to automate the process significantly. I transplanted the potted plants and reinforced the formations before I went back to Markas. </p><p>I replenished the Qi reserves of the flying boat while I added a secondary garden, focused on growing plants that gave the most Qi with the least amount of work. When the boat had been filled, the first batch of seeds had already matured — even though it meant I had temporarily slowed down the growth of the ginseng garden. </p><p>Then, I started going back and forth. My prisoner had given me the address of five ruins with a certain amount of risk. I built safe houses near every ruin, making sure I had a place to escape in case of an emergency, while also giving them time to accumulate some Qi. </p><p>I wished that there was a lot of ambient Qi, but that wasn’t the case. I was still on the outskirts, and the best I could get was occasional winds carrying a few strands of Qi. While it had been a treasure when I had been first trying to grow as a cultivator, it meant next to nothing for my current purposes. </p><p>Technically, I could use it. All I needed to set up a formation as big as one I had around the capital and Markas, and it could collect the environmental Qi. Large enough scale and it would be efficient. </p><p>It would also be very noticeable. I might as well put a giant board shouting my location. </p><p>Establishing all five safe houses meant that, when I was finished with the fifth one, the first one had already accumulated enough Qi for me to start moving. I added several temporary formations on top of the first one, confirming that I was currently alone. </p><p>As I put the isolation formation over the ruins, a bunch of savage beasts rushed toward the ruins. They were strong, some of them strong enough to kill the Foundation Establishment cultivator. </p><p>With my formation in place, they weren’t any kind of threat. They represented an excellent source of essence fertilizer for my base rather than any kind of threat. </p><p>However, their sheer numbers would have been enough to kill my prisoner. It didn’t make sense, as I was almost certain. </p><p>I expanded the detection area, only to realize that even more beasts were gathering at a greater distance. It was too excessive. It would easily kill a Foundation Establishment cultivator. </p><p>“The mist,” I said in realization. I had already realized that the mist had some kind of control. And, I had just isolated the ruins from the mist, which might register like destruction. </p><p>I reinforced that isolation several times, as well as the detection. I was afraid of a potential cultivator visit as much as I feared the beasts, so I didn’t want to get ambushed. </p><p>Only after I felt secure, I walked into the ruins. It was different than the previous ones, where every single stone had been bisected or crushed in hopes of discovering a secret. It was still a mess. Every building had been smashed down, some with time, most through direct cultivator interference. </p><p>“Interesting,” I muttered even as I touched one of the intact bricks. Unlike the demolished ruins, I could feel a hint of essence locked in their structure. Not particularly strong. Barely an echo, but I could still identify the traces of Everdawn essence. </p><p>It was only possible because of my refreshed martial talent. </p><p>Only a few of those buildings had that kind of echo, while the rest had been made of more ordinary materials. It gave me a handy way of identifying which of the half-destroyed buildings were more important. </p><p>A welcome direction. </p><p>I started dismantling the first building, which rewarded me with the burnt remains of a few books. Still, I could get some information, which was all I needed. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Visiting Janassa had been relatively straightforward. I just needed to ask her a couple of questions, and she was more than happy to turn that into a long, detailed lesson, more than happy to go even deeper about the practical aspects of the technique. </p><p>However, even with that, it took three days for detailed, repeated work for me to get the next reward I had been working for, one that had been only possible thanks to her breakthrough in the process. Not just her cultivation, but also my understanding. </p><p>Thanks to my growing understanding of the more advanced parts of her technique, I not only asked some ‘accidental’ questions to lead her to better understand her own problems relating to the more advanced parts of the technique, but I also added some insights about the technique on the merit purchase system I created for her. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 40; Pity Bonus - 50 (Capped)]</p><p>[90x Return - Kartpa Alchemy Technique Lesson - Beginner, Minor Familiarity]</p><p>“Thank you for your kindness, mistress,” I said as another lesson ended. “Now, I have disturbed your cultivation enough…” </p><p>“Nonsense,” she replied with a kind smile. “You can visit me anytime. I like teaching alchemy.” </p><p>I bowed before I left, leaving her to study the latest set of alchemy insights she had purchased from the System. While I wanted to increase my proficiency even more, even the most optimistic estimation told me that increasing to Major Familiarity alone would require something around a month. </p><p>Or, I could just let her study her alchemy for a while I can start searching for a Foundation Establishment pill recipe, and focus on boosting her cultivation. Increasing both the multiplier and her cultivation would make the same improvement process much faster. </p><p>Once I left her behind, I triggered the latest reward, and my mind was filled with another flood of alchemy information, which luckily included quite a lot of medical information. Including, how to completely cleanse the essence of a martial artist.</p><p>I wanted to use that on myself, as my improving apothecary knowledge included quite a bit of information about how repeated usage of martial arts slowly transformed the body. Of course, that information was mostly geared toward how to hasten the transformation, which would make the martial artist even stronger.</p><p>Luckily, there was some information about how to reverse that and cleanse the martial basis completely. It was there as a counter, as these techniques were more geared toward healing enemy attacks. Apparently,, some martial essences acted like a disease, infecting and ruining the enemy through essence attacks. </p><p>The information included was to remove that infection on the surface level, but my combined alchemy and apothecary knowledge allowed me to reverse engineer to completely remove that. However, it was a painful, invasive process that risked damaging the martial arts foundation of the target, which was why I had gone to the newest garden I had for ginseng plants. </p><p>I first uprooted one of the smaller plants that had been growing, which, under the forced growth of the formation and spiritual fertilizer, had already reached a maturity that it would take a hundred years outside. </p><p>However, it would barely count as a Medium Black Rank. Incredible considering the time I had spent, but not exactly impossibly rare. </p><p>A rule of thumb for alchemy was that the quality of the materials created an upper bound for the pills that could be created. However, those rules were for people who didn’t have proficiency in of techniques three major ranks. </p><p>Minor Familiarity with the Kartpa alchemy technique was like being a solid-C college student trying to solve an elementary school question. While lacking the corresponding Nascent Soul technique meant that I had no idea how to use a complicated concept like Providence to refine pills, those advanced techniques were still applicable for a relatively basic pill like a martial aptitude pill. </p><p>Particularly since I could use the spiritual vein to supply a wasteful amount of Qi from to smooth out any problem. </p><p>The refining process took one hour, and, as the flames around the cauldron were removed, I was looking at a beautiful round pill with an excellent smell. </p><p>Earth Low-Grade, three minor steps higher than the material I had used. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I muttered, but I didn’t decide to consume it immediately. Or, decided to use the Heaven-ranked ginseng plant to refine another pill. Why should I, when I already had a helpful assistant that could help me improve it.  </p><p>I noticed Janassa had already made her choice about the reward. Insights about the Kartpa technique, which she still didn’t know the true name of. </p><p>I spent twenty minutes filling out several pages, my calligraphy allowing me to embed the insights I had learned from the latest reward, including some entry points to the Foundation Establishment stage. Then, I sent that through the delivery formation … along with a small gift bundle of rewards that included an Earth-grade martial aptitude pill. </p><p>I then spent an hour working on the garden, selecting a great number of mature plants that generated the most spirit energy, placing them in pots, and filling the deck of my spiritual boat. </p><p>Those plants weren’t enough to support the consumption of the boat, but in preparation for my visit to the mist. Once that was complete, I visited Janassa again, carrying a freshly brewed pot of tea with me. A little idle chatter and a few wistful glances were all that I needed for her to give me a gift. </p><p>An Earth Grade martial aptitude pill that I could use to study.</p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 40; Pity Bonus - 50 (Capped)]</p><p>[90x Return - Martial Aptitude Pill - Heaven High-Grade]</p><p>“The story is really important,” I decided even as I left Janassa alone for her studies, and went to the center of the formation. If I tried to give me a sword or something similar, I probably would have to work hard to convince her to gift me it out of pity. </p><p>However, my story as a captive of the inheritance land trying to learn alchemy to get my freedom did the job for me. </p><p>“Let’s see what Heaven ranked pill looks like,” I said to myself even as I pulled it out of my inventory … and the world around me shifted. </p><p>It was a subtle change, one that I could have ignored easily if I wasn’t in a location where every little detail had been controlled by me. </p><p>Providence around me had shifted. </p><p>It wasn’t just my fate that changed, that much I could feel. It wasn’t even the karma between me and Janassa that changed, but the Heavenly Providence around me. </p><p>It weakened. </p><p>That weakening was very slight, and I might have not noticed it if it wasn’t related to alchemy, as my understanding of Providence was very spotty. I didn’t know what happened. </p><p>Not even to have an educated guess. </p><p>As much as I wanted to start experimenting, I couldn’t do so. Any experiment would take a lot of time, and getting anything reliable before I could improve my understanding of Providence would have been a waste. </p><p>I had more urgent missions to deal with. </p><p>First, I used Qi to completely cleanse my body of any hint of the essence, completely destroying my martial cultivation in the process, using three hundred and sixty acupuncture needles as a medium. It was an invasive, destructive process that had ruined my martial talent completely, but with the Heaven Ranked pill in hand, it wasn’t exactly a problem. </p><p>Instead, I swallowed the Heaven Ranked pill. </p><p>If I didn’t have a lot of concentrated essence pills to consume, and Qi to quickly process it, the pill might have actually killed me. Instead, it had reshaped my body to the smallest detail, turning my body into a finely tuned wonder designed for martial arts. </p><p>A painful process, but it was worth it. I could feel that a subtle weight over me had disappeared, as I had just left a job that I hated. It was subtle but distinct. </p><p>Too bad I couldn’t simply practice a new set of martial arts immediately. </p><p>Instead, I went back to the base and kidnapped multiple martial artists, both Everdawn and Tiger Fist — a process that wasn’t particularly difficult thanks to the secret entrance I had integrated — and on the way, I had also kidnapped a few itinerant cultivators that were exploring the mountain. </p><p>All of them, I kept at the outskirts of the misty mountains, and started experimenting on formations around them, trying to block the effect of the mist. I had long discovered how the mist supported Everdawn while forcing some kind of subtle transformation, while it attacked Tiger fist disciples. </p><p>I tried to come up with a formation that could block the effect. I didn’t want the same mist invading my body. The Qi cultivators were there as a control group. </p><p>Luckily, while I didn’t understand how mist worked, blocking its effects didn’t seem to be too complicated. It was more tedious. A combined system of purification and cleansing talismans, integrated into a formation that controlled air inflow and outflow like a complicated air conditioner seemed to be enough. </p><p>I was ready to explore the Misty Mountains. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You look tired,” was Eleanor’s first words when she visited me the next morning, pushing a huge cart that was taller than her with ease. It weighed at least three tons, but stats were useful for more than just fighting. </p><p>“I want to make sure I don’t disappoint you,” I said, which was once again not exactly the truth. However, keeping the supervisor unaware of the intricacies of the experiment budget was never a bad idea. </p><p>I was simply lost in the excitement of experimentation. The man from the solitary shell only allowed me to make two more attempts, and only with smaller pieces. Both had been abject failures, but they provided enough data for me to gather some clues. </p><p>I had enough of the first blue crystal and the herb to start experimenting. It wasn’t enough to even get close to success. For now, anything that managed to stabilize was roughly as strong as a sandcastle, but I wasn’t after the end result. </p><p>No, I needed to understand the process of crystallization and the shape of macrostructures. That was only the first step before I could start the real experimentation. Too bad I lacked the necessary background, and relied on a knowledge base that was cobbled together. </p><p>“Good. I hope they will be useful,” she said as she pulled the cover of the cart, and showed that it had not only contained all types of metals but also piles and piles of broken shells. “Would that be enough?” </p><p>“Not even close, but it will be good enough to start,” I said, not willing to turn down my only mana source. She looked surprised. “I can try to ration them, but using them excessively would allow me to process them faster. Since they are garbage, what’s the harm.” </p><p>She frowned. “Bringing them here might be suspicious,” she admitted. </p><p>“You’re the commander. I’m sure you can find a good reason,” I said, already touching them to test their mana content. A slight frown appeared on my face as I noticed some of them had much less mana than the others. The smaller they were, or the dirtier they looked, the more mana they had lost. </p><p>I realized why the System shop only bought the undamaged ones. The moment they shattered, they started to leak mana. </p><p>“Something wrong?” she asked. </p><p>“No, it’s just that the older ones look like they have decayed somewhat. The fresh ones would work better,” I replied. </p><p>“Should I not bother with the old ones?”</p><p>“No, the more, the better,” I said. “Maybe there’s some benefit to using decayed ones.” It might even be the truth. Using organic materials for alloy making was not exactly a topic that science had covered. Even if someone explored it, it was probably nothing more than a niche field. </p><p>How I wished I still had the internet. </p><p>Once she was done with the delivery, I expected her to leave, but I noticed that she was still waiting with a smirk on her face. “What’s going on?” I asked. </p><p>“I have another delivery,” she said as she threw me a backpack. I opened it, only for my eyes to widen. It was filled with papers. Mostly magazines, with several journals mixed in. I pulled out the first journal, flicking it with excitement that I had never shown before the Cataclysm. </p><p>Most scientific articles were boring, derivative articles that merely introduced a fraction of new knowledge while they pandered pointlessly, only minutely different from a hundred other articles I could find with a quick query. </p><p>But, with that option gone, every article represented the crystallization of human ingenuity, with ideas I could never come up with on my own. </p><p>I flipped the first article, reading the abstract out loud. “A two-dimensional mathematical model for a process of solidification of a binary alloy in the presence of an electric field as a free boundary problem.” </p><p>“So, useless?” Eleanor asked. I turned to look at her, and she flinched and took a step back. I took a deep breath, realizing that I might have got … a tad angry. “Not useless?” </p><p>“Of course not,” I said. </p><p>“But, there’s no electricity anymore. It doesn’t work with mana, even in the dead zones.” </p><p>What she had said was true. During the first year of the Cataclysm, there had been a lot of attempts to restart technology. Three main targets were steam, gunpowder, and electricity. </p><p>Among the three, electricity had been the one that had been abandoned first, for a very simple reason: Mana didn’t get along well with electricity. Once they mixed in, the results were unpredictable. Sometimes, it fizzled and melted, sometimes it exploded. I didn’t know if anyone properly completed those experiments in mana dead zones, but considering monsters let out mana when they died, I didn’t know how much it would have mattered. </p><p>The gunpowder and steam had been abandoned for simpler, logistical reasons. </p><p>Ironically, the reason gunpowder had been ignored was the reverse of the process it had led to its adaptation. During the fifteenth century, gunpowder weapons were less powerful and less accurate than the bow and arrow, yet it had been adapted because training an archer took years, it required immense strength, and making arrows was much slower than making small metal balls. </p><p>The exact opposite was true for our circumstances. With the System, a decent archer required mere days to turn into a marksman that could comfortably compete in the Olympics, the physical strength came from leveling up, and ammunition could be simply purchased from System shops, and reused for a long time. </p><p>That had been true the first few days, and it was even truer now. At this point, where people could heal from a lot of wounds, gunpowder weapons simply lacked the necessary stopping power. </p><p>The steam engine, on the other hand, could have been technically useful, but a simpler fact stopped it. While steam and fire weren’t as volatile as electricity when interacting with mana, it was still enough to make the idea of a steam engine made of ordinary metal useless. </p><p>The alloys that the blacksmiths could forge could be useful, but that meant a radical increase in cost. A steam engine had to be large to be useful, which meant at least five tons of metal. A ridiculous amount, considering a sword required less than four pounds, and the ingots the System sold were usually between one and two pounds. </p><p>A steam engine took enough metal to arm a whole town. Hardly an acceptable tradeoff, particularly since anyone with high strength could match the power of a steam engine. </p><p>It was for a reason our old technology had been abandoned, which I was more than alright with. It was how technology worked. </p><p>What truly rankled me was abandoning the process of science with it. </p><p>I took a deep breath, suppressing my desire to deliver a long explanation. “It doesn’t matter if electricity doesn’t work. We can’t use the process described in the articles in any case. They are not exactly manufacturing plans. I need them to give me ideas to try.” </p><p>“And, it’ll work?” </p><p>“It worked to drop the repair time to eight minutes,” I said, ignoring the temptation to inform her that I had already reduced it even more. No, that part could wait. I needed it in case my other experiments failed. “But, as I said, I can’t promise results, not until I can find a proper direction.” </p><p>She looked unconvinced, but after a while, she shrugged. “You’re, the expert, professor,” she said before turning and walking away. </p><p>I could see that she was trying to annoy me by tackling that last part, but I didn’t care. I was more interested in going through all the books. Not all of them were about material sciences, but related topics. Mechanics, control systems, thermodynamics… None of them were particularly useful for a blacksmith, but I was still happy about their presence. </p><p>More information was not something I would turn my nose to. Just because they weren’t immediately needed didn’t make them useless. </p><p>My first real disappointment was about the condition of the material. Not all books were intact. Some of them were half-burned, while the others were missing pages, moldy, or dirty enough to make reading a chore. </p><p>It was clear that whoever had them treated them as garbage. “What a disappointing loss,” I muttered even as I carefully went through every book and journal, categorizing the information they contained. </p><p>Once that was done, I started reading the first article, a summary of the performance of two different industrial casting processes of aluminum with regard to their final tensile strength.</p><p>The actual conclusion part of the article was useless. First, I didn’t work with aluminum, and even if I did, I was hardly at a point of caring which of the two methods would be more useful, when both processes were optimized to create several tons of metal for every batch, for plants that probably created a thousand tons each day. </p><p>The sense of scale between our old and new world was worlds apart. </p><p>I read it carefully, because the article went quite a bit in detail about the merits of various types of water cooling, and, in the process, went into a lot of detail on how hydrogen bubbles could damage the integrity of the metal, and how a certain combination of iron salts could be used as a solution. The process was roughly similar to the impact of the second crystal. </p><p>By comparing the information provided in the article with what was provided by the System, my mind was churning a lot of new ideas. </p><p>Before even finishing the article, I had six experimental setups I wanted to try, and that was merely the first article.</p><p>“We’re going to have a lot of fun,” I said as I looked at the rest of the books. Mathematical sociology might be my one true love … but sometimes, there was no harm in straying. </p><p>Not when I could feel another revolutionary development ahead of me. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“And, that’s the last piece,” she said as she placed the forge. Thanks to its nature, it had been easy to carry, though how she excused its extraction from the forge building, I didn’t know … or care. All I needed was to connect the fire to the building chimney, and that would be enough. </p><p>“I’ll start working immediately,” I said, looking at the pile of dungeon materials. A lot of crystals, and some herbs, but the most attention-grabbing thing was the pieces of a large shell. “Is this from the dungeon creature?” I said. </p><p>“Yes. That’s the most common enemy. Some kind of distorted bug with a few weak points, that releases some kind of acid spell when dying. It destroys the weapons.” </p><p>“And, I’m guessing using hammers is not an option.” </p><p>“No,” she replied. “If the shell is broken, the System Store doesn’t take the purchase,” she said. </p><p>“Do you mind if I quickly check something,” I said. She nodded, and I touched the object. Thanks to the meditation, I could feel that the shells contained quite a bit of mana in them. </p><p>“Good,” I said, smiling as I examined it. </p><p>“What do you mean, good?” she asked. </p><p>“It's good material. High tensile strength, probably stress resistant as well,” I said. “Promising for experimentation.” </p><p>That was patently not true. I was excited because I could use those shells to practice my skills. I didn’t feel guilty or felt like I was really cheating them. I could always pay them back by reducing the repair time even further. To their knowledge, it was still around eight minutes. </p><p>“Don’t expect to have a lot of them,” she said. “They are the greatest income source of the dungeon. The System store purchases them without a limit.” </p><p>“For how much?” I asked. </p><p>“Twenty silver coins for now,” she said. My eyes widened. That was good money. “Hopefully, it won’t drop too much once the number of shells increases.” </p><p>“The shops do that?” I asked. </p><p>“Sometimes,” she replied. “They can be difficult to predict. Sometimes, the price drop is permanent, and sometimes it just fluctuates.” </p><p>“Do you mind if I try something?” I said, curious how the mana would react. I broke a corner, only for a small plume of mana to burst out. However, the pieces still maintained their mana content, That was good news. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>“I have to break them for my experiments,” I said. “So, you don’t have to bring me the intact ones. Just bring me the damaged ones. The more, the better.” </p><p>“Do you really need that many samples?” she asked. </p><p>“Edison had run more than ten thousand tests before inventing the lightbulb,” I replied. It was a gross misrepresentation of the real process, but fibbing the history of technology wasn’t the worst thing I had done today. </p><p>“Alright, the broken shells should still be near the dungeon. I’ll make sure to arrange their delivery. Same with the metals.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, not bothering to hide my happiness. Once she disappeared at the end of the stairs, I was alone in the basement. My smile was even bigger as I destroyed a small corner of the shell. Its mana content was far denser … but I noticed something interesting. </p><p>The mana from the monsters was a little cloudy. I only noticed that while meditating. Absorbing took almost four times longer, the meditation skill separating some kind of chaff from it. I had no doubt that it would be very inconvenient for a mage, who’d spend a lot of mana fighting. </p><p>For me, it was a benefit, as that cloudy effect made the mana stick together longer. When I destroyed a bronze ingot, I was barely able to absorb a tenth. With the shell, I was able to absorb more than half before it dispersed. </p><p>[+1 Mana]</p><p>Excellent efficiency. “Maybe I’ll be able to improve the process even further,” I muttered. However, as tempting as it was to start playing around, I decided to delay it until the broken pieces had arrived. I needed to look like I was working. </p><p>A tidy workspace was a good first step … a good step that had paid off in an unexpected way. A familiar surge from Mana Forge skill gave me a recipe for a new alloy, which used two of the crystals, the shell, and one of the herbs to be mixed in for some reason. </p><p>It also required a lot of mana for every ingot, which meant it couldn’t be done in the dead zone efficiently. </p><p>“What an interesting coincidence,” I muttered. Along with the recipe, came a lot of information. Information that included some kind of anti-corrosion property. It would have helped the profitability of the dungeon immensely. </p><p>Too bad I had no plans of revealing my mana forging to them as it touched my secrets. </p><p>“But, that doesn’t mean I can’t try to replicate a weaker version of the effect,” I replied. After all, they didn’t need a perfect solution, just a workable one. If I could come up with an alloy that didn’t require mana, the other blacksmiths could replicate it easily. </p><p>It shouldn’t be impossible. The System didn’t include any such recipe, but it didn’t matter. It was just like repairing the edge. The System didn’t include any direction that couldn’t be defined as perfect. </p><p>But, even an imperfect copy wouldn’t be easy. I would probably need to start with creating a few ingots to understand the nature of the alloy, not just its final properties, but also the in-between steps. </p><p> Then, I need to turn that into a dagger and test it on the dungeon beasts, as well as the other weapons to understand exactly how the corrosion effect impacts the metal, and see if that could be achieved without mana. </p><p>Which would be followed by hundreds of attempts as I tried to come up with a stable alloy that didn’t shatter immediately and resisted corrosion. </p><p>Still, I was hopeful, mostly because I didn’t need anything that was close to usable in any other context. It can be brittle enough to shatter after a dozen blows, which would have been unacceptable for any other condition. </p><p>But, not here. As long as they could kill four to five beasts without shattering the weapon, it would be profitable. </p><p>“Excellent,” I muttered even as I continued to tidy the workshop. The best thing, even if their bronze supply was not cut, it would make sense for them to continue funding my experiments. The money I would consume would be nothing compared to their potential benefit. </p><p> Even better, once I found a method, I could release multiple versions of the same metal, slightly improving its performance every time. </p><p>That trick had been good enough for the academic papers. It would be good enough for this as well. </p><p>“If all goes well, I should be able to make enough money to get a position in the research institute.” </p><p>Bribery was not something I wanted to resort to, but it was better than the alternative. However, I didn’t want to hurry up. My previous failure had taught me a good lesson about the importance of emergency funds.</p><p>As much as it rankled me to delay my return to the scientific community, I had learned my lesson. “And, it doesn’t mean I have to delay my research. I can always pay Rosie to collect some data for me, and focus on exploring the System in the process.” </p><p>I smiled happily as I got the fire going while I systematically destroyed half of the shell, carefully absorbing the mana that was let out. </p><p>[Mana 14/160]</p><p>For anyone else, that was not a notable amount of mana. For me, it represented my first opportunity to forge a mana alloy. Not even a full ingot, but barely a piece as big as my thumb. </p><p>It was a copper alloy, which was a happy occasion. Copper was one of the easiest metals to process, which was why it had been the first metal humans had used en masse. </p><p>Of course, it was also soft and brittle enough to incentivize the first primitive attempts at metallurgy, forcing the ancient people to actually experiment until they discovered bronze, which fueled our first real civilization, an ancient bronze civilization that sprawled across the Mediterranean sea, with the first global web of trade between Egypt, Hittite, Greece, as well as other European and Asian civilizations, all to ensure a steady supply of tin and copper. </p><p>Unfortunately, once international trade collapsed, so did those civilizations… The Bronze Age collapse was one of my favorite periods to study as I tried to map the impact of a similar collapse on our civilization. </p><p>Three years after the Cataclysm, I was ready to acknowledge the irony… </p><p>“Less pondering, more working,” I spoke to myself even as I started working on forging a copper mana alloy, following the suggestions from the skill as I melted the copper. The process had been relatively simple. The recipe included two different crystals, both finely ground, one herb, and a coarsely ground shell of the dungeon monster. </p><p>Mix the first crystal to molten copper, then burn the herb right underneath and let the crystal absorb the energy it radiated. Let it cool down to a red-hot state before starting to temper the metal and fold a few times, then start to add the coarsely ground monster shells while folding the metal, using the mana to keep the process stable and grow the crystals, keeping the metal merely red hot at the process. </p><p>The second crystal was to be mixed with the water, and used to quench the metal once the forging was complete. </p><p>A simple process that failed spectacularly, which was not a surprise. Not only did using the recipes from the system not always guarantee success — the level of the user, in particular, impacted the results quite a bit due to benefit from the stats, and skill level played an even bigger role — but also I wasn’t following the recipe completely. </p><p>The full recipe required me to make one standard-sized ingot, and I didn’t have the mana to do it. Adapting it to a smaller piece was not a trivial process, as it changed many important details, from the speed the metal cooled to the folding patterns. </p><p>But, that failure meant nothing as I started taking notes, incomprehensible to anyone but me. </p><p>I was already in love with my new working space. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Finding myself mixed in a conflict I had no idea about was not a pleasant feeling, but it was far from the worst case. I certainly didn’t expect to end up as a primary assassination target as the sole blacksmith. </p><p>However, the flip side of the problem was equally interesting. Since their conflict was bigger than I had expected, it meant that they would be willing to accept some demands that might otherwise be assumed to be excessive. The more problems I solved, the more I could ask for. </p><p>Assuming, of course, I didn’t reveal my upgraded skills. That particular secret was still too volatile to reveal. </p><p>Since I had decided to show off, I decided to focus on the biggest problem while she continued to examine his pockets. “Would I be wrong assuming that he’s somehow behind our most recent supply problem?” I asked. </p><p>“Supply problem?” she asked, surprised. </p><p>“The bronze ingots. You mentioned it when you arrived before I showed you the body,” I said. </p><p>“Ah, right,” she said, then paused. “Yes, that’s correct. He was here to refuse our latest request. Apparently, there had been some problems with the System Shop.” </p><p>“What kind of problems?” </p><p>“We have purchased the swords and the bronze from the same System Store. It’s in the middle of nowhere, and it’s currently defended by four families. Our Griffin family is one of the five families that have shares in that System Store, which meant we could purchase some of the limited stocks every week. But, the traitor here informed us that there was a dispute about the shares, so the next delivery will be delayed.”</p><p>“Supposedly,” I said. </p><p>“Right,” she said. “Since he proved to be a traitor, that might have been a lie,” she said, looking relaxed. “Maybe there’s no problem. I just need to fly and check. It’ll barely take a few days.” </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, then passed. “Or, there’s actually a problem, and he’s deliberately underselling the importance of it to prevent you from seeking an alternative solution until it’s too late.” </p><p>I wasn’t entirely honest in saying that. If the problem was as serious, he wouldn’t have tried to assassinate me. From their perspective, I was just a blacksmith that could work a little faster. I would have been useless without bronze. </p><p>Not a nice thing to do, but it wasn’t the first time I fibbed some of the details to get a bigger grant. </p><p>Still, thanks to a lack of remote communication, it would take a few days to check the situation, and meanwhile, I could use that as an opportunity to push for some new experiments. It wouldn’t be with that particular bronze alloy, but it was a sacrifice I was willing to make. </p><p>“You’re right,” she said, looking tense. “We have enough stock to keep us going for a few weeks, but if we are delayed, we will have to stop just as the dungeon starts operating. I need to fly there myself.” </p><p>“Maybe that’s not a good idea,” I said, happy to delay things a bit more. “You’re the strongest person in the camp. What if something happens in your absence.” She looked thoughtful. “And, wouldn’t it be better if you kept the fact that you’re suspicious of him a secret? I don’t know exactly what you are dealing with, but I’m sure it’ll be helpful.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” she said. “He died in our camp while trying to assassinate someone.” </p><p>“Did he?” I asked. “Or, did he leave the camp and disappear?” </p><p>“What do you mean?” she repeated. </p><p>“You mentioned that he had already left. Did you watch him leave, or did you just assume?” </p><p>“I watched him leave on a griffin an hour ago,” she replied, then paused. “I see. Since he had already left, and he returned under invisibility, we don’t have to explain anything. We have dozens of guards who would swear that he had left safely. Wilderness can be dangerous, even for someone at level sixty-seven.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but tremble when she mentioned that number. “That high?” </p><p>“Yes. He bragged about it a lot during our meeting. You were really lucky.” </p><p>I gulped. I was lucky indeed. If I didn’t follow Maria to that leveling trip, I would have been dead. A good reason to get even stronger. “It makes sense. I’m sure Rosie will be happy to confirm the situation at that shop for a price. She’s good at finding out stuff like that,” I said. </p><p>There was no harm in sending some work for a nominal ally, especially since I needed her goodwill. I had a lot of questions to ask her during our next meeting. </p><p>“A good point,” she said. “Still, it doesn’t solve the main problem. If there’s a problem with the supply, we’ll be in trouble.” </p><p>“What if we can find an alternative to bronze swords,” I asked. </p><p>“No. We tried everything. That’s the cheapest alternative we can purchase that doesn’t just melt completely. Anything weaker, and the weapons get destroyed completely. And, anything that’s too strong to resist the effect completely is not enough to make it economically feasible. We calculated them ourselves.” </p><p>“That’s probably true, but that’s not what I was talking about,” I replied. “What if we forge something ourselves?” I said. “I’m sure there’s a mine nearby, and even if there’s not, there’s too many ways to buy ordinary metal. And, we have a dungeon next to us, providing us with a lot of excess material. As long as we use them to forge weapons, we don’t have to deal with a long and dangerous supply chain.” </p><p>“We already thought of that. The dungeon has no material that can be used to make any alloys, let alone one that could resist the corrosion of those damned monsters,” she countered. </p><p>“No, that’s not correct,” I said. She looked confused. “There’s no material with a recipe that’s already included in the skill,” I corrected. “We can experiment and see if there’s an alternative,” I said. </p><p>“Would that work?” </p><p>“Maybe,” I replied. </p><p>“What do you mean, maybe?” she said. </p><p>“It’s an experiment. I can’t guarantee you results, certainly not in such a short time,” I said. Admittedly, I was more interested in the opportunity to experiment endlessly in the next five days than the possibility of success. “But, either way, it’s not a big investment. Some ordinary metal, and a lot of material that you get from the dungeon. And, it’s not like I’m too busy,” I said. </p><p>“Makes sense,” she said. </p><p>I paused for a moment as inspiration hit. The opportunity was actually greater than I had first realized. “Actually, there’s something else we can do,” I said, hoping that she would buy the idea. </p><p>“What?” </p><p>“Well, it’s clear that your opponent wants to prevent Maria from succeeding in her mission. It’s inevitable that they’ll have some spies, and they might do something more excessive if we make any progress. And, we still need a better story for the death of our traitor.” </p><p>“He died in the wilderness. It’s good enough.” </p><p>“As an official one. But, the one that sent him here knows better … unless, of course, there’s a better explanation.” </p><p>“Spill.” </p><p>“We frame it like I have died, and during the process, the forge somehow exploded, burning the building. You can say that there was a second unidentified corpse. Meanwhile, we bring the forge to a basement that people can’t access, where I work alone, hidden from anyone but you,” I said. “That way, you won’t have to dedicate a team trying to save me from assassins.” </p><p>“And, you would be alright living in a basement without getting to go outside?” </p><p>“It wouldn’t be the first time I locked myself in a dark room trying to solve a problem,” I said. “And, there’s a lot of people that walk around wearing helmets. I can always disguise myself as another newly hired guard. A beard and some hair dye should solve everything.”</p><p>She looked at me with a frown. “You come up with that plan quickly,” she said. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk, my mood was admittedly too good for someone who had been just assassinated. But, the idea of a private lab where I can actually experiment to my heart’s content was a good tradeoff. Still, I wasn’t above using guilt to push the limits of science. “There’s something about being assassinated by invisible people that really inspires me,” I snarked. </p><p>“Good point,” she admitted guiltily. After all, the defense of the camp was her responsibility. If I was found dead with no assassin around, it would be a big black mark against her. Not to mention, without my teaching, there was no guarantee the other blacksmiths could discover the repair trick in a reasonable timeline.</p><p>In both ways, I had saved her ass. </p><p>She pulled a ring from the dead man’s finger and threw it to me. “Put this on, and don’t make any sudden movements,” she said. A little morbid, but I still put that on. A weird, fuzzy sensation covered me even as my skin started to show what was behind me. </p><p>An interesting effect. </p><p>I walked a little, careful not to make any sudden move. “Good, now follow me,” she said. I did so, staying behind her to not run into anything or anyone. We stayed near the walls, and soon, we were at the center building, which functioned both as a headquarters and a residence for the two. </p><p>Interesting choice, but considering it was the most defended building, it made sense. </p><p>I pulled the ring from my finger and put it in my pocket. It was a beautiful survival tool for emergencies. Eleanor said nothing, too distracted by the next steps to care about an item with limited effectiveness under most circumstances. </p><p>For me, it might be the difference between life and death. </p><p>“You’re familiar enough with the building,” she said, clearly unhappy about the fact. “Go to the basement and pick a room that we can fit a forge into. I’ll return in an hour.”</p><p>As I walked toward the basement, I couldn’t help but think that she was right. I was too chipper for a man who had just survived an assassination attempt. </p><p>But, the payoff made it worth it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was glad that I chose to fake repairing a sword, as it meant that I could cede control to the skill while I observed the approaching mana cloud … one with a roughly humanoid shape. Considering they had to open the door to enter, it was less likely to be a spell. </p><p>What was more likely was that they were someone under an invisibility spell. Someone that was most likely holding a weapon, considering the mana cloud on the right was a foot longer than the one on the left. From a purely technical perspective, I didn’t know if the intruder was an enemy. </p><p>After all, there might be a perfectly reasonable explanation for someone sneaking into my forge while I was busy, holding what was most likely a dagger. </p><p>I spent a second glancing toward him, and was barely able to catch some kind of outline. The mana fog didn’t cover it despite overlapping, because despite the way my mind interpreted it, it wasn’t exactly a visual object. </p><p>Once I caught that outline, the figure of a bearded man became visible, like it was one of those pictures with a visual illusion. Some kind of camouflage spell that I would have never caught without Essence helping me. </p><p>And, even with Essence, I would have missed it if the camp hadn’t been in a mana-dead location. The fog of mana that clung to him was weak enough to mix with the background, had the background not been clean. </p><p>I barely held back a gulp as I started going through my options. There were only two. I could raise an alarm and hope that the reinforcements would arrive faster than he could kill me, or wait for five seconds, and deliver the first blow. </p><p>The first option, I might have chosen if it wasn’t for one fact: Hammer of Might was a style that was designed for overwhelming offense. Good at fighting against monsters, but not as good at fighting against another man who might be stronger than me. </p><p>No, I had no choice but to go with the second option. That was where my advantage lay. He was walking directly toward me, with no attempt to stick close to the walls or otherwise avoid me. Clearly, he had no fear of being detected. Not a bad assumption, considering only a chain of flukes allowed me to detect him in the first place. </p><p>He was walking slowly, whether it was the limitation of the spell he used or his arrogance, I didn’t know, but either way, it meant I would have the chance to deliver one free blow. One that was too valuable to pass. </p><p>Even as my mind churned those options, my body was moving under the control of my skill, maintaining the illusion that everything was going well. The only exception was my heartbeat, getting faster and faster as I realized that I had to kill. </p><p>Again. </p><p>One of the worst things about the post-Cataclysm world was that murder had turned far more acceptable. I had to kill twice, both against muggers thinking to make a quick buck over my corpse … before the discovery of the repair spell ruined my business and I was one of the richer people of the town. Both times, I hated the feeling. </p><p>But, I didn’t hate it enough to let someone assassinate me. </p><p>My hammer repeatedly landed on the surface of the sword as he closed in the distance. He was one step away from me when I flicked my wrist and threw the sword toward him. It was a very effective distraction, as the sword was hot enough to glow red. </p><p>Even with the System, it was nearly impossible to avoid a point-blank attack, particularly if the target didn’t expect it. He still made a valiant effort to lean to the side sharply, his movement ruining the spell protecting him. </p><p>I didn’t even wait until I used my work hammer to attack him. Unbalanced, he wasn’t able to dodge, and the attack landed on his head. </p><p>And, killed him before he could even make a sound, unlike his head, which shattered loudly. I shivered even as he collapsed to the floor. </p><p>Health cured a lot of things, but a destroyed head was not one of them. I started shivering even as I looked at the door, waiting for the guards to arrive, but they did not. I breathed hard, trying to process the fact that I had just killed someone else. </p><p>I hated the feeling. </p><p>A minute passed, and the trembling of my hands subsided. Still, there were no guards. For a moment, my mind went in a conspiratorial direction, wondering if the guards had been a part of the issue. Then, a simpler possibility occurred. </p><p>They probably ignored the sound. The forge already had good noise isolation, and the constant sound of crashing was easy to ignore. </p><p>I was about to shout when I finally paid attention to the bearded man’s outfit. It had the sigil of a griffin, like the ones the guards had been wearing before Thomas took all of them away. Worse, it was more complicated than what the guards had, and similar to what Eleanor had been wearing. Not exactly the same, but both included enough silver. </p><p>That couldn’t be good news, I realized even as I changed my clothes before walking to the door. One that I couldn’t handle alone. </p><p> When I opened the door, I found the assigned guards squatted in a corner, playing dice. </p><p>As much as I wanted to curse them for their lack of vigilance, I did not. If someone wanted to enter the forge while invisible, they would, and their lack of vigilance only made them more confident. “Yes, sir,” the guard said, looking panicked. </p><p>“There’s a small issue with the forge. Please go and get Eleanor. Tell her that it’s very urgent.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” the guard said. I nodded. “Your funeral,” he said, then looked at me. “It’s not about … this, right?” he asked, looking at the dice game they were playing. His partner looked equally scared. </p><p>“I don’t know what you are talking about,” I said with a wink. They looked relaxed. </p><p>I returned, the ordinary discussion calming me down somewhat. I didn’t touch the crime scene but tried to come up with a story to tell. The general events had no problem. Ultimately, I didn’t need to explain why I killed someone who had snuck up on me invisibly. </p><p>But, I couldn’t tell her that I had noticed the mana. </p><p>“The steam,” I muttered. It was a good excuse, one that could explain the timing. Quenching a sword created a thick cloud, and claiming that it was a lucky shot came from panic was enough. It just changed the facts slightly, turning into an accident rather than an intentional choice. I actually let some of the steam appear, in case she would be careful enough to check that. </p><p>I doubted it, as Eleanor wasn’t that attentive, but it was better safe than sorry. After it saved my life, I was even less reluctant to reveal my ability to use mana. </p><p>I waited in the corridor, ready to block anyone but Eleanor. Luckily, at this point, she trusted me enough to arrive herself. She looked harried and exhausted. “I don’t know how you heard it already, but yes, there won’t be any new ingots for a while. You have to stop experimenting for a while.” </p><p>At any other time, that statement would have earned a bigger reaction. “It’s not that, and we’ll talk about it later. Follow me,” I said as I walked to the main forge. She saw the body and tensed. The sharp aura was back. </p><p>“Explain,” she ordered. </p><p>“It was an accident,” I started. </p><p>“An accident?” she asked. “How? And, why was the steward here talking with you when he was supposed to be gone already?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” I said. “He was invisible when he entered.” </p><p>Her eyes widened, showing that she understood the implication. “Traitor,” she growled. It was a scary word, even when her gaze was firmly on the corpse as she said that. It was scarier when she started looking at me. “Invisible, or camouflaged.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I have no idea. I just noticed some kind of weird movement in the steam when I quenched the sword and slammed down my hammer. The aim was … an accident.” </p><p>She looked at me for a moment, before she walked to the corpse, and started to examine the body. “A nice blow,” she said, which was not exactly what I was expecting for killing a member of their house, but I was glad to take it. A tasteless compliment was much better than being turned into a scapegoat. </p><p>Her compliment showed that she had accepted my version of the story. I was glad that I didn’t touch the body, which made my version much more credible. </p><p>“Don’t tell anyone what has happened!” she warned as she crouched down, and started to go through his belongings. </p><p>“Of course,” I replied. At this point, it was clear that the success of the dungeon operation was linked to some kind of internal political battle, the kind that made assassination and bribery the first tools to be used. </p><p>I wasn’t necessarily happy that I was a part of it, but the moment I killed him, I had become too involved. Now, even if I managed to convince Eleanor to terminate my contract — which was not a given — I couldn’t get away. Not after killing one of their members. </p><p>For better or worse, I was a part of the conflict. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I woke up, my body was still aching somewhat, reminding me that using Health from the System to heal wasn’t exactly perfect, or painless. </p><p>“I can’t believe I was that reckless,” I muttered, my body reminding me of the cost of trying to use a skill without understanding it fully. It was arrogant of me to self-experiment without properly assessing the situation. I had assumed a mere one point of mana wouldn’t be a problem. </p><p>At least, instead of a painful injury, I had received some upgrades to my skill, as well as a valid way to rapidly improve it. Curious to test, I went to the forge, and intentionally damaged one of the swords before repairing it again. </p><p>“Wow, controlled flow is amazing,” I muttered as I repaired the weapon. It allowed me to somehow nudge the enchantment to the side while repairing. It didn’t have too much of an advantage when I was repairing the sharpness enchantment, as I had long learned how to bypass it. </p><p>Instead, I had pulled a broken weapon from the pile Eleanor had provided for me to experiment with, one with a simple durability enchantment. I wasn’t able to repair those before, because the enchantment was shaped more like a web, making it difficult for me to work on the metal without breaking the enchantment. </p><p>Now, with my ability to nudge the enchantment to the side without destroying it, I was actually able to repair it. It was a slow process, taking almost an hour of my time before I could even reach halfway. Theoretically, mana blow might have been usable, but with each blow requiring at least one point of mana, it was not something I could test. </p><p>I quit there, because I had nudged too hard, and the enchantment had destabilized. </p><p>However, that was not exactly bad news. A small mana cloud appeared as I destroyed the enchantment. It was less than what had been revealed by destroying the ingot, but with my improved Meditation, it was just enough for me to capture it. </p><p>[+1 Mana] </p><p>“That’s a nice surprise,” I muttered, my smile growing. The broken weapons that were here for my experiments were not as valuable as the bronze ingots, meaning I didn’t have to choose between improving Repair, Forge, and Meditation. It was good news. </p><p>“Now, to the not-so-good one,” I said as I prepared myself to repeat the same reversal trick. I needed to see if my newest perk would help me reduce the pain somewhat. However, this time, I first went to my bedroom. </p><p>I didn’t want to be caught by a visitor. I closed my eyes, focusing on the flow of the mana, reversing the rotation of the orb as I pushed the mana out. The pain hit, but it was far less than I had expected. </p><p>[Meditation (Common) - 11 -&gt; 13]</p><p>[-85 Health]</p><p>“Success through self-mutilation. My psychologist would have had a field day with it.”For a moment, I wondered if he was still alive, but that was just a momentary thought. Thinking if the friends from before the Cataclysm were alive or not was a quick road to ruin. </p><p>Especially for someone like me, who had the misfortune to experience the disaster while traveling for a conference on the East Coast, and was caught halfway, surviving only because I chose to drive rather than fly … away from everyone I had ever known, lost in a town in the middle of nowhere. </p><p>“Focus,” I muttered even as I went downstairs once more, picked some more broken weapons, and started destroying their enchantments for extra mana, only to push said mana out of my body. </p><p>Every repeat damaged my body somewhat, but I ignored the potential risks. It was not my usual careful attitude … but what had following my careful attitude for three years given me? A pile of rejections while I eked out a pathetic living, barely able to afford a room that I could keep my books in. </p><p>No, some risk was inevitable. </p><p>With that in mind, I repeated the same trick. As meditation reached twenty, I was required to exude three points of mana to increase Meditation once, but considering the damage it created had already dropped to single digits, it had become an acceptable tradeoff. </p><p>By midday, I had reached the point I had been searching for. </p><p>[Meditation (Common) - 24 -&gt; 25]</p><p>[Perk Options — Efficient Absorption / Contained Flow / Enhanced Sensing] </p><p>“Oh, a difficult choice,” I muttered as I examined the benefits. Contained Flow was clearly the next step of Controlled Flow, and taking it was tempting. But, in the end, I chose Enhanced Sensing. </p><p>The moment I did so, my ability to read the mana patterns had increased. I could see some surface-level details on the enchantments … which were naturally incomprehensible, like trying to understand how a computer worked by opening the casing. </p><p>Still, it was better than looking from the outside. </p><p>I broke another enchantment, and confirmed the same thing was true for the mana cloud. Rather than seeing a featureless fog, I found myself looking at … a fog with slightly more discernible features. </p><p>Well, it was still only a Perk to a common skill. </p><p>The same was true for the absorption. I could see that, as the ephemeral sphere rotated, the mana patterns turned slightly more discernible. And, that allowed me to reverse the rotation smoothly. Three more attempts, and I had succeeded once more. </p><p>“No pain,” I said happily. Finally, I was able to repeat that trick without hurting myself. </p><p>Of course, now that I had cleared the next threshold, the improvement of the skill would slow down noticeably. I doubted that I could get it to reach thirty even if I destroyed every weapon and material I had in here, including the forge. </p><p>An acceptable loss, as being able to improve a mana skill in a location with no environmental mana had already been pushing it. I just needed to return to the town, and meditate in my room safely to increase it even further. </p><p>Honestly, a part of me was telling me to quit and go back to town, maybe even migrate to one of the cities with a better environment, preferably with a System Shop. But, one thing prevented me. </p><p>I didn’t know if I would be able to actually use the System Shop. Every city had certain rules when it came to using those shops, as not everything was sold without limit. Eleanor had already revealed that the bronze mana ingots had a certain quota every day. </p><p>No, even if it slowed down the improvement of my newest skill, the opportunity to push my two production skills higher was too valuable. Not to mention, quitting suddenly would anger my new bosses, which was not exactly smart. </p><p>I could always change my mind once I had taught the other blacksmiths how to repair the weapons. </p><p>With that, I returned downstairs, forging another dagger to test the benefits of Meditation and my newest perk. “Beautiful,” I muttered. </p><p>Having meditation didn’t change the way I forged the weapon based on the skill, which was not surprising. It was clear that the autopilot of the System was working with far better detection than what it allowed me to access. </p><p>Technically, it meant that Mana Forge drew no benefit from increasing Meditation. It looked like the only reason that I received that skill was to gather mana, and trust Mana Forge and Mana Repair to use it. </p><p>Not exactly a rare event. The origin and the objective of the System were a mystery, but the working principles were not. It clearly expected every user to follow its guidance to rapidly improve. It had certain benefits to it, as I had experienced with my external combat skills. </p><p>Of course, there was the skill upgrade aspect, a great reward for overcoming those limitations, which made the subject a little murkier. </p><p>“Either way, it doesn’t make my new perk any less valuable,” I said to myself as I continued forging. Meditation might not benefit Forging directly, but my newest perk allowed me to observe the process even better. </p><p>Especially when I stopped occasionally to use Inspect, which gave me a completely new set of information. With multiple methods of observation in place, I was able to watch the process of the skill more carefully, learning more and more. </p><p>And, observation was the cornerstone of science. It was the seventeenth century when humanity discovered the existence of bacteria, and it wasn’t because we suddenly became more intelligent. No, we simply invented the microscope, revealing the existence of a whole new world. </p><p>From there, many mysteries had been solved one by one. That had been true for X-ray, radar, and heat sensors … every time our observation methods increased, the developments followed. </p><p>No, I didn’t care if increasing meditation didn’t suddenly enhance my Forging abilities. It made me learn and discover faster, which was all I needed. All I needed was to work with full focus and discover more and more secrets. </p><p>However, when the door opened, I immediately interrupted my work, even smashing the dagger hard enough to ruin my work. I guessed it was not Eleanor, as she didn’t bother keeping the sound down. Meanwhile, servants opened the door carefully, trying not to disturb me. </p><p>Unfortunately, inadvertently, they still ruined it. I immediately threw the dagger into the fire, letting it melt completely. Instead I pulled another sword, acting like I had been repairing them. </p><p>I didn’t want others to realize just how much of my time I spent experimenting on unrelated subjects. I expected another servant to walk forward … instead, it was a mana cloud. </p><p>A nasty surprise. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I retreated from the burning remains of the sorcerer, I couldn’t help but lament the easy death he had experienced. Cursed and burned at the same time was not exactly pleasant, but it was quicker than he deserved. </p><p>“It’s a problem,” I muttered even as I started running, feeling my body struggle with the effort. Whatever the sorcerer had done with the mana I pulled, it was refusing to be expelled easily. I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for the dragon heart constantly pumping mana, my fate wouldn’t be too different than him. </p><p>I wished that I had the time to sit down and examine it, as it didn’t feel exactly like mana, but something more. I had no doubt that, examining it even for an hour would have expanded my horizon when it came to the nature of vitae and mana. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have time for that. I didn’t even have time to slowly hunt the remaining legionaries that were split between the two wings, their attempts to close on me delayed by the spreading fires. </p><p>For one simple reason. </p><p>Whatever that was living in the depths of the valley, it woke up. </p><p>And, it was angry. </p><p>The only thing I did was to remove the poorly fitting armor on my torso, and wrap a cloak around my right arm. Somehow, I managed to keep that a secret. Anything else they might deduce had to be abandoned. </p><p>As I ran toward Lillian and Astrid — who thankfully had enough presence of mind to stay together — I absentmindedly caressed the Spear, still unable to believe that it bonded with me. It was supposed to be impossible. Without the proper inheritance ritual…</p><p>“You weren’t just training me in tactics because you were bored, were you, old coot,” I grumbled as the realization hit. I had always thought that he trained me to be some kind of an enforcer mage for the family, and the tactics and history lessons were just a way to pass the time while I was resting between training — torture — sessions. </p><p>But, the fact that the Spear of Scipio reacted to me, just like it always did to his presence, changed everything. </p><p>Suddenly, I couldn’t help but feel despair as I imagined his letter, being destroyed by the mages that had been raiding his home. At that time, I had assumed that it wasn’t as important as the presence of a sorcerer in the compound. </p><p>But, maybe I was wrong… </p><p>“Marcus, you’re alive,” Lillian gasped as I burst into their hiding spot. Astrid said nothing, but it was because she was already moving toward me for a hug, but I could see that she was exhausted. </p><p>“Both of you, stay where you are. I’m still trying to deal with a spell on me. Stay away just in case.” </p><p>“What kind of spell?” Lillian asked. “Maybe I can heal?” </p><p>“The kind that’s cast by a dying sorcerer, so let’s not waste time. It’s already in control,” I said. </p><p>“Maybe we can carry you—” Lillian started. </p><p>“No. You two are not in any better condition. And, I can’t really risk you touching the spear,” I said. It shouldn’t harm anyone while in my hands, but it wasn’t worth the risk. </p><p>“You look dead on your feet. Is a new weapon really that important? Just throw it —” Astrid started, interrupted by Lillian’s gasp. </p><p>“Wait, is this…” </p><p>“The famous Spear of Scipio. Yes. Our sorcerer friend was kind enough to bring it to me,” I said. “But, let’s move. I can feel the presence of their horses. They are just two miles away. We need to get some before they panic and escape.” </p><p>I started jogging, which was the fastest pace I could maintain with the weakness of my body as I battled with the energy. Luckily, they were able to match my speed, but they weren’t any less exhausted. </p><p>“Why did they leave their horses behind? It doesn’t make sense.” </p><p>Before I could answer, a roar exploded from the center of the valley, one that I felt in my bones. “That’s why,” I said. “The beasts could sense its presence, whatever it is. Now, move. We need the horses if we are to ever get away.” </p><p>“D-do you think that beast will follow us?” Lillian said. </p><p>“I don’t know, but —” I started, only to stop when I felt the presence of two shifters running toward us. “Can you make me two ice spears,” I asked. She immediately did so even as it exhausted her. ”Excellent,” I said as I threw them into the trees. </p><p>I was too exhausted to hit them, but it was enough to scare them enough. </p><p>With that, we managed to barely stumble toward our target. They looked far too crazed, but Astrid moved toward them. A touch of hers was enough to calm the horses down. It was far faster than taming a wild beast. </p><p>While she was finishing that, I freed the rest of the horses, and they escaped in panic. It was a very expensive, but effective way of creating false trails. </p><p>“Excellent teamwork,” I said as we each climbed on a horse, and started riding. </p><p>“Are we trying to escape whatever that beast is?” Lillian shouted. </p><p>“Yes and no,” I replied. “We also want to escape before the other legion forces inevitably respond,” I said. Luckily, while the fire mana in my arm weakened my body, it didn’t weaken my senses, which allowed me to pick a direction that avoided the first responders from the legions. </p><p>“Where are we going?” Lillian asked even as we managed to leave the valley. </p><p>“Where they won’t be looking for us,” I responded. </p><p>“You mean?” Lillian asked, her tone hopeful. </p><p>“Exactly. We’re going back to Britannia,” I declared confidently. Things would be much easier without a sorcerer right in our tail. </p><p>“What if they send another sorcerer?” Lillian asked. </p><p>I chuckled. “I doubt it. Even assuming they can discover that we went back to Britannia, I doubt that they would be readily committing another sorcerer. And, even if they did,” I said and dragged my finger over the hilt of my new weapon. </p><p>With the Spear of Scipio in hand, I was far more confident against a sorcerer. And, even if they did the unthinkable and sent multiple, we could always escape again. </p><p>Sorcerers weren’t exactly subtle presences to my senses. </p><p>They didn’t argue. I didn’t know if it was the exhaustion, or if they agreed with my judgment, but I wasn’t in a position to care either. I was too busy trying to chart a safe direction toward the sea. </p><p>A while later, a commotion caught my attention. Even from a great distance, I could feel the presence of at least six sorcerers, casting spells. Yet, it wasn’t it. At the distance, I could feel the march of thousands of people. </p><p>Multiple legions were mobilizing. </p><p>However, for once, I wasn’t afraid that I was the target. Not when I could see a pair of huge wings poking through the tree canopy at the center of the valley.”  </p><p>“Well, that answers a question,” I commented in a tone of awe and shock. I would have assumed that I was too spent to feel any strong flare of emotion, but it clearly wasn’t the case. </p><p>But then, how many times would one see a living, breathing dragon that confirmed their existence. </p><p>It looked like the name of the crystal was not just a coincidence… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I started running forward at full speed, ready to use the distraction of the sorcerer to my benefit. </p><p>While their attack had ruined my initial plan, I had to admit, the opportunity it generated wasn’t too bad. They attacked two sides at the same, which, combined with my earlier efforts, actually forced them to commit not only their reserves but also some of the forces at the center. </p><p>Initially, trying to force them to commit their reserves was just a fake plan. </p><p>I didn’t really understand what Lillian and Astrid were trying to do. They either believed that my diversion attacks were the real thing, and decided to support it, or they thought to turn things more confusing to give me a chance to escape. </p><p>I was sure that they weren’t trying to strip the sorcerer at the center out of his support, which made their achievement a complete accident. With my transformed eye, I could catch the movement. All the mages and most of the mage apprentices moved to support the sides. Meanwhile, only four apprentices stayed with the sorcerer, carrying oversized tower shields. </p><p>The best part, they were moving toward me. </p><p>“Oh, the irony,” I muttered as I found the setup roughly familiar. A weak center, reinforced wings collapsing against the target. It reminded me of the Battle of Cannae, one of my grandfather’s favorite topics, where Hannibal had delivered the single most devastating defeat Rome had ever experienced. Eighty thousand soldiers were killed, taking merely seven thousand enemy soldiers with them. </p><p>However, why I found it ironic that the battle was the representation of Roman arrogance. During that battle, the Roman army had eighty thousand soldiers, led by two legendary sorcerer-consuls, confident that they could easily destroy Hannibal’s army of merely fifty thousand. </p><p>With that confidence, they committed their forces to the center, determined to shatter Hannibal once and for all. Only for Hannibal to assign his elites to the center to pull the incredible task of holding all that force without collapsing, while the wings of the army surrounded and enveloped him. </p><p>It was a battle I had to memorize every little detail, despite the fact that the Scipio family played no part in that battle. The Scipios had fought with Hannibal before, killing his father, and in turn being defeated by him in Hispania. They fought with him after, ending up with Hannibal’s ultimate defeat. </p><p>Yet, it was the Battle of Cannae that my grandfather focused on the most because it was the battle that forced the Scipio family to completely rewrite its military doctrine. </p><p>Maybe, if it wasn’t for all those lessons, I wouldn’t have even taken note of the similarities, but not that I did, I had to admit, the dilemma was the same. I was the reckless force that was trying to break through the elite center while the wings slowly closed on me. </p><p>In the end, it meant that I was facing a sorcerer, and if that wasn’t intimidating enough, all he needed to win was to delay me until the wings arrived. Then, it didn’t matter whether he kept me here, or forced me to escape. </p><p>Either mean, it would be my loss. </p><p>Yet, even as I pushed forward, I couldn’t help but be amused that if he hadn’t sent the three air mages at first, I would have no chance of winning. </p><p>Once I burst through the flames, I found myself across the sorcerer … only to stumble in shock. It wasn’t what I was seeing, as that hadn’t changed thanks to my enhanced vision. No, it was what I was feeling. It didn’t feel like a strong mage surrounded by four guards, but an open flame doused in mana. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my sharp senses, I would have assumed that it was just his spells creating a cloaking effect, but it was not. From such a close distance, I could easily penetrate the cloud of mana around him. And, what I found was shocking. It was as if someone had replaced his bones with flowing magma. </p><p>He didn’t feel like that when I saw him earlier. </p><p>Was that what being a sorcerer meant? Becoming one with the element to the point that even his whole being subsumed by fire. Or, was it just a side effect of pushing himself that much? </p><p>“Monster,” I muttered. At first, I felt like it was an echo. Then, I realized that it was the sorcerer, saying the exact same thing, his shock no different than mine. </p><p>Well, I couldn’t blame him, not with my arm fully on display. This time, I didn’t bother hiding my abilities. I attacked, even as the four guards moved with speeds that could match me. I might have pitied them if it wasn’t for the familiar black mark on their shields. </p><p>Instead, I used my claw to cut through the shield. To my surprise, it only went halfway. Whatever that shield was made of, it was not a simple material. “Monster,” the sorcerer shouted, and behind me, I could feel the mana transform. </p><p>One disadvantage of trying to fight a sorcerer in close quarters. It was impossible to predict the attack trajectory. But, I was fast enough to dodge once I felt the build-up. He tried to change the direction, but he failed. </p><p>It splashed against the shield ineffectually, making me wonder exactly what those shields were made of. But, first, I wanted to see the advantages. I grabbed another shield and pulled. I might not puncture it, but ripping it was easy. </p><p>I used it to disperse the next spell before it even started to gather, and used the opportunity to kill the guard without a shield. The sorcerer tried again and failed again. Unfortunately, three guards were strong enough to defend him. </p><p>And, I was afraid of stepping into the melee range. The closer the sorcerer, the more dangerous he was. </p><p>Luckily, I had a different plan in mind. I started pulling mana wildly to my body, trying to drain the surroundings. A sorcerer could transform the free mana directly, but no mana meant he would be merely limited to an extremely strong mage. </p><p>One that was currently wounded. </p><p>It was a trick my grandfather taught me, but I doubted his objective was to weaponize it against a sorcerer. As for the target for all the mana, it was easy. My scaly arm. While it wasn’t able to absorb the outside mana as smoothly as the one that was produced by the dragon heart, it was still able to metabolize it somewhat. </p><p>Then, suddenly, my arm started burning. Not as a pain sensation, but actually burning. The scales caught fire, radiating heat and pain in equal measure. </p><p>“Arrogant. You think you can drain my mana without consequence,” he declared. </p><p>Good point. I could feel my body weakening, but my arm was in a weird state. I attacked the next guard, and the flaming scales punched through it easily. The second guard was dead. </p><p>“Impossible” he growled as he tried to cast a spell, but without environmental mana, he had to cast it directly, and it clearly interfered with the state of his body. His skin caught fire as well. “No,” he growled. “Guard me.” </p><p>With my body weakening, it took almost ten seconds to kill the remaining two guards, but it was enough for him to pull the Spear of Scipio. I noticed that his skin stopped burning, but the Spear started to glow instead. </p><p>“Are you shocked I can use your family weapon, bastard,” he growled. </p><p>“How? I gasped as I made a show of retreating, but it was just a distraction. I had long come to terms with the fact that I would never wield the spear. However, the story of a bastard being scared of his family weapon was understandable. </p><p>Patrician weapons had some weird powers over the bloodline. It was not exactly to fight against them. Of course, if I couldn’t feel that the spear was still inert, I might have reacted differently. </p><p>Being killed by the family weapon was not a fun experience. I had seen it before, when a distant family member — possibly instigated by my dear uncle — tried to assassinate my grandfather. </p><p>It was not fun. </p><p>I faked my retreat, and the sorcerer, desperate to finish me off, attacked with his full power. I reversed my direction even as I ducked under the spear, trying to deliver a deadly wound. I managed to take half of his leg, and in response, he managed to scratch me with the tip of the spear. </p><p>The Spear of Scipio glowed. </p><p>We both froze. </p><p>“I’m … dead,” I muttered, shocked by the sudden end. The weapon was inert. It shouldn’t have worked against me. I stilled, preparing for my flesh and blood to rot. </p><p>It happened, just not to me. I watched dumbly even as the spear started to glow brighter as it started draining my mana. </p><p>“B-but … you’re a bastard,” the sorcerer managed to whisper. I grabbed the spear, unable to understand why it was reacting to me. </p><p>“Yes, I am,” I muttered, trying to understand what was going on. </p><p>“K-kill me,” he begged. </p><p>“No,” I said. “But, when you reach the Halls of Saturn, don’t forget to say hello to Quintus Scipio. Say that I’ll send my uncle to join you soon.” </p><p>Luckily for him, the curse didn’t seem to react well to whatever that was going on with his body. I retreated, just as he caught fire. </p><p>One down. One remaining. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>Three mages flying toward me at full speed was the first problem I needed to face. Fortunately, they had all but gift-wrapped themselves to me. </p><p>Of the four elemental specialties, each group had its own advantages, and just like earth mages had an incredible advantage on defense, especially when given time, the air mages distinguished themselves in their mobility. </p><p>At least, that was true in general terms. The individual perception of their elements relied on the mage in question, which could develop in a completely opposite way. However, looking at the way the air mages dived toward me like a trio of birds of prey, I could see that not only they had relied on the most traditional understanding of air, but the deviation between them was almost nonexistent. </p><p>I wondered whether it was about being a part of a legion, which would make strategic alignment much simpler, but it would also bring some drawbacks. </p><p>Ultimately, those thoughts were mere idle wonderings as I did my best to calculate their trajectory, waiting for them to get closer. They were moving in a direct line, confident that the thick smoke was blocking my view, and the mana from the fires doing the same. Not a bad assumption. They read the situation to the best of their ability. </p><p>Too bad it was the wrong assumption. It didn’t matter whether it was their fault or not. The battlefield was not a place that forgave mistakes. </p><p>I waited until they were close enough, not just to make sure I could take them down immediately — as I didn’t fancy trying to chase down air mages — but also because I wanted to do it in a way that would keep the rest of the army unaware. </p><p>Risky, but since they were trying to catch me.</p><p>Once they were about to appear from the smoke, my arm moved, and I used my newly acquired strength to the limit. Pilum might not be a weapon designed to ruin shields with a soft tip, and would have been useless against high-quality layered armor like the air mages were wearing, but it didn’t mean it was useless. </p><p>I just needed to throw them with an accuracy that was supposed to be impossible and target the gap in their helmet. I wondered if the air mages appreciated the irony, as they would have probably dodged my attack despite my effort without the smoke. </p><p>All they would have to was to turn to their side, or create some kind of wind in front of them to deflect the attack, and the pilum would clutter against their armor uselessly. </p><p>They did not.  </p><p>Killing a mage was a proud achievement. Killing three of them at one was the kind that people made up to impress people while drinking around a campfire. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t have time to enjoy my pride. I still had a small army and a sorcerer to deal with, and behind me, I could feel the stirrings of whatever lived in the valley. </p><p>Gloating would have to wait. </p><p>Even before the bodies had touched the ground, I grabbed the rest of the pilums, and threw all of them to the left wing of the formation. A few managed to kill the targets, but that was it. They might have been hamstrung by the strategic choices their commanders made, they were still legionaries, and they reacted instantly to form a shield wall. The rest had sunk into their shields. </p><p>I had kept only two pilums.</p><p>As the signal horns rose, I moved to the fallen bodies of the air mages, and ripped the armor of one, using my claw. </p><p>At the same time, I started releasing my mana wildly once again. Ultimately, I was afraid that the sorcerer would catch my location based on my mana presence. Trying to suppress it completely was one option, but  I didn’t know if it would be able to trick once I walked through the flames. </p><p>However, skulking in darkness was not the only way to avoid a night patrol. A sudden firework to blind them worked just as well. Too bad, just like a firework to distract the night patrol, it had disadvantages. </p><p>One was the presence of the beast behind me, its stirrings getting even more intense as the mana density increased. The other was the intensity of the flames that surrounded me, getting more and more intense. Yet, despite everything, I could hear the furious shout of the sorcerer above everything. </p><p>“Perfect,” I muttered. For a moment, I considered escaping. With the army already locked around me, I could run away, and this time, I didn’t even have to abandon Lillian and Astrid. I could save both escape safely, and evacuate the region while they were busy dealing with the awakened beast in the valley. </p><p>Unfortunately, while the idea of running away was tempting, staying here to finish the job was even more tempting. My enemy was a sorcerer, true, but he was also a sorcerer who had committed a string of mistakes, leaving himself exposed. </p><p>It was my only chance to take revenge. </p><p>That alone was enough, but then there was the Spear of Scipio. The patrician weapon, the artifact that could be traced for the founding of Rome, the weapon that accompanied generations of Scipio generals as they defeated Hannibal and saved the Republic from certain destruction.</p><p>As a bastard, I didn’t really care about all that glory, and the weapon was even more useless. Without a proper inheritance ritual, the best thing I could do was to carry it without touching it directly. Trying to use it would have killed me. </p><p>However, while I didn’t care about the weapon directly, my monster of a grandfather did. And, leaving his precious weapon in the hands of one of his killers — the majority of the blame going to my dear lovely uncle — was an even bigger insult than not taking revenge. </p><p>As much as I hated the old man, I loved him as well. I owed him as much. </p><p>The decision made, I didn’t waste any time before I ripped the armor of the mages using my claw, ruining them in the process. However, I didn’t care. I put two two sticks, and left the third one on the ground. </p><p>All of it required less than thirty seconds, which was barely enough for the formation around me to react. Half of the reserve force was committed to the left wing. </p><p>I started running toward the right side. One of the armors, I put at the edge of their vision, and the second one, I put slightly behind in a concealed spot. They should be seeing nothing. Then, I used the two pilums I had carefully, targeting the mages at the back of the formation. </p><p>Both of them survived, but I didn’t care. The aim wasn’t to kill them. It was to just cause a distraction. I rushed forward, pushing through the flames. The pain was unbelievable even though I passed through them in a second, but I needed to do so in order to target them. My wounds were healing already, and my face was untouched because I had protected it with my scaly arm. </p><p>That arm was mostly pristine as well. </p><p>“Monster—” one of my targets shouted, but I didn’t care. I just killed two and pulled back toward the dummy I set up. Horns had been sound once again, but this time, they didn’t commit too much of the reserves. </p><p>I didn’t care. I already had the third armor in place. I picked that up and tied it with a string, ignoring the pain of my burn wounds, which were healing already. </p><p>Hardly the best disguise, but with everything going on, it was enough. I just needed to suppress my presence, actually go from the back of the formation, and mix the formation on the left side. A simple plan, but one that would only work because they had no idea about the true speed I could move. </p><p>I was ready to do so, when a sudden burst of water rained over the fire, one with a very familiar presence, targeting the left side. At the same time, I could see a herd of animals attacking the right side of the formation.  </p><p>Lillian and Astrid. </p><p>I froze, unable to believe that they would attack a sorcerer who was leading a considerable fraction of a legion just to help me. Technically, their help was not necessary. It was even making my life harder, forcing me to abandon my plan to adapt to the new situation. </p><p>Yet, one fact was immutable. Rather than escaping safely, they were throwing their lives to give me a fraction of a better chance of surviving. It was something stupid, reckless, suicidal…</p><p>It was the nicest thing someone had ever done for me. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>“It’s lucky that you’re unconscious,” I muttered even as I started examining the imprisoned being. Looking at him, it was clear that his imprisonment was not some kind of punishment, or even a way to suppress some kind of evil that couldn’t be suppressed. </p><p>Nor, it was a way to keep cursed Qi somehow contained like I had initially assumed. </p><p>No, I could vaguely sense that the chains were suffused with some kind of energy, transferring it to the corpse that was somehow still alive. And, the crystal sword was draining it off him. As I watched, the glow slowly built up, only to fade back when it started to glow too much point then fade back, starting a cycle, almost like a beating heart. </p><p>The whole point of the complicated existence was to drain something. The chains collected whatever they were gathering, the unfortunate skeleton was the collection medium, while the crystal sword transferred the collected energy. </p><p>Considering the continued radiation of Cursed Qi as a side effect, whatever they were doing was not something nice. </p><p>“I think I have just avoided a terrible fate,” I muttered as I watched the process. </p><p>Considering the relationship with the Everdawn Empire, I couldn’t help but wonder why he had given me it. To possess me, or to force me to replace him. Frankly, the first one was the preferable option. I shuddered, glad that the System had given me too many options. Otherwise, I might have been truly tempted by the idea of Martial Arts that would allow me to resist the might of the cultivators. </p><p>“Now, let’s see what’s going on,” I muttered as I walked closer, still careful not to touch anything. There was nothing in the room other than items and artifacts of the Everdawn Empire, which seemed intentional. </p><p>Even the golden chains had been stamped with the same symbols in alternating manner. Similarly, the living corpse had a crown on his head, as well as a bunch of rotted clothing and a ring that still carried the sign. </p><p>It was hard to determine it correctly, but I had a feeling that, whenever they had been destroyed, someone had been visiting to replace them. And, I doubted that it was for nothing. I felt like someone was working hard to keep the evidence that the room belonged to the Everdawn Empire. </p><p>I doubted that it was because they liked the Empire. </p><p>That was true for every inch of the throne room … except the throbbing crystal sword at the center of his chest, draining whatever they had been collecting. I didn’t want to get any closer, but understanding what had been going on seemed like a better idea. </p><p>As I walked closer, I started examining the chains more carefully and realized that they weren’t flawless. They had been corroding somewhat, but recovering at the same time, but the pattern was interesting. As if the rot was spreading through the center, but recovered from the outside in. </p><p>How, I had no idea… Whatever that was going on wasn’t reliant on Qi. It was merely a side effect of what had been going on. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the crystal sword at the center, which had been throbbing continuously. It was the only thing in the room that was completely pristine and flawless. On the contrary, it radiated some kind of holy sensation, like it was something to be worshipped. No, calling it veneration against a hero was a better idea. </p><p>But, for some reason, that sensation that claimed that the crystal was an object of veneration was familiar. </p><p>“The same sensation that brought me to the Nascent Soul cultivator,” I muttered, unable to keep my shock down. “Providence!” </p><p>Then, I gasped, realizing what was going on. It was a scam, just like what I had done with Aisnam and Janassa repeatedly. The crystal, the chains, the corpse, all the Everdawn Symbols. It was a giant scam setup. </p><p>The only difference was, while I had been tricking the System, they were tricking the world itself. “Could it be that they are … farming providence,” I muttered. It was supposed to be crazy. How could someone actually farm something as untouchable as fate? </p><p>But before I could even ignore that realization as a wild assumption, the realization had triggered some confusing connections. I was able to trace it back to half-formed information contained in the Kartpa Alchemy technique. </p><p>Particularly, Nascent Soul gives me the impression that, at that level, fate might not just be an external, illusory force. Unfortunately, without the main cultivation technique, it was more than a half-formed opinion, almost like a difficult-to-remember dream. </p><p>But, it was enough to confirm what was going on. They were truly farming providence. And, once that conclusion was made, the rest of the details like constantly replaced flags, cursed Qi, and even the living corpse started to make more sense. </p><p>Not only they were stealing the providence, but also they were framing the Everdawn Empire for it. </p><p>“Like things weren’t complicated enough,” I muttered even as I took a careful step forward, careful not to interact further. And, as I walked closer to the living corpse, a new instinct started to appear in me. It was an illusory feeling, promising fortune just like it had brought me in front of the Nascent Soul cultivator earlier … only a hundred times stronger. </p><p>It was almost like a whisper in my ear. I knew that, at that moment, if I destroyed the living corpse, I would be earning an incredible reward. </p><p>Unfortunately, I would also be alerting the owner of the sword, who probably wouldn’t have been happy about their ploy being destroyed. Considering whoever was behind the sword was at least a Nascent Soul cultivator, or someone even stronger, it was not likely that I could survive to enjoy the reward. </p><p>I ignored the currently unconscious living corpse and turned to examine the golden chains, trying to get a better sense of their structure. But, their structure was a mystery, even with my new alchemy knowledge giving me some insights about the nature of the materials and the energy. </p><p>The best I could guess, it was a mixture of an unknown material, the martial essence of the Everdawn Empire, and providence, all mixed together to create a material that deserved to be called miraculous even in a world where people could fly casually.</p><p>I wanted to examine further, but a detail convinced me that I had already stayed here long enough. The formation around me had started to decay. </p><p>It was a minuscule effect, impossible to notice if it wasn’t for my absurd formation skill. Yet, it scared me for one reason. The formation wasn’t being eroded slowly from the outside, which would have been understandable under the thick pressure of cursed Qi. Instead, it was the formation itself, slowly losing its function. </p><p>The loss of function was very small, but it wasn’t what scared me. It was that, even with all my knowledge, I had no idea how to repair it. </p><p>Scared, I started examining my own body, and the items I was wearing. I was equally as good in talismans and would have noticed if there was the same kind of subtle destruction going on. </p><p>There, the results were even more interesting. There was some kind of corruption going on, only to be countered by the subtle energy radiating from my body, only detectable in the areas they clashed. </p><p>The difference was enough for me to get a rough idea. My personal items were being protected by my personal providence, while the formation didn’t count as one. It felt like an arbitrary distinction, but I was glad for it. Without it, I might have stayed here for hours, slowly running experiments even as I lost my luck slowly and slowly. </p><p>And, considering how treacherous the meaning of luck in this new world, pushed me to endless battles, I was not ready to test how being unlucky worked. </p><p>“That’s enough exploration,” I muttered as I left the mockery of a throne room behind, my mind already churning with the next steps of the plan. </p><p>I needed to visit the other Stone Gate locations, but not before I could enhance Kartpa Alchemy techniques and my martial talents. At the same time, </p><p>Increasing my martial talent was given. And, so was improving Kartpa alchemy technique. It was the only source of knowledge for providence. Most of the critical knowledge might be lacking, but every little bit counted. </p><p>However, rather than annoying Janassa immediately, I decided to go visit Misty Mountains first. I needed to find information on Everdawn Techniques, and the ruins seemed like the best option. </p><p>Of course, there were many other things I wanted, the forefront being a book on the Mutmah Formation Technique, but I didn’t dare to start it. And, not just because I lacked the time. I was afraid of the trouble it would bring along if I found it. And, now that I had real proof of providence and fate’s existence, I knew that it was not just a coincidence. </p><p>I had too many problems to get tempted even more. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I had left Janassa for her studies, I moved immediately to my next challenge. </p><p>Creating a proper alchemy room. It wasn’t exactly a great challenge. While alchemy knowledge didn’t come with plans on how to set one, my two alchemy techniques came with hazards to avoid. Some were easy to predict — steady heat and no Qi fluctuations from outside — while the others had been more esoteric. </p><p>Ideally, creating a room like that in the form of an artifact was the best option. It would be expensive, but the longevity benefits would have been worth it. Unfortunately, artifact refining was one area I had been lagging behind significantly, so I had to rely on formations to handle most of them. </p><p>It was far more expensive to maintain the environment, but once again, I wasn’t exactly lacking Qi. </p><p>Once I had arranged my pill refinement room, I pulled the Black Medium-Grade cauldron from the System space, enjoying its perfect, gleaming surface. It was a true masterpiece. “Let’s see how far I can push this bad boy,” I chuckled, treating it as a luxury car. </p><p>For my first attempt, I chose to refine a batch of alchemical fertilizer. Not exactly a glorious product, but it was the best way to handle it. </p><p>Just like the talisman plans I had received from the System, the pill recipes were not singular, strict guides that required the collection of a strict list of materials, but ones with many alternatives. It meant that I should be able to produce all Qi Gathering stage pills and products easily. </p><p>With the System, learning how to make things was much better than angling for a specific gift. </p><p>I took a deep breath and started using my new alchemy room to its best effect, but even then, it took an hour for me to finish preparing the fertilizer. It was a bluish liquid with a soft glow. “Yellow Medium-Grade,” I muttered as I examined it. Not as good as I hoped. </p><p>Of course, any other alchemist would have stabbed me for daring to complain about it. For any itinerant alchemist, a steady rate of success above twenty percent was impressive enough for the title of the Alchemist. However, once again, a cheater like me had different standards. </p><p>“Maybe I should delay the martial arts talent pill until I could improve it further,” I decided. For the next few hours, I had refined a few more rounds. I also tried to automate the production of the fertilizer, but it didn’t work. </p><p>My alchemy knowledge wasn’t good enough. I decided to try again once I could reach the realm of Immersion, or maybe even Integration. </p><p>Instead, I visited the garden I had created for the ginseng plants, and used the fertilizer on the plants. They started to grow much faster, but their consumption of Qi had reached a truly extreme point. For the first time, I was using the Qi production of the spirit vein to the limit. </p><p>“Well, that was a surprise,” I muttered. I was used to treating the spirit vein as a limitless source, but it seemed trying to forcibly mature a hundred Black Grade ginseng was actually the limit. But, after thinking a bit, it made sense. </p><p>If a grade one spirit vein was limitless, it would be valuable enough to move the whole Kartpa Valley into action rather than one outer sect elder moving without support. </p><p>“It looks like I need to continue adding spirit plants to turn it into a bigger ecosystem, just in case,” I said. One or two gardens wouldn’t be able to match the production capacity of the spirit vein, but what about a hundred … or a thousand. </p><p>One thing that the mortal kingdoms didn’t lack was the land. Of course, that meant putting a lot of effort into planting the plants, which I currently lack. Even with formations, it couldn’t be completely automated. </p><p>With the alchemy ploy done, I decided to pay a visit to the capital, to the ruins of the Spring Palace. Initially, I didn’t intend to test the stone gate there, but the discovery of the random Nascent Soul cultivator in Linnass scared me. </p><p>The Capital of Zaim was already defended with the intricate formation I had put in, which would certainly detect the presence of any Golden Core, and I was ready to bet that it would also notice the presence of a Nascent Soul cultivator. </p><p>A bet that I wasn’t happy to make, but I didn’t want to delay things too much. At least, the being in there had been imprisoned. </p><p>Once I arrived, I couldn’t help but feel fascinated by the stark difference. Just a few days ago, the streets were half empty. Now, they were filled with crowds that looked far happier than I had expected. Having a Queen that was strong enough to kill a Foundation Establishment cultivator was clearly paying off. </p><p>As much as I wanted to stop by Aisnam’s new royal guard and talk with them about the current status, I ignored it momentarily. It had been less than a week, and they were competent enough to keep everything together in such a short time. </p><p>Also, if there had been an emergency, they would have dropped a letter to one of the emergency spots, which would have triggered the formation to send me an alert. With that in mind, I directly walked to the ruins of the Spring Palace. </p><p>“What a waste,” I muttered. The ruins had been cleaned based on my orders, but there was no building, instead replaced by a beautiful garden. Still, I couldn’t help but miss the Palace. I had a lot of pleasant memories there. </p><p>With a sigh, I walked into the tunnel and stood in front of the stone gate. With the new formation in place, there was no cursed Qi slipping out, but that didn’t make the place any less dangerous. For that reason, I had started building multiple formations, far more complicated than anything else I had built. </p><p>The outer layer was to isolate the gate from anyone else. Then, there was a containment layer that was stronger than the stone gate, to make sure nothing would escape. Inside it, I had added several killing formations that would have easily killed a Golden Core cultivator … assuming, of course, he walked into the trap obediently. </p><p>Then, I started building similar formations around myself, creating a Qi equivalent of a diving suit. At the same time, I pulled a stack of talismans from my ring and kept them around my belt, ready to be used, be it for purification, shielding, or offensive means. </p><p>And, if the worst happened, I could always activate the flying boat for another layer of defense. </p><p>Only after all of the preparations had been completed, I had removed the protections on the stone gate and opened it. </p><p>The moment I opened it, the disgusting cursed Qi had spread, thick enough to kill me in a second despite my cultivation if it wasn’t for my defenses. However, while it was tempting to start purifying it, I decided against it. </p><p>Instead, I walked forward, aware of the risk I was taking. But, it was a better idea than just ignoring the risk. After following a short corridor, I found myself facing a spiral stairway, going deeper into the darkness. </p><p>I tried every detection method I could think of, but it detected nothing more than the cursed Qi. I decided to ignore every lesson I had learned from the horror movies and actually started to climb down. A scary process, but one that was inevitable. </p><p>Interestingly, there were no mysterious whispers tempting me this time, suggesting that the imprisoned being inside was still unconscious after its knowledge transfer. It can technically be a ploy, but I didn’t want to delay it any further. </p><p>I didn’t have the luxury of waiting until the conspiracy started moving. </p><p>The stairs had been taller than I expected, bringing me two miles deep underground, cutting deep. The deeper I got, the darker and the more corrupted everything had become, like even the stone itself had been sick and diseased. </p><p>The stairs ended up in another corridor, but this time. There were the remains of another gate there, but it had been long corroded, turning into dust. I followed the corridor … and it led me into a throne room, once again corroded and cursed. </p><p>The walls had been covered with rusty, corroded weapons, and flags that turned into garbage. However, even in their destroyed state, I was able to see the sigil of the Everdawn Empire in half of them. The other half had some kind of wolf, with the sigil of the sun still behind it. </p><p>Be it positioning or color, it was clear that it was some kind of noble of the Empire. </p><p>However, those barely held my attention compared to the figure at the center of the room. A corpse with half of the flesh rotten off, wrapped in golden chains, with a glowing, throbbing crystal sword stabbed through his chest. </p><p>I think I have finally found my forceful teacher. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>As I left Janassa, I was trying to keep calm, but failing. Once again, it was apparent that my smart scheme of calmly farming the System had backfired in a spectacular manner. The random person I had selected ended up being linked to Kartpa Valley.</p><p>If it wasn’t for my other experiences, I would have assumed that nothing bad would happen, but I had already experienced enough to know that, somehow, it would be relevant. </p><p>“Well, at least I have a warning,” I muttered even as I moved away, ready to activate my reward, which had been surprisingly pitiful. Just a Beginner comprehension, and nothing more. Which was weird, as while the Kartpa technique was more complicated than the other technique I had learned, it wasn’t enough to justify such a great drop. I was expecting Perfection at a minimum. </p><p>With a frown, I activated the reward … only to freeze as a shocking amount of information flooded into my brain, with an intensity that reminded me of the Foundation Establishment sword control technique, only more. </p><p>Kartpa Alchemy technique wasn’t only for Qi Gathering or Foundation Establishment stages. It wasn’t even limited to Golden Core, but actually included Nascent soul techniques. </p><p>Of course, that wasn’t exactly as incredible as it sounded. I couldn’t start making Golden Core pills, and not just because I lacked the necessary recipes. Like any other technique, alchemy techniques assumed a general competency in the basics of cultivation, like understanding how Qi worked at Golden Core, which I lacked. </p><p>It was even worse for Nascent Soul. Just a bunch of what was essentially a garbled mess, requiring an understanding of not only Golden Core’s compressed Qi, but something else. </p><p>“Let’s look at the bright side. It’s better to know and not need it than the otherwise,” I said. Ultimately, Janassa was already set up comfortably. I could supply her with more information through my Calligraphy, and the multiplier would continue to rise as her cultivation improved quickly thanks to the excellent cultivation environment I had created for her. </p><p>Especially since sooner or later, a few lessons later, I would be able to make some basic pills to a very high level to support her cultivation. </p><p>Then, I started walking back and forth, pondering the other benefits of receiving such a complex technique. “Maybe I can use it as a reference,” I muttered even as I started pondering on the new information I had received, wondering if it could benefit my formation ability. </p><p>It would certainly be a significant help when it came to the Foundation Establishment, as the working principles of Qi were pretty much the same, only with a much greater intensity, which I could supply with relative ease. </p><p>The Golden Core was a stretch, but it would still help if I ever had to fight against them. I might be lacking some critical information, but it still gave me a much better understanding of their abilities and limits than watching a few casual attacks from a distance. It was not enough to feel confident fighting against them, even with my formations, but it might change as I improve. </p><p>As for the Nascent Soul … that was currently hopeless. Even with the System’s help, it was still an incomprehensible mess. </p><p>“Let’s start working,” I muttered even as I pulled a bunch of paper, and started writing a nice treatise about how to reach the peak of Qi Gathering Realm. Improving her cultivation was the most important thing. That, and to see if I could get a better cauldron. </p><p>I needed to think about writing about the Kartpa Valley technique as well, but after a momentary thought, I decided against it. The beginner level was too early to teach her anything. I couldn’t ruin her potential development just to hurry up. </p><p>The long-term development was much better. Just like how reaching Immersion allowed me to bypass the need for learning formation schemas and allowed me to work freestyle, I was hoping the same would happen for alchemy. </p><p>Creating my own pills would be very beneficial when it came to improving further. I couldn’t sacrifice that for short-term benefits. </p><p>“But, do I need to actually do it,” I muttered even as I started writing a set of notes on the Umnim alchemy technique, which, in comparison to the Kartpa technique, was lacking significantly. But, I deliberately used poor handwriting.</p><p>Once that was finished, I didn’t wake Janassa up immediately. Instead, I spent my time working on the defensive formations, enough to enhance them somewhat. </p><p>“I need to get my hands on the Mutmah Formation technique,” I muttered even as I worked on it. While having an alchemy technique on the Golden Core realm was nice to have, having the same with the Formation Techniques would have been incredible. Mutmah sect was one of the four great sects, equivalent to Kartpa Valley, but mastering formations while Kartpa specialized in alchemy. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t something I was ready to work on immediately. I had too many urgent things to work on to go such a wild goose cheese. I just needed to keep an eye on any good candidate to ... grant an opportunity — kidnapping was such an ugly word. </p><p>I returned to the training area once Janassa woke up. I was tempted to cook her a delicious breakfast, but it would be suspicious for a servant to only bring food on certain days. Instead, I set a formation to handle the deliveries. </p><p>The formations were truly incredible. </p><p>I was about to visit her once she started working, but paused when I felt the distinct stirrings of opening a new gate. She was breaking through. I waited until she succeeded, picking the rewards. A better cauldron, more materials to practice, and some luxury items including some high-quality tea — according to my knowledge, and not my taste buds. </p><p>She was smiling widely as I entered. “Congratulations on your success, mistress,” I said even as I bowed. “I have your rewards for breaking through.” </p><p>“Hello,” she said as she waved at me cheerfully, then paused. “Hey, I just realized that you haven’t told me your name,” she said. </p><p>I made a show of flinching. “T-this servant is not allowed to use his name, mistress,” I said as I bowed. I didn’t want to miss a chance to make myself even more pitiful. “A punishment for my failure.” </p><p>“That’s horrible,” she gasped. “Can’t you just tell me?” </p><p>“No, mistress. I’ll be punished,” I said, shuddering badly. She looked even sadder. “I’ll only regain it if I can clear the alchemy trial.” </p><p>“Then come here and let’s work.” </p><p>“First, let me go over the rewards, mistress,” I said. “A better cauldron, higher quality materials to practice, and some other items of comfort.” </p><p>“Oh, there’s some tea leaves,” she said even as she grabbed it, smiling widely. “What’s going to happen with the old cauldron?” she asked. </p><p>“It’s yours. You can keep it, or sell it to the mystic land for points,” I said, but even as I said that, I threw a wistful glance at it, like I wanted nothing more than to have it. </p><p>Janassa was too sharp when it came to the feelings of the others to miss it. “How about I give it to you?

The points will come in handy,” I responded, looking shocked. </p><p>“That was not my question,” she said, smiling like she had caught me. “I asked whether or not am I allowed to give it to you.” </p><p>I sighed in mock defeat. “Y-you are, mistress,” I said. </p><p>“Excellent,” she said even as she passed it to me.</p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 40; Pity Bonus - 50 (Capped)]</p><p>[90x Return - Black Iron Alchemy Cauldron - Black Medium-Grade]</p><p>I didn’t need to fake a smile of enthusiasm, glad that I had given her a damaged but decent-quality cauldron in the first place.

    "content": "<p>I took a deep breath in preparation for using my Mediate skill, my gaze already turning toward the only source of mana available. </p><p>The ingots. </p><p>I knew that what I was about to do was wasteful. It was like destroying a brand new phone for its materials, so far below its value to be unbelievable. I still didn’t have a good idea of how much mana each ingot contained in terms of mana points, but if I were betting, I would be betting on single digits. </p><p>Low single digits. </p><p>“Doesn’t really matter,” I muttered as I reached the first ingot, heated it up, and started to destroy it methodically. It wasn’t the first time I was trying to extract mana from the ingots, so I was familiar with the process. At first, I destroyed a tiny portion, hoping that it would be enough to trigger the skill. </p><p>It was not. The little mana I managed to generate dispersed no matter how much I tried to interact with it. I repeated the process again, doubling the size of the pieces, but I failed every time. There was not even a response from my Meditation skill. It didn’t even engage with the mana. </p><p>“Interesting,” I muttered as the remaining half. First, I heated it up more, not just red, but the edge of melting. Then, I raised my hammer, took a deep breath, and demolished it as quickly as I could, turning it into a liquid potty. </p><p>Then, I closed my eyes, and engaged my new skill once more. This time, I had felt momentary feedback, similar to the instructions I got when I tried to repair it. I crossed my legs and took a position, but unfortunately, those instructions disappeared before I could pull some mana. </p><p>“Close enough to show viability, but not enough to actually work,” I muttered even as I heated up another ingot. The skill required a really strict pose and flow, very different from the ease Maria had displayed while she was gathering mana, but I couldn’t compare myself to her when it came to mana manipulation. </p><p>Not when my skill was just at one point. </p><p>“Let’s try again,” I muttered as I positioned myself perfectly before I destroyed the ingot. The mana radiated freely, and I let the skill run, not bothering to ponder on its impact or process. I just let the skill run its process. Most of the mana still dispersed, but I didn’t care about it, not when a small part of it stuck around me, grabbed by the skill.</p><p>The mana slowly circled around me before it sank into my body. It took more than a minute, but I was fascinated with the process. The tendrils of mana circulated around me, getting closer and closer as if they were planets orbiting the sun. </p><p>The tendrils got closer and closer, until they touched my skin. From there, they disappeared with a soft tingle, replaced by a notification. </p><p>[+1 Mana]</p><p>“Fascinating,” I said as I tried to ponder on the process. I tried to touch the reservoir of mana in me, but it failed utterly. Not a surprise. I had Health for three years, and I could barely channel it, and I needed to injure myself beforehand to trigger the flow. </p><p>“Now, let’s see if I can use it,” I said as I raised my work hammer, and used my Mana Blow perk. A glow appeared on my hammer as I felt a tingling sensation travel through my hand. </p><p>[-1 Mana]</p><p>I tried to absorb it back … but it just dispersed. All my effort had just evaporated in one blow, but I didn’t let it bother me. Ultimately, it was just another experiment. One that was more expensive than I would have liked, but an experiment nonetheless. </p><p>I destroyed another ingot, once again letting the skill catch some of the mana while the rest dispersed. This time, I paid more attention to the movement of the skill, feeling a sense of rotation inside me, similar to how I felt whenever I used to inspect. </p><p>Slowly, the mana pulled toward me. It was a slow, painstaking process, too complicated to understand with just one attempt. I let the mana seep into my skin once more. </p><p>On the next attempt, I tried to interrupt halfway. It worked to give me a better understanding of the process, but the mana that was under my control had dissipated before I could absorb it. A waste, but considering I wouldn’t be able to do anything with a few points, not exactly a big one. </p><p>I thought about using the last five ingots, but I decided against it. Every ingot represented a chance to improve my Mana Forge skill, which was more important than another ineffectual experiment. I had already understood the basics, and while I wanted to experiment more, I needed hundreds, maybe thousands more repeats. One more repeat wouldn’t help. </p><p>I just needed to decide what to do with the sole point of Mana I had. “I wonder if I can release it by reversing the meditation technique,” I muttered. It seemed like a reasonable risk. I closed my eyes, trying to visualize the same effect, wanting to see if I could control it like my other skills. </p><p>Unfortunately, I failed to engage the skill. Helpless, I destroyed another ingot, the presence of mana allowing me to trigger the skill. I tried to replicate the same effect, but pushing the mana instead of pulling. An operation that was much harder than the summarized description suggested. </p><p>But, I did it —</p><p>[-1 Mana]</p><p>[Meditation (Common) - 1 -&gt; 8]</p><p>Any other time, I would be very happy to see seven points of jump in my new skill. But, right now, I have other priorities. Like, the worst pain I ever felt hitting me hard, like someone had been ripping my insides. I pushed my Health overdrive in panic, trying to fix whatever I had ruined even as I vomited blood, dazed and shivering. </p><p>The discomfort lasted for minutes while I lay on the ground, somehow managing not to shout, but it was a close call. I kept my voice suppressed, and only because I could feel that whatever damage that had been done had recovered. </p><p>[-582 Health]</p><p>“Well, that was a way to improve,” I muttered as I stood up, realizing just how close I had pushed myself to death. It seemed that I had become arrogant in my recent chain of success. It was a close call. I had lost almost two-thirds of my Health in one mistake, and that was with all my leveling up. </p><p>I didn’t even want to imagine what such a botched attempt would do to a mage. Most of them didn’t have Double Vitality to absorb the damage of accidental self-harm. And, that was only one point of mana. </p><p>Even though I had improved my skills far more than I had been expecting, I wasn’t entirely happy. The pain had been bad, the recovery was a close thing. I stood up to go to the small attached pantry, cooking a large piece of monster steak. It would slowly recover my lost Health, but it would take a while. </p><p>So, before eating it, I took one of the emergency concentrated potions designed to replenish Health, filling it completely. Luckily, a workshop was a dangerous place with a lot of fire and sharp objects, so keeping a stock of health potions was always a smart idea. </p><p>A chain of notifications appeared, showing the slow recovery. Even with the potion, it wasn’t exactly an instantaneous process. </p><p>[+1 Health] … [+1 Health]</p><p>At the same time, I grabbed a second one, preparing myself for another attempt. Painful and risky it might be, the ability to rapidly increase my Meditation skill was too valuable. Not only did I need to support my two skills, but also I needed to discover its secrets as fast as possible. </p><p>I wanted to see if I could improve it to a higher grade before I reach level fifty, and see if I could get a new class. The risk was acceptable, especially since this time I had brought a second potion, ready to assist. </p><p>First, I destroyed another ingot, using Meditation to absorb it. The initial pattern stayed the same. Some kind of illusory orb inside me, spinning while it captured a point of mana into its orbit, slowly dragging it close. However, the higher skill level allowed me to absorb mana faster. </p><p>[+1 Mana]</p><p>I crossed my legs, taking a deep breath to prepare myself for the torture … and reversed the flow. </p><p>[-1 Mana]</p><p>[Meditation (Common) - 8 -&gt; 11]</p><p>[Perk Options — Efficient Absorption / Controlled Flow] </p><p>As much as I would have loved to ponder on the new stats, I was too busy vomiting blood as I trembled. Ten minutes later, I lay down, trying to catch my breath as Health did its job. </p><p>[-519 Health]</p><p>“The damage wasn’t as bad,” I muttered as I forced myself. It was a good sign. Maybe, someday, I could repeat it without almost killing myself. </p><p>I just drank the potion as I forced myself up to my feet, I pondered on which perk to choose, but after a while, I settled on Controlled Flow. Once again, if it turned useless, I could just use a Perk Reset stone. Then, I destroyed one last ingot, absorbing the mana. There was a slight increase in absorption speed, but not enough to be about a new perk. </p><p>Then, I used my Mana Blow perk, and noticed the gathered mana was easier to control. “Excellent,” I muttered. Control was a much better perk than faster absorption for me; both as a blacksmith and as a scientist. </p><p>And, if it made my reversal trick less suicidal, even better. </p><p>I wanted to go and sleep. Depleting my Health twice left me even more exhausted than I had been, and the mental load of a close call with death wasn’t any easier to swallow. Yet, before going to bed, I cleaned the forge twice, making sure I got rid of all evidence. </p><p>No need to ruin everything due to a bout of carelessness. </p><p>My bed looked even more inviting than I remembered. I threw myself to its depths. The darkness claimed me before I could hit the bed. </p>",

The moment I asked, she tensed. Understandable, as it was rather rude to ask such questions. Of course, using identification magic on people without permission was even ruder, but I wasn’t entirely surprised by her double standards. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I had dealt with the upper crust. </p><p>“Which one?” she asked, her tone deceptively calm. </p><p>“Just meditation,” I replied quickly. “That’s how every mage absorbs their mana, right?” </p><p>“Just the ones too poor to afford a better variant. Meditation kind of sucks,” she said with a haughty chuckle. I didn’t care about her unintentional insult. I much preferred that to a tense Maria who would second guess every question. “Why do you ask?” </p><p>“I was thinking of the mana alloy experiment we tried. Maybe if I know how mana behaves, I can develop some new experiments.” </p><p>“About that…” she muttered. “I would be busy for the next few days. The caravan bringing the new recruits is passing through a dangerous spot, and I have to go defend them.” </p><p>For a moment, I considered volunteering, tempted to spend some time in a location that didn’t lack mana, but that thought went as quickly as it arrived. Just because I had got somewhat stronger didn’t mean I should turn into a barbarian throwing myself into potential danger. </p><p>Slow and steady. </p><p>“Even better,” I said, which surprised her. And, I even saw a hint of hurt on her face. “I need some time designing new experiments and working on some theories. If I prepare enough, I can make sure I don’t bore you with repetitive stuff. Science can be somewhat boring,” I rapidly explained. </p><p>That earned a chuckle. “Don’t worry. I don’t find your company that offensive,” she said. “I would have loved to spend more time, but with this damnable challenge —” she added, then cut herself. “Anyway, you were asking about meditation.” </p><p>“Yes. How does it work?” </p><p>“Hmm, it’s hard to describe it to someone lacking mana sensitivity. But, the easiest way to say that, the mana outside our bodies is different, reluctant to interact with us. Meditation allows us to align with the mana outside our bodies and pull it to our bodies.” </p><p>“That’s it?” I asked. “Any other use?” </p><p>“No, that’s it,” she answered. “It’s a fundamental skill, but that’s it. The rarer variants have more advantages, like selectively absorbing different types of mana and such, but at its core, it’s limited.” </p><p>“Interesting. And, are there any patterns as you pulled it similar to the structure of the spells you use?” </p><p>She paused a moment, thinking. From her attitude, I could see that she didn’t spend a lot of time on it. A waste, but I wasn’t surprised. Almost everyone was like that. Just like most people didn’t know how electricity actually worked before the Cataclysm, most people didn’t really care about the finer mechanics of the skills. </p><p>A waste. </p><p>“It’s … softer,” she finally replied. “The spells usually work in hexagonal patterns at the center, surrounded by more complicated mana structures. The meditation lacks that. It’s more like a gentle spiral.” </p><p>I wanted to ask a few more questions, but I could see that her frustration was already building up. “Thanks, it helps,” I said, ignoring the temptation to ask more. “B3,” I called instead. </p><p>“Interesting start,” she said as she responded, her mood shifting in an instant. </p><p>“Well, I have to keep you on your toes. Sooner or later, I’ll win,” I replied, more than happy to distract her from her earlier failure. I knew that she didn’t like to look weak, and she was proud of her, well, Intelligence and intelligence. She would ponder on the question I asked if only to dazzle me the next time. </p><p>It would work far better than bombarding her with questions she couldn’t answer. </p><p>Even as we played chess, I could see that it was working. Many times, the mana around her stirred and started flowing to her, only to cease its flow and reverse. Unfortunately, while Essence allowed me to see the way the mana moved, it proved supremely useless to glean anything. No more than I could understand a hurricane by just looking from the outside. </p><p>The mana just gathered around her in complicated patterns before disappearing into her body. </p><p>Still, I was hopeful that, once we landed, she would have interesting insights for me. Too bad those hopes were dashed the moment we landed, and found Eleanor waiting for us. She glared at me. “We have an emergency meeting, my lady,” she said. </p><p>“Sure. Devon, do you want to join?” she asked. </p><p>“He has some emergency repairs he needs to finish,” Eleanor cut in. I was pretty I did not, not with the dungeon operations slowing down, but her glare was easy to read. </p><p>“True. I need to stay ahead of the curve until the other blacksmiths join in,” I replied, not willing to antagonize Eleanor just to join their important meeting. </p><p>“Alright,” Maria said. “Have a good night,” she said, and I went back to my workshop. A lot of damaged weapons were waiting for me there. A quick count confirmed their numbers at eighty. I could easily repair them in under five hours, even lower if I pulled some new tricks thanks to my improved skills. Enough to finish everything before going to sleep despite my exhaustion, but I did not do that. </p><p>First, Eleanor was still under the impression that it took me just under ten minutes to repair a sword, so it would be suspicious if she arrived only to find the order was complete. More importantly, I had yet to test my Mana Repair and Mana Forge skills properly. </p><p>I had been too busy trying to get rid of any evidence of my success to test them properly. </p><p>Of course, I had used them to make a few new weapons and fix a few, but it was mostly following the directions of the System. Certainly not something I would call a proper test, let alone experimentation. “First, let’s gather some more data,” I muttered even as I started repairing the weapons. “Fascinating,” I muttered. </p><p>Previously, I wasn’t able to see mana. The Inspect gave me a good idea about what I had been doing, but the difference was stark. In contrast, Essence didn’t give me the ability to see the mana trapped in the metal, but in conjunction with Inspect. Previously, I was using an X-ray, and now, I was using a combination of X-ray and MRI, giving me a lot more information than I expected. </p><p>And, with that information, far too many tricks to fix the weapons. I wondered if I could figure out some kind of cold forging trick with mana. Without a need to continuously heat up the swords, the repair would take even less time. </p><p>“Fascinating, and utterly useless for the current situation,” I muttered. After all, the whole reason they needed blacksmiths to repair the weapons rather than using repair spells was the lack of environmental mana. </p><p>Technically, it was not correct. I knew that repair spell took a pretty chunk of mana. I didn’t know the exact numbers, but I had seen mages at work. They had to stop and mediate after a few times. Hard to guess the exact number without knowing their levels, but I would be shocked if it cost less than a hundred mana. </p><p>Depending on how much mana I would need, technically it could still be sustainable even without environmental mana. Of course, that was just a theory. I still didn’t know exactly what a point of mana represented, how much it would take to repair a sword, the cost of mana supplements, the speed of repair… </p><p>Ultimately, however, it was nothing more than a thought exercise. Regardless of the result, I couldn’t use it here, because I wasn’t planning on revealing my rare skills. I continued to repair the swords, trying new tricks thanks to my ability to better view the structure. </p><p>A routine task, but not without its rewards. </p><p>[Mana Repair (Rare) - 25 -&gt; 26]</p><p>Seeing my class skills improve had always been a nice thing, but it turned into something truly wondrous now that I was aware of the benefits. So, I was more than happy to stretch the work to try new tricks, trying to gain more points. It meant I was once again pushing myself to work instead of sleeping … but it wouldn’t be the first stretch when I neglected sleep. </p><p>Too bad it made me crave a hot cup of steaming, bitter coffee. Or several. </p><p>I ignored that desire as I worked, discovering some new tricks thanks to my enhanced vision. Some of those tricks even triggered some nice responses from my Repair skill, allowing it to improve far faster than I expected. When midnight came, I merely finished repairing ten swords. </p><p>But, other benefits made it worth it. </p><p>[Mana Repair (Rare) - 26 -&gt; 34]</p><p>One of my class skills had improved significantly. Now, it was time to see if I could repeat it with my newest one. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Congratulations,” she called as the mana around me calmed down. “Now, you belong to a new tier. How does it feel?” </p><p>I killed another beast and realized that my movements were noticeably smoother. For a moment, I thought that it was my increased Dexterity, but her reaction suggested that there was another reason. “Smooth, like I weigh much less,” I said. </p><p>“That’s because stepping over the threshold makes you get more aligned with your stats. It’s very helpful,” she said. “You’ll notice the difference even more as you push yourself,” she said. </p><p>“Certainly a welcome change,” I answered even as I moved to the next monster. “It feels amazing.” </p><p>I wanted nothing more than to sit down and absorb mana now that I actually had the ability to do so. However, I ignored that temptation, for one simple reason. The moment I gained Essence, the world had shifted slightly, giving me the ability to perceive mana. Meaning, that Maria would notice easily if I tried to absorb mana. </p><p>It was almost visual, though it didn’t suddenly distort the world with a blanket of blue or something equally annoying. I could just … perceive it. The quick way I could dismiss developing a completely new sense was a good indicator of just how ridiculous the System was. Miracles lost their quality of wonder once they became commonplace. </p><p>I killed another beast, focusing on other changes. Compared to other things, the slight increase in my Dexterity was less notable, but certainly welcome. A lot of complicated forge work required fine motor control and timing. Dexterity helped with both. </p><p>However, the real surprise was the sudden appearance of the new skill. Meditation. The Skill the mages used to collect mana. </p><p>I wondered if the appearance of it meant that it qualified as a class skill, or it was just as an external skill. I would have questioned Maria about it, but I had already asked too many questions about some potentially sensitive topics. I didn’t want to alert her. </p><p>Especially since just needed to raise meditate to level ten to learn the truth. No inconvenient questions were necessary. I just needed to show a little patience. I killed another wounded monster instead of using the skill I wanted to use. </p><p>[Level 25 -&gt; 26]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>Double points in Dexterity, which was less impressive than getting a point in Essence. It looked like these points arrived in an alternating pattern. Not a particularly useful information, but it was always better to know more. </p><p>Speaking of knowing more, I had one more thing I needed to learn. How Identify worked. Previously, the only thing that I felt was a subtle whisper. I wanted to see if anything would be different now that I had the ability to perceive mana. </p><p>“Look at my level,” I declared Maria proudly, almost smugly. </p><p>“Another upgrade, congratulations,” she declared, but I was more interested in the line of mana that stretched from them to me, tickling as it touched me … and nothing. There were no complicated mana structures that appeared whenever she cast it. Just a touch. </p><p>Then, maybe it made sense. After all, it was a skill, so it made sense it worked similarly to my Inspect perk. It didn’t require any mana either. That mana was just there to create a remote contact while the skill handled the rest was an easy assumption to make. </p><p>Whether that assumption was true, I didn’t know yet, but it was how science worked. Make assumptions, design experiments, and then validate. </p><p>“Level twenty-six. Impressive,” Maria said, easily checking my level without any further mana fluctuations inside me. Still, it was good that I could detect if someone used it on me. Well, unless my assumption was correct. Then, I would need to be careful touching anyone. “We might bring you to somewhere around thirty-five as long as we work hard.” </p><p>“Well, I’m a hard worker, not to mention my stamina is endless,” I declared proudly, mostly to play off her enthusiasm. It might have been the biggest benefit of the System. I hadn’t been a fan of exercising before the Cataclysm, so getting some external help was certainly welcome. </p><p>“You do?” she said, but I noticed a blush on her face. Maybe exhaustion. She must have been pushing herself harder than I realized. </p><p>“C3,” I called, once again starting a chess game. Since she was getting exhausted, I better provide her with some entertainment to keep her going. </p><p>More levels meant more safety. We changed locations multiple times, moving to new locations once the monster density had decreased, but as the place was starting to get dark, I reached level thirty-two. Not exactly as high as Maria wished, but more than incredible for my purposes. </p><p>But, before leaving, I wanted to try one more thing. “Hey, do you mind letting one go without wounding it? I want to see if I can take it down unassisted. And, a little combat practice with my new abilities wouldn’t be amiss.” </p><p>“Good idea. Skills improve faster when you fight directly,” she said as she looked at the horizon. “And, we can still stay around ten minutes until it starts to get dangerous.” Then, she frowned. “I’m not ready to listen to another lecture from Eleanor.” </p><p>I chuckled, amused that she cared more about Eleanor’s words than the significantly increased danger factor from monster attacks. I had to admit, that being strong had its advantages.</p><p>“Thanks,” I said. “Do you mind letting go of something strong but slow?” </p><p>“I have just the monster,” she answered as she adjusted her spells, and soon, one that looked like an animated tree stump lumbered toward me. </p><p>“Excellent choice,” I said as I moved toward it. Slow with incredible endurance, the target was truly a good choice. Especially since I had misled her about the aim of my practice a bit. While I wanted to practice, the aim was the opposite of what Maria had thought. </p><p>I had two objectives. First, I wanted to get used to holding back. Bringing any skill to even twenties was supposed to be a significant hurdle. Bringing it above fifty in less than a day was flat-out suspicious. So, I wanted to get used to sandbagging my physical prowess. And, as an added bonus, if I had to reveal it, I could mention that I had been working hard during my leveling trips. </p><p>It would make a good cover story for anyone but Eleanor. I doubted that anyone but her would go to Maria and ask for the exact time I spent working on my skill rather than leveling. </p><p>“Come on, buddy,” I said even as I circled around the beast, my hammer raised high. It lashed against me with one of its branches, but I met with a blow of my hammer. The beast was strong, but I was stronger, easily parrying the attack. “Wow, it feels good not to be thrown away,” I said. Blacksmith might not match most Warrior classes in Strength, but we weren’t too far behind them. Double stat points were still respectable. </p><p>But, Strength didn’t exactly translate to combat capability. An Olympic Weightlifter could lift more than a heavyweight boxer, but that wouldn’t have prevented them from being demolished in the ring. Skills were that important. </p><p>And, now, it was not a problem for me anymore. The hammer swung with a perfect, eerie accuracy, parrying the next two attacks, before I reflexively took a step forward and smashed the trunk twice. Hammer of Might showed its name, demolishing the tree. </p><p>“Damn,” I muttered in frustration. I wasn’t planning to take it down that easily, but I wasn’t able to keep the skill back. The sudden improvement affected me more than I expected. I looked at Maria, expecting a suspicious gaze. </p><p>“Very good,” she just said instead. “All that killing really improved your skill, right?” </p><p>“Yes,” I said, more than happy to be underestimated. “How about if you let out something slightly faster?” </p><p>“One large bear, coming up,” she said cheerily as she let it forward. </p><p>I chuckled at her callous attitude, like she wasn’t letting forward a beast that would have killed me easily in several blows before my little discovery with the hammer skill. I dodged the attacks easily, parrying the attacks. </p><p>Multiple times, the skill forced me to lunge forward to take down the bear. Just as the name suggested, Hammer of Might was a very aggressive style that focused on leveraging the benefits of the Strength to the max. </p><p>Luckily, thanks to controlling my Repair skills for three years, I was familiar with how to ignore the suggestions from the skills selectively. It was harder to apply during a combat scenario, but as I practiced against the bear, I was getting a hang of it. I managed to stretch it to one minute before I killed it. </p><p>However, I did receive a nasty blow while doing my best to keep back. Recovering from it took quite a bit. </p><p>[-42 Health] </p><p>“Careful,” she warned. “Do you want to stop, or…” </p><p>“Nothing more than a flesh wound,” I said, ignoring the fact that, without Health to help me recover, it would have likely killed me from internal bleeding. “We only have a few minutes. Let’s not waste too much time.” </p><p>“Good point,” she said. A few more fights, and I was having a much easier time controlling it against active targets. From here, all I needed was to practice alone for a while, and it would give me what I needed. “I think that’s enough for the day,” I called. “It has been another amazing day. Thank you very much. You’re amazing,” I said, leaning a bit heavily on the compliments. </p><p>But, she certainly deserved it, helping me progress that much. </p><p>“My … pleasure,” she said, her voice surprisingly stilted. </p><p>She must have been really tired of stammering like that. I made a note to find an appropriate gift for her. She deserved it. </p>",
