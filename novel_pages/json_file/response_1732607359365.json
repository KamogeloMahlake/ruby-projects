    "content": "<p>“Wow, it’s a nice stadium, much better than the little marble place that they had built to entertain that jerk,” my guide said even as I found a parking place near the entrance before floating forward, examining the stadium. </p><p>I had a sinking feeling that that jerk was Zeus once again, and the little stadium was probably the stadium built for original Olympic games, famously dedicated for the honor of Zeus. </p><p>She certainly had a unique way of name-dropping. </p><p>I ignored that particular nugget — which was getting increasingly easier, especially since she didn’t have the ability to interact with anything except me — and slammed the door close. Luckily, the car didn’t break down, allowing me to arrive at the correct time. </p><p>After a small pause where I picked my sports bag from the trunk, I walked toward a desk at the entrance, with a sign marking it as the registration booth for the practice squad. The desk was manned by a tall, blonde guy, muscular enough to suggest that he was a part of the team. His general disinterest and smugness as he pushed a paper toward me suggested he was not a part of the practice squad, but the team. </p><p>“Are you here for the try-outs?” he asked, not bothering to raise his gaze from his phone. </p><p>“Yes,” I said, suppressing the temptation to state whether it was obvious. No need to anger team members. </p><p>“Fill the form first,” he said, his eyes still down. </p><p>I didn’t try to make small talk, not when he clearly treated his job as a nuisance. </p><p>I quickly filled the form, a simple one that asked for various personal information, along with the current department and the affiliated sports discipline, if any. While I filled my form, I checked the other papers. They were mostly track athletes, with a smattering of basketball players. </p><p>I was the only chess player. Shocking. </p><p>“Done,” I said and pulled it. The blond guy took it with a grunt, but before I could take more than two steps away, he shouted. “Hey, where are you going?” </p><p>“To the locker room,” I answered, confused at his weird reaction. </p><p>“Not before you fill the form properly.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked with a frown. “It’s filled properly.” </p><p>“Nonsense,’ he said, though I only understood his point when he raised the form, his finger on the affiliated discipline, which said blitz chess. </p><p>“Yes,” I said with a sigh of resignation, realizing where it was about to go. “I’m a part of the chess team.” </p><p>He looked at my face incredulously, trying to see if I was joking, but seeing no hint of humor, he grabbed my form, and ripped it off. “Fuck off and play with your little dolls, nerd. We don’t want weaklings in our team.” </p><p>I was ready to calmly argue my point unnecessarily in order to avoid trouble with my future teammate. Unfortunately, for the blonde giant who decided my current discipline was a good reason to kick me out. </p><p>Normally, it would be the time I threw a punch. Not because I was furious, but because years of experience back in the high school football team taught me that physical violence was always a good way to communicate feelings between teammates. </p><p>And my years in my street taught me that the first punch was an excellent way of winning the fight. </p><p>However, this time, I wanted to try a different approach, and test the brand new Intimidation Trait I had received, but failed to test during the game. </p><p>How kind was my newest teammate, volunteering to be a tests subject. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, a snarl already on my face as I took an aggressive step forward, my shoulders tense. My stance was different than the one I used back in the chess tournament when I was trying to intimidate my opponents. There, I was silent yet confident, like a lion prowling lazily among a herd of helpless gazelle. </p><p>But here, I was retaliating against aggression, like the leader of the lion pride, ready to teach the arrogant little hyena a lesson about not angering the wrong king. </p><p>Even without the benefit of my new Trait, I had all the confidence of breaking down an arrogant football player who had been unimportant enough to be relegated to the reception desk, albeit with a couple of punches thrown in. </p><p>This time, I didn’t need to. The Intimidation Trait helped to convey my willingness to fight perfectly. </p><p>And facing against someone actually willing to fight, my potential teammate was quick to take a step back, literally as well as metaphorically. “Maybe you’re not soft for a chess player,” he murmured, trying to sound cheerful, but failing to do so. My smirk just widened. “Why don’t you fill the form again and we call this a bonding exercise.” </p><p>“I already did,” I said, putting just enough threatening growl to enhance the effect. He gulped before turning and picking up the pieces of paper he had thrown, pulling a new form to fill himself. </p><p>Only then, I walked away, happy with the success of the last field test of my mysterious Traits. </p><p>Though, I didn’t want to overestimate the effects of Intimidation just because of some success. The guy I just faced was tall and muscular, but that didn’t change the fact that he was soft. Maybe even the softest on the team despite his size. </p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been kicked to handle the boring task of handling the newcomers. </p><p>“What a rude boy,” my guide finally chimed in with a frown as she looked at him dismissively. I just shrugged. Though I was glad that her apparent innocence didn’t extend to objecting to intimidating others. </p><p>Luckily, they thought about putting some signs to direct the newcomers to the assigned locker room. “Do you want to come inside?” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“N-no,” she said, choosing to stay outside, blushing cutely. </p><p>I chuckled even as I entered a relatively empty locker room, a few people changing. I took some shared gear piled from the table, including a helmet and plastic padding that reasonably fit my size. They were not new, nor well-maintained. Still, they were leagues better than the decade-old equipment we had in my low-budget inner-city high school. </p><p>So, unlike the other candidates, bitching and moaning about the low-quality equipment, I quickly put them on and left the locker room. </p><p>I didn’t want to be the last one to arrive. That was the way to be noticed by the coach. And not the good way. </p><p>When we arrived at the stadium, my guide floated away — though, once again, never more than fifty feet — leaving me alone to examine the field. On the left side of the field, the newcomers gathered. On the other side, the team, the training was underway. </p><p>And just with a glance, I could see the reason for the losing streak of ‘glorious’ Sunset Pirates. </p><p>There was no discipline. It wasn’t too noticeable, but my high school coach was a discipline-obsessed one. For him, every single repeat had to be perfect to attain success, otherwise, training was a waste of time. </p><p>It was an approach I embraced as well. Unfortunately, the members of the offense team, currently occupying the field, clearly didn’t join the same school of thought. Their starts were not explosive, the routes they run loose, and they were simply too chatty between themselves. </p><p>My old high school coach would have killed them. </p><p>Though, their lackluster practice didn’t mean they were weak. Not in terms of the physical traits. No, as the star recruits all across the state, those aspects they excelled. Strong, fast, agile. Watching them reminded me of my decision to change my scholarship focus. In general, I wasn’t weak. I was tall, strong, and fast. </p><p>But every single guy on that field was either faster, stronger, or bigger than me — depending on the role. And from what I could see, the ones in the same category as me — the tight ends and some of the more physical slot receivers for the offense, which was currently in training — clearly eclipsed me in all three categories. </p><p>And the drills they were going through certainly drove that detail even deeper. </p><p>Interestingly, the drills they were going through suggested that everyone on the field belonged to the offense team. </p><p>I used to play defense, the only position my relatively balanced build allowed. </p><p>In football, the defense had three critical components. The defensive line, linebackers, and the secondary. </p><p>Except for a small stint at the beginning of high school thanks to my early growth spurt, I didn’t play as a part of the defensive line. The defensive line’s aim objective of defeating the opposing offensive line required overwhelming physical strength, considerable more than my lithe body could provide. </p><p>The same fact was true for the secondary. Both the cornerbacks and safeties were tasked to cover the wide receivers of the other side, and to defend the great empty field on the back. They were usually the fastest players on the team. Compared to the overall recruit, I lacked the speed, so unless an emergency in the roster due to an injury, I didn’t play that role either. </p><p>I was a linebacker, the second wall behind the defensive lines, essentially the core of the defense, responsible for handling the attacking team’s tactical tricks. A linebacker attacked the opposing quarterback, blocked the runner that slipped away from the defensive line, or tried to block an inside pass, depending on the latest trick of the opponent. </p><p>My mixture of strength, agility, and speed worked well to play linebacker, especially when combined with my early physical growth. And my chess experience helped me a lot when it came to playing the real challenging part of playing the linebacker. </p><p>The tactics. </p><p>Among all the players, the ability to read the game was most important for the linebackers — except the quarterback, of course. </p><p>Playing chess didn’t give me any movie-type magical abilities to see the field of course, nor it gave me an intelligence boost. Ironically, it helped because of the study discipline it gave me. Professional football players studied hours and hours about the little details of the game to handle their role, something their high school counterparts were much less enthusiastic about, helping me to be more distinguished. </p><p>Enough to be the target of the constant curses of the opponent, the best compliment a defensive player could ever receive.  </p><p>It was a good time, working hard, defeating opponents, and hoping for a better future. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Patience, I decided after some consideration. The best thing I could do facing a completely unfamiliar tradition of magic, with all the traps and dangers it implied, was to show patience. </p><p>As much as I hated sticking around the base of an unknown enemy protected by an unfamiliar set of warding, I hated leaving that enemy’s status as unknown even more. </p><p>There was an art to stake out an unknown location, especially when the place was guarded by an unknown number of guards with equally unknown skill sets. </p><p>Luckily, the Blade of Shadows removed the biggest challenge, namely, finding a safe location, and a role that would not raise suspicion due to extended presence. Of course, the mysterious enemy wasn’t just relying on their eyes to catch an unwelcome guest — if they were relying on that at all. I could feel the occasional sweeps of magic spreading out to observe the surrounding. </p><p>Luckily, there was no consciousness driving those magical feelers, suggesting it was an automatic aspect of the protective wards that surrounded the building. The ward itself was ingenious, and due to the mysterious tradition that created its basis, impossible to decipher. </p><p>Breaking it directly was not something I could achieve, not when it was constructed for such a difficult reason.  </p><p>Luckily, the same didn’t apply to managing its external detection. Ultimately, it was a static response, making those detection feelers possible to trick, at least to a mage at my level of competence. </p><p>Arrogance, I realized. The arrogance of their architecture. </p><p>Combined with their display back in the palace, it suggested the enemy was arrogant. Extremely so. </p><p>I just wasn’t sure whether to be happy or afraid of that fact. </p><p>Normally, my response would have been pure happiness. An arrogant enemy was a fragile enemy, easy to carefully wrap in my ploys before taking them down. The conquest of Sapphire was an excellent example. The Queen of the Empire, so confident in the power of her magical equipment that she preferred to keep me imprisoned in the depths of her palace, only to lose everything. </p><p>However, the current situation with the newest mysterious enemy was different. I knew the reason for Sapphire’s arrogance. After all, they had managed to take me down in my own base, and assumed that I would be helpless without my castle, my henchmen, and my treasury. </p><p>She just miscalculated how much her advantages were truly advantages, and how much the loss of my base would hinder me.</p><p>The new enemy was different. They were showing that arrogance in the middle of the base of their enemy, and they were displaying that arrogance to a shocking degree. The problem, I had no idea where their arrogance was coming from, and that made me scared. </p><p>There was nothing worse than preparing for a fistfight, only to realize the opponent was carrying a magical sword. </p><p>I needed to understand, so, no matter how tempting was to return to my bed to get a good night’s sleep before starting to draw a new strategy, I stayed outside, carefully sending out weak strings of mana to the ward that surrounded the building, light enough to be mistaken into an environmental flicker, trying to understand its nature. </p><p>Also, I wanted to drag Emma away the moment she left the building. Unfortunately, she was still imprisoned. </p><p>As minutes turned into hours, I was starting to get a rudimentary feel of the wards. They were somewhat familiar, but in a way I could pin immediately. But one thing I was sure, it wasn’t the scraps I had learned in the library that was giving that help. </p><p>It was an older impression.  </p><p>However, before I could make a deduction, a hooded figure approached the building, carrying some kind of glowing symbol etched on a card in his right hand, while holding a suspiciously struggling sack on his back with his other hand. </p><p>“Arrogance,” I murmured even as I expanded my feelers before he could enter the building, delving deep into the little magical card to memorize the ward on it. It was not an easy task, certainly not something I could achieve without the Tether. </p><p>Unfortunately for my enemies, hypothetical didn’t help against the facts. I did have the Tether, and when the man finally stepped into the area that was under the control of the ward, I had already completed copying it, and etching the same symbol to a rock in my hand. I watched carefully as the wards reacted to the symbol the man was carrying, trying to understand if there was any secondary control, informing someone inside about the entrance. </p><p>But the way the ward reacted instantly, and its relative stability, suggested that it was completely automatic. </p><p>I hadn’t been able to use the same trick earlier, because Emma’s escort hadn’t used a disposable item, casting the spell directly instead. With her obvious magical competence, I was afraid of testing her too much. </p><p>I hoped my conclusion was correct, because I was betting a lot there. Not my life, of course. The ward was completely unfamiliar, preventing me from sneaking in the usual way, but escaping from inside, with both the Shield of Ether and Tether of the Underworld in my possession, a brute force solution was always an option. </p><p>I was curious about the identity of the enemy, but not enough to commit myself to a suicide mission. </p><p>I would have loved to wait for a few minutes for the ward to settle just in case before I walked forward, but I was afraid of the existence of the other security measures. The best idea was to follow that hooded figure, using him as a guide.</p><p>Luckily, the impromptu key I had fashioned worked excellently, allowing me to pass through the wards without the slightest issue. Amateurs, I thought, unable to hide the feeling of derision. Despite all the power they had put behind the wards, they failed because of a simple design principle. </p><p>The first thing I noticed as I entered was two marble statues of hooded, armored men, crafted to perfection, though the amount of magic radiating from them suggested that they might not be just decoration. As we moved forward, I noticed other statues, with equal magical potency, which hardly helped me to feel confident against the source of the enemy.</p><p>Those kinds of magical items were neither cheap nor efficient. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I was using an enemy that was relying on that kind of magical construct as a part of their defenses, but that didn’t mean I was surprised by their presence. Because all magical constructs, be it golems, enchanted armors, moving statues, all shared two deadly faults. </p><p>Limited flexibility was their first problem. Like an uncontrolled ward, their reactions were limited to the number of scenarios someone had embedded into its structure. However, there were many guard locations that their limited flexibility was not a problem. Still, they were very rare. </p><p>The reason lied in their second problem. The cost. </p><p>Not all constructs were expensive, of course. Not prohibitively so, at least. Many merchants had a few of them for showing off, as a status symbol. They might even take down a few bandits. But making one strong enough to make a difference against a competent mage, or a decent warrior was a different challenge. Those not only took a small fortune to make, required an even bigger fortune to maintain. </p><p>It was much cheaper to hire a top-tier knight for the job. </p><p>And the fact that I could see twenty of those constructs littering through just the entrance of the corridor was weird. The money that was spent on those was enough to raise an actual army, unless they were built by a completely innovative method of construction. </p><p>However, combined with the weirdly competent yet smug attitude of the mysterious person escorting Emma, I felt that it wasn’t the case. </p><p>Perfect, I thought. Another fucking mystery. Like the issues I had in hand weren’t enough. </p><p>When the hooded figure took a turn, I abandoned that line of thought for a moment. I maintained my focus while following the hooded figure. He took the stairs to the basement, ending up in a prison area. There were eight cells, though currently, all of those cells were empty, just like the corridors that we passed. </p><p>The enemy wasn’t a crowded army, at least not in their current base. Which was always something convenient. </p><p>He used a different magical rune to unlock a magically-reinforced cell door, before placing the sack that was carrying his prisoner. When he removed the sack, I was surprised to see the identity of the prisoner. </p><p>Isolde. </p><p>Though, that surprise was nothing compared to when the one that was carrying the prisoner removed his hood. </p><p>“You won’t get away with this, Lancelot,” Isolde growled in anger.</p><p>What a surprise, I thought even as I tightened the shadows around me, hiding in the corner. Here he was, mister hero, the good guy that was supposed to save the Empire from the darkness, imprisoning one of his companions. </p><p>“You need to calm down. I’m doing this for your own good,” Lancelot said, his tone calm, almost tender. I gritted my teeth despite the fact that I wasn’t the target. I hated that tone since I was a child, after it had been used by priests, teachers, and many other authority figures. </p><p>You’re just a child, the tone said. You need to accept the word your betters, that you’re destined to be a disposable part of the world, destined for mediocracy as a laborer, or, if lucky, apprentice of a craftsman, toil endlessly on the hopes of becoming a master cobbler one day. </p><p>I had no words to explain just how much I hated that tone. </p><p>Like I actually needed more reason to dislike that smug entitled asshole, I thought with a dark smirk, tightening my grip around the hilt of my sword, only its coldness reminding me that killing that guy at this moment was a bad idea. </p><p>While Isolde growled, my mind was going through options. With Isolde imprisoned and Lancelot as a traitor, things were getting even more complicated. </p><p>I needed to decide what to do next. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Master Antonius proved that his reputation as a good leader was accurate. He stayed in the meeting room for another half an hour, casually talking to establish a good rapport before leaving. </p><p>Oh, his attitude was completely fake, of course. His hidden disgust to actually spend that much time entertaining a slave was not too hidden, but his position didn’t allow him to apply a more even-handed approach. </p><p>After he left, I stayed in a while more, just to further sell the idea that I was fascinated with the luxury they were putting in front of me. Not that I had to work hard for it. It was surprising how willing they were to believe the stupidity of a barbarian, no matter the evidence on the contrary. </p><p>When I finally left the room and returned to the courtyard, I was met with a surprise. In the form of a cart, loaded with a cage that was radiating magic, eight guards around it, waiting tensely, escorting a very familiar locked figure. </p><p>The Nemean lion. </p><p>The beast clearly didn’t appreciate the cage, but its attempts to burst out were proven useless. The thickness of the ambient magic radiating from the cage suggested it was either the work of a sorcerer, or a group of skilled mage artisans. </p><p>Either way, it was an expensive treasure. Though considering it was holding a beast that was much more precious, certainly not wasteful in its usage.</p><p>The beast smashed against the bars again and again, helplessly, trying to seek his freedom. Unlike our battle, however, I could see the hints of intelligence in its wild gaze. A great difference compared to its earlier madness. </p><p>Whatever side effect it had been suffering after the death of its tamer, forcing it into a rage, had dissipated. </p><p>Curious, I walked toward the cage. “Hey, no one is allowed to near it. It’s dangerous-” the guard started before his friend elbowed him in the ribs. </p><p>“I don’t think it’ll be a problem,” I said with a chuckle, pushing my chest out proudly, playing the smug barbarian role perfectly, including the dismissive glare sent to the guard’s way. “I have taken it down once, and I can take it down again.” </p><p>The guards seemed hesitant at the claim, but they didn’t stop me as I walked closer to the beast. </p><p>It was an impressive sight, a giant bundle of muscle and magic, danger incarnate. Unfortunately, it was helpless behind the bars. A roar made every guard tremble in pain, but not me. I just smirked and put my hand on the bars, close enough that a swipe of it could leave a significant wound despite the magically strengthened cage. </p><p>“Stop,” shouted the guard in panic, no doubt afraid the star gladiator of the school would be wounded in a way he could be blamed for, but my warning gaze prevented him from moving. </p><p>And he wasn’t the only one that was dissuaded from acting. </p><p>The lion roared in anger once more, even louder, so much that the guards pressed their hands to their ears, grunting in pain. Some collapsed on the floor.</p><p>But the beast didn’t try to attack me. </p><p>It didn’t dare to. </p><p>So interesting. It was not a reaction that could be just earned by near-death experience it suffered in my hands. The beast was too strong, and too proud for that. A possibility arose in my mind, and I stopped suppressing the transformation of my arm, just for a moment, making a small scale appear. </p><p>The beast flinched back even as it growled, its panic clear. </p><p>“So, tell me, why is this little cat is here?” I asked even as I suppressed it once more. “I thought it belonged to Bestiaries School.”</p><p>“I-it’s a reward,” the guard managed to stammer, still unsettled by the roar. “For helping to suppress their accident.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said with a smirk, then tapped the bars again. This time, the lion just growled, neither roaring, nor trying to attack. </p><p>I retreated in a smug walk, leaving a murmuring crowd behind. But this time, my smirk wasn’t just about the effect I had on the beast, or impressing the crowd that surrounded me to push my fame even higher — though that certainly didn’t hurt. </p><p>No, even as I was scaring the beast, I was flaring my magic slightly, testing against the supernatural aura radiating from the beast. </p><p>A little trick I had learned from the book I acquired from his former master.</p><p>Another little bonus I acquired, but luckily, no one was aware of that particular fact. Not the Bestiaries School, not my Dacian school. </p><p>On the way back to my room, I made sure to stop in a corner, the same one I utilized as a hiding spot, took back the small book I had swiped from the bag of my wannabe assassin. I had been escorted heavily on the way, of course, but sneaking a small book without them noticing hadn’t been a particularly difficult task. </p><p>Especially since they had no idea they had been dealing with a sorcerer. </p><p>And taking it back without any attention wasn’t any harder. </p><p>When I arrived back at my room, everything was different. All my furniture was changed, well-made but functional maple furniture replaced by much more impressive mahogany four-poster bed and other fancy furniture, functioning yet ugly linen sheets replaced by silk. </p><p>The room was better furnished than a noble’s bedroom, though with one interesting exception. There was no desk, or any kind of writing implement.</p><p>Why should a little barbarian need such tools, after all? </p><p>As much as it was nice to see my character was holding true, it meant that studying my new books, found on the bag of my unfortunate assassin, about beast timing, was turned more inconvenient. Especially the book was simple one book on a more complicated subject, skipping whole subjects by assuming them as basic, or referring to others for a more detailed explanation. </p><p>Luckily, as the dismissed bastard child of a noble family that had been banished to provinces centuries ago, it wasn’t the first time I had to learn magic from pilfered books without necessary support material, or a teacher to guide me. </p><p>Due to the crisis I had faced, my training schedule had been emptied for the next two days, allowing me to study the contents of the books with leisure — though I had established a subtle ward around the room to alert me in case of a visitor. </p><p>After some study, and deciphering the references, I was able to identify three main methods for beast taming.</p><p>Of course, these methods, or taming in general, weren’t the only way of commanding beasts. Many mages and sorcerers made familiars out of such creatures, something inherently different from taming. </p><p>Familiars had their own advantages, magical empowerment of the creature the most prominent, not to mention perfect coordination and unwavering obedience. But it came with a drawback as well. Losing a familiar was a costly loss, damaging the magic of the owner, permanently in most cases.  </p><p>Also, it was impossible to make familiar out of creatures that were stronger than the mage. Some had tried to do so by bonding strong magical beasts in their infancy, only to lose control of the bond once the beast grew too much, reversing the bond. From there, madness was the likeliest end for both the familiar and the mage, often followed by a painful death due to chaotic magic. </p><p>However, beast taming didn’t empower the beasts the same way creating familiars did, and controlling the beast was much more intensive. </p><p>The first method was best defined as mind control, wrapping the beast with layers and layers of complicated wards, seeping deep into the beast’s mind to put it into a dreamlike state, and after some training, the beast could be easily controlled by the owner. </p><p>At first glance, it looked like an excellent method. Truly a genius strategy, likes of which I had never seen anywhere else — though, considering war beasts were hardly used by Rome for military purposes, not too surprising. It relied on the resonance between many different wards to circumvent the specific resistance of the beast. </p><p>The fact that it could be applied on a Nemean lion, a famous magical beast that could easily threaten a small army due to its unique abilities, was enough proof of its abilities. </p><p>Unfortunately, its drawbacks were equally numerous, their impact no way lesser. First of all, it required a collaborative effort of several mages, working in coordination to create a tailored ward system for the beast in question. And those wards needed to be updated continuously to make sure they were working.  </p><p>And the higher levels of control weren’t always a perk. It meant that the natural instincts of the beast were suppressed by the commands of the controller, reducing its battle potential in most cases. </p><p>Another obvious weakness was the one I discovered by accident. Killing the controller ruined the array, making the beast rage in a drunken rage. </p><p>The second method was a more direct one, and unlike the complicated direct control that was only applicable as a luxury, widely used. It was essentially a punishment ward, coupled with some instincts, punishing the beast painfully the moment it violated one of the few rules. In the case of the Bestiaries, attacking its handlers, trying to escape, and most importantly, not fighting in the arena. </p><p>As a drawback, it made the beasts angrier and angrier, making them even less suitable to control compared to their natural state. However, to Bestiary school, these beasts were destined for the arena, and ultimately death, and their explosive anger was hardly a problem. </p><p>However, it was the third method that grabbed my interest. Compared to the first two, the third method was much less detailed. Not because it was a great mystic technique, but it was almost exclusively used to train weaker beasts, like horses with some supernatural ancestry, weaker beasts used for tricks, and magical dogs used as guards. However, it had the advantage of allowing better control, with much fewer drawbacks. </p><p>But one important requirement was enough to limit its application significantly. It didn’t use complicated magical schemes or unlimited pain to tame the animal. Instead, the technique relied on the natural domination the trainer established on the beast, before reinforcing it with some wards that built on that sensation. </p><p>They hadn’t used it to tame beasts like Chimera, or Nemean lion, because it was impossible for a trainer to do so. </p><p>Well, I corrected with a smirk. Impossible for any trainer that wasn’t currently going through a transformation that somehow intimidated even beast in the caliber of Nemean lion. </p><p>I had some experimentation to do.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Three hundred miles between Silver Spires and Mount Dread was quite a distance for most people. Luckily, I had long lost the right to be considered in the same category as most people. For me, it was nothing that I couldn’t handle in several minutes. </p><p>But I didn’t rush out immediately, and first visited the Hall of Crafting, to see my favorite blacksmith. </p><p>Unfortunately, not have some fun activities — as I lacked time — but ask her help to forge some new weapons. After the teleportation mishap, my arsenal was completely gone.  </p><p>That plan went astray the moment I entered the hall of crafting, and realized, she wasn’t in her room. She was in the main area, working with the other blacksmiths to forge a set of weapons. No doubt emergency orders from the school. I couldn’t imagine her working together with the guilds under any other circumstance. Though, that didn’t prevent guild members from watching her angrily, jealousy mixing with entitlement. </p><p>Understandable, as even when she worked alone while the rest worked in teams, her weapons were clearly superior. And to add insult to injury, she was considerably faster in her production as well. </p><p>Pity that meant I couldn’t just pull her away. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. I could have pulled her away, but that would mean invoking the headmistress’ authority. </p><p>I wouldn’t mind abusing that authority under better circumstances, but with the number of spies that clearly infected the school, it wouldn’t nice for Oeyne if these spies realized she had a connection to the headmistress through a mysterious agent. </p><p>Things were complicated enough in Silver Spires before stirring the pot pointlessly. </p><p>Instead, I sneaked down to use Oeyne’s forge room. With all the material accessible, it took me half an hour to forge a new sword, a dagger, half a dozen throwing knives designed to hold mana for my unique fighting style. </p><p>Also, most importantly, I crafted a large net, the kind that could capture a large magical creature without hurting it too much. </p><p>[-3419 Mana]</p><p>Not the highest quality of equipment, not in terms of the materials I had invested, and certainly not in terms of the time and energy I committed to them, but considering the time crunch I was facing, the best I could manage. </p><p>With the Eternals were already hunting for the dragon, the sooner I acted, the better. Failing my first mission from the headmistress, even a difficult one, wouldn’t go too well in my mission to gain her trust. And her trust was critical, because she was my only source of information about the truth of the System. </p><p> And if the worst happened, and my weapons proved insufficient, I could always come back to forge new weapons. The travel took much less time than the crafting required. With the decision made, I summoned another elemental ride. </p><p>[-942 Mana]</p><p>Riding the air elemental, the distance between the school and my destination melted into nothing in minutes, and soon, I was once again looking at the misty peak of Mount Dread. </p><p>That close to a possible Eternal presence, I dispelled my ride. I could have ridden it further, but it was better safe than sorry. The mount was fast, but both visually and magically, it was hardly the sneakiest method to travel. Walking, especially thanks to the constant rolling mists ready to hide my presence, was much easier.</p><p>My plan was simple. First, I would arrive at the safe house, reinforcing the wards I had set up there during my previous trip, maybe establishing a couple more wards to enhance the security, before starting a deadly game of tag with the Eternals. </p><p>I started walking. However, my plans hit a little, almost minuscule snag… </p><p>In the form of a huge, rotating ward that covered the whole mountain without a warning, locking me in the mountain. </p><p>The ward was strong, stronger than anything else I had felt in my life. The closest thing for them was the defensive wards of Silver Spires when they were raised in war mode according to the plans, but I wasn’t sure which one would win out. </p><p>“Not a great start,” I murmured even as I pulled my dagger reflexively, but somehow, I managed to keep myself from gathering my mana for an explosive spell. </p><p>The reason for it, the shape of the ward. </p><p>If I was the target, they wouldn’t have surrounded the whole mountain with the ward. </p><p>That didn’t mean there was no danger. Of course not. Like that was even possible with my luck. </p><p> No, it just meant I wasn’t under immediate danger. </p><p>“What to do?” I murmured to myself even as I forcibly suppressed my mana even below its natural condition. Not the most comfortable feeling, but it prevented my presence to be detected. </p><p>One silver lining about the strength of the ward was that I didn’t need to actively use my mana to check its nature. As it glowed stronger than the sun to my magical senses, it was easy to understand its main functions without delving into it with my mana. </p><p>And while that implied a certain sense of weakness, the reality wasn’t that kind. Huge walls of a castle were also something that could be seen from a distance, but that didn’t make it any less effective in their job. Not everything needed to be hidden to function properly. </p><p>A quick assessment was enough to reach a few important conclusions. </p><p>First, the Eternals were clearly responsible, because their magical runes had come from the same tradition as the wards I had sneaked through when I had taken down three of their members. </p><p>Unfortunately, the current ward definitely didn’t share the shoddy construction of the earlier defenses. Meaning, I was not only facing the Eternals, but also I was facing something stronger than a small, disposable team. </p><p>And considering their small, disposable team included two assassins and a mage over level thirty. I was able to take them down easily, but unfortunately, that was less about their battle potential than the excellent ambush I managed to pull while they were in their own base. </p><p>Hardly an achievement that could be copied easily. </p><p>Second, at least in the short term, for all intents and purposes, the ward was essentially unbreakable. Yes, its strength was comparable to full-powered wards of the school, and I had half a dozen ways to destroy or circumvent those wards. </p><p>Unfortunately, the current ward wasn’t as simple. </p><p>The wards of Silver Spire were like a finely crafted mechanical toy, with many tricky bits designed to allow passage, maintain the living condition of the students, and otherwise interact with its inhabitants. And that wide range of tasks was the thing that allowed me to find workarounds, allowing me to sneak through them. </p><p>Breaking a complicated toy was a simple affair. </p><p>This ward was might as well be a sheet of solid steel, designed to do one thing, and only one thing. To isolate an area. There was no trickery against a solid sheet of metal, only brute force. </p><p>Third, trying to break out was a horrible choice. Call me paranoid, but there was a small chance that the one responsible for the ward might decide to check it out if they noticed someone trying to break out of the wards. Which, considering my expectations about their powers, was hardly a good feeling. </p><p>Not only I was woefully under-equipped — how I regretted not stopping by Aviada’s patrol to borrow her sword once more — against any foe, but also I had no idea about the number and composition of the enemy. </p><p>My only reasonable guess was that they had more than three members — maybe a few, maybe several —  and I expected every member to be over level thirty, with no reasonable guess about the upper limit.</p><p>Not exactly the easiest challenge to face. Ironically, not the worst either. At least, unlike my first battle against Zokras, I wasn’t ambushed by a superior foe supported by nearly a dozen undead machines of death.  </p><p>The only positive thing was that my sixth senses weren’t tingling the same way I had felt in my last visit, so whatever mysterious being that had been watching me during my last visit had better things to do. </p><p>It wasn’t hard to think about what might be the distraction. </p><p>Seconds later, I felt another ward spreading out, its feelers spreading, forcing me to pull my mana even tighter into my veins. It was a detection ward, validating my earlier decision to dispel my mount.</p><p>The detection ward was merciless. If I delayed canceling the mount until the moment I had detected the first ward, the detection ward would have picked the mana remnants. </p><p>I wasn’t able to analyze the defensive ward, because, unlike the first ward, glowing with all the confidence of shining steel wall under the sun, it was a subtler ward. I could feel it spreading over the sky, impressive for a detection ward. </p><p>It was not impossible to analyze it, to understand its strengths and weaknesses more accurately, but to do that, I needed to stay under some wards of my own, blocking the feelers the detection ward was spreading. Ironically, the detection ward itself prevented me from erecting such a ward in its confines, while its defensive counterpart prevented me from escaping. </p><p>Luckily, I had already established a perfectly serviceable hideout, with wards designed to protect me from exactly those kinds of interference. </p><p>I started walking toward the hideout, my mind drifting toward the nature of the challenge I was facing. </p><p>The only positive thing about those wards was that they were established through some kind of artifact rather than cast directly. Technically, I didn’t have any evidence to support that conclusion, other than the power required to erect those wards. </p><p>Even in my current strength, setting up a ward to cover up the whole mountain in seconds was impossible to imagine, let alone setting up two of them in quick succession, with no rest in between. Considering the Eternals were supposed to fight against gods and win, I wasn’t ready to discount the possibility of them having someone as strong. </p><p>But sending someone as strong to such a mission was completely different. If I were to guess, based on not my own progress but the more usual progress I had seen on others, someone definitely needed to be over level hundred to instant-cast such a ward, with a stat growth to actually match their level. </p><p>Not exactly someone to send out to errands. </p><p>They likely had a unique item to cast such wards. It wasn’t the happiest conclusion either, showing the depths of their treasure vault, but certainly better than having an opponent that could snuff me with a flicker of their mana. </p><p>“Finally,” I murmured even as I finally stepped into my safe house, my own wards enough to block the feelers of the detection ward, allowing me to relax the tight hold I had on my own mana, which was always an extremely uncomfortable sensation. Like trying to hold my breath, tense and uncomfortable. Almost like an itch impossible to scratch.</p><p>However, despite the temptation to laze around for a moment, I was already setting up a ward of my own to properly analyze the opponent’s defensive preparations. Because one thing was clear. </p><p>The opponent set up a deadly trap, one that was suspiciously excessive, almost overkill, to be applied against a dragon that could be restrained by a few measly liches. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324 / 6324 Mana: 6942 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>My entrance to the headmistress’ office was less spectacular than the previous time. One difference was I wasn’t sneaking in but asked to be there, but also I didn’t come face to face with a thief in the midst of burglarizing some of her most precious documents. </p><p>Pity, as unlike the last time, I would have been free to react. And I would have loved the excuse to capture one of the princess’ secret agents for some pointed interrogation. </p><p>Instead, I sat down on the nearest chair, letting my gaze dance over the documents sprawled on the table, but otherwise not doing anything dubious. The headmistress could arrive any second, and I had no intention of ruining the trust I had earned through my spectacular victory — even said the victory was less impressive than the headmistress might think. </p><p>I didn’t explain Zokras’ latest trick to her, nor did I plan to do so in the future, because it would raise a lot of questions about the limits of my true ability. According to everything I had revealed to her about my abilities, it wasn’t something I could achieve. </p><p>Zokras’ continued survival had no immediate implication worthy of for me to abandon my convenient fake identity. </p><p>I turned my gaze on the documents that were sprawled on her desk. None of those had any huge secret. If they had, she wouldn’t have left them on her desk carelessly while allowing me to enter without supervision. It was different for the books on the shelves, protected by layers of wards. Nothing I couldn’t break, but she might arrive any moment.  </p><p>More importantly, sometimes, unimportant details told a better story. </p><p>Naturally, every single report on her desk was about the recent battle. One of the advantages of high intelligence was to process information faster, so much that processing every single detail represented in the visible pages of the reports took me only a few seconds. </p><p>And the results were hardly amazing. Every single report on her desk was misleading. </p><p>Dangerously misleading. </p><p>Nothing inaccurate at the highest level, of course. It would be easy enough to detect. Anything too high-profile, meaning anything that might be double-checked by the headmistress directly, or might be followed up by a discussion with Titania, was flawless. </p><p>Well, mostly flawless. The way the conclusions were written included some interesting word choices, subtly undercutting the importance of the events that happened in the surrounding towns, and overstating the importance of the crisis at the school. </p><p>The details were even more inaccurate. I didn’t have a full picture of the view, of course, but just comparing the numbers against the actual details I had observed directly while waiting for Titania, the disparity was clear. </p><p>The situation was even worse than I was expecting. The spies were not only adjusting the headmistress’ orders or interfering indirectly, but actually feeding her garbage information. </p><p>And neither Titania, nor the headmistress had the personality to dig through that numbers to discover the subterfuge. </p><p>Turning those reports into another subtle, yet deadly wound on Silver Spires. </p><p>However, before I could delve deeper into the implications, the door opened, and the cloaked figure entered, though, unlike other times, she didn’t bother pulling her hood, her beautiful face out in the open to contrast her black robe. </p><p>I recalled with some amusement how intimidated I had been of her when we had first come face to face. A mysterious hideous ghost that managed to control one of the most premier organizations of the world despite all the opposition. </p><p>The deeper I saw the supposed premier organization, the faster that fear and reverence dispelled — not helped by knowing the innocent beauty that lied under her scary robe. As I understood the power of the enemy, the veneer of strength Silver Spires was reduced into smokes and mirrors.</p><p>And not the kind that could actually trick the enemy, not if their latest moves were any indicator. </p><p>The headmistress walked forward with grace, her wings gathered under her robe, looking like a hunch. She didn’t give any sign of greeting or other social niceties, just sat on her chair. </p><p>However, her robe was unable to hide her exhaustion. Her tense shoulders and trembling arms were evidence enough. She had been affected by the transfer process significantly, and the fact that she wanted to have a meeting despite that was another evidence of the seriousness of the situation. </p><p>I waited silently, doing my best to look even more exhausted than her. </p><p>Her gaze danced over the room before focusing on me. “Good work against Zokras,” she finally said. “He’s not someone that will be missed.” Her voice was slow, stuttering. Like she was not used to paying compliments, though her lowered hood hardly helped. Without its intimidating shadow, her aura was lacking. </p><p>“It was nothing,” I said. “I was just lucky.” </p><p>“It was more than luck. You adapted to your power faster than I imagined,” she asked, trying to sound casual, but against me, her interrogation attempt, which was clearly supposed to be subtle, was laughable. It didn’t alarm me, because if she was serious in her fears, she would have asked the questions before going all the effort to transfer a chunk of Divine Spark. </p><p>Or maybe not, I realized a second later. Maybe she was actually trying to use the effects of the Light Node to make the interrogation easier. </p><p>“Is it faster than normal?” I questioned, trying to sound neutral. After all, I wasn’t supposed to have any kind of baseline. </p><p>“A bit,” she answered. </p><p>“Is this about the spells I used against Zokras?” I asked. “Because it was mostly about the wards I set up. I only managed that effect after hours of preparation.” It wasn’t true, of course, but she definitely lacked the sources to validate it. Even Titania couldn’t really dig down to my magical tricks.  </p><p>“Show me,” she ordered as she leaned forward, anticipation showing despite her exhaustion. </p><p>I raised my hand and started to draw several runes rapidly, creating a small ward that could use light magic in combination with life energy, for great explosive effect. I didn’t use it against Zokras, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t actually usable. I just didn’t have the time to do so. “It took hours to set the ward up, but the results were spectacular,” I answered. </p><p>She nodded after examining the ward for a long while, and from her expression, I could see that she was already convinced by my answer. </p><p>“Good work,” she said, suddenly falling silent, like she had something else to say, but failing to come up with a way to do so. The fact that she didn’t give a direct order was telling. </p><p> “What’s the problem?” I asked, giving her a chance to open up. </p><p>“There’s no problem,” she said, but that the answer came too quickly, and her eyes evaded mine. The exact reaction of a bad liar, trying to deflect. Her reliance on her magical aura and mysterious hood made it difficult for her to face someone near her power, yet not fully loyal to her. </p><p>“Sorry if I misspoke,” I said with a regretful expression. “With the undead threat gone, I’m sure there’s no emergency left.” </p><p>Her silence was beautiful. I could see her trying to find a preamble after my statement, without swallowing her words. Which was inconvenient when she was facing a threat important enough to hasten the transfer process significantly. </p><p>“I should leave you to your tasks, I’m sure you’re busy with a lot of things after a crisis,” I said, standing up like our meeting was already concluded. </p><p>“Not yet,” she said as she shook her head, but that didn’t prevent panic from infecting her tone. </p><p>She was completely unfit to lead with anyone that was not showing her extreme loyalty or she couldn’t fully dominate with a flex of her magic.</p><p>“As you wish, headmistress,” I said as I took my seat once more, not being difficult, at least, not directly. </p><p>“There are some mysterious sightings around Mount Dread,” she finally decided to say/ </p><p>“Oh, that’s quite far away,” I said. “What exactly are we talking about?” </p><p>“A dragon,” she said. </p><p>I was glad of my acting abilities because inside, I was quite surprised. Not just because I was almost sure about where that dragon came from, but also the headmistress actually asked about her. </p><p>It wasn’t too shocking, because as I learned more about the System and its roots, it wasn’t hard to connect dragons weren’t just another group of monsters, their special trait of not giving experience made a lot of sense in the process. </p><p>I was interested in the headmistress’ priorities, however, because while the dragon was an interesting target, the fact that she was focusing on that in the middle of a crisis was quite telling. </p><p>It should be too unimportant to the considerations of the headmistress. Unless there was another mystery around it. </p><p>“Is it too strong?” I asked, carefully asking a leading question. </p><p>“Maybe,” the headmistress answered, and she didn’t seem to be lying. It revealed one important piece of information. She didn’t have a connection with the dragon, at least not enough to know her strength. </p><p>Not that I had a true perception about her power level as well. I hadn’t been extremely impressed by her display of power as we escaped the undead base, but might be about the damages she had received in the hands of the necromancers conducting a ritual on her. </p><p>“Anything else I should know?” I asked. </p><p>“You need to capture the dragon alive, and if possible, without hurting it too much,” she answered. </p><p>“It should be done unless it’s too strong,” I said, which earned a soft smile from her, that made her even cuter than her beautiful features already did. “And it’s a priority mission, why?” I countered, choosing to dig into her explanation. It was clear that there was more to it than just capturing a dragon, or she would have just given an order. </p><p>Her delay was pointed. I waited for her to answer patiently. “There might be some …” she murmured before fading. </p><p>“Let me take a guess,” I said, reading her hesitation. “There’s some members of our mysterious walking around.” </p><p>“Maybe,” she answered, which didn’t surprise me even the slightest. </p><p>“And I’m guessing that it’s very important, but for a reason you can’t tell me,” I said, stealing her initiative even further. She nodded. “And you don’t have any reliable information about the number of enemies or their powers,” I followed up, stealing the initiative even further. </p><p>“I know it’s a bit difficult,” she said before taking a deep breath. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll do it,” I said with a smile even as I stood up. “Do you think they’ll be more interested in killing it, or capturing it?” I asked. </p><p>“Killing,” she answered with a nod, which unlocked another interesting set of questions for me, particularly why it was important to capture a dragon alive for the headmistress, but the organization preferred to kill it. Yet undead forces wanted to use her for a mysterious ritual. </p><p>But I kept my mouth shut. Playing the role of the obedient subordinate was much more important at the moment. </p><p>Especially with her change of attitude. </p><p>After confirming that my display of power was not suspicious, her orders were replaced by hesitant requests. I was willing to believe it was about my spectacular performance against Zokras, not only dispelling the threat but also saving her only subordinate — or at least, only one strong enough to matter.</p><p>But maybe, it had a different reason. </p><p>However, that was a problem for a different time. For now, I needed to find an old acquaintance. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324 / 6324 Mana: 7750 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sarah was having trouble hiding her shocked gaze at the way Carrie dressed, even after the last night’s amazing show. Understandable, considering that with an ill-fitting, poorly tied bathrobe, Carrie looked like she was about to start acting in a scene of a high-budget, but very erotic movie. </p><p>The way the robe loosened even further with each step hardly helped to counter that beautiful impression. </p><p>“Good morning,” she said even as she walked toward us, watching us from the half-wall opening of the open kitchen. I watched every step of her with rapt attention. Sarah was no different, fascinated by the intentional twirl she added to her every step, though with a great deal of jealousy replacing my fascination. </p><p>“Good morning-“ I started to answer when she finally entered the kitchen, but that was cut short. Before I could even finish my greeting, she put her hands on my shoulders, rose to her tiptoes, and sealed my lips in a searing kiss. </p><p>Impressed with the sudden initiative, I let her push me back successfully, until my back pressed against the wall. Carrie continued to kiss, even Sarah let out a pointed cough. Her bathrobe failed to stay closed under her sharp movement, making my towel the only thing between our bodies. </p><p>The temptation to bend her over the table and reward her for her failure was intense. Ironically, it was Sarah’s pointed coughs that made me hold myself back. Not because I was shy to do in front of her — something I had proved without a room for doubt the last night — but because I didn’t want to scare off Sarah by being too aggressive. </p><p>Because I could share that idea with Carrie, she pulled back, her bathrobe open, granting us her delicious nakedness. </p><p>“Try to keep it in your room, guys,” Sarah said, somehow managing to do so without a stammer despite her growing blush. Just because she had watched us before didn’t mean she was desynthesized to our show. “If you rub against each other for one more second, you’re going to catch fire.” </p><p>“No need to be jealous just because you don’t have someone to rub against,” Carrie said. </p><p>Under different circumstances, it might have been a hurtful statement, the kind Sarah would just pull back sadly. However, after everything that happened last night, it was much more different. “Oh, really?” Sarah said, her voice tense, like a politician declaring war. </p><p>Carrie smirked as she fixed her bathrobe, trying to act like she didn’t catch Sarah’s reaction before turning to catch my gaze. </p><p>However, there was no mistaking her gaze. It was the same one she had when she was watching us from the window while we frolicked in the pool, the less intense version of the gaze she had when I taught Sarah joys of the flesh in my bed while she peeked from the door. </p><p>Carrie was developing into a precariously naughty girl, goading her friend to a desperate attempt to pay back. The only thing that was keeping Sarah back was guilt, and Carrie’s mocking was an excellent way to destroy that. </p><p>I wondered whether her effectiveness was accidental, or I was facing the origin story of a sexy villain!</p><p>Regardless, Sarah hardly waited for Carrie to leave the kitchen before walking in front of me, and opening one of the cabinets, trying to pick a mug from the highest shelf despite having several others in more convenient locations. </p><p>“Can you help me?” she gasped, doing her best to sound erotic. It was more angry than erotic, but ironically, that made her even sexier. </p><p>“Of course, sweetie,” I said even as I grabbed her waist and lifted her up easily. She reached the mug with deliberate slowness, but she was busy trying to catch Carrie’s eyes. </p><p>She managed to catch Carrie’s eye, but didn’t find the sudden jealousy she was hoping for, greeted by amused dismissal instead. “Your friend seems to be confident about her hold over me,” I whispered as I lowered her slowly, even as the way I dragged her close to my body dislodged my towel once more. “Maybe even too confident…” </p><p>“Maybe,” Sarah gasped, unable to do anything but gasp beautifully as she felt my naked shaft pressing against her skirt. </p><p>I faced the same temptation I felt when Carrie was facing me, to push her against the kitchen counter and take her mercilessly. Pity that it would ruin the fun atmosphere that took all night to establish. </p><p>Instead, I took a step back, and leaned down to pick up my towel. Just as I grabbed it, a foot landed, preventing me from taking it down. “The room is warm enough,” Sarah whispered, with a heat that surprised me. Maybe it was the anger she felt from the dismissal, maybe it was the rush she had from looking down on my bent body, but her voice carried the confidence she had when our little game had started. </p><p>“Oh,” I answered back. I didn’t bother trying to act surprised. Instead, I put my hand on her inner thigh, climbing up slowly yet steadily. I waited until her gaze trembled before asking my question. “And you’re not worried about your friend seeing me naked.” </p><p>Sarah throw a worried glance at Carrie, who was doing a good job of looking like she was focused on the TV — though her sprawled pose once again displayed her assets to a spectacular effect. That worked wonders to renew her decisiveness through burning jealousy. </p><p>Then her gaze fell on the kitchen counter, sizing its height, which, luckily, was tall enough to cover my state of nakedness as long as Carrie was sitting. Her gaze fell on me once more, her courage renewed. “Yeah, it’s alright,” she said, trying to sound nonchalant. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said with a smirk before standing up, but I kept my hand on her leg, letting my fingers rise up, revealing more and more of her toned thighs. She shivered as I was about to caress her panties. </p><p>I picked that exact moment to pull back, leaving her to gasp in shock while I returned back to flip my delicious omelet. Luckily, due to its thickness, I had to cook it slowly, giving me just enough time to tease Sarah in close quarters. </p><p>When I finished flipping it, Sarah’s gaze was already on my midsection, watching my erection with great interest. </p><p>I chuckled even as I pointed at the fridge. “Do you mind getting some juice?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she said, doing her best to watch me as she moved. Meanwhile, Carrie raised her head and looked at us, and after making sure Sarah was looking at the opposite end, opened her robe even more, turning her cleavage into a delicious naked show, followed by a saucy wink, and a gesture for me to move faster. </p><p>It was incredible that she was still feeling horny after last night, not that I had any problem with it. While Sarah leaned down to grab the bottle from the fridge, I closed the distance in a few quick steps, standing behind her. “Let me help,” I whispered. </p><p>“No need-“ she started, only to freeze halfway as she felt the same shaft she had been watching earlier slip under her skirt, rubbing against her core, her panties the only barrier between our skin. </p><p>And a weak one at that. </p><p>“I can help,” I answered even as I pushed my hips forward, sliding my shaft between her legs in a manner that would awaken all sorts of memories. She froze, no doubt caught flat-footed at my sudden daring while Carrie was still in the other room. </p><p>Which, considering the last night, shouldn’t be too surprising. </p><p>“I insist,” I added in a throaty tone just to make sure the impression stuck properly. She trembled, under the assault of shock and desire in equal amounts, no doubt recalling the memories of the night before, when she learned the true meaning of the pleasure. </p><p>She held on the side of the fridge to balance herself rather than trying to grab anything from the fridge. She didn’t move even as I pushed my hips back and forth a few times — well, only after discounting her shivers. </p><p>Then, a moan exploded off her lips, catching all of us in surprise. </p><p>Sarah pushed me back in panic as she stood up, desperately looking toward Carrie. Carrie, who had been trying to catch a glimpse of the show without being too apparent, was caught flatfooted at Sarah’s sudden move. </p><p>Carrie froze, convinced that she had been caught. </p><p>Luckily, Sarah’s mortification and fear at the sudden moan was enough for her to miss Carrie’s guilty expression. “I hit my toe to the coffee table,” she muttered in panic. </p><p>“Fridge,” I whispered, unable to prevent a snicker from escaping my mouth. After all, the kitchen was conspicuously absent of coffee tables. </p><p>“Sorry, fridge,” Sarah muttered as she looked down, making a great show of stumbling toward the counter, looking down like she was trying to check her feet, which gave Carrie just enough time to return to her seat. </p><p>Sarah leaned against the counter, not realizing that Carrie had been seen my nakedness when she was standing up.  </p><p>“Oh, you seem to be needing help,” I whispered even as I once again walked behind her, and I closed in the distance, my shaft pressing against her ass once more. </p><p>However, this time, my hands slipped under her skirt as well, pulling down her sexy panties before she could even realize it. She looked down once more, but despite her superior vantage point and the angle, the dominance she showed earlier before was nowhere to be seen. </p><p>Replaced by arousal and anticipation. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I enjoyed the nature of the whispers, anger mixed with admiration as I walked away from the eighth and last opponent of the day, qualifying me for the quarterfinals, which was exactly what I needed to maintain my scholarship without an issue.</p><p>The games themselves were quite interesting as well, each victory enhancing my reputation as an assassin. My third opponent was simply crushed under my merciless assault, especially in the third game, where it turned into a complete clusterfuck after I sacrificed two bishops seemingly pointlessly, giving him hope before moving for the kill. </p><p>When I had left the table, he had been whispering that I was a demon, actually in tears. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, I was just asshole enough to enjoy it. He was a grown man, and he needed to handle it better. </p><p>After my fifth game, however, my opponents started to take their defeats rather more acceptingly, my reputation starting to do my job for me after a string of devastating victories. That didn’t make me sad, however, as the number of people examining my games increased, leaving them to burst into a whispering conversation about the complicated structure of the games. </p><p>Which meant even more Intent for me, my guide confirmed. So, I made a point of pushing for ever-increasingly complex patterns, doing my best to turn every game into a show. </p><p>Some people even claimed that I had been cheating, or I was clearly one of the football players only here to play a prank. </p><p>Normally, I would have ignored that, but instead, I simply closed my eyes and called a white move, making it impossible for me to cheat. </p><p>The frustrated huff he let out as he retreated after a humiliating game I extended just for fun, taking every single piece he had was beautiful. And it increased the number of people calling me an assassin, which I always liked. When I left the tournament, my reputation was better than ever. </p><p>Or worse than ever, depending on the perspective. </p><p>However, that wasn’t the only reason for my good mood. </p><p>[Pattern Recognition II, acquired]</p><p>[Tactics I, acquired]</p><p>Receiving two new Traits during the tournament was even more beneficial than I had been expecting. Improved pattern recognition helped me to process complicated situations with surprising smoothness, and the addition of the tactics allowed me to plan even more deadly attacks, allowing me to plan one step deeper than my usual ability.  </p><p>A deadly combination, so much that I didn’t even have a chance to try the Intimidation, though, considering the efficiency of the others, I was quite excited about its potential. </p><p>I left the tournament area, with an upbeat rhythm in my steps. </p><p>The conference center was quite distant from my dorm, but since I didn’t use my car — my old, shitty car that required three small miracles to work every day — I had no option but to walk back. Still, it was nice weather — if a bit chilly — allowing me to have a talk with my sexy guide leisurely. </p><p>“So, can these Heroic Traits also improve my physical abilities?” I asked her.</p><p>“Not with the slivers of Intent you received,” she answered, her tone dismissive, like I had just bragged a billionaire about my hundred dollar bank account. “Little, ephemeral aspects are easier than directly improving the body, or giving comprehensive mental improvements.” </p><p>“How much more Intent is needed?” I asked. “It’s not like there’s a lot of people watching the games as well.” Which was true. The college spent a lot of money to make it a reputable tournament, and many other participants also brought some friends who enjoyed the game to watch, but ultimately, there were barely more than a hundred people watching the tournament, and split among many games.</p><p>“It’s not just the number, but the intensity of their Intent,” she answered. “The people that watched you during the tournament contributed quite a bit despite their limited numbers. They care about the game.” </p><p>Of course they did. They had traveled for hours to watch a tournament. </p><p>“When are we going to start working on finding proper worshippers?” she asked. “We shouldn’t delay it too much. Tonight? Tomorrow morning?” </p><p>Honestly, a part of me was tempted to actually follow her idea, no matter how crazy it sounded. The benefits I was receiving clearly proved that it wouldn’t be a fruitless affair. However, my negative reaction didn’t only come from my distaste of trying to sell myself as a crazy evangelical TV personality or a hooky cult leader — though that part certainly didn’t help. </p><p>No, I was hesitant because of the gaping holes of information she seemed to possess, especially in terms of her sketchy historical memory. Because she seemed not to remember anything closer than 1200 B.C. which was dangerously close to the mysterious period the historian dubbed as the bronze age collapse. </p><p>A period that not only the ancient Greek civilization, but all civilizations — except Egypt, who survived in a diminished state — of the old world had collapsed in a three-century period. And I still remembered her referring that I was supposed to defend against some kind of darkness. </p><p>Since then the world was still standing, the threat had likely passed, but I wasn’t the kind of person that poked around, risking awakening some kind of mysterious ancient threat — not unless I was forced. </p><p>“But wouldn’t it better if I improved myself properly before started gathering worshippers. You know, to make sure I could make an impression.” </p><p>“No, it would take too long,” she said with a sharpness that belied her usual silly speaking patterns. The sharpness was gone as quick as it arrived, but the sensation of fear thumping my heart didn’t disappear as quickly. </p><p>Fuck, I thought. Maybe I misunderstood the function of the guide. She wasn’t there to help me understand the system, but to make sure I was not lazing around. </p><p>And with her memory loss and mood swings, I had no idea how she would react once she decided I was slacking. </p><p>But before I could answer, a loud car, covered with the caricature of a puma, the symbol of our school’s football team. Sunset Pirates. </p><p>“That’s it,” I thought even as I remembered one mass mail I received a couple days ago, targeting all sports-scholarship students, promising another ten percent scholarship in exchange for joining the practice team, to help the actual team train. </p><p>I doubted that I was the intended target for the email. </p><p>Whether chess was a proper sport or not was an ongoing debate, but no matter what side people fell on, they would agree that the chess team wasn’t the best source for the people tackle down football players. Get tackled by them, sure, but not tackle back.  </p><p>At least, they weren’t supposed to, unless they actually tried to take the scholarship route for football before setting on chess. </p><p>I wasn’t in perfect form, but I tried to maintain my fitness as much as possible — more out of habit than anything — which should be enough for the practice team, giving me the excuse to delay my guide. </p><p>The possibility of a hundred thousand people cheering aggressively, committed enough to start fistfights and spend hundreds of dollars, should be enough to distract her for a while. I had no hope of actually making it into the team, of course, my guide wouldn’t know that unless I told her. </p><p> All I needed was to convince her. </p><p>“What if I had a better option than chess?” I asked before giving her a quick breakdown of the football, including how many people watched it every week. But even as I explained, I had already quickened my steps. I had to first go back to my dorm, to pick my exercise clothes. </p><p>Also my car. The stadium was too far to walk. </p><p>“It sounds … logical,” she said. I let out a relaxed gasp. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured. Admittedly, however, I wasn’t really enthusiastic. </p><p>While I earned some time to better understand the situation, it was only in exchange for suffering endless hours of practice. </p><p>Watching other people live my childhood dream while I tried to deal with a bunch of obnoxious jocks and rich buddies who would no doubt fill the practice team to mooch of the popularity of the team definitely didn’t sound like a good time. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I stayed silent as I walked toward the bathroom, ignoring the satisfied expression of the angel that was floating next to me. I maintained my silence as I slipped into the bathroom, and checked every stall to make sure it was empty before catching her eye. </p><p>“Come, we need to talk about what just happened,” I said, unable to hide the anger infecting my tone, even at the risk of annoying the supernatural creature that was following me.</p><p>“I - can’t,” she stammered with a sudden panic. </p><p>“Why?” I growled in anger, unable to contain my tone even under the risk of angering an extremely powerful supernatural being, preparing myself to receive another deflection. </p><p>“It’s -“ she stammered. “It’s men’s washroom.”</p><p>“Really,” I murmured, barely stopping myself from cursing. “It’s empty.” </p><p>“N-no,” she stammered, scandalized. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured. Apparently, my angel guide was also shy. Rather than insisting, I left the room and walked away toward a corner instead, hoping that we wouldn’t be interrupted. “What was the notification that I had just received?” </p><p>“Notification?” she asked. </p><p>“A writing in front of my eyes, saying pattern recognition and intimidation,” I said. </p><p>“It appears in writing?” she said, surprised. “That’s convenient.” </p><p>“Do you mind explaining to me what was that?” I said, hoping that I would get an answer this time. </p><p>“I have triggered the System to give you some Heroic Traits,” she explained simply. “It didn’t have much Intent available, but I had nothing to do around, so I decided to test the system, to make sure it works properly.” </p><p>Of course she did. But no matter how tempting was to curse her aggressively, I forced myself to keep my lips tight. Don’t anger the extremely old, extremely powerful magical being, I repeated to myself. </p><p>Even if she was acting sillier than a drunk sorority girl trying to complete her pledge. </p><p>“I thought I needed people’s worship for me to receive power.” </p><p>“That’s only for Divine Traits,” she said dismissively. “Heroics Traits doesn’t require worship, being the focus of the mortals' anger or admiration is enough. How else do you think little boys like Cadmus and Jason received their powers?” </p><p>“Obviously,” I answered with a sigh, trying to ignore the fact that not only she had referred to two mythical Greek heroes like they were little children — though, after casually referring to gods, not too surprising — but the heroes she referred to were from the oldest tales. </p><p>“What about Achilles and Odysseus,” I asked with a sudden impulse. </p><p>“Who?” she said in confusion, but this time, it didn’t seem like the blank expression that appeared on her face when I asked about her name. No, it was a simpler lack of recognition. “Ajax? Menelous? Diomedes?” I asked, only to receive the same blank response. “How about Hippomedon of Mount Portinus?” </p><p>“Little boy of Talaus, I remember him,” she said with enthusiasm. “Though I don’t remember his actions, I’m sure he had become a strong hero.” </p><p>“He did,” I said. Her answers revealed some, but brought much more. Every single hero she had recognized had lived quite a bit before the famous siege of Troy, and she had not recognized even a single one of the heroes that were reportedly participated in the siege of Troy. </p><p>Interestingly, that gave me an interesting cutoff date. Somewhere between thirteen-hundred and twelve-hundred B.C. It wasn’t the most beneficial information, but considering her sudden silence whenever I asked about her history, every scrap of information was useful. </p><p>Strangely, she didn’t ask any more questions about them, not at all, which contrasted greatly with her usual chipper attitude. </p><p>“We should go back to the tournament,” I said. Asking more questions was clearly useless. Even without considering the weird mental blocks she displayed, she was already too flighty to understand what was important, and I lacked the time to properly explain that to her. </p><p>Luckily, even without asking her, one thing was clear. With her personality, if she had a choice about what skill to give me, she wouldn’t have given me intimidation. Yet it was my favored weapon against my opponents. And pattern recognition clearly had a direct link to chess. </p><p>Even the way I perceived was clearly outside her own understanding and related to my own subconsciousness, limiting her role to somehow triggering the System if my assumptions were correct. </p><p>So, the selection either came from my subconsciousness, or somehow linked to the nature of this so-called Intent based on what people that watched me was feeling.</p><p>All that remained was to see what kind of impact those so-called Heroic Traits had on my abilities. Not that I expected much. They came with numbers denoting their power, and I was currently at the first stage. Not the greatest advertisement. </p><p>So, to get a better understanding, when I walked back. Unlike my first entrance, I wasn’t tense. </p><p>I wanted to test the Pattern Recognition before the Intimidation. </p><p>The people looked at me with a mixture of anger and fear, but that was hardly different from the way they looked at me before, confirming that intimidation wasn’t some kind of passive magic aura. </p><p>Or, it was weak enough not to make a difference, but I hoped it wasn’t the case. </p><p>I hoped the first was the case, but I feared it was the second. It would be just my luck. </p><p>When I arrived at my next game, the opponent was already waiting for me. A familiar face, even. I remembered defeating him in the previous tournament. He was a decent player, around my skill level if no tricks were pulled. </p><p>Unfortunately, he had proved particularly vulnerable against said tricks, his mental power collapsing after his second loss, marking him as the loser. </p><p>“I won’t fall to your tricks again,” he growled, which earned a warning glare from a nearby referee, but didn’t escalate to an official warning since the game was yet to start. </p><p>“We’ll see,” I said with a smirk. Under normal circumstances, I would have started to worry, because he was the kind of encounter I hated the most. A skilled opponent that was prepared for my trick, turning into a slogging match where even a victory hurt, because it dispelled the threatening aura I had worked hard to cultivate. </p><p>Luckily, it made him the perfect opponent to test my new ability.  </p><p>Now, I needed to see how much this Pattern Recognition helped. </p><p>While a bit simplification, chess games — especially formats like Blitz with extremely limited thinking time — could be categorized into two types. One was where both players stuck to more established openings, sometimes moving twenty even thirty steps into the game without deviating from the traditional playbook. </p><p>People preferred to play those kinds of games, especially in the early stages of the tournament, because they were mentally less exhausting — significantly — while still determining the better player with decent accuracy. Though, it favored experience and studying rather than ability and raw talent. </p><p>The second way of playing was deviating from the standard openings through a surprising move early on. It turned the comfortable slugging into a slogging match, like boxers fighting without their gloves. It was not a preferred way to play, because even for the winner, it came with great mental exhaustion. </p><p>And mental exhaustion quickly built up after playing almost fifty games during a tournament, even more if the games went to longer tiebreakers. </p><p>It was why I earned a frustrated glare from my opponent after reacting to his kingside pawn opener with attacking with the right-side pawns, throwing the game into chaos in exchange for losing a slight advantage. </p><p>He bit his lips and stuck to the center, playing defensive, but in a more balanced manner than my previous opponent, not making the mistake of abandoning the initiative. </p><p>I responded by attacking with my rook, making the game even more complicated. It was the worst nightmare of a Blitz player, a board that would have been considered even as a classical game, where players routinely expanded more than ten minutes just to consider one move. </p><p>I had to admire my opponent. During the previous tournament, he would have started panicking in the same position. This time, he stuck to his guns, smoothly establishing an interlinked defense cutting most of my attack routes. </p><p>So, I just twisted my attack formation at the cost of a knight, wasting a piece to make the problem even more incomprehensible. </p><p>His defense adapted, but not without wasting a nice chunk of his time. Meanwhile, I was examining the board with an almost hypnotized fascination, enjoying the flowing offensive and defensive lines, much clearer than before. </p><p>The Heroic Trait I had received was even more useful than I had hoped for. It wasn’t certainly something that would be termed magical, at least not the kind that would suddenly make me invincible. A grandmaster, or even a high-ranked master, would still cut me into the pieces. </p><p>But it wasn’t negligible either. If I was trying to win the current game half an hour ago, I would have likely lost it, though earning the bonus of an exhausted and annoyed opponent in exchange. </p><p>This time, as I pushed my queen forward, my opponent just toppled his own king to indicate surrender before standing up. “We’ll start the next game after a break,” he said, using one of his timeouts immediately. </p><p>Smart, I thought. Too bad that, unlike what he expected, it wasn’t luck that allowed me to catch an obscure opening in his formation, but the improvements from the skill. </p><p>Though, after fifteen minutes, and two games later, his shocked gaze certainly didn’t share the same nature. He looked crushed. “You can’t be this good,” he said, shocked. “We have just played two months ago, and all you had was tricks.” </p><p>“Well,” I said with a shrug. “Do me a favor and keep it a secret, but last time, you fell for my tricks. This time, you were a worthy opponent, so I used my true skills,” I said, consoling my opponent, which was normally not something I preferred to do. I preferred to crush my opponents, removing a future challenge.</p><p>But realizing my sudden magical guest brought some benefits along with the headache, I was in a good mood. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After a moment of consideration, I decided that more information was the thing I needed the most. And what better way to do so than watching an impromptu meeting between Emma and her new mysterious allies. </p><p>If it had been the day before, I would have hesitated to follow them because of the risks the situation implied. Between three options me, the Queen, and her biggest rival Fernhand presented, she chose to support an outside party. </p><p>That alone put her new allies in a dangerous category. </p><p>And I didn’t allow relatively easy conquests of Sapphire and Fernhand to drop my guard. The only reason for the relative simplicity could be traced to one important mistake of Sapphire, putting me the deepest part of the palace defenses with the ancient magic-restricting chains with the assumption that they were completely unbreakable. </p><p>My convenient access to the secret tunnels constructed for the royalty in case of an emergency hardly worked for their benefit either. </p><p>Unfortunately, unless Emma’s helper was a part of the palace — which wasn’t likely considering they were using Emma to access the library — I had to actually break through their defenses. And their defenses were guaranteed to be strong if they dared to pit themselves against the Queen. </p><p>Without the insurance my new shield represented against any sudden magical disaster, or the various advantages of the tether-blade combination in penetrating through wards, I might have chosen to actually drag Emma back to break her relationship with her new faction rather than taking the risk of following them to an unknown destination. </p><p>Well, I thought with a shake of my head later, unable to prevent a self-deprecating smirk from popping on even as I wrapped myself into the shadows of my blade, erasing my presence. I probably would have pushed forward regardless. </p><p>I had a marked difficulty resisting the call of the mystery, especially when a delicious example of womanhood like Emma was involved. </p><p>Or, make that two examples of exquisite womanhood, I corrected myself even as a brown-haired woman burst inside, her gaze landing on Emma. “What are you doing, dawdling around, we have to go,” she ordered, with a tone that managed to unsettle me. </p><p>Her tone was disrespectful, but for the moment, I was more interested in the way her body was filling the maid's uniform. Oh, there was no doubt that it was a disguise, a poor one at that. It wasn’t about her beauty. This was the palace, and all maids were beautiful — though it was easy to argue none had her perfectly pouty lips and flawless nose. Nor it was her curves, just bulging enough to strain the maid costume without turning it into an obscene show. </p><p>No, it was her posture. Just by standing in front of Emma, she exuded command, the kind that developed through a life where every single order had been fulfilled. And the way she sent a dismissive glare toward the books, like they were nothing more than garbage, highlighted her pedigree even more. </p><p>It wasn’t the dismissive gaze of a warrior, like Isolde might carry, unaware of the value those books represented. No, it was the kind of gaze that successful merchant toward a few copper pieces. </p><p>Utterly inconsequential. </p><p>Ironically, that gaze allowed me to understand that I had been facing a true mystery. Because, while the royal library, admittedly, was not the greatest library of the Empire, no one should be able to give such a dismissive glare to it. </p><p>The likeliest case, she was from the Magician’s Guild. But even that was a stretch. </p><p>With a frown, I did my best to gather a sliver of my magic without being noticed — ironically, something I had developed to an incredible degree when I tried to get out of the magically-restricted chains. With that, I reached a point where I could extend a small magical detection field a long-range. </p><p>And when I reached the surface of the skin, it met with a flowing field of disguise spell rather than reaching the flesh. </p><p>Before I could feel a deeper sensation, however, I felt the magical field tense up, like it was about to react, so I let the little scrap go. </p><p>It was a spectacular piece of magic, better than I could achieve, certainly. I had no idea how much of her looks was magically-altered, and how much was real. Ironically, despite the great magical expense, it was a horrible disguise. </p><p>Who decides to hide as a maid, then makes themselves attention-grabbing enough to make any observer suspicious?</p><p>However, I wasn’t able to focus on that particular detail, not when her gaze danced around the room in a reflexive manner. I felt the magic in the room following her gaze, scouring the room like a wave. </p><p>Interestingly, the detection method was as inept as her disguise. The way the magic moved in perfect unison was an amazing show, the kind an ordinary mage would work for all his life only to fall short, yet it was simple to trick. Just two wards, one to distort the flow away from me, and the second to correct it after the passage. </p><p>Even with the shield, I was reconsidering the merits of following them. But the situation was simply too important to act hesitant. </p><p>Sometimes, all chips needed to be pushed forward for one desperate hand.  </p><p>“What are you waiting for, let’s go,” she lashed at Emma, who had been panicking at the spell. Her guilt and shock were so easy to read, mixing into her shocked euphoria, but interestingly, her mysterious ally missed that detail as well. </p><p>“O-okay,” Emma stammered as she stood up, her shocked gaze no less than mine. </p><p>I let them move away for a bit before strengthening the shadows concealing my body. Only then I started following them, wrapped in a thick silence as I applied every little trick I had learned during my youth as a thief. They used a different secret tunnel out of the palace — which was honestly passing the point of being a security threat and straying into the joke area — and I followed. </p><p>The moment they entered, Emma’s mysterious ally waved his hand, and a gray cloak, complete with a hood deep enough to hide all her features, came flying, wrapping around her snugly, the magic flaring around her more noticeably to prevent any magical penetration method. </p><p>Like her earlier disguise, it was the perfect magical solution to conceal her from detection, while simultaneously triggering every single possible logic filter, for even a random passerby. </p><p>Such a contradiction, I thought even as I followed, paying special attention to staying silent. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one silent, but unlike mine, which was operational, theirs was defined by discomfort. It was clear that Emma was hesitant to even talk, thoroughly intimidated, to a level she didn’t even feel against me. </p><p>Of course, a part of it was about me actively trying to make her relax — in a manner of speaking — but that didn’t change the intensity of her feelings. And moreover, it wasn’t a tenseness she might feel against the Queen, or Fernhand. She was afraid of the immediate threat of violence. </p><p>And, despite her political incompetence, she was truly an exceptional magical threat. The fact that she was feeling like that against another magician told me a lot. She was tense, stretching even tighter every step forward. </p><p>She tried to keep it off her face, but I was far too familiar with her body to miss the way her shoulders set her, the stiffness of her back. </p><p>And just to make it even more conflicting, she only started to feel like that once her ward had been tripped. Emma was clearly not expecting her to be in the palace — another thing I probably needed to check once I finished her. </p><p>Emma let out a harsh breath as they stood in front of a building, a fancy residence that was indistinguishable from all other fancy mansions on the streets, if I discounted the desperate cries of my sixth sense, telling me to turn back and leave this particular stone unturned for my continuing health. </p><p>I usually listened to that feeling. </p><p>However, as I watched Emma enter the building, following her ally — for a given value, considering her tenseness — I was more conflicted. </p><p>I wished that I was projecting due to the sudden threat I had discovered earlier in the palace, but I was starting to feel that, maybe, just maybe, I had discovered the source of the magical wards around the palace. She certainly fit the extremely powerful, yet arrogant wardmaker that would add mind-bending wards to the throne room of the Empire. </p><p>Of course, there was a chance that there was a completely unrelated to the magical genius with unknown skills that applied those wards, but what were the chances of having two mysterious magical organizations skulking around. </p><p>It was simply logical, I decided, but stretched my magic toward the building, to check its protections and compare against the other wards. I expected one of two possibilities, either the same mysterious ward structure, or a more mundane ward to reinforce their undercover identity. </p><p>Then, I touched the wards, only to stop checking and take a step toward the nearest wall… </p><p>And hit my head softly, again and again… </p><p>“When,” I whispered to myself. “When I’m going to learn not to tempt fate with that kind of statement.” </p><p>It was a completely different ward structure, the kind I had never seen before, even more incomprehensible than the wards of the throne room. The palace wards, compared to the mainstream magical tradition, was a different language. </p><p>The wards around the building in front of me didn’t even use the same alphabet. It was completely alien. </p><p>And just like that, another huge variable was thrown into a situation that was getting increasingly complicated… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Half an hour after the failed ambush of the famous Bestiaries Gladiator school, I was escorted into a room by four guards, waiting for the arrival of the master of the school in isolation. </p><p>I wasn’t literally locked, of course. No, that would have been tasteless after such a spectacular victory. Instead, I was gently led into one of the best-furnished rooms in the complex, the table piled with some of the most expensive food I ever had the opportunity to consume — falling significantly short against the dishes I enjoyed last night, but being lesser when compared to a patrician house was to be expected — accompanied by a large pitcher of chilled wine. </p><p>Still, even with all the luxury, it didn’t change the fact that I was temporarily imprisoned. A comfortable prison, but still a prison for the moment. If I tried to leave the room, I would be gently discouraged, and if I tried to insist… Well, it was a door best left locked as well, at least for the moment. </p><p>Interestingly, I wasn’t sure limiting my mobility was the only reason, or even the main one. The room I was currently being, well, let’s say rested, was in the dead center of the school complex. Hard to escape, of course, but there were other, less expensive ways of achieving that. </p><p>For defensibility, it was the perfect solution. </p><p>I couldn’t help but think that, if weighed on a metaphorical scale, the second reason would have prevailed with a wide margin. Otherwise, the patrolling guards — far too many for this time of day — wouldn’t have been observing the walls with rapt attention. </p><p>I leaned back in my plush chair, my eyes closed, not willing to waste even a second of resting opportunity after the day — and the night — I had. </p><p>I deserved my rest, in every shape and form. </p><p>When I opened my eyes again, the sun was much higher in the sky, indicating almost hours had passed, giving me the time I needed to rest. It was the sounds of several sets of footsteps that pulled me out of my rest. </p><p>So, when the door opened, and Master Antonius, the owner of the school, and technically, my owner, walked inside. He was dressed to impress, though not the usual noble way. The cut reminded me of a gladiator, but no gladiator would wear silk-linen blend dyed in a particularly expensive coloring, the kind that would cost a decade of a normal legionaries’ salary just for a small bottle. </p><p>Whatever meeting he had been just coming from, it was clearly important, with an audience higher than his peers. </p><p>“Lanista,” I said, standing up and nodding, showing respect, but I was deliberate in my show. It wasn’t disrespectful, but only technically so, skirting the limit of scandalous. If someone else was in the room, it was enough to start some pretty dangerous gossip. </p><p>But Antonius just nodded before taking a seat, gesturing me to sit as well. However, he was unable to prevent his eyebrows from rising, indicating shock. </p><p>His surprise was understandable, as while my earlier disrespect could be seen as naked arrogance after my victory, it was actually careful signaling. The Dacian school was clearly going through a dangerous challenge, even bigger than I had first assumed. If I had known in the beginning, I would have just stayed away rather than taken the risk, but since I was already in the middle of my dangerous heist, I had no option but to continue. </p><p>My calculated show of limited respect was me saying that I was aware of the current value I had represented to the school, especially after ‘helping’ the poor Bestiary School for containing their precious animal after its rider died in an unfortunate accident, before the beast turned into a disaster for Rome, killing many of its citizens. </p><p>I didn’t need any information to know that was how they had framed the event, to prevent it from splashing back to the other Gladiatorial schools. </p><p>“You’re filled with surprises for a barbarian,” he said after a moment of silence as he watched me sipping wine, like we were two friends hanging around. His expression was calm, but his gaze was cold, telling me that he would remember my impunity. </p><p>I shrugged. “It’s interesting how you Romans think that everyone living outside your ‘glorious’ city is a bunch of savages that can’t string two words together,” I said, letting the fake accent I had been using all the while I was being trained disappear. Not completely, of course, as I still needed to sell a character.  </p><p>“I see,” he said, his face tense as he realized he had been being played by one of his slaves. Certainly not a nice realization for a prideful person, even a logical one like Antonius. </p><p>I had no doubt that I would have received several lashes for such disrespect at a minimum, maybe even sold to a salt mine for a — short — life of hard labor as punishment, if I hadn’t just made myself the most valuable face of the school. </p><p>He needed my cooperation desperately, and revealing he had a real opponent rather than an ignorant barbarian was the only way to conduct those activities effectively. </p><p>“How did you end up in here, if you’re much smarter than even a Roman?” he said with an insulting tone, but his eyes stayed cold. “And why don’t just escape?”</p><p>I chuckled at his attempt at angering me. Though I accepted his compliment at my intelligence smoothly, selling my arrogance as well, giving him the hope that he could manipulate me easily. “What else, jealousy and betrayal, of course. Do you think those two flaws just belong to glorious Roman citizens?” I smirked. “And about why I didn’t escape…” I said, letting my words fade as I pulled my chest, showing the stamp that was supposed to be cursed, then gestured to the table. “I definitely prefer eating good food and fucking the wives of Senators to being hunted like a dog.” </p><p>Another little trick, revealing my hedonistic desires. Giving him another easy tool to bargain. </p><p>“I see,” Antonius said. “And what would you say if I tell you there are several noble families already interested to buy you as a guard?” His smug smirk showed that he already had the perfect way to assault. </p><p>“Let me guess, by a pure coincidence, those houses are all ruled by rich widows, but by varying age.” </p><p>“Exactly,” he said with a smirk. “Interesting that some of those widows, despite having some pretty hefty estates, are in their early twenties, and famed for their beauty, and others pushing for their second century.” </p><p>I made a show of shivering in horror. “And I’m guessing the old ones are offering much more money.” </p><p>“Exactly,” Antonius said, his smirk widening like he had caught my weakest point. I let him think that. </p><p>I said nothing for a moment, grabbing a knife to cut a large piece of meat from the lamb leg, still warm thanks to the runes around the tray, keeping the food at the perfect temperature. I chewed calmly, making a show of stealing time. </p><p>Antonius just sipped his wine, confident that he had already caught my weakness. Despite my earlier display, his prejudices were still intact. He had just elevated me from a barbarian to a smart barbarian, fascinated by the great decadence of Roman society. </p><p>Admittedly, he wasn’t wrong. The luxury of Rome was nothing like I had ever tasted before, so much that, without the deadly threat of the transformation threatening my whole being, I might actually have considered sinking into the mediocrity of shadow-managing one of the smaller noble houses. </p><p>But no, with the constant battle against my mysterious affliction, it was hardly an option. </p><p>“And if I were to take a wild guess, there’s a small chance you might have a small problem, that if solved, might make the difference between two offers trivial.” </p><p>“What a coincidence,” Antonius said, his smile getting wider. “That’s exactly the case. I’m facing a small problem.”</p><p>“In the arena?” </p><p>“Partially,” Antonius answered. “Though there are some other little things a young successful warrior seeking a challenge might be interested in.” </p><p>To his credit, even as I made a show of thinking, he didn’t burst into threats. He was smart enough to know not all threats needed to be spoken, especially gauche ones like torture and dismemberment. </p><p>Working with a professional was always a pleasure. Even better when the professional was convinced that he was holding all the cards that matter. </p><p>“A challenge?” I asked, dipping my head to the side. </p><p>“Something to be spoken later,” he said. “Let’s enjoy the food for now.” </p><p>And just like that, the tense meeting turned into a calm feast, at least on the surface. It was still subtle posturing, especially for me, doing my best to show the correct eating ethics of the Roman elite, but mixing enough mistakes in terms of nuance that I was an observant barbarian, but not as observant as I was thinking. </p><p>It was a difficult rope to walk, but his expression didn’t give any indication of noticing anything unfitting. </p><p>Though, I wasn’t the only one posing. At this point, Antonius didn’t need to spend an hour feasting with me, not when he was trying to manage a big crisis. He was clearly trying to signal that whatever emergency crisis he had been dealing with was resolved, which made it even more obvious that it wasn’t the case. </p><p>The crisis he had been facing was still burning bright, enough to force him to bargain with one of his slaves. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As one of the loyal servants of the headmistress — a miracle I didn’t burst into laughter as I thought that particular nugget — I stood in front of her door obediently, not making any sound, waiting for the exact time of the meeting to arrive. </p><p>Like the previous meeting, the door opened on its own in the prearranged meeting time, accurate to the second, revealing the dark stairs adorned with silver runes, inviting me to climb. </p><p>The more I learned about her, the more I realized just how inflexible she was. Or maybe sheltered was the better option. Trying to devour the Divine Spark without the interference of the system, evidence showed that she was essentially in self-exile, her attempts to hide her nature limiting the number of people she could honestly communicate.</p><p>Even if she had supporters other than Titania, they were clearly not around. </p><p>She was strong, there was no doubt about that. I still remembered the scary flow of her mana, enough to make her a dangerous threat even without the addition of the Divine Spark she had under her control, which was a spectacular amount. </p><p>However, that great potential was clearly wasted by her inflexibility. The only reason she was able to stick around was the great web of mystery that she drew around herself, but the actions of Zokras, the Crown Princess, and Eternals suggested that even that aura of mystery had been cracking from the perspective of their opponents. </p><p>She was so lucky that I suddenly appeared, helping her to sell the impression she had other weapons she had been hiding. Still, that didn’t change the fact that she was squandering all her power and knowledge with a politically-inept mind and a horribly direct approach. </p><p>Unfortunately, her political astuteness wasn’t my only problem. </p><p>Unlike the previous times, I enjoyed the metaphorical weight of the darkness settling on my presence, weakening the connection between me and the system. The more my trust toward the system dwindled, the more I appreciated the presence of the wards that could limit its interference without blocking the power it granted. </p><p>Too bad those wards required a unique Divine Spark to power them. I didn’t know whether only the Darkness Spark could do so, or there were some other Sparks that was a viable solution, but there was no doubt that the Light Spark — the only other spark I could access at the moment — was a horrible substitute for doing so. </p><p>Trying to use the light to create concealment would be like trying to make a fireplace out of tinder, not only useless, but explosively dangerous. </p><p>I continued to climb, the chorus getting louder and the silver runes shining brighter with each step. I wasn’t impressed with them the first time, and the repeated exposure hardly helped me to develop a sense of awe I lacked. </p><p>Luckily, my acting skills once again came to the rescue, adding all the amazement and worship I wasn’t feeling to my expression. </p><p>The room was once again decorated appropriately, with crystal pillars surrounding the crystal platform, and the headmistress once again dressed in her silver and gold armor, as well as her white robe, her glorious wings on the first display. </p><p>I was fortunate that she couldn’t read minds. I doubted she would appreciate my fantasies about the alternative ways of using those glorious wings. </p><p> [Divine Spark Identified! Please absorb it to continue to support the operations of the System]</p><p>The system notification didn’t come as a surprise, especially since my last visit already showed that even the wards weren’t enough to suppress that aspect of the system. </p><p>Nor it was able to suppress the sudden sense of hunger inside of me, forcing me to go forward and devour as much as Spark as I could manage. </p><p>This time, it was much easier to notice the foreign nature of that sensation. </p><p>I knelt in front of her like a loyal knight, and she put her hand on my head. This time, she didn’t bother asking about whether I was ready or not before letting her mana flow into my body, wilder than the last time. </p><p>I just grunted my teeth, accepting the flow of her sharp power. This time, I was prepared for the merciless deluge, easily isolating particles of Light Sparks from her mana. </p><p>Maybe it was the transformation my body had gone through during the previous time, but despite her mana containing more Spark, it hurt even less, my body getting stronger with each passing second.</p><p>Her mana flowed through my fake soul space, but this time, aware of the impact it needed to resist, I had built it much stronger, easily handling the flood of mana, while using the previous diversion trick to steal more Divine Spark. </p><p>With her choice to send a stronger flow, her control was even more limited, allowing me to steal more and more of the Divine Spark. Compared to the previous times, it was maybe ten times faster, meaning, if the headmistress maintained the transference process for roughly the same time, I would get ten times more Divine Spark. </p><p>And I had no intention of letting the system devour all of it. </p><p>My growing distrust was the main reason for such a decision. With my growing distrust towards the system, the last thing I wanted was to transfer all of it to the System, thus abandoning the initiative. </p><p>So, I split the Spark I managed to steal into three categories. The first, and the smallest, category, I isolated for the system to devour. About as equal to the previous time, a tenth of the total. Ironically, I didn’t even plan the system to devour all of it at once, but fed to in quarters, to better understand the rate of conversion into experience.</p><p>Or whether it had any actual link in between in the first place, like I was starting to suspect! </p><p>The second piece, about double the size of the one that would be devoured, was safely packed into my fake soul space, converted into her equivalent of a Companion Node, to prove the headmistress her efforts were not in vain. </p><p>Her choice to use a much more intense mana flow was certainly a curious decision, the one that needed to be assessed. But regardless of her reasoning, if I didn’t show her her strategy was yielding tangible benefits, she might not repeat such an action again. </p><p>However, the biggest part of the power I managed to acquire, almost three-quarters of it, was wrapped in several layers of my mana, in complicated wards I had created based on the workings of the Crown Princess’ spear, to be absorbed directly into my body. </p><p>It was an important step for my search for power, even if the resulting power was much less than the System. Because, despite everything, the system was clearly an external source of power. </p><p>I had already discovered a way to block the System from empowering — already tested on a fun way against Oeyne — its hosts, and if I could do that, there was no reason to believe the Organization couldn’t do the same. And I didn’t want to go back to being the Mule. </p><p> I would rather die. </p><p>Luckily, the empowerment of the Divine Spark gave me a more palatable alternative. Unlike the system, distributing its power from a center, it literally infused into every fiber of my physical body. </p><p>Yes, it empowered me much less than the System, taking a great more deal of effort to pull successfully, but still, compared to the alternative of utter powerlessness… </p><p>A little work was certainly more preferable, even if it was committing the sin of wasting Divine Spark in the process.</p><p>Pun intended. </p><p> The transfer continued, while I split my attention between trying to suppress the unfamiliar sense in front of me, trying to force me to devour all the Divine Spark I could manage, no doubt forced by the System, and maintaining the balance of the complicated mana structure I was using to steal Divine Spark from the mana flow. </p><p>A long while later, she finally stopped with the transfer. Her mana probe followed instantly, checking my soul space to the development of the Light Node, a smile appearing on her face as she checked the effectiveness of her new method, though exhaustion was clear as well. </p><p>It was a subtle thing, but it confirmed that, for some reason, she was in a hurry. Because she had chosen to apply a more intense method — one that was riskier for me, and more exhausting for her — despite not knowing for sure that it would work. </p><p>Unless there was a need to do so, it was a bad move. </p><p>I wondered what was her reason, because, from her perspective, everything should have been going excellently. The Zokras was defeated, and while two towns were destroyed in the process, most of the civilians managed to escape, turning what could be a huge crisis into a casual event. </p><p>Which meant, there was yet another thing that was pushing her to hurry up. </p><p>I hoped it was something related to the Crown Princess, because otherwise, it would mean we were facing a true crisis. </p><p>“Go and wait for me in the office,” she said, trying to sound impervious, but I could hear the exhaustion in her tone, further confirming the importance of the issue she was facing, at least from her perspective. </p><p>Important enough to put her extra effort to strengthen me. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I stood up, though, despite my somber tone, I made sure to replicate the stiff movements of a nobleman in the process, trying to sell her the impression of a royal knight. </p><p>She nodded in appreciation, and I left the room, ready for a difficult discussion.  </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324 / 6324 Mana: 7750 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

As I felt the chilly touch of the morning weather on my face — I hadn’t blocked it intentionally, to properly wake up — my mind shifted into more important issues. </p><p>Namely, the threat provided by the mysterious Eternals. Until I discovered Zokras’ final trick, I had assumed that their presence had been an incidental part of this siege, trying to score some easy victories for whatever they had in mind by supporting Zokras. </p><p>But Zokras’ latest decoy had put a different spin on the things, especially since I had no idea just how committed Zokras had been to the siege in the first place. </p><p>He was obviously trying to destroy the school, of course, as some of his plans were perfect until they were unraveled by me, a factor that he could not have planned for in any shape or form. However, that didn’t actually mean his main focus was against the school. Maybe it was a decoy from the beginning. </p><p>Which meant that I had never met with his real body, not even in his base — though, the real body was a complicated concept for a lich in the first place. When I first met him, I wasn’t strong enough to properly assess his capabilities, nor my focus was on there. </p><p>I was too busy trying to escape his death knights. </p><p>The anger he displayed as I destroyed his death knights was certainly genuine, though that wasn’t very surprising. Even if the attack was a decoy against the organization, he had to commit a majority of his assets — at least, the known ones — for his sacrifice to be convincing. He, without a doubt, hoped to save at least some of those Death Knights for future use. </p><p>The same was true for the magical ability he had displayed. His actual strength was definitely higher than his revealed strength.  </p><p>Though, it was complicated. If I was approximating the organization’s abilities correctly, it was difficult to hide things from them. </p><p>Which meant one good news and one bad news for me. Good news, even if Zokras had been using a decoy from the beginning, I had seen enough to get a good understanding of his power. Enough that I shouldn’t be worried about him trying to target me directly. </p><p>And considering he was trying to hide his survival, he wouldn’t have bothered with a pointless act like targeting Cornelia and Helga, shouting his survival. </p><p>Bad news that, even with everything I had discovered about the Eternals, I might have been underestimating their power and their reach. Zokras spending a decade of effort just to frame his death — albeit while achieving some other objectives, most likely stealing that dark Divine Spark the headmistress using for an extremely expensive concealment source, maybe even taking down the headmistress at the same time — told a lot about their strength. </p><p>Once again I was facing an enemy that over-classed me significantly. </p><p>“Damn,” I murmured, letting the wild winds devour my annoyed gasp. With the undead threat resolved, I was hoping that my desperate need to get even stronger would have disappeared. </p><p>It wasn’t even that I was hoping for a holiday. The presence of the Crown Princess was a mess big enough to keep my attention even without the looming shadow of a huge organization that could make my life hell if they ever properly noticed my presence. </p><p>“I was lucky,” I murmured as I realized another critical detail. Almost every mass-destruction spell I had used during the battle had been light magic in some shape or form. It had some generous life magic mixed in to make it much more explosive, of course, but ultimately, for an outside observer, it wasn’t nothing that couldn’t have been applied by a secret mage raised by the Headmistress and kept in reserve for emergencies, acting in shadows while Titania played the more visible face. </p><p>That wasn’t the case, of course. I was an accidental acquisition for the headmistress rather than a carefully-developed weapon, but it was the only reasonable conclusion a spy could make based on the data. Amusingly, the real truth was too absurd to be a part of the report for any competent spy. </p><p>Which meant, I still had a layer of anonymity to act around. </p><p>Unfortunately, that anonymity didn’t come without its cost. To sell the impression that I was working for the headmistress, even on the surface, meaning I had to sacrifice a considerable amount of freedom, to reinforce the impression for any possible spy.  </p><p>I didn’t make the job any easier by introducing myself to different parties by different identities. For the possible spies of the Eternals, I was a mysterious spy with great competency in light magic, almost raised intentionally to fight against the darkness, his visage always hidden. </p><p>And, from the perspective of the princess and her party, I was an expert in crafting, focusing on esoteric wards and enchantment, yet with weak social skills. The overlap between the two identities was considerably low that any spy might think of these two identities as two different people. </p><p>Or not, considering their appearance in timing. It depended on the abilities and the connections of the spy. </p><p>Of course, whether the spies could guess I was the one that ‘destroyed’ Zokras or not, I had to be careful in my interaction with the princess’ retinue. It wasn’t about me trusting her — and I certainly didn’t — but something more fundamental. Her brothers had used the same monster horde trick the undead army suddenly added to their arsenal when they faced with a problem.</p><p>Meaning the enemies of the princess were in contact with the Eternals. </p><p>I didn’t know about the level of connection between them. It might a straight transaction of services between the princes and the organization, or it could be a total surrender in terms of some of the royal family. </p><p>Regardless, one thing was clear. My involvement with the princess would make me a person of interest to the organization, meaning, I had to be very careful revealing my skills and abilities, especially when it came to forging weapons capable of storing Divine Spark. </p><p>One thing the Organization clearly hunting for. </p><p>If I had known Zokras was just a shell, using such a deadly siege that expanded most of the forces he gathered for decades just to fake his death, I wouldn’t have gotten involved with the princess. Unfortunately, the die was already cast, and trying to pull back would just bring more unwelcome attention to my identity. </p><p>But I didn’t have much more time to consider the political weight of my actions, not when I arrived at the school, even as the first lights of the morning smashed against the walls. </p><p>As I closed in, I noticed that the walls had suffered some damage, indicating that the surrounding towns were not the only ones that suffered the attention of the undead. </p><p>However, while the attack itself was not surprising, the damage itself was. Ironically, not because it was too much, but because it was too little. Other than a few spell damages on the walls, there was hardly a sign. </p><p>Which raised some dangerous issues. </p><p>The attack wasn’t surprising, because even with most of his forces committed to the towns, Zokras needed to add another variable to the battle, enough to prevent the school from sending some rapid reinforcements. However, such a diversionary force needed to be convincing, more than able to leave a few broken walls.</p><p>The lightness of the attack was not the problem, however. That could have been easily explained by Zokras trying to hasten his death. </p><p>The problem was the lack of reinforcement from the school. It was impossible for such a light diversionary attack to convince the school not to send any reinforcement. </p><p>Unless someone high up enough was able to interfere enough to send reinforcements. Maybe it was the same spies that tried to take down Titania earlier. Unfortunately, despite it being the likeliest conclusion, I couldn’t take that as an outcome. There was a chance the spies from a different organization — maybe the Eternals, or maybe completely unrelated groups. </p><p>There was even a chance that the Crown Princess was the one that interfered, hoping to get rid of the headmistress’ most loyal assistant to increase her bargaining value. It sounded counter-intuitive to cripple a critical ally, but unfortunately, that was how politics worked. </p><p>Regardless of everything, one thing was clear. The higher management was still infiltrated with spies, fully able to interfere with critical decisions without revealing themselves as the culprit. </p><p>Which definitely didn’t make my job any easier. </p><p>Still, the deeper I delved into politics, the more I was realizing that keeping myself hidden was the smartest decision. </p><p>With a shrug, I dispelled the elemental mount and sneaked into the school. I had more important things than theorizing about the definite existence of the spies and their possible intentions. </p><p>Like, another meeting with the headmistress. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324 / 6324 Mana: 7750 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I woke up to the sound of footsteps, walking down the stairs. </p><p>I was happy, which was the natural consequence of waking up wrapped with the deliciously naked body of a busty blonde, still carrying several marks from the night of debauchery we shared. Especially since not all of them were her work. </p><p>Some of them were the work of the person who was busy walking down the stairs, my blonde paramour’s brunette friend, trying to do the walk of shame before she got caught. Just another reason to have a big smile. </p><p>I was tempted to let her succeed in her aim of getting away while I stayed in Carrie’s arms for a long sleep, but I decided against it. The last night was hardly the casual evening three friends could have, and making sure she wasn’t plagued by negative emotions was the decent thing to do. </p><p>Also, she was too cute to escape without a morning kiss. </p><p>Slipping out of the bed without waking up Carrie was a challenge, but her exhaustion made it easier. She was extremely aroused after watching me take her friend’s first time, enough to make me work hard for almost two hours before she finally crashed into a hazy collapse, a big smile on her lips.</p><p>I considered leaving the room naked, but decided against it. It was better to check her mood before teasing her in such a spectacular manner. Instead, I wrapped a towel around my waist, leaving my muscular chest naked. </p><p>A nice balance between modesty and teasing. </p><p>When I left the room, I was more focused on being fast than being silent, not wanting Sarah to slip away before I could catch her. But when I stood at the top of the stairs, I realized it was a pointless rush. </p><p>The reason, Sarah was trying to find her underwear, the ones she had discarded during our naughty game the night before, where she had pushed far more than she had planned in a pointless attempt to surpass Carrie, unaware of the lengths her shy blonde friend had gone beforehand. </p><p>So, as I moved down the stairs, I focused more on not making a noise, enjoying the view as she bent over the couch, trying to find her clothes in the messiness of the couch. Pity that she had come with an overnight bag, meaning the ones she was trying to find wasn’t her only clothes. </p><p>She was wearing a skirt that would have been modest if she wasn’t fully bending over, riding it high enough to reveal her panties. And unlike her skirt, those red lace panties were nothing that could be classified as modest, hinting at the beauty of her core. </p><p>The same beautiful world I had invaded last night, with a spectacular outcome for both of us. </p><p>A tent appeared in front of me as I closed the distance, the towel failing to contain my reaction. Understandable even after a night of sensual fun. If there was one thing good about trying to be a professional sportsman, it was the endless libido as a result of equally endless training. </p><p>Especially with the presence of some sexy ladies appreciating that feature. </p><p>“Good morning,” I said, a smile coloring my face as Sarah turned in panic, failing to realize the impact of such a sharp move would have on her flowing skirt, providing a full range display of her panties before she could put her hands on the hem and push it down. </p><p>“G-good morning,” she stammered, her usual sharp speech replaced with a shy stutter more fitting her formerly-shy friend. </p><p>I sent a pointed gaze to her bag, before shifting back to her blushing face. “You’re not thinking of leaving without a breakfast, right?” I said. </p><p>“I have some stuff to do,” she answered, this time managing not to stutter, but still escaped my gaze. </p><p>“Nonsense, it’s Saturday. Whatever you have can wait until you have a good breakfast, even if you don’t want to wait until Carrie wakes up.” </p><p>The mention of her friend only intensified her blush, along with a great deal of guilt. After all, in her mind, she had betrayed her friend by stealing me while her friend was sleeping, unaware that the said friend had been watching us all along, with more enthusiasm than she could ever imagine. </p><p>Too bad that her misplaced guilt just made it easier to play with her. And Carrie’s actions, especially the last part in the bedroom where she actually sneaked in, showed that she was more than happy about pushing it forward. </p><p>“Maybe a quick coffee,” she relented after a failed attempt to exert her will. </p><p>“Excellent, do you mind helping me in the kitchen?” </p><p>Her gaze dipped down to my towel, and the tent in the front. “Aren’t you going to change first?” she asked. </p><p>“Why?” I whispered, shifting my tone into a dark, throaty grunt, an excellent method to trigger a shiver on my target. Sarah reacted just as I expected, and I used the opportunity to take a step closer. “Don’t tell me you’re feeling shy after the last night?” Her eyes grew in panic. </p><p>“Don’t talk about that. It never happened,” she gasped. </p><p>“What, swimming together in the pool?” I said, acting confused. Her sudden freeze was beautiful. “I was talking about the towel covering more than the swimsuit.” A short pause for impact as my lips twisted into a smirk. ‘Why? Are you talking about something different?” </p><p>She was a smart girl, fully aware that I was mocking her. But that didn’t mean she had a response for it. “T-that’s swimming,” she managed to answer. </p><p>“Nonsense, I wouldn’t say anything if you put on that delicious black swimsuit again.” </p><p>Sarah said nothing as I walked toward the kitchen, and she followed. “I just don’t want Carrie to misunderstand anything,” she said. </p><p>I was tempted to tease her about her word choice, in particular using misunderstanding, but the sudden tightness of her voice suggested that I had stepped into dangerous territory, and pushing more was not the smartest idea. </p><p>Instead, I moved to the fridge, and pulled a small carton of eggs. I broke eight in quick succession, before noticing Sarah’s gaze. “Sorry, forgot to ask. Do you want eggs, or are you more of a cereal person?” </p><p>“Normally I would prefer a lighter breakfast, but since you already prepared…” she said. </p><p>I chuckled. “Oh, no, those are just for me. I’ll add some more if you want,” I said even as I started whisking them rapidly, even as I started to heat a pan, then pulled some pre-sliced potatoes and onions from the freezer. </p><p>“Then no,” she murmured.</p><p>“Are you sure?” I said. “Because I make a mean Spanish omelet,” I said. And it wasn’t even an empty brag. Taking enough protein was always a big part of professional sports, so any aspiring amateur worth his salt would have a decent number of protein-heavy dishes that could be prepared easily. </p><p>“Maybe I can try,” she said, unable to reject my enthusiasm. I added two more eggs, one for Carrie, one for her, before putting the mixture on the pan, creating a thick layer that looked like a pie from a distance. </p><p>“How can you eat that much for breakfast?” Sarah asked, though it was not only about her shock, but also her desperate attempt to pull the discussion away from any thorny subject. like the interesting game we had played on the couch, or our private time in the pool. </p><p>… or, me pushing inside her in my bedroom, again and again. </p><p>“Hey, those muscles need a lot of food,” I said with a goofy tone. I give her an exaggerated strongman pose, a silly smile on my face. If I was dressed normally, it would have been a simple joke pose. But wearing nothing but a towel, with my whole body in display, it was a different deal. I heard her beautiful gasp as I stretched my muscles, enjoying the way a fresh blush crept up her neck. </p><p>I didn’t actually intend for my towel to loosen and slip, but when it happened, I wasn’t particularly fast as I reached down, giving her enough time to enjoy the full view as I grabbed it, stretching various muscles to the best effect. </p><p>And despite the disapproving gasp she let out when it first happened, she didn’t look particularly torn-up as I moved slowly to grab it up. </p><p>“Do you mind making the coffee,” I had to say to make her pull her gaze away from my midsection. </p><p>“Where’s it?” she asked after filling the drip machine. </p><p>“The second one on the right,” I said, and she was quick to turn — though, this time, she remembered holding her skirt — and open the cabinet, interested in the opportunity of looking away. </p><p>How amusing, I thought. </p><p>She rose to her tiptoes, but still failed to reach it. “Let me help,” I whispered as I stood behind her. And my erection pushing against her amazing hips was a complete coincidence. Just as my other hand slipped under her skirt to caress the texture of her panties. </p><p>I put the box in her hands, but stayed in place. “Are you going to let me go?” she gasped, her voice tense with arousal. </p><p>Leaning forward even more, my naked chest pressing against her back, I whispered into her ear. “Do you want me to let you go?” I asked. </p><p>Her silence was perfect to convey her conflict. “W-we can’t,” she finally whispered. “I can’t do that to my friend.” </p><p>I could have reminded her that she had already betrayed her friend — at least from her own perspective — but despite the slow response, she sounded pretty determined. And I still have an omelet to finish cooking, so I decided to let her have that victory. </p><p>Carrie picked that moment to stroll down the stairs, wearing only a bathrobe. And since it was a normal-sized one I kept for any nighttime guests, it didn’t properly fit her, strained especially on the chest area and around the hips. </p><p>She was just wearing a carelessly-tied bathrobe, providing an amazing show. </p><p>Normally, it was to be expected to cease any kind of flirting going on between me and Sarah, but the sudden angry expression on Sarah’s face, tinged with jealousy… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Pushing Emma down to devour my shaft, feeling the warmth of her lips, not only provided me with great pleasure, but also gave me some time to think about Emma’s recent actions.</p><p>More importantly, in relation to the sudden shift in her objectives. Our latest ‘deal’ had been very specific, with me revealing some of the double agents of the dark faction for her — the ones working for my rivals, obviously — while she arranged certain benefits, like a comfortable prison cell.</p><p>Her desire to make her mark in the Empire politics was clearly unchanged — but unfortunately, her incredible magical ability certainly didn’t make her politically competent. With her desires one-directional and easy to read, she was easily manipulated. The Queen started it the first, followed by Fernhand before I took the lead.</p><p>And now, implied by her focus on scouring the library with great hurry in the middle of the night rather than trying to convince the Queen to change my interrogation method, her latest backer.</p><p>Ironically, her first attempt immediately betrayed her new backer, just by her research topic. Before even asking her one question about the mysterious party, I learned a lot of things.</p><p>And the most important piece of information was that another group was searching for information about those mysterious ward-makers.</p><p>A more direct Dark Lord might have ignored the implications of it, but for me, that single fact came with an incredible wealth of information. Their detailed research topics suggested that they had a better understanding of the information available in the library, enough to give Emma a research guide. But the fact that they were researching in the first place meant that their information about the mysterious party was not complete, making it necessary for them to use subterfuge, trying to get more information.</p><p>However, there were also more dangerous implications hidden in the attempt. Sending Emma to the library in the middle of the night to get all the information at once was more dangerous than spreading the same attempt for the next month, allowing her to get a few pieces of information every day.</p><p>Such hurry implied that the other party had a reason to hurry up. The clue that triggered my research, the wards embedded in the throne room, was in place for years without the slightest touch and maintenance, hence, the reason I was doing a more comprehensive sweep about its roots.</p><p>But what if the mysterious party was active somewhere else, in a way with more immediate implications?</p><p>Fuck, I thought even as I grabbed Emma’s beautiful red hair tightly, slamming her face aggressively, more to bleed my frustration than to soften her for the following interrogation. Just as I felt that I had control of the situation and relax, another wild variable came, ruining my plans.</p><p>I hated the feeling of control slipping off my fingers.</p><p>Luckily, I thought as I looked down at the beautiful redhead that was busy massaging my girth with her throat, that I had the perfect double spy already in place to get a better understanding of the situation.</p><p>Though, I was certainly happy that I had undersold my abilities to Emma and didn’t give her even a flicker of my true inclinations. She might be a capable mage, but she was certainly a terribly unlucky spy.</p><p>“Take it deeper,” I murmured even as I pushed her head down, even more, enjoying the enveloping sensation. There was no harm in properly weakening her resistance before launching another chain of subtle interrogation.</p><p>With my iron grip not allowing her to retreat, her only option was to bring me to completion as quickly as possible. Her hands landed on my thighs, using it as leverage to take me even deeper, showing just how much she had learned during our last encounter, where my sexy princess and I double-teamed her mercilessly as a punishment for an extended while.</p><p>Since she was showing such an amazing commitment, I pulled my hands away from her head, and focused on her remaining pieces of clothing. A few controlled cutting spells made sure to leave every single piece of clothing she owned — other than her outer robe — into pieces.</p><p>The image of her retreating from the library, her body underneath covered with my cum, was almost as electrifying as the treatment I was receiving.</p><p>I grabbed her naked breasts, squeezing and slapping, as she tried her best to bring me to completion, her lips dancing along my length aggressively, getting even faster as I squeezed her nipple, earning a delicious moan off her.</p><p>Her obedience was getting smoother and smoother…</p><p>Marking the time for the next stage of the interrogation. As much as I hated stopping halfway before giving her the reward she was in the process of earning, I needed her tense and aching for completion to interrogate her indirectly, without realizing the nature of my questions. She might not be an excellent spy, but she wasn’t stupid either.</p><p>She was rattled as I suddenly grabbed her waist and lifted her, her body weightless against my strength. Confusion was clear in her eyes as her ass landed on the smooth surface of the desk once more. “Is something wrong?” she stammered.</p><p>I chuckled, amused by the fact that she was more interested in why we stopped rather than sitting on the desk naked, her amazing body on display for anyone that might burst in — though, in this hour, it wasn’t very likely. “I decided to give you a momentary break,” I answered with a chuckle.</p><p>“There’s no need for it,” she answered, her answer curiously rapid, and her eyes dipping down, tinged with desire. “I can continue.”</p><p>The interrogation wasn’t just fun for me, it seemed.</p><p>“I’m sure you can,” I said as I took a step forward, bringing our bodies dangerously close. Her legs parted wide even as she slid forward, bringing me the perfect position to slip inside. Unfortunately for her, rather than responding to my slipping inside, I put my hand on her knob, caressing gently. Not enough to push her toward the completion, just enough to keep her tense. “Oh, but I also have some questions about your new spell. Can’t I just ask them?”</p><p>She might not be the sharpest political agent, but even in her aroused state, she didn’t miss that it was just a rhetorical question, a part of my dominance game. “S-sure,” she tried to say, interrupted midway with a moan as I flicked my fingers.</p><p>There was a certain satisfaction watching her tremble under my gentle touch as she tried to fight against the desires of her own body, unable to help but contain them even on the edge of a climax. It was the thing that people misunderstood about the sense of domination, mistaking it for mere sadism or childish tantrum, as if aggressively threatening a powerless widow could ever rival silencing one of the strongest mages of the Empire with a touch of my fingers, silently begging for a climax even as she tried to explain a mysterious spell structure for me.</p><p>And the pleasure I was getting from keeping on the edge was just one benefit. As I hit her with more and more in-depth questions about her nonexistent spell, shedding her poor cover story, she had to rely more and more on the core of the array she was researching.</p><p>It wasn’t that she knew a lot about the magic theory relating to the mysterious array itself, making her cover story about the new spell almost nonsensical as I continually ask her more questions, even as she had tapped into the limited information she had on the mysterious new direction.</p><p>But like before, the absence of the information was information itself, especially as she continued to lose coherency, drunk with pleasure, tortured on the edge, making her answers more incoherent yet honest at the same time.</p><p>And it revealed that whatever new group she had switched after her latest betrayal, they didn’t trust Emma with a lot of information about the nature of the new magical discipline. They just gave her enough information to make her search in the library a smooth affair, but not explain her more. They either acquired her as an asset recently, or didn’t trust her to reveal more.</p><p>Maybe a combination, which would be smart, considering Emma’s loose lips. Though that hardly helped me to pin the identity of her supporter. I could have tried to ask her directly, but that would have alerted her about the real focus of the interrogation, something I was reluctant to do at the moment. Unfortunately, the magic part of the interrogation hit a dead end. More magical questions wouldn’t give any worthwhile information on the subject, but questioning her about the power behind her would alert her again.</p><p>It was a tough decision, so rather than making an immediate decision, I decided to take a break, her naked body in front of me, trembling with unmet arousal, giving me the perfect tool to relax.</p><p>I grabbed her shoulder and pushed her against the table, earning a shocked gasp at the collusion, followed by an even louder gasp as three of my fingers slipped inside her, earning a delicious moan in the process.</p><p>I pumped my fingers aggressively, each twirl making let-out moans filled with desire. My empty hand landed on her breasts, squeezing a cry among her moans. She tried to say something, but that melted into her moans. I didn’t even let her take a breath, until she started trembling desperately, her body turning limp, gushing.</p><p>Only then, I pull my fingers out of her beautiful entrance, still undecided about what to do. I expected her to lie on the desk, trying to catch her breath.</p><p>I certainly wasn’t expecting her to reach to her robe desperately as she turned at the entrance, where the door was still closed. Damn, I thought, realizing that her last panic was likely her alarm wards triggering. “Y-you need to leave,” she stammered even as she hastily pulled her robe on and — after a frustrated glare at me — burned the scraps of her ruined clothing, not even leaving a particle of ash behind.</p><p>Her elemental competency was not a joke.</p><p>The reaction she displayed, and the request for me to disappear rather than help her, made it clear that it was an ally of her that arrived.</p><p>I had another important decision to make, and I didn’t like it.</p><p>Things were starting to move faster than I had been hoping, threatening to ruin my comfortable nest…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Without its tamer, the beast is going crazy,” explained Pico even as he took a step forward, standing in front of me, determined. “Run and find another place to hide. I’ll try to hold it off.” I looked at the old man, couldn’t help but respect his determination. He had raised his gladius, ready to go down swinging.</p><p>Pity that the skin of a Nemean lion was famously immune to mortal weapons.</p><p>What he was proposing was certain death, but once again, he was willing to take the risk of his loyalty to the gladiator school. How interesting, I thought, that what was essentially an entertainment organization galvanized the same level of loyalty as the army, maybe even more.</p><p>It was an impressive achievement.</p><p>I weighed the implication of staying to defend against the beast versus leaving and leaving Pico alone. Unlike him, however, mine wasn’t fueled by loyalty, no matter how much I was impressed by Pico’s actions. Ultimately, they were the people under the misconception that they owned me, with no problem of sending me to my death — like they thought that they had done against the Chimera — if the price was good enough.</p><p>No, my consideration was more selfish. Leaving was definitely an option, but not as safe as it looked at the first glance. Not only explaining my mysterious survival would be easy to explain to Antonius, but also there was a risk of the Nemean lion going wild and killing citizens.</p><p>If something like that happened, it wasn’t hard to imagine who would be blamed for the whole fiasco. The only survivor from the encounter, who was conveniently a slave.</p><p>No, staying to fight was the better option, even if that meant that I had to use my magic to kill the beast. I had no doubt that I could slip that over Pico, and worst, I could incapacitate him for a moment before doing so.</p><p>However, I had a better idea in mind, the kind that would punish the Bestiary School for daring to plot against me. I didn’t know whether they were all in it or Antony was acting on his own, but considering he was their heir, I didn’t care either way.</p><p>They dared to plot against me.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Pico said, looking at me. “You need to run!”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m not going to bet that I can run faster than a magical predator. I’ll take my chances directly.” I answered with a shrug, even as I threw my sword on the ground, ignoring Pico’s glance. Weapons were useless against the beast unless I drenched them in my magic, and in that case, I might as well shout my true profession.</p><p>No, I thought, even as the beast burst into the opening. Ultimately, I had half a dozen ways that I could kill the beast, some even including disguising myself as a mysterious sorcerer to support the army, but a question appeared in my mind. Was that the most efficient way?</p><p>After all, while I had some solid clues about Junia Patriarch House having the information I hoped, it was certainly not a guarantee, and infiltrating more houses was beneficial.</p><p>And for that, I needed more fame.</p><p>The kind that might be earned from a victory worthy of legends outside the arena.</p><p>“Just distract it for a moment,” I said to Pico. “Go stood next to the body of its master, and get its attention.”</p><p>It didn’t look like reasonable advice, earning a questioning look from Pico even after he offered to sacrifice his life uncontested. “Trust me,” I said. “It’ll be just like the Chimera.”</p><p>While he looked at me questioningly, however, I cast a little spell, making Antony’s bag float away from his body, in a location where Pico couldn’t see. Growing up as a bastard taught me never to lose an opportunity to increase my sources, and the bag of an arrogant heir certainly had some goodies that would make it worth it.</p><p>Pico nodded before going next to the body of its master, dipping his sword into the pool of blood. Smart tactic. Whether the beast was seeing the body of his master as an object of its anger or something to protect, Pico’s presence near it was clearly not to be appreciated by the lion.</p><p>It charged toward Pico, unaware of my presence, as I dashed toward it until it was too late. It tried to turn toward me, but before it could complete the turn, I grabbed its mane, dragging myself on top, my arms clenching tight around its throat.</p><p>The roar that the beast let out as it dashed toward the nearest tree was earth-shattering. From such a close distance, it would have knocked me out if it wasn’t for my magic protecting me. Still, that was a mistake, because I tightened my grip around its throat, trying to prevent it from breathing.</p><p>It felt like trying to hug a tree, hard and unyielding, but it achieved the objective. The lion tried to breathe back, only to realize it was much harder than it had assumed to suffocate a magical creature of its caliber.</p><p>Luckily, while the transformation my body was going through was an extremely inconvenient transformation that forced me to go undercover as a gladiator just so that I could identify it, it granted me with inhuman power to succeed in my objective.</p><p>A gladiator strong enough to suffocate a Nemean lion was suspicious, but not suspicious as a mysterious Sorcerer walking around to kill such a beast, and disappearing just as quick.</p><p>The Nemean lion didn’t appreciate being suffocated. It tried to slam itself against a tree. It might have even worked, but at that point, the beast’s desperate dash brought us away from the field of view of Pico. So, when it tried to use a tree to hit me, a shining magical shield was already in place, preventing its simplistic yet effective plan from succeeding.</p><p>I kept the shield in place until the beast realized that, in his crazed mind, that smashing me against the trees, again and again, was not the solution. There, I could have defeated the beast, allowing me to extract myself from the situation with the least fanfare.</p><p>But there lied the question. That whether I should just let it slide with the limited fanfare. The answer was no, not when the whole point was to get famous to get access to various patrician estates.</p><p>And what better way to do so than killing a crazed magical animal in the view of the city.</p><p>It wasn’t a perfect solution, not even close. Killing a beast belonging to the Bestiaries School would ruin their reputation, as it would imply that they had lost control of one of the magical beasts, one of the highly dangerous beasts that they famously owned.</p><p>Though, considering they already committed to killing me, it wasn’t exactly my biggest concern. Yes, the increased focus they would have on me, independent of their battle with the Dacian school, but that didn’t matter. After all, I needed the fame, and the higher my fame got, the bigger target I would become for the enemies of the school one way or another.</p><p>And if the enmity was inevitable, why shouldn’t evoke it under my terms.</p><p>I had to admit, riding a crazed magical lion, even when it was struggling to breathe, wasn’t the easiest thing I had ever done. My magical knowledge was extensive, but magic was too extensive for one person to master every aspect of it.</p><p>And beast taming was definitely not one of my strengths, leaving my strength as the only way to direct the beast to a more public location, where some people could watch my achievement. I pulled, the beast roared, launching the single most exhausting battle I had ever experienced. Not the most difficult, and certainly not the most dangerous, but certainly the most exhausting. Still, I stayed focused.</p><p>Seconds turned into minutes as the struggle stole most of my attention, so much that even the thinning forest was an afterthought. It was only the cries of the onlookers that reminded me of aim. I looked around, only to find myself near the walls of Rome, with a spectacle around me, cheers mixing with cries as people gathered.</p><p>Watching me defeat the famous Nemean lion, followed by cheers. Just to make my show even more incredible, I just suffocated the beast until it was unconscious rather than dead, adding laurels to my already legendary show.</p><p>I just hoped that I could wield the sword of the fame before it chopped me.</p>",

    "content": "<p>My throaty warning didn’t make Helga tremble in fear. She did tremble, but it was a display of passion rather than fear. Her widening smile was the distinction. The way she pushed her hips up, giving me the perfect angle to slip inside, just underlined the beautiful impression she was giving. </p><p>I pushed, her wet lips enveloping my shaft. A loud grunt escaped my mouth, which earned a reaction from Cornelia. But unlike before, rather than awakening her frustrated jealousy, it stroked her arousal further. </p><p>Luckily for her, dealing with her arousal was not impossible, especially not when she positioned herself in front of Helga, her legs widened in preparation before grabbing Helga’s hair and pulled her down, inviting her to service. </p><p>Helga seemed more than happy to service Cornelia, though her efforts often interrupted by the moans as I pushed inside her, her body easily swallowing my shaft. And my hands weren’t exactly waiting idle as I pushed repeatedly inside her. One of my hands landed on her bottom, making her plump ass giggle, while the other landed on her inner thigh, climbing upward slowly, almost tenderly, contrasting the aggressiveness of my hips with the sensual massage of my fingers. </p><p>My eyes met with Cornelia, whose beautiful green eyes were burning with desire and joy as Helga licked her. And I could see that it wasn’t just the pleasure she was feeling — though it was definitely having a part on it. No, she was feeling happy because of the speed Helga had agreed to help her face, a challenge that could easily cost her life. </p><p>I smiled back to her while casting a little arcana trick to caress her nipples, adding another layer of pleasure to the tongue-heavy treatment she was already receiving from Helga, trying to make her climax even deeper. </p><p>My smirk widened as the nature of the shine in her eyes changed, gratitude replaced by pure ecstasy. Emotional catharsis was nice, but not for our current moment. </p><p>After making sure Cornelia was properly occupied by her moans, I turned my attention back to Helga. My hand on her thighs crept upward slowly, closer and closer to entrance, the softness of the sensation to contrast greatly with my merciless ramming. Her moans, even in their muffled quality as Cornelia forced her head down, loud enough to rattle the windows, making the silencing wards to work to their limit. </p><p>Under attack from both ends, it wasn’t surprising for Helga to tremble helplessly a while later as the climax hit, making her collapse. Luckily for her, Cornelia was ready next to her, preventing her from hitting on the floor painfully. </p><p>“You’re exhausted rather quickly,” I said with a chuckle as Helga desperately tried to catch her breath. “Don’t tell me you’re out already.” </p><p>Cornelia chuckled even as she stole a quick kiss of Helga, helping her to sit down. Then she stood up, her body tense in preparation. “Oh, I’m sure she’ll catch her breath soon enough. Why don’t I tag in for a moment.” </p><p>“If you say so,” I responded mockingly. I looked at Helga, matching her euphoria-filled exhaustion with a big smirk. “However, from the looks of her, you’re going to take up the slack for a long while. Do you feel confident enough to handle it?” I asked. </p><p>I remember making a similar comment to Marianne not too long before, when we were having a threesome with her and Titania, though she was too shy to answer. Cornelia’s response was equally silent, but the source of it was different. </p><p>Cornelia didn’t answer, because she let her confident stance to answer. She stood up, her lithe body tense in preparation, each step bringing her closer to the monumental challenge she was about to face. Even after everything that happened, I couldn’t help but feel impressed by the way Cornelia owned her nakedness, as if she was being radiated by the inner light of her fire magic, equally fiery. </p><p>I couldn’t help but lick my lips, which widened her smile considerably. “I think I can,” she finally answered even as she put her hand on my shoulder, and pushed me to a sitting position. </p><p>I allowed her to do so, more than happy with the change of pace after dominating three beauties, one after another — two into exhaustion, the other to near-collapse. After that direct aggression, it would be fun to be on the defense for a moment. </p><p>And Cornelia was the perfect one to deliver such an assault. She might be developing a submissive side, but that didn’t mean that her aggressive edge had evaporated completely. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured as I shuffled in my seat, enjoying the way her tight hips swaying with each step. Around her, there was a soft red halo, her mana moving with excitement, adding a flickering flame aura to the mixture. </p><p>Her magical capabilities had truly reached to a new, very impressive, degree. </p><p>Cornelia arrived in front of me soon after, looking down with desire burning in her eyes. For a moment, I thought she was going to extend her vantage point to tease me, as it had been a rarity for her to enjoy a dominant position over me — even if I was the one allowing that to happen in the first place. </p><p>But Cornelia surprised me by collapsing on her knees immediately, her eyes locked to my erection, still glistening with Helga’s juices. Apparently, I had significantly underestimated the high her arousal reached watching me dominate her compatriots. </p><p>“Such an enthusiasm for cleaning,” I said mockingly as her lips wrapped around my shaft, her moans displaying her joy. Her tongue darted out with great enthusiasm after she pulled back for a moment to give a naughty smile, following with a slow, lingering lick to the side of my shaft. </p><p>A groan of pleasure escaped my lips, but the distraction it provided wasn’t enough for me to miss another ice cube flying toward me. “Naughty,” I murmured, catching Cornelia’s amused gaze, not diminished even when her attack surprise attack diverted completely. “Good attempt, but you need to have a follow-up plan no matter the viability of the success.” </p><p>Cornelia showed her appreciation toward my lesson by swallowing my shaft once again, pushing her as hard as she could manage, her throat tightening around my girth spectacularly. I leaned back, enjoying her service as she struggled to take me deeper and deeper, her beautiful lips around the base of my shaft, her perky tits pressing against my legs. The flexible dance of her tongue in her mouth, creating additional shivers of pleasure, just added another layer to my enjoyment. </p><p>She was amazing, especially with her impressive display of enthusiasm. As she sank deeper, her magic flared even more to match her enthusiasm. The aura of flame reaching to a point that would have scared me if it wasn’t for my own abilities to intervene if needed. </p><p>However, I said nothing, because the sight of a sexy redhead wrapped with an equally impressive flame aura even as she did her best to completely swallow me was too attractive to stop. I much preferred to stop an accidental fire to stop her halfway. </p><p>Cornelia continued her task enthusiastically, uncaring of the fire hazard she was creating, or the mana she was wasting. Though, why should she care about the mana she wasted when her lips were already clamped around a hose of endless mana, the best magical item she ever used. </p><p>She gasped and gagged and heaved, swallowing the full length of my shaft repeatedly. </p><p>I was considering how to properly finish the day, when I felt a delicious softness around my neck, one that I recognized easily. </p><p>Marianne was awake. </p><p>And she wasn’t alone, Titania reminded, when she burst into the scene, grabbing Cornelia’s head to push her down, her smirk suggesting that it was not just an erotic moment, but making her pay back for the failure of their earlier combined tactics. </p><p>I wasn’t able to say anything, because Helga came back, pulling me in for a hungry kiss, her hands happily employed, rubbing my chest while her tits mashed me. </p><p>It was quite a show, I thought even as I flared my magic, curing my exhaustion. </p><p>Something told me that I would need it… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324 / 6324 Mana: 4671 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 19/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t waste too much time before I moved on to the main topic. I looked at Helga. “I want you to accompany Cornelia on her journey.”</p><p>Cornelia threw a glance at me, one that was unable to settle to a decision between annoyed and happy. She didn’t appreciate the implication that she needed help, but she didn’t reject that idea either. Her reaction would have been more explosive before her close call with the death knights.</p><p>“What about my new role at the faculty?” Helga asked.</p><p>I looked at Titania, who was gently sleeping while her face was buried in Marianne’s comfortable breasts. “That might not be that hard to arrange,” I said with a chuckle, earning a similar response from Helga, making her bosom jiggle.</p><p>I pulled the girls closer to my body, enjoying the warmth of their naked bodies. “I thought you were going to come yourself,” Cornelia asked, reminding me of our previous deal. To her credit, her tone wasn’t angry, simply questioning. “Why the change?”</p><p>“Things are moving too fast. There’s no guarantee that I could get away from Silver Spires for such a long time without letting a very important thing slide,” I answered with a frown even as I let my fingers travel down, caressing their breasts, while giving a high-level explanation about the Crown Princess’ visit.</p><p>Just because we were discussing a serious topic didn’t mean we couldn’t have fun in the process.</p><p>“I see,” Cornelia murmured, carrying echoes of a moan, my fingers still caressing her skin. “And how should we act.”</p><p>I was tempted to say Cornelia just followed Helga’s every order, but even with her mellowing personality, that was a recipe for disaster. Luckily, Helga was calm and crafty enough to handle Silver Spires as a commoner, and she could handle Cornelia without triggering her completely. “The problem is the utter lack of information you’re currently facing,” I said.</p><p>“It’s not too bad,” Cornelia answered. “I still have some loyal servants back in the house, and they are keeping tabs at my uncle.”</p><p>“And you know they haven’t already been subverted by your uncle and feeding you false information, how?” That was enough to silence Cornelia for a moment, her head dipping in disappointment. She clearly wanted to argue, but her position wasn’t the best. More importantly, she knew that.</p><p>“The first objective is to set up a defensible position. When you arrive at your house, find an excuse to stay in your quarters no matter what your uncle gives. Even if he claims that there’s a deadly emergency, say that you got ambushed on the road and exhausted yourself magically. Then, go to your private wing, take down every single ward, no matter how small, and establish brand new ones.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t that tell my uncle that I was lying about being exhausted?”</p><p>“That’s actually a part of the plan. Unless he actually tries to set an ambush himself, he would assume you’re not exhausted in the first place. By setting the wards, you’ll give the impression that you were exhausted in the aftermath.”</p><p>“I see,” Helga cut in. “And I’m assuming that we shouldn’t waste more than half of our mana while setting the wards.”</p><p>“Try to spend no more than a quarter,” I said, even as I grabbed Cornelia’s hair and pulled her down aggressively, until her lips were pressing against my shaft. Her gasp of pain was laced with pleasure, and her lips opened immediately, licking and sucking. Still, even as she enjoyed the fullness of her mouth, her eyes stayed on Helga and me, showing her attention to the topic of discussion.</p><p>What a good way to handle a strategy meeting, I thought.</p><p>“But it’s hard to set up a reliable defense with only a quarter of our mana,” Helga said.</p><p>“It’ll not be the case once I finish with you two,” I said, flaring my mana at the same time to fill Cornelia’s mouth with energy noticeably, turning that to experience. Cornelia was near the limit of my empowerment, but luckily, there was still a margin to strengthen Helga. Four levels is not exactly a simple power-up, especially when it brought the target from eighteen to twenty-two.</p><p>[-1493 Mana]</p><p>Interestingly, the jump between twenty-one to twenty-two wasn’t something that was directly enabled by the system. If I stayed limited to that, twenty-one was my limit at my current level, due to the so-called fifty percent level difference, requiring me to be level thirty-three to power them to twenty-two.</p><p>Only thanks to some of the tricks I developed by examining Titania’s level structure and the headmistress’ tricks to contain the divine energy, I managed to push the barrier a bit more.</p><p>Trying to make my girls even stronger wasn’t the only reason for my experimentation, however. The more I learned about the system, the more my suspicions were growing, both about the system in general, and my own variant in particular, so learning to override some of its restrictions and developing some tricks wasn’t the stupidest strategy.</p><p>“So, what’s the next part of the plan?” Helga asked even as her fingers traveled down to wrap around my balls, massaging gently.</p><p>“If my guess about his personality is correct, he’ll find some reasons to tire you out, either some kind of hunt, or otherwise, some dangerous activity. First, you need to make sure you never split up, no matter the reason he gives. Second, try to argue against his reasons to exhaust you, but ultimately give your reluctant acceptance.”</p><p>“Why?” Cornelia asked, surprised at the direction.</p><p>“The same reason I asked you not to spend more than a quarter of your mana while setting up the wards. You want to sell the impression of weakness. He’ll try to overestimate your mana reserves, but there’s no chance that even his optimistic assumptions could gauge your true potential. Not after the enchantments, you two have worked so hard for,” I added, the last part with a smirk even as I grabbed Cornelia’s hair, sinking her back to my shaft, her throat wrapping around aggressively, working enthusiastically for some more enchantments.</p><p>“Right,” Helga said with a chuckle even as she pressed her lips on my neck for a fleeting kiss. “We worked so hard for our power.” After a few more kisses, she continued. “What’s next.”</p><p>“Actually, there’s no more to it. I want you two to stay on the defensive all the time. I don’t know what kind of challenge awaited me during this horrible mess, but I should be able to find an opportunity to visit you two in a week or two at the worst. You’ll be far away, but with a full-power air elemental, I can still handle the travel in several hours, half a day at worst. Once I’m there, I’ll investigate everything properly and resolve the issue.”</p><p>Cornelia said nothing, but the speed of her throat swallowing my girth was more than enough to show her appreciation.</p><p>I intentionally neglected to mention one possibility. That I could teleport to them instead of using a magical mount. But the results of the first attempt were still clear in my mind, pushing me even closer to death than I had ever imagined it to be possible.</p><p>Another attempt was definitely out of question without some serious magical experimentation unless it was another life-and-death situation.</p><p>“Seems simple enough,” Helga murmured before leaning forward, capturing my lips in a searing kiss, and while I was distracted by her kiss, she pushed me back and climbed on me. Cornelia pulled back, allowing her to slide in easily.</p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk remembering the last private time three of us shared, each second filled with their attempts to make each other pay. The last time, when Helga was able to take the first turn, she was busy sending smug looks at Cornelia, but this time, she was busy delivering a kiss to Cornelia.</p><p>I was really proud of their developing friendship.</p><p>Under different circumstances, I might have teased them together, trying to stress-test their developing friendship before they left for their dangerous mission, but after their latest display of cooperation, I decided to let it slide.</p><p>Cornelia’s enthusiasm told me that she was more than happy with that decision, though her enthusiasm jumped a considerable degree when my fingers landed on her body, showing the happiness awakened by my attention as I explored her beautiful curves.</p><p>Helga was not to be ignored, however. Her hips rose, before falling down with a renewed passion, the sound of flesh hitting flesh echoing in the room, mixing into my grunt, enough to make Marianne shuffle in her bed. She continued to sleep, however, while I rewarded Helga with another flood of mana, while paying attention to her soul space to transform it.</p><p>[-1973 Mana]</p><p>[Helga - Level 19/21 - 1%]</p><p>“Congratulations on your new level,” I said with a chuckle even as I grabbed her hips and lifted her. A second later, she was on the floor, on her hands and knees, ready for my invasion.</p><p>She wanted rough, I thought with a chuckle. Cornelia recognized the nature of my expression, being a subject of it more than once herself, and chuckled in amusement.</p><p>I had no problems giving her exactly what she wanted.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31 Experience: 493210 / 496000</p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324 / 6324 Mana: 2931 / 7750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration</p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 19/21]</p>",

Unlike Penny, Nancy was clever enough to understand how a private shoot, even in the middle of nowhere, could end with me on the other side of the camera.</p><p>Then, I noticed the beautiful glint in Penny’s eyes, realizing that I had been underestimating my busty blonde, mistaking her subtle acceptance for obtuseness. And if the quickness of her stand was any indicator, she was quite enthusiastic about what would follow.</p><p>Maybe she was impressed because I had defended her against Nancy’s tricks. Maybe her submissiveness was growing even quicker than I was expecting.</p><p>Either way, I was more than happy with the result. “Exactly,” I said. “Why don’t we start with a couple of pictures of you standing together,” I said. “You’re going to put a show for the majority of the day together, and it’s for the best if you can look natural,” I said.</p><p>Penny was quick to follow my order. Nancy was significantly slower, as if she was making a point of not listening to me, but since she followed the order but only a few seconds of delay, I let her do so.</p><p>Her earlier service earned her quite a bit of leeway, and it was her choice how to spend that.</p><p>I started snapping photos even as I asked them to take several poses, staying loyal to the angles that were more fitting to a warrior and a thief, mostly to warm up. “Keep moving,” I ordered soon after. “But pose however you feel comfortable.”</p><p>Penny reacted instantly. She might not be a natural model, but she was a great student of the art of sexiness, and her pose reflected that.</p><p>Nancy looked at her with a distinct distaste. I just smirked, focusing on Penny almost exclusively, and it didn’t take for Nancy’s distaste to be replaced by jealousy. She might not enjoy being forced to pose, but she hated being ignored distinctly more.</p><p>So, I wasn’t surprised when she turned her back for a moment, her hands moving suspiciously. And when she turned to face me once more, her cleavage had gone through a transformation, passing the border of sexiness to sink into the land of slutty, even skirting the edge of whorish.</p><p>That earned a frustrated look from Penny when she strolled in front of her, bending forward to enhance her sexiness even more. Unlike Penny, I was more than happy about the development, carefully recording the most spectacular instances as she moved into a sitting pose without prompting.</p><p>“Fantastic,” I murmured when Nancy grabbed another button of her thief costume, deepening her cleavage even further. “We might make a proper model out of you, yet.”</p><p>Penny looked lost for a moment. Unlike Nancy, her immediate reaction wasn’t to retaliate. But I didn’t want to order her directly, not wanting to blunt Nancy’s competitive instincts. Instead, I waited until Nancy was looking away before catching Penny’s eyes and gestured for her to walk behind Nancy, tapping my finger to my chest, signaling her to catch up with Nancy.</p><p>Penny caught a second wind the moment she received the order, taking a step forward even as her fingers reached her top, loosening her armor, making me lick my lips in anticipation as she stood behind Nancy, her hands on her shoulders.</p><p>Nancy looked up, not appreciating the close contact, but when her eyes caught the immensity of Penny’s cleavage, the reason for her annoyance flipped immediately.</p><p>“Your poise is amazing,” I said to Nancy. “If we work enough, maybe you can follow Penny’s footsteps and become a real model.” The backhanded compliment worked just as well as I hoped, and Nancy stood up while opening a few more buttons of her blouse.</p><p>Considering she was not wearing a bra, the resulting view was above spectacular.</p><p>“Beautiful,” I said, being completely honest. “Penny, why don’t you hug her from behind so that we can have a few interesting photos to give away with each successful sale.”</p><p>Nancy’s eyes widened at the realization, remembering that she wasn’t just posing in a public — albeit concealed — place but also she was being photographed for every single second of it. “I - I don’t feel comfortable using that to sell books,” she stammered, though the intensity of her blush suggested that it was less about her moral objections to using sexuality to sell her books, and more about the fact she was a part of the product.</p><p>“Could it be that you’re feeling shy?” I said with a smirk, with no problems to highlight her failure.</p><p>“N-no, of course not,” she answered predictably, so much that even Penny’s face had a wide smirk.</p><p>“Excellent,” I said with a smirk. “Then, we can have another break on the way, and have a proper shooting.” I gestured around. “A shitty waiting room is hardly the best setting for a warrior and a thief to mingle, right?”</p><p>Nancy’s silent fuming just widened my smirk. I left, and Penny followed immediately, not even bothering to fix her cleavage, which, while sexy, was still in the bounds of public decency. Nancy’s cleavage was certainly not, so she had to delay for a while before catching up, not helping her anger in any way.</p><p>We started driving once more. “I’m not sure about using those photos to sell books,” Nancy murmured a minute later. “What if it hurts my reputation as a writer?”</p><p>“All Hollywood directors use sexiness to sell their films. Are you saying that you’re better than every single one of them?” I countered, which was enough to silence her quite a bit. Not willing to continue arguing, Nancy reached for another book, continuing her task of signing all of them before we arrived at the convention center.</p><p>I put my weight on the gas, trying to gain some extra time. Not to arrive at the convention center any earlier, but to have some more time for our next stop. Nancy looked reluctant for it, but I had no intention of letting her get away from that trick.</p><p>But to do that, I needed her competitiveness properly awakened. Luckily, the road was empty, making it easy for me to drive the car with only one hand, the other landing on Penny’s lap, climbing up her thigh.</p><p>Her failed attempt to suppress a moan was all that needed to earn Nancy’s attention. She looked up, angry jealousy back in her face immediately.</p><p>I acted unaware of her attention even as my fingers crawled upward until they found the button of Penny’s pants, slipping inside to treat myself to her tempting body heat, making it rather difficult to keep my mind on the road.</p><p>Luckily, I soon noticed a side road, one that was leading to a little-known lake with an amazing view, though not known by most people. The only problem was the disgustingly bumpy road leading to it.</p><p>Under the circumstances, it was a nice advantage.</p><p>My fingers slipped into Penny’s panties, the bumpy road immediately elevating the experience to the next level for Penny, making it even more difficult for her to keep her moans in. “How about some music?” I said but turned it up before Nancy could answer, trying to make it look like I was hiding Penny’s reaction.</p><p>It was not a very convincing ploy, but luckily, Nancy was too distracted by her jealousy-tinged-anger to notice subtle details.</p><p>The country road leading to the lakeside wasn’t exactly short. The car bounced steadily on the way, and my fingers disappeared inside Penny, the combination enough to break her attempts to suppress her moans, loud enough to be heard even over the music.</p><p>Nancy might not appreciate the reasons for those moans, but that didn’t prevent her nipples from hardening in arousal, especially since she was feeling the rapid bounces even harder in the backseat. My shaft hardened painfully.</p><p>Luckily, Penny chose an excellent moment to show initiative, and her delicate hands reached for my zipper. A fumble later, my shaft was free. Its freedom lasted only for a second before it was imprisoned again, but Penny’s soft fingers were definitely the superior alternative.</p><p>A mutual handjob was definitely a good way to add color to a boring drive, especially since every single bounce on the road made Nancy’s tits jiggle on the back seat, leveraging her lack of a bra to the maximum benefit.</p><p>The combined assault of the amazing show and Penny’s soft touch was more than enough to turn my shaft into a steel rod, though Nancy’s angry frustration was just as delicious as the soft sensation. I continued to drive, enjoying the bumpy road — or, more accurately, the effect it had on the arousal of my two sexy passengers.</p><p>I could have driven harder, making Penny explode with arousal, but I didn’t.</p><p>I wanted them in just in the mood when we arrived at the lakeside.</p><p>Two minutes later, I finally stopped the car. “We’re here,” I said, gesturing toward the amazing view, and while they examined it, put my shaft back in my pants — no matter how uncomfortable it was.</p><p>“Put on your wigs, so we can take some character photos,” I said with a big smirk, ready for the spectacular show that was about to come.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I said nothing as I walked through the corridor, my expression stiff enough to earn some hesitant glare from the other tournament participants. Even the people I had played before looked at me with a mixture of distaste and hostility. </p><p>All due to my intimidating appearance. </p><p>I wasn’t annoyed by their hostility and fear. Why should I, when I had carefully curated my appearance and reputation in the chess circle carefully to maximize the emotional effect? After all, even with all the time I sank into playing chess, I was only a decent player in terms of competition. </p><p>And while I doubted the intimidation effect would help against the real professionals, college chess players were much less stable emotionally, especially in a state in the middle of America, where chess was hardly the most favorable target. </p><p>The tactic worked even better with my focus. I exclusively competed on Blitz, meaning rather than each game lasting hours, they were restricted to five minutes to each side. With the time restriction, my opponents rarely had the time to adapt to my tricks before they made a mistake, maybe a knight advantage, or a couple of extra pawns in the mid-game. </p><p>After that, it was easy to sweep the game. </p><p>Of course, that hardly helped my reputation in the chess circles, not that I cared much. I was here not for the love of the game, but for my scholarship. Nothing more. </p><p>However, this time, it was much harder to keep my expression stiff, thanks to my mysterious guide. “What’s a nerd?” she asked as she floated next to me. Pity that she was invisible, because I had a feeling that half of the room would have been too interested in her curves to put a decent game, allowing me to win easily. </p><p>“It’s an insult for the scholars, by more physically inclined people,” I murmured from under my breath, trying to look like I was trying to psyche myself before the tournament rather than talking to an imaginary friend. </p><p>“But why?” she asked, shocked. “A warrior requires both the body and the mind to achieve excellence. Even that brute Ares was smart enough to understand combat is not about muscles and shouting despite his abysmal reputation.” </p><p>“People are weird,” I said with a shrug, once again ignoring her casual name dropping off another Greek god. </p><p>It was not the time to delve into it. </p><p>I sat on the corner, deliberately grunting to anyone that dared to sit next to me. The black muscle shirt I put on, revealing the flame tattoos covered my right forearm perfectly, making their hesitancy even higher. </p><p>“What kind of game is this?” my guide asked a while later, however, ruining my plan to focus on my intimidating visage. I tried to ignore her, but she proved her inability to catch subtext by repeating the question twice, with increasing loudness, which made me abandon that plan. </p><p>Instead, I stood up, walking around while whispering under my breath, quickly explaining the rules. </p><p>“I see, it’s like shatranj, like the game famous in Antioch,” she said in enthusiasm. “Though the rules are quite a bit different. Do you want me to help you? I’m quite good,” she said. </p><p>“It wouldn’t be fair,” I said, though my response was less about the fairness, and more about the cute sexiness she displayed as she declared her competency. I could easily imagine someone intentionally losing her to keep that smile on. </p><p>“You’re right,” she said with a blush. </p><p>“I need to focus on the game. Please try to be silent,” I asked her, and earned a nod in response. </p><p>I returned to the main area with ample time, giving me enough time to examine the tournament schedule, identifying my opponents, just enough time to ‘accidentally’ walk around them, maybe even accidental collision or two if I could squeeze in. </p><p>All was fairly in love and war, after all. </p><p>I took my seat five minutes before the match, sitting on my chair with a stiff, stony expression. My opponent came a minute before the match, but hesitated before sitting, his eyes already looking for a referee. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, looking naturally scary was not one of the rules. </p><p>Everyone took their seats, before the announcer made a quick speech, declaring that the Blitz portion of the second chess tournament of Sunset College — my dear, aptly named college — had begun. </p><p>I was black, so I waited until my opponent moved his kingside pawn two steps, taking e4, a classical, safe approach. I would have moved my queenside pawn in the response under normal conditions, an aggressive yet conventional move. </p><p>Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to hide the tremble on his finger. </p><p>Smelling blood in the water, I immediately moved my pawn from the wings, and when he responded by adding another point to the center, I smirked even as I moved my knight to the side, committing deeper into a side attack.</p><p>He moved his knight behind the defensive line he had established, staking the control of the center. Admittedly, it wasn’t a bad strategy. Holding the center was almost always the best choice, giving the best defensive position without curtailing offensive options. </p><p>Too bad for him that I had pushed my knight forward in aggression that would have been pointless under the normal circumstances, exchanging for equal value, but leaving his position better. Since he played white for this turn, starting him with the advantage, it was a considerable difference. </p><p>All he needed was to push his queen forward, leveraging his positional advantage. To his credit, despite his surprise at my over-aggressive play, he reached toward his queen, ready to launch that exact movement. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, I was just opening my bag of tricks. Just as he was about to touch the queen, I hit him with a vicious smirk, the kind that actually managed to intimidate junkies looking for a soft target back in the street. </p><p>A little soft nerd trying to make his mark through a chess tournament had no chance. </p><p>Instinctively, he reached for his bishop, shifting to a defensive play. I moved my bishop upwards, ignoring his attempts to set up a defensive territory, directly into his main area, unsettling his efforts to set up a defense. </p><p>He pulled his knight, reflexively trying to reinforce the same area I had forcibly weakened, giving me the mistake I was searching for. </p><p>My queen dashed forward, checking his king. He retreated, but not without a cost, losing a knight in response. It wasn’t an unrecoverable position. On the contrary, if we were playing classical chess, he would have ample time to find a solution to punish my excessive aggression. Unfortunately for him, he had neither the time nor the composure needed to do so, losing the first game after three more moves. </p><p>“Shall we start the second one?” I asked. The tournament was best of six to allow each side to start equal amounts, moving to tie-break games in case of a draw. </p><p>After every game, players could take a five minutes break, but when I asked the question, my voice was more of a growl, threatening him more. </p><p>“S-sure,” he stammered, which was clearly the worse choice. We started the second game, and this time, I pushed my king-side pawn forward, a much more balanced move. </p><p>His response was telling. He pushed his knight forward immediately, one of the more defensive variations he could use, trying to defend himself against my aggression. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, there was no aggression coming. I used his hesitancy to casually expand into the mid-game, establishing board control before he could realize what happened. After twenty moves, we only exchanged four pawns, and one knight to a bishop, but he was squeezed into his side of the board. </p><p>With the strategic advantage on me, I could have pushed for another quick victory, but why would I do so, when I could grind my opponent’s mind. The game lasted more than eighty moves, costing each of us almost all of our stones, but when the game ended, I was smirking viciously like an assassin, while my opponent was breathing hard, trembling. </p><p>“The third game?” I asked. </p><p>“N-no need,” he said as he stood up, trembling, unbalanced enough for his chair to tumble back, earning a warning from the referee. “I give up.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I stood back, raising my hand to squeeze his, only to earn a nasty glare. Not that I blamed him. He was shaking badly. I started walking away, enjoying the sudden whisper exploding around the viewer area. </p><p>“The assassin struck again,” said one of them. </p><p>“The assassin?” whispered his friend. “What kind of nickname is that?” </p><p>“He joined the scene the last year,” said the first one. “I don’t know where they found the monster, but he’s a menace.”</p><p>“Is he that good?” </p><p>“Not really. He mostly reached the quarterfinals. He only has one semifinal, and it was mostly luck.” </p><p>“Why the nickname then?” </p><p>“He literally kills the weaker players. I heard that four players actually stopped attending tournaments after losing to him-” he explained. </p><p>I missed the rest of his whispering explanation, but not because he stopped suddenly. No, a sudden line of writing appeared on my line of sight. </p><p>[Pattern Recognition I, acquired]</p><p>[Intimidation I, acquired]</p><p>I looked to my right, but I didn’t need to see the proud expression of my guide to guess the source of it. </p><p>I dashed toward the bathroom, not from a need, but to ask for an explanation. And I needed somewhere silent. </p><p>Because I didn’t trust myself to keep my voice low.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I wished that I had been woken up by the annoying blare of my alarm, no matter how much I hated its distinct cry. That way, at least, I would have a minute to convince myself the existence of a blonde, sexy angel clad in white leather, displaying a deep cleavage to contrast with the scary depths of her power was just a figment of my imagination, an out-of-control dream thanks to some excess alcohol. </p><p>But no, I didn’t wake up from the annoying blare of my alarm. Instead, I woke up with a gentle poke. And while that could have been written it off as one of the rare times I had managed to arrange a one-night-stand — which was difficult to achieve with old clothes, little disposable income, not to mention my reputation — and my date was waking me for a breakfast, the following sound was much harder to rationalize. </p><p>“It’s morning, Chosen,” said a perfectly melodious voice. “Please wake up.” </p><p>At least that annoying epic echo no longer came with her tone, I thought even as I opened my eyes, enjoying the sight of a cleavage pressing too close to my face, still clad in leather. </p><p>Well, at least there were perks to the situation. </p><p>“Good morning,” I answered, even as I stood up. “Isn’t it a bit early, though?” I asked as I checked my phone, showing that it was barely six. </p><p>She looked sad. “You said you had an important task in the morning, and I wanted to…” she said, her disappointment clear. </p><p>“For gods-“ I started, only for my words to melt halfway. Yeah, it wasn’t the best curse to use on the situation, and cursing an enthusiastic supernatural being for being helpful was another stupid idea. </p><p>Maybe I should think of her as the silly daughter of a gang boss, her cheerfulness not making her any less dangerous. “It’s not the custom to wake up that early in the morning anymore,” I said. She looked confused. </p><p>“Why?” she asked. </p><p>“People use machines to farm, so most farmers work different jobs,” I said. She looked like she wanted to ask a follow-up question, but before she could do so, I stood up, walking to the bathroom. Explaining the difference between the farming communities and city communities after the industrial revolution was a heavy topic for the first minutes of the day. </p><p>Luckily, she didn’t follow me to the bathroom, allowing me to wash my face in peace, my thoughts struggling to start with the help of the cold water. </p><p>Accepting what had happened was hard, so I did whatever I faced as a difficult challenge. I locked it in the back of my head, and focused on the present. </p><p>Namely, the tournament I had to compete in. I wished that I could blow it off, but the only thing I could afford barely afford college was my partial sports scholarship, making skipping a tournament a bad choice, even with all the baggage that came with the existence of the supernatural. </p><p>Focus on the present. Always the best move. </p><p>The angel was waiting for me to arrive in the bedroom, her expression back into pure enthusiasm. “By the way, I forget to ask the last night. What’s your name?” </p><p>“I’m…” she started, only to stop, but the confused surprise on her face suggested her stop might not be voluntary. “My name is…” she murmured, looking even more confused. </p><p>“So, how exactly we can make this system work?” I asked immediately, distracting her. </p><p>Something was clearly wrong as she failed to immediately remember her name, and distracting her from that stress looked like a smart decision, at least until I could get a better understanding of the situation. So, I brought the topic back to the only area she actively tried to talk about. </p><p>Her so-called system. </p><p>“It’s very simple,” she said with enthusiasm immediately. “The core acts as a focal point for the … Intent of the devout, gathering as a core, which will then slowly grow into unique godly powers, thematically linked to the intent of the devout. The stronger Intent, the stronger Divine Traits.” </p><p>“Sounds simple enough,” I murmured. And it was so, in theory, though as a poor, nineteen years old engineering student, I certainly was a horrible person to start a cult. </p><p>And that was only if I decided to embrace that ridiculous idea of starting a cult for power, which wasn’t exactly given at this point. </p><p>“Yes, we just need to decide on a fitting theme to make sure…” she murmured, but her words faded, eerily similar to the time she had forgotten her name. But this time, she just smiled, like she didn’t even realize she had stopped halfway. </p><p>Perfect, I thought with sudden tenseness. Not only do I have an air-headed sexy guide trying to make me start an actual cult, but also she was clearly compromised. She tried to give me a warning, but she clearly forget it halfway, so much that, when I started changing, she said nothing, just returned examining various devices with great interest, but only from a distance. </p><p>It didn’t change when we left the dorm and started walking outside. She just followed, like she had finished every single thing she wanted to explain about the subject of the Divine. </p><p>I started walking, the nameless angel floating next to me, still examining her surroundings with great enthusiasm, though not as surprised as the night before. </p><p>Luckily, she didn’t ask any questions. After her reaction to Zeus, I didn’t want to explain to her that everything she was seeing was working by what was essentially trapped lightning. Maybe she would find it humorous. </p><p>Maybe not… </p><p>Still, I appreciated her silence to take a long walk around the campus, trying to process the new potential of my life — and failing to do so. </p><p>And it was hard. </p><p>Two hours later, in front of the convention center, I was still trying to get into grips with it. Before I could enter, however, a car drove by with great speed, giving a little quintessential college picture. Red convertible, a black-haired guy behind the wheel, and a blonde girl wearing a low top, both cheering in enthusiasm. </p><p>I would have ignored them after a momentary glance, but then they slowed down near the convention center, and started egging the entrance. I was quick to react, the others trying to enter the convention center, less so. “Nerds!” he shouted loudly as he threw the last egg. </p><p>Fucking frat boys, I thought, my intent clearly mirrored by the other participants of the tournament, but that didn’t prevent them from looking at me with the same anger. “Are you going to throw ketchup on us?” growled a raven-haired girl even as she tried to clean splatters from her windbreakers. </p><p>“Nope,” I said with a shrug, used to the response. “I’m here for the tournament as well.” </p><p>“Yeah, you’re an excellent example of a chess player,” she growled. </p><p>“Hey, it’s not like there’s a uniform,” I answered, but before she could answer, I get past her. </p><p>She was right. Six foot three, and relatively muscled — at least compared to the rest of the crowd, half of it looking frail enough to collapse from lifting more than three books — I looked more like a football player trying to fill a pledge than a chess player. </p><p>Accurate, considering I was only here because I wasn’t able to get a scholarship as a football player. </p><p>I was strong, but certainly not strong enough to make a lineman, trying to block a two-hundred-sixty pound athletic giant from trying to kill our quarterback. Not even close. I had a decent speed, but not enough to be a cornerback to prevent a four-five guy from slipping from my control for an easy touchdown. Nor I had the aim and the processing abilities of a quarterback. I played linebacker in high school, but unfortunately, my competition was physically more impressive. A bit faster, a bit stronger, enough for the scouts to ignore me in favor of them.</p><p>Maybe, if I had enough excess income to slip a couple of gifts to the scouts it might have been different, but unfortunately, an under-the-table part-time job didn’t pay enough to bribe a scout. </p><p>Hence, no full-ride sports scholarship for me, which was the most viable way of getting a college education, the only option I had to make myself a life where a bullet wasn’t a likely ending. </p><p>So, I turned to back to chess. I wasn’t a complete amateur. As I child, I used trick plays to hustle the tourists for a few dollars, who were readily impressed by the chess skill of a kid. Unfortunately, it lasted only until my growth spurt hit, replacing the cuteness of childhood with the awkwardness of adolescence. </p><p>Without money, I dropped playing, only to pick it back as a high school junior, this time trying to impress the college recruiters with my intelligence. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a moron, but I’m not a genius either. I had decent grades. Unfortunately, a lot of time and a stable home were needed for someone with my limited potential to convert those decent scores to elite, two factors I lacked. </p><p>Luckily for me, a lot of people assume chess reflects pure intelligence, ignoring the pure repetition that went to it like any sport. I used it to dazzle recruiters with my ‘intelligence’, though my college offering an actual scholarship to cover most of my tuition fees was highly surprising. </p><p>I later learned that the only reason they had done so was their reputation, which was not only firmly established as a party college, but quickly turning into a total dumpster of intellectual disgrace. So, the dean decided to hastily put together a chess team, good enough not to embarrass the school. </p><p>Which wasn’t working as intended, with the frat guys making a routine point of egging the tournament locations. </p><p>Not that I cared. It allowed me to attend college. </p><p>I stepped into the conference center, ready for another day of slog to earn my scholarship, which was conditional for me holding a top-fifty ranking in the state among the college level. </p><p>It was time to fight, one way or another.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The chill of the night hit mercilessly as I left the building. </p><p>There was no one around, which was not surprising. The museum was located in a forgotten corner of the university — which, considering the campus was located in the middle of the nowhere in America, two hours of drive away from the closest city, reflected the true meaning of desolate. </p><p>Around the museum, there were a few other educational buildings, of course, like the library, but the students rarely visited those places, more interested in frequenting the frat houses and college bars to see how close they could come to alcohol poisoning rather than studying. Party college was the perfect description for this place, and only two things mattered for the majority of the students. </p><p>Partying, and the football. </p><p>I walked on the pavement, half of the lights broken, hating the silence. The inner city was a tough place to grow up as an orphan, with all the mess of constant street fights, shouting marital arguments, streetwalkers trying to find their Johns, and the constant traffic… </p><p>Ironically, after a while, all that noise melts into the background like the throbbing of a heartbeat, allowing any resident to understand the ebbs and flows of the city life. If you lived in the inner city, you loved the constant noise, because it worked as an early alarm system, any change of pace warning you to be careful. </p><p>And the worst thing to experience back in the city was the silence. Nothing good happened when a city got silent. </p><p>So, whenever I walked on the campus during the night, I was tense, expecting a disaster that would not happen. </p><p>Luckily — and wasn’t that an ironic use of the word — I had something to focus on tonight. An incorporeal — and possibly hallucinatory — angel floating near me, with all the enthusiasm of a tourist, examining the light streaming down from the street lamps. </p><p>“How amazing,” she gasped gleefully as she floated toward the nearest lamp. Which gave me an amazing view of her incorporeal hips, clapped tightly with her leather pants, making my own pants equally tight. Though, her words were more than enough to keep me focused at the moment. “I can’t believe the magic developed that much in a few years, cores everywhere just to keep an empty street illuminated. And their crafting is amazing. I can’t feel even a flicker of magic radiating out.” </p><p>I thought about explaining that they were not magic, but then decided against them. Still, I found her comment useful, because it implied that she couldn’t somehow access my brain effortlessly to pull the information she needed — I hoped. </p><p>A couple of cars had passed since we had left the museum, but none of them even slowed down. Considering the sight of a floating winged person that looked like she had lost her way on the way of a naughty photoshoot would have been enough to earn some gawking stares — or at least, a few quick photos to earn some social media reactions — it wasn’t hard to assume I was the only one I could see her. I didn’t want to be identified as a crazy person talking to himself in the middle of the night. </p><p>Although, whether such a description wouldn’t have been accurate was another thing. Rationally, the only explanation was that she was a fidget of my imagination, as a result of whatever weird shit had tainted one of the discarded historical items I had acquired somehow drugging me. </p><p>Interestingly, despite being against the only reasonable explanation, I didn’t believe her to be an illusion. I had no real reason for it, nothing more than my instincts. </p><p>However, those instincts definitely saved my life again and again in the past, when I was struggling like a little orphan hustler in the jungle of the inner city, and I trusted them much more than any incompetent doctor or psychologist that worked for a third-rate party college. </p><p>I walked silently, watching the sexy angel flying around, examining the weirdest things, fascinated by the crushed cans of coke — for their exquisite forging and finishing — discarded piles of papers, and other trash, more than she was fascinated by the actual buildings or even cars — other than a fleeting glance. </p><p>She chirped around, seemingly uncaring of my silence even once for the ten minutes walk between my dorm and the museum. In the process, however, I did notice one interesting detail. She had never moved more than fifty feet away from me. Whether she couldn’t, or preferred not to, was a question I wondered. </p><p>I was lucky not to have a roommate, because the room was barely big enough for me — well, me and the ethereal erotic angel unable to touch anything but me. “So,” I murmured, taking the attention of my new hyperactive guest. </p><p>“So, you were about to tell me about the Divine System?” I prompted, finally allowing her to speak after the walk helped me to center myself. </p><p>“Yes,” she said with clear enthusiasm, which was in great contrast to her earlier reluctance to talk about herself. “The Divine System is a gift from the Great Realm of the Light, beyond the Boundary, gifting the mortal races power to stand against the Great Darkness. It acts a focal core for the creation of the divine entities.” </p><p>Ironically, the first thing I noticed about her statement was a mysterious realm, ‘gifting’ a lower realm with something valuable. If there was one thing I had learned to live as an orphan trying to thrive in a dangerous environment, it was never to trust the powerful. </p><p>Especially when they were bearing gifts. </p><p>However, criticizing the bosses of a mysterious sexy angel was hardly the smartest thing to do when I was trying to get some information from her. “Divine entities, like God, or like Zeus?” I asked. She frowned at my question, and I suddenly felt a chill. It wasn’t like the frozen feeling I had received when I touched that mysterious orb. It was far more similar to the time I had collided with one of the gang leaders when I was dashing around as a child. </p><p>It was the feeling of being the target of someone else’s annoyance. Someone far stronger. </p><p>Idiot, I thought, cursing myself in my thoughts. Referring to pagan gods in front of an angel — even if the said angel was had a more risque design than the official church dogma — was sheer idiocy. Unfortunately, watching her examine weird little mundane objects while commenting on their excellent magical crafting went a long way to make me ignore her supernatural nature, and a mysterious power that made me feel the chill of the death just because she was annoyed.</p><p>And she wasn’t even trying to be threatening, like that gang leader had been when I collided. No, she was slightly annoyed. </p><p>Good going, Terry. </p><p>Luckily, her frustration only lasted a second, disappearing immediately. “Don’t mention that jerk to me,” she said, though this time, her frustration reminding me of a sorority girl lashing out against a handsy football player rather than the righteous fury of a supposed angel, the earlier threatening aura disappearing.</p><p>“Z-, the lightning guy?” I stammered, barely correcting my statement halfway after another flicker of threatening frustration. </p><p>Her nod certainly didn’t help my confusion any. I certainly wasn’t expecting that my mysterious angel companion to confirm both the existence of mythological Greek gods and reveal some kind of personal connection. </p><p>Just the realization I needed to make the night even more incomprehensible. </p><p>“Right,” I murmured. Hundreds of questions burst into my mind about the history of the world, an understanding that she destroyed by an offhand comment. I wouldn’t classify myself as a history enthusiast, but — reluctantly — working for the museum, I did have a solid understanding of it. </p><p>Or what I thought as a solid understanding, before an offhand comment threatened to destroy every single thing I had known about it. </p><p>And when one had too many questions, it was hard to decide to ask the first one. So, I skipped all of them about the history, focusing back on the mysterious system. “And how does this Divine System works?” </p><p>“The Divine System provides a gathering point for the prayers of the worshipers, and the transference of the acolytes,” she explained. </p><p>“And I need to make people worship me, like a-“ I stammered, only to stop at the last moment. I was about to say a deranged cult leader, but maybe, it was not the smartest way to describe that to her. </p><p>I was getting really, really tired. </p><p>“Yes, like a demigod, or even a god, if you can establish a proper temple,” she explained cheerfully. </p><p>Excellent, I couldn’t wait to tell people that I was being ordained as a cult leader, by an angel that looked like she was about to leave for her day job as a high-class dominatrix. I couldn’t imagine it going wrong. </p><p>At all. </p><p>“Should we go out and start?” she exclaimed, unable to hide her enthusiasm. </p><p>“Maybe tomorrow afternoon. I have a big day tomorrow,” I murmured. </p><p>“Oh, really? Okay,” she answered, her wings dipping down along with her enthusiasm, making me feel bad for my words, like I had just told a child that Santa didn’t exist. </p><p>It wasn’t technically a lie, but I was more interested in its nature as an excuse to reject the request of my ‘guide’ to establish a cult in the middle of the night, without annoying her in the process. </p><p>Angering a mysteriously powerful, obviously supernatural existence by directly rejecting her plan was not the smartest idea. She looked silly and sexy, but I distinctly remembered the threatening aura that almost drowned me just because of the slight annoyance she felt. </p><p>I turned off the lights, but despite the pulled-off curtains, the room was still illuminated, in the form of a soft inner glow from the wings of the angel. </p><p>Maybe I should ask her to turn off her lights, I thought with a smirk even as I turned my back, the sleep taking me rather easily. This might have been surprising to someone else, but I had managed to sleep through many gunfights throughout my childhood. </p><p>The light from a magic angel was nothing I couldn’t handle…</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was a long night, and I was working hard at my job in the museum. It was not Louvre, of course, nor it was the National Gallery, the British Museum, or any other museum where the name would create a glimmer of familiarity on a passerby. Or even an expert. It wasn’t even one that would earn its place in the city guides, hoping to scam a few dollars from any tourist that might have lost their way into the middle of nowhere. </p><p>No, the nameless museum I was working for was little more than a glorified storage room for the shitty university I was also a student of, trying to work my way into an engineering degree. Every single item in the storage room was rejected by several other institutions due to their sheer unremarkability. </p><p>None of the items were deemed important or significant by any shape or form. The current batch I had been assessing, in particular, came from the basement of some kind of tomb in the middle of nowhere in Europe, only significant due to their smell, somehow moldy and dusty at the same time. </p><p>At least, I assumed so, until I pulled a brass orb from one of the boxes, only to feel the most spectacular jolt of the pain of my life. Nothing even came close, not even the time I shattered my leg in five places when I was nine, the car I was in had been blindsided aggressively. </p><p>Only to feel the great jolt of pain radiating into my body. I tried to open my fingers, but it proved to be impossible, my fingers refusing to follow my orders. </p><p>Or, more accurately, they decided to follow the opposite of my order, and started to close on, worrying me that somehow, I would end up in broken fingers — certainly not something I could afford by an orphan in America with absolutely no social security net, trying to put myself through the college. </p><p>My fingers didn’t break despite their worrying movement trend, but the significance of my continued health was lost when my fingers started sinking into the brass orb. Or more accurately, what had been a brass orb, but rapidly turning into some kind of metallic liquid, seeping into my skin. </p><p>I expected the pain to worsen, maybe to a terminal level, but instead, a chill covered my body, as something icy seeped under my body, weird and uncomfortable. I lay on the floor, shivering helplessly. </p><p>I didn’t know for how long I trembled, but I would have collapsed on the floor if it wasn’t for a distinctive voice. “You have been chosen for a great destiny, mortal,” said a voice. It was hard to describe it, as the mixture of a rock concert and a sexy chat-up line. </p><p>I opened my eyes, only to see a floating angel in front of me. </p><p>Or more accurately, a weird, horny approximation of an angel, decked in white leather that left a lot of cleavage, floating in front of me, like the live-action movie version of one of the hentai games, the kind that would have been played by one of the young bimbo blonde models at the peak of their career. </p><p>“I beg your pardon?” I managed to stammer despite the uncomfortable sensation. Admittedly, it wasn’t the best thing to say after being confronted by the late-night cable adult version of the divine, but in my defense, I was already exhausted before the weird torture I had just suffered. </p><p>The angel looked down on me, her beautiful face melting into a soft expression. “I said that you have been chosen to rise to the ranks of the divine, to be a bulwark against the darkness,” she explained, though, as she spoke, her voice slowly lost its confusing ethereal quality. Don’t get me wrong, it was still not a sound a human could make without spending a lot of money for the special effects budget. </p><p>“Okay,” I murmured, unable to stem my confusion — and if I had to be honest, the arousal I was feeling was hardly making the things any easier, which was very hard to stop when faced the incredible mixture of a sexy dominatrix and an innocent beauty, even if the said beauty had actual wings. </p><p>Like white, fluffy wings, the most ridiculous depiction of an angel, which was ridiculous even for a nonbeliever — theoretically agnostic, but practically atheist — like me. </p><p>“Let’s go!” said the angel with a cheerful voice before she prepared to turn, and only then, I noticed her wings passing through the walls like they weren’t there. </p><p>“Hey, wait a minute, are you a hallucination?” I said suddenly. “Why can your wings pass through the walls?” </p><p>“N-no,” she said, her blue eyes suddenly avoiding mine. </p><p>“Really?” I said, unable to prevent a suspicious frown from appearing on my face. </p><p>“No,” she repeated, but once again, her tone was less convincing than a child interrogated about missing cookies despite the impressive echo of her tone. </p><p>“But…” I said silently. Spending a significant part of my life trying to survive by my wits, I had developed a decent sense against lies of omission, and the mysterious erotic angel that had been appeared in front of me was triggering all of them successfully. </p><p>“I-I’m a guide assigned to help your divine journey,” she murmured. “A messenger.” </p><p>“And…” I continued, even as I stood up. The weird sensation that covered my skin slowly disappeared, letting me take back control of my body. I stood up, putting my eye line closer to the mysterious figure in front of me. </p><p>“And my visage is determined at the moment of bonding, based on the understanding and the perception of the Divine Candidate,” she explained. I could have pushed her more, but she seemed to be tense already. </p><p>I nodded, noting her relaxation. The rational thing was to say that she was a hallucination, of course, but both the sensation of the pain, and the following chilly sensation were too weird, almost ethereal. </p><p>If she was a hallucination, there was no benefit of pushing her any case, and if she wasn’t a hallucination, there was no point in antagonizing her. Either way, I decided not to push her even more. Instead, I stayed on the aspect of what she already mentioned. “So, your looks are based on my mind. Can you read my mind?” </p><p>“It’s not one of my abilities,” she said. “It’s an automatic response of the Divine System, based on a reading of your subconsciousness. I’m just a Divine Guide, tasked to help your transition.” </p><p>Well, that answered it, I thought ironically. As a horny bastard, and as a nonbeliever, I wasn’t exactly surprised that my subconsciousness had come up with such a wet-dream scenario. If one was to be confronted to be supernatural, at least it might also function as an eye candy, which, ironically, was the case whether she was real or just a hallucination. </p><p>And she was definitely eye candy, a busty, sexy blonde clad in bleached leather, her blonde hair sprawling beautifully like she had just spent hours in a hairdresser, natural yet perfect at the same time. </p><p>“Would you mind explaining what’s the Divine System, then?” </p><p>“Of course,” she answered, her enthusiasm immediately drowning her earlier hesitation. It seemed that, unlike the questions about her nature, she was more than happy talking about this so-called Divine System. “It is-“ she started, only for me to silence her with a gesture. </p><p>“I feel the explanation is going to take a long time,” I said, which earned a nod in response. A nod that made her illusionary assets shake most emphatically, enough to make me bite my lips. “So, it’s best if I return to my room before we start.” </p><p>“It would be nice to catch the sight of the Earth once again,” she said enthusiastically. </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I turned my back, quickly putting the boxes in place and turning off the computer I was using to enter the stock. However, my attention was in the curious way of her phrasing, showing enthusiasm about seeing the Earth again. </p><p>Which implied that she was not from here, yet she had been here before. </p><p>How curious…</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Gate, I thought even as my body tensed, like I hadn’t had enough to deal with. Fucking old council fogies. If it wasn’t for their overwhelming enthusiasm to punish me, I would have no need to visit that horrible place. </p><p>My first destination wasn’t the Gate, however. No, I first went to my apartment to make some preparation. You start by preparing for the trip extensively, making sure everything was in order. </p><p>My preparation started with preparing a good meal before I started picking up my weapons. I pulled a steak from the freezer, magic dancing on the surface. Thigh meat of a colossal chimera, one of the rare magical luxuries I was able to get in my home dimension. </p><p>Ironically, acquired in the Gate. </p><p>The Gate was a curious location. It was a place, but only in a very loose definition of a palace. A more accurate definition was that it was a wound. A penetrative, rough wound on the soul of the Earth, a remnant of an old war three thousand years ago, the same war that had resulted in the collapse of the great magical civilization of Earth. Hittites, Mycenaeans, Assyrians, and great independent Mesopotamian cities with their Sorcerer-Kings. Only Egypt survived among the great magical kingdoms, but with most of their great priests fallen, and the providence of their Pharaohs depleted. </p><p>Ironically, trying to cure the great wound consumed those kingdoms more than the battle itself. But compared to leaving a gaping entrance to the Beyond, the collapse was the preferable alternative. </p><p>The Gate was the result of closing the wound, one of the greatest band-aids that were ever designed. </p><p>The band-aid reference was deliberate. Like a band-aid, it didn’t cure the wound, nor did it isolate the wound perfectly. It just added a layer of protection, preventing simple incursions from the Beyond from happening. However, unlike an ordinary band-aid, the Gate existed in multiple dimensions, stitching every existence of the wound simultaneously. </p><p>And as a side effect, it created conceptual thinness on Earth, allowing magic-sensitive people to step through the weak spots to the Gate. The magical equivalent of a global transportation hub.</p><p>Unfortunately, that hub was built a wound leading to the Beyond, meaning while it was fast, it was hardly the safest location. Therefore, only the most desperate of the magical creatures and the most helpless of the magic users used the Gate for the purposes of travel, both between different locations on Earth, and to the different dimensions. </p><p>Unfortunately, one trait of human civilization was shared across every single sentient life form, both natural and unnatural. Once the desperate gathered to one place, the parasites trying to abuse them were not too far away. </p><p>According to the historical records, it took almost no time for the Gate to transform from a desperate travel method to the single biggest illegal magical market of Earth. From there, its transformation into an extremely dangerous magical ghetto where a wrong turn or a wrong word could cost its participants more than their life, was a natural evolution. </p><p>It didn’t burst into total chaos, only because some of the more infamous creatures decided that the existence of a natural market might be beneficial for their operations. While the Council officially disapproved of the existence of such marketplaces with a standing order for their extermination, I personally knew three members unofficially getting very substantial bribes from such ‘illegal’ locations in exchange for protection. </p><p>I didn’t know the Gate had a similar arrangement, but I had no reason to believe otherwise. </p><p>However, the illegal links didn’t mean that I, as an official council sorcerer — albeit one with the status of an exile — had any kind of preferential treatment. On the contrary, it might very well be the opposite, depending on the identity of the theoretical supporter of the market. Though, that was a pointless gesture, because I wouldn’t dare to visit that place under my real identity. </p><p>My presence there was enough for instant execution, for violating the terms of my exile. I could only visit there under disguise. </p><p>However, before I went to my wardrobe, I stayed in my kitchen, cooking the Chimera steak to medium-well. Unfortunately, my cooking was hardly a match for a dedicated magical chef, nor I did have some of the traditional side dishes. A can of diet coke was hardly a replacement for a thousand-year-old magical wine, after all. I enjoyed the unique texture of the steak nonetheless, savoring each bite. </p><p>A magical steak, even a low-quality one that I cooked myself, was a rare pleasure, the one I intended to enjoy, especially before a dangerous trip.  </p><p>By the time I was done eating, I could feel the additional magic flowing in my veins. The reason I decided to eat such a rare delicacy in a relative hurry in the middle of the day. The extra magic was hardly a considerable upgrade compared to my reserves, of course, but that didn’t change the biggest benefit of it. It was magic, coming from a foreign source. </p><p>Exactly what I needed to properly conceal my identity. </p><p>I closed my eyes, focusing on the steak that was being digested, extracting every single scrap of magic from it, gathering it to a little ball, concealed by my own magic. </p><p>It was not the time to use it yet. </p><p>I went to my wardrobe, trying to decide what kind of disguise to wear, which, admittedly, was a more difficult question than it might first seem. The Gate was not a monolithic entity, but an ever-changing dominion of different species, sometimes daily. </p><p>However, there were some constants. </p><p>Vampires, for example, were one of the constants of the Gate. Never the strongest, nor the most expanded one, but with a relatively stable holding. Unfortunately, they were less the misunderstood pitiful creatures cursed to unlife by an accidental bite, and more monsters who decided to deliberately transform themselves into a fleshy monstrosity through long, painful, and most importantly, very deliberate rituals. Oh, they were charismatic enough to fulfill their misunderstood victim role, but there were only two endings for their poor gullible victims. Death, or becoming a mindless thrall.</p><p>Vampires were dangerous, because they were true vermins, and it was hard to guess just how far their power extended. True vampires were not only rare, but also they lacked the power to truly match the top-tier hitters of the other factions. But their ability to use their rapidly-created thralls for their disgusting aims made them a dangerous enemy to anger. More than one magical organization learned that the hard way. </p><p>Shifters were another strong group, though their reputation was even less accurate than the vampires. First of all, unlike their modern reputations, their status was definitely not transmissible. I had no idea that part of their myth had even come from. At least, vampires created their thralls by biting. </p><p>No, most shifters were relatively accomplished nature casters, rain-callers of the Native Americans, Druids of the old Gaul and Celts, paganistic witches of the North, dervishes of the old Anatolia, and other monastic cults. Unfortunately, unlike the vampires, their footprint on Earth was almost completely eradicated. Rome dealt the first true blow to their strongest incarnation, Druids, while rain-callers had been exterminated by the Spanish expansion to the new world. Crusades had cleaned up the rest. </p><p>It was a pity, but their ending was to be expected. Trying to protect the nature against ever-growing strength of human-centric empires was a helpless task. </p><p>Shifters, popularized by their strongest combative wolf shifters, also known as the werewolves, was one of the strongest among the groups that battled to dominate the Gate in terms of total combat power, connecting with nature strongly enough that their soul had aligned with their totem beast, enough that the connection bled back to their physical bodies, transforming them into an idealized version of their totem animal at will. Their transformed state was a dangerous foe, especially with their famous magical immunity. Their long ages, some easily reaching thousand years without a significant strain, made them even more dangerous. </p><p>Unfortunately, their power sphere was far smaller than their power might have implied. The reason, their roots. After all, despite their shared skill set, a druid from old Britannia and a spirit-caller from India had nothing in common other than the nature of their magic. </p><p>Ironically, their long lives were their biggest problem in establishing their faction. Without their leaders being replaced by the younger ones, they were focused on their tradition, to a point that every single group under their faction had impossible-to-mend grudges against each other. </p><p>Of course, shifters and vampires were two of the dozens of significant powers, some eclipsing both greatly. I focused on them, because I knew that Monica had active contacts with both factions. Without a doubt, she had other contacts with those factions, of course, but they were her most prominent connections. And since she mentioned the Gate but didn’t mention anything else, there was a very high chance it was one of them. Otherwise, she would have given me another clue. </p><p>I only hoped that they weren’t involved together. </p><p>Oh, god, please, don’t let both of them be involved at the same time. </p><p>“Of course,” I murmured with a sudden realization as I pulled a black cloak and a unique staff from a secret compartment of my wardrobe. With my luck, of course, both factions were involved at the same time. Why else Monica would have warned me to stay away so emphatically. And here I was, going to put my nose where it didn’t belong, in a condition where I could only use a fraction of my powers to make sure I stayed concealed.</p><p>Sometimes, I really, really hated the old fogies of the council… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching Emma walk away with a determined gait, it was easier than I expected to come to a decision. Why should I bother trying to decipher her notes or go through all that effort to follow her, when I could just as easily interrogate her directly? </p><p>Not to mention, such directness came with one very important benefit. The interrogation didn’t need to be a bland, boring affair. </p><p>Still wrapped in shadows, I walked quickly toward the library door, intent on cutting Emma’s path, even as I shed my disguise. Emma was just impulsive enough to react explosively to a mysterious trader that accosted in the royal library, before I could give an explanation about my presence. </p><p>The dark lord that she was under the impression of freeing due to her spectacular mistake deserved a different reaction. </p><p>I waited until she was about to open the library door and leave before speaking, letting the shadows that wrapped around me fall at the same time. “What a nice coincidence to see you here, sweetie,” I said in a cheerful voice. </p><p>The way she turned toward my voice was enchanting. Her body flipped, coiled like a spring, ready to explode. The form of that explosion was never in doubt, her fingers already laced with an ethereal fire, ready to trigger a storm, the bright flash of light illuminating her beautiful face. </p><p>However, as beautiful as her aggressive stance was, the way her flames flickered and died, her beautiful face contorted in shock the moment she realized who she had been talking to. “W-what are you doing here?” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Nothing much. I decided to go for a midnight walk, to stretch my legs. You know, enjoying my freedom,” I said mockingly, reminding her of the supposed role she had on my freedom indirectly. “How about you?” </p><p>“J-just some magic research,” she said, her beautiful green eyes doing their best to avoid my gaze. I smirked before turning my back and walked toward the nearest desk, explicitly avoiding giving any sort of order, or indicating for her to follow me. A small test of obedience. </p><p>It worked excellently, with her footsteps gently tapping on the floor. I sat on the chair, and just as she was about to pull one for herself, I tapped on the desk. Frustration flared on her face for a moment, but only for a moment. It died the next second, replaced by resignation. </p><p>Our earlier obedience training still had some hold over her, it seemed. </p><p>I said nothing, just leaning back, waiting for her to speak, applying one of the most underappreciated interrogation tactics. It wouldn’t have been too effective against a composed target, but Emma, caught in the middle of a sneaky activity, facing against the dark lord she helped to capture, and helped to free, was the farthest thing from being composed. </p><p>“I’m trying to develop a new spell, and trying to get some inspiration from ancient records,” she said a second later, latching the easiest explanation. She was clearly not doing the research for herself, but it was the interesting thing about lying. Trying to conceal the wrong thing could easily backfire. </p><p>“Oh, really, what kind of ancient records?” I asked.</p><p>She jumped at the opportunity to get away from the instigator of her visit, and started explaining. Amateur mistake, I thought humorously, but that didn’t mean I wasn’t listening to her explanation with rapt attention. She started explaining, and a few pointed questions were enough to delve deeper into the information she collected. </p><p>And the information she collected was interesting, far more relevant to my current plight. The first few magical information she provided seemed unrelated, both to my search, and to each other, but soon, it started creating an intriguing picture. </p><p>She was researching the same ancient magical formations I tried to find. </p><p>After listening to her findings, it wasn’t shocking that my search had been fruitless. She was clearly under the orders of someone, with a detailed guide for every scrap of information hidden in the depths of some random books of reference, but even then, the information only touched the edges of the information I had been facing. Only by seeing them together, aggregated, I could see the shape of my target, and even then, it was nothing relating to the core, just a shadowy silhouette drawing the edges. </p><p>The absence of the core information, however, was too apparent. Suspiciously so. </p><p>As if someone had gone through the library in painstaking detail, removing everything relating to the information I had been seeking. The mystery was getting deeper and deeper. </p><p>I deliberately tried to avoid trying to ask her about who asked her to gather the information, because she was doing her best to keep the discussion away from that topic. If I was interrogating someone else, that would have been the point I used some enhanced interrogation techniques, but luckily for Emma, I had a much more efficient way of loosening her tongue. </p><p>Along with the rest of her body. </p><p>“What an interesting spell you’re trying to design,” I said even as I put my hand on her thigh, still covered with her robe. Her voice tightened, but that was her only reaction to her otherwise smooth explanation, already accepting where that touch might lead after the ending of our last encounter. </p><p>“It’s smart, trying to develop a trump card,” I said, listening to her lengthy explanation, going deeper and deeper into the theoretical aspects, deep enough that I was having trouble following her explanation. I was good at magic, but that didn’t mean I could follow every little magical theory easily. </p><p>She just nodded at my words, more interested in the way my hand slipped under her robe, making contact with her naked skin. She tried to pull the hem of her robe reflexively, only to abandon that attempt a moment later. “Good girl,” I whispered, making her shiver. </p><p>“I need to go back to my room,” she whispered. </p><p>“Do you?” I countered even as my hand traveled higher, making her blush climb higher alongside it as well. As my hand moved up, it dragged her robe along as well, and soon, it failed to cover her bottom properly. It revealed her legs, pale and creamy, yet deliciously tight. More interestingly, it revealed her panties, black and lacy, almost invisible, far more interesting than I had been expecting her to wear for a midnight research activity. </p><p>After our adventures, she was starting to embrace her femininity, it seemed. </p><p>Her panties weren’t the biggest evidence of her transformation, however. No, that honor went to the growing wetness of her core, announcing her arousal. </p><p>It was always good to have confirmation of my partner’s excitement. </p><p>She noticed the target of my gaze, her magical explanation stammering as she tried to tighten her legs, but my hand positioned carefully, that attempt was destined for failure. “It’s difficult to explain complicated theories while distracted,” she whispered, though her throaty tone left it doubtful whether she wanted my touch to cease, or asking for permission to stop her explanation, so that she could properly on the treatment she was receiving. </p><p>“What distraction? I’m perfectly silent, and listening in rapt attention,” I said, earning a frustrated sigh in response, hardly helped by my forcing of her legs even wider, giving me a view of her core, its sight restricted only by her moist panties. </p><p>“You’re right,” she said in resignation, continuing her explanation into the intricacies of magic, only to be stutter once more when my fingers reached her panties. I pulled, and their delicate texture failed to resist my touch, allowing me to rip them off easily. </p><p>And her explanation got considerably slower once I leaned forward, pressing my lips on her naked slit. A moan forced itself between her words, and it got only worse when my tongue joined the fray. Her sweet taste blossomed on my tongue as I lazily caressed her knob, leading her to let out another moan, interrupting her explanation. </p><p>“Why did you stop?” I asked, pulling my head under her skirt, catching her expression turning from pleasure to frustration. A wiggle of my eyebrows just pushed the impression further.  </p><p>“You…” she gasped. “You can’t expect me to explain complicated magical theories while doing … that.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said with a sigh, even as I reached for my belt. Some fumbling later, my shaft was free from the tight prison of my pants, breathing freely. “Then, be a dear and help me back,” I said even as grabbed her wrist, and with a tug, pulled her down the table. </p><p>She was going to use her lips, one way or another. </p><p>A push later, she was kneeling in front of me, inches away from my shaft. “Don’t waste time, sweetie,” I said even as I grabbed her robe, pulling hard enough to rip the front, revealing the corset underneath, once again black and lacy. </p><p>I just needed to decide the intensity of the interrogation… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Dear Pico,” the man riding the Nemean lion spoke with a confident smirk, under the illusion that everything was under control. “Let me repeat my earlier offer. Our school needs a skilled trainer like you. Why don’t you switch employers.” He stopped for a moment, letting out a chuckle. “It’s not like you have a job for too long in any case.”</p><p>Once again, I didn’t bother trying to say anything. Unlike his attitude toward the disposable guards, the man’s attitude toward Pico seemed genuine, which should make betrayal a viable option. In a way, his betrayal would make my life much easier. I would be able to use my magic without any pesky witnesses. </p><p>Not alive ones, in any case.  </p><p>Pico said nothing at first, just took a half a step forward, as if trying to defend me against the first charge of the lion, which ruined that plan. I sighed in disappointment. </p><p> I had no illusion about the reason for his action, of course. His loyalty was toward the Dacian School, and not me. He was only defending me because I was a literal asset to the school, a prized stallion. Still, while oftentimes I could be opportunistic, I had my own personal boundaries, and rewarding loyalty with betrayal was not one of them. </p><p>Unfortunately, keeping Pico alive meant that I couldn’t use any explicit spells. I didn’t want to bet that he would keep my secrets from Master Antonius just because I had saved his life. He clearly saw his life as less important than his loyalty to the school, and he couldn’t just assume a secret mage between gladiators didn’t have any evil objectives toward his school. </p><p>I didn’t, of course, but it wasn’t something he could be certain of. </p><p>When in doubt, run, I decided. Suddenly, I grabbed Pico’s arm and started dragging him inside the cave. “What are you doing?” Pico asked, shocked. The rider, identified as Antony by Pico, looked also shocked enough to fail to react at that moment. After all, from his perspective, he already won. </p><p>“You think you can run?” he growled in anger and raised his hand, trying to cast a spell. The earth started to swell, as if it would close out our path. </p><p>Excellent, I thought even as I flared my magic, just subtle enough to delay his spell a second. He was just a mage, weaker than I had been when I had been in the middle of my training with my grandfather, so interfering with his spell without him being aware was a simple task. I had no doubt he had other abilities. The fact that he was able to ride a Nemean lion suggested that, but in an elemental spell, it was easy to trick him. </p><p>We found ourselves locked in a cave, with an earth wall rising in our wake. “Let’s move deeper. I could feel the fresh air. There must be another entrance,” I said, loud enough to be heard by our attacker. </p><p>I wanted him following us in the cave, after all. It was the easiest way to limit his advantages. </p><p>“Keep your mouth shut,” Pico gasped in anger, unaware of the reason I wanted to alert our enemy. I shrugged. An old man shouting at me for my mistakes was not an unfamiliar feeling. </p><p>“Sorry,” I said even as I used a subtle spell to reinforce the rock wall that was just created by our opponent, making it easier for him to take us down, trying to goad him to use a dangerous spell. </p><p>His magic hit the cave once, enough to dislodge a few dangerous rocks — only to be deflected by my own magic, conveniently — but the rock wall stayed in place. “That fucking wall!” he shouted in anger, his voice easily cutting through the rock.  </p><p>“He seems a bit rash,” I said mockingly even as I moved deeper into the cave, and Pico followed. The cave didn’t have another exit, but at least it was deep enough for me to hide that fact for a minute or so, which was all the time I needed to launch the next part of my plan. </p><p>“As the heir to his school, he had a smooth life,” Pico said dismissively. “Young people always expect things to go in their way.” </p><p>I just chuckled at the surliness of my trainer, but before I could say anything else, the cave shook again, showing Antony’s renewed determination to hit. I let the rock wall dissipate at his third hit — any more, and even he would be suspicious — but not without another little gift. I triggered a partial collapse on the way, so that if he wanted to follow us, he either needed to stop riding his lion, therefore solving my problem of killing him without raising suspicion, or try to widen the entrance, and give us time to escape. </p><p>And if he took too long enough opening a safe passage, I could create an exit, using his spells creating a tectonic reaction as an excuse. </p><p>But I wasn’t expecting a loud roar, strong enough to rattle my bones, followed by a crashing sound. Apparently, my opponent chose a different direction, using his battle pet’s supernatural strength to forcibly create an entrance. </p><p>Moron, I thought even as I cast another sneaky spell, weakening the walls of the cave, hastening an inevitable collapse of the cave, before grabbing Pico and hiding in a corner, creating a small magical cover around us to make sure we would survive. </p><p>Just in time, as the rocks started to rain down on us. “Mars burn it,” Pico growled in disappointment as he watched the stones falling down. </p><p>“We’re in the gods’ hands now. Whatever happens, happens,” I said calmly. It was easy to be pious with the ability to stop the collapse. </p><p>Despite the collapse, I could hear Antony’s pained cries and the lion’s angry roars. Neither his magical talent nor his beasts weren’t enough to completely protect him from the collapse, it seemed. </p><p>“Lucky,” Pico whispered as the collapse settled, with a large air pocket around us. “There’s enough air for us to survive until Master Antonius sends a search party, to get our bodies for funeral if nothing else.” </p><p>I nodded, glad that the situation passed that easily, but another cry from above ground suggested that we might have jinxed ourselves. “Find their location, you stupid animal,” Antony cried even as I felt his flare of magic, aggressively spend his mana. I wondered how he discovered we weren’t dead yet for a while, until his words revealed his motivation. “I want their corpses strung on top of the city walls. I am wounded because of a worthless slave and a peasant. It’s unacceptable.” </p><p>“Wow, angry much,” I said while Pico stiffened, feeling as Antony’s mana flared to the limit. Digging a cave as hastily as he was trying to do was not a simple magical achievement.  </p><p>Even in touchy noble standards, Antony seemed to be the hasty kind. I would have understood trying to make sure we were dead, but wasting all of his magical strength just to get our corpses. As the spells he was casting felt closer and closer, I prepared myself to act. </p><p>If he wanted to die, I had no problems giving him that. Unfortunately, his beast was a barrier to that. Luckily, I still had the sleeping bear in the cave, and he was closer to Antony’s spells. I cast a spell to awaken it back, and another spell to empower. It was a hasty, useless way that would end up in the death of the bear in minutes, but that was not relevant. </p><p>“Kill it,” Antony cried the moment bear pushed into the surface, directed to attack Antony. I directed the bear to escape on that instant, betting on Antony’s vindictiveness. “Chase it,” Antony cried again, sending his lion to follow the bear, leaving himself defenseless, unaware that he had signed his own death warrant as he continued to dig. </p><p>Arrogance was a costly mistake. </p><p>The moment his spell arrived around us, opening a path, I charged forward, my blade glistening under the bright sun. “You’re still alive,” Antony gasped in shock and started casting a spell. To the credit of his training, this time, he was using a simple defensive spell, impossible to miscast for someone in his skill. </p><p>So, his eyes widened in shock the moment the spell failed to come together. “You!” he gasped, realizing the source of his constant misfortune was my intervention. </p><p>Pico burst out later, unaware of the reason for Antony’s shock. “Don’t kill him,” he cried in panic, trying to warn me against the crime of killing a noble. </p><p>I might have been willing to grant that request. Unfortunately for Antony, his mind decided to work at the worst possible moment, amounting to an unwitting betrayal. Discovering my abilities was his mistake. He tried to reach his mana to cast an emergency spell, only to realize it was completely out of reach. His eyes widened, realizing the extent of my strength. What I had been doing, directly shutting down a mage couldn’t be done by another mage, no matter how strong. I had to be a sorcerer. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, the slash of my sword came a moment later, getting rid of his head. </p><p>Before I could talk with Pico about the death of a noble, however, a mad roar reached to my ear. </p><p>Maybe Pico had another reason for his request other than protecting the life of a noble. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Our little game was developing amazingly. With two beauties collapsed, I only had two more to handle. </p><p>And seeing Cornelia and Helga wrapped around each other, their moans equally mixed as their fingers explored each other, was the perfect stimulation for me to ignore the opportunity to take a breather, and continue with my self-appointed yet glorious mission. </p><p>As I walked closer, I couldn’t help but appreciate the show they were providing. Their beautiful moans, the way their fingers danced over each other’s hard nipples, their back arching as their bodies rubbed together. </p><p>It wasn’t purely the pleasure that drove them to provide such a beautiful show. It wasn’t that they weren’t enjoying each other’s treatment — which was clear from the intensity of their moans — but it was clearly a secondary benefit. No, the way they positioned their bodies, angled perfectly toward me to maximize the visual impact showed that it was a deliberate ploy to entice me. </p><p>And the smile on their face was far too naughty for it to have an innocent reason. — though, in the context of an orgy, the word innocent was quite nebulous to define properly. And their deliberate attempt to keep that edge concealed — a desperate attempt against my Subterfuge abilities — made it certain that they had a different aim. </p><p>“Won’t you join us, Caesar?” Helga said as she turned to face me properly, lying on her side as she did so, a move that had a spectacular effect on her beautiful tits, especially when they were not resting on the bed, but Cornelia’s tight body, their hair mixing into delicious copper color. Her legs parted open, her wetness inviting me forward. </p><p>“Mm, how can I reject such a beautiful invite?” I said as I started examining their bodies. I took a step forward, only to feel the faint presence of a ward around me, being established very slowly. </p><p>I recognized Helga’s handiwork, even as she was doing her best to lean forward and nibble Cornelia’s earlobe to distract me. Cornelia’s wiggling body and loud moans were excellent ways of distracting me, of course. If it wasn’t for the great gulf between our stats, she would have succeeded in her task. </p><p>Good, I thought happily. They were learning. </p><p>I felt like a dominant lion, happy to see the females of his pack becoming stronger hunters. Even the rationale was not too different. Just like a male lion was equipped to fight against other predators at the expense of his hunting prowess, leaving the important task of hunting to the females, I had to trust the girls to hold their own against the ordinary political machinations of the faculty, nobles, and other threats that could be classified as ordinary. </p><p>The trick pulled by the Zokras had spooked me greatly. The stronger they got, the less likely a similar event would happen, especially if they could stay in Silver Spires, where the headmistress was a proper deterrent now that the undead threat had been resolved, providing security. </p><p>For a given value of security, of course. In a collapsing world, security was always a rare commodity. Though, knowing that the said world was under siege of literal gods while being manipulated by a shadowy organization, the collapsing state made so much sense. </p><p>Unfortunately, Cornelia was about to leave for her family, which worried me greatly, even with her strength boost. Yes, she was supposed to be strong enough to take down her uncle, but ultimately, she was a mage, weak against close-range combat. A home under the control of her opponent provided too many opportunities for pulling such tricks. </p><p>Cornelia’s straightforward personality made it even worse. </p><p>I was planning to go with her, to protect her, but with the situation back in Silver Spires wildly evolving with the nature of the headmistress and the inclusion of the Crown Princess, there was no guarantee that I could actually go with her. </p><p>It was why I took another step, letting Helga wordlessly direct Cornelia to subtly summon the ice cube once more, ready to launch while she continued to set the ward. I had been impressed by the way they worked together against the undead invasion, but collaboration under immense danger was easy, while cold planning required much better alignment. </p><p>Their little ploy got my interest exactly for that reason. Not only the low stakes and the playful nature were the perfect way of showing their collaboration smoothness, but also Helga was the one leading their little ploy, while Cornelia was listening to her obediently. </p><p>Exactly the thing that Cornelia needed back in her family. Cornelia’s initial plan, before their lives were inevitably interlinked by mine, was clearly taking Marianne along with her to support, both politically and magically. Even then, Marianne wasn’t a weak caster, and healing talents could make the difference. </p><p>Unfortunately, Marianne had two big drawbacks to that role. First, her magical skill set was extremely limited, restricted to healing, a situation that barely changed even at the moment. More importantly, however, she lacked the strength of personality to blunt Cornelia’s headstrong approach, making her an easy target for any kind of ploy her uncle might pull. </p><p>I took yet another step, curious of seeing the impact of their little operational duo. </p><p>Helga leaned to nibble Cornelia’s ear, making a show of their closeness while using that to whisper directives to Cornelia. Cornelia followed her directives, the movement of the ice cube hidden behind the ward Helga had created. </p><p>Cornelia’s legs parted open while Helga’s fingers slipped inside, perfectly timed to the last part of the ice cube’s trajectory. </p><p>I decided to encourage them a bit, and let the cube come almost within touching range before reacting, confirming the effectiveness of their team play. However, I didn’t let it touch, because I didn’t want them to be overconfident. Instead, I made a show of being shocked before deflecting the cube away. “That was close,” I murmured, my Subterfuge helping to sell the idea I barely escaped their attack. </p><p>They pouted at their failure, but still, the glint in their eyes told me that it was a moral victory for them. Exactly what I had intended. </p><p>“So close,” Helga murmured as she pulled away from Cornelia, though that was not a stop to their affairs. No, it was just to allow me to squeeze between their delicious bodies. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said with a chuckle even as I put my hands on their bodies, enjoying the way they shivered under my touch. “You’re getting better, Cornelia. You might even handle the challenge in your House without dying.” </p><p>Helga looked at us, confused. Her reaction was normal. We have talked before about Cornelia going back to her family, but that didn’t mean that she had known the full gravity of the situation. Especially since her commoner background isolated her from the gossip that might have informed her of that. </p><p>Cornelia looked at my eyes for a moment, asking for permission to explain, and I nodded, indicating that there was no problem sharing the details Helga. “It’s my uncle,” she said. “I’m the heir of my house, but my uncle is the regent, and also, the one that would take the reins of the house if something happens to me.” </p><p>“But that’s horrible,” Helga cut in. “He’s your family.” </p><p>“That doesn’t mean much when it comes to noble families,” Cornelia answered sadly. “At least, not when rewards are easy pickings.” </p><p>“So, that’s why you didn’t graduate years ago, despite your power,” Helga said. “You don’t trust the members of your own house.” </p><p>“My uncle had years bribing or marginalizing anyone that’s remotely loyal to my late father, and the ones that didn’t obey his wishes disappeared mysterious,” Cornelia answered. “I have the legal right, but if I go back without overwhelming power, things won’t end well for me.” </p><p>Helga said nothing, shocked by the revelation. I was willing to bet that until now, even with their growing relationship, Helga had just assumed Cornelia was a privileged heiress, wasting time to enjoy her privileges before the reins of her family, unlike her, who was struggling to carve a place for herself in a school that was dangerous for her. </p><p>To her defense, Cornelia was far too aggressive and prickly to actually tell someone about her problems, leaving her isolated, making her uncle’s job much easier. It was no wonder Helga didn’t understand the implications. </p><p>“Thanks,” Cornelia muttered, appreciating Helga’s simple gesture. I didn’t know her reaction would have been the same before everything had happened, but I suspected otherwise. Despite the changes she had been gone through, Cornelia was still a girl who had been shaped by the narration of nobles being superior to common blood —admittedly, due to quirks of the system, it was more than an illusion. She was accepting Helga’s consolation, not because she had gained a new appreciation of the commoners, but in her eyes, Helga had elevated herself up through her skills and power, carving an exception for herself. </p><p>Not to mention, the help Helga’s position received from my status. I had established myself as Cornelia’s superior to such a degree that she internalized her forced identity as a maid. And she accepted that position smoothly, due to my overwhelming display of strength putting me above the other nobles, rather than lowering her position into a commoner. </p><p>Of course, none of those meant Cornelia’s and Helga’s relationship would be perfectly smooth, especially when Helga tried to limit her actions. Clashes between them were inevitable. Luckily, Helga was smart enough to handle the implications of a position. </p><p>All that was needed was for me to explain my plans about the next steps about Cornelia’s ascension. Plans that would no doubt make Cornelia bristle in annoyance, thinking she was being treated like an unreliable hothead — even though she was certainly one. </p><p>Luckily, I had some interesting ways to smooth that message, a particularly fun version popping out immediately. One that would work wonders to strengthen them before pushing excellently with the need to strengthen them before a dangerous situation. </p><p>And I had all day to make sure they were properly equipped to face danger. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324 Mana: 2931  / 7750        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 18/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I had been planning to move onto the beautiful dance of red and gold, but Titania’s legs, tightening even further as she climaxed, showed that she had no intention of letting me go. </p><p>As far as impediments went, it was far from being unwelcome. I enjoyed the way she showed her passion, despite the overwhelming tremble that filled her whole being. I couldn’t wait to test the limits of her renewed passion, still feeling the frustration of her loss. </p><p>My Endurance made sure that my shaft awakened back to life in quick order, so I didn’t bother pulling out before letting my hands land on her alabaster skin, slipping under her to cup her bottom hungrily. She moaned in joy, though that was quick to be replaced with a flare of anger as I probed her puckered hole with my little finger. </p><p>“Don’t you dare-” she gasped in a palpable aura of anger, but that was quick to fade as I pushed my hips forward, once again making her enjoy the invasion of my full length. Her hands landed on my chest, but rather than trying to push me away, scratched angrily. </p><p>Too bad that, even with her recent improvements, her physical strength wasn’t enough to leave anything but a pink line. With a chuckle, I grabbed her hand and kissed her palm, the gentle touch working wonders to drain her anger. </p><p>“Don’t dare, what?” I said with a chuckle even as I pulled my finger out, only to put my hands on her waist and raise her. Unprepared for the sudden move, she didn’t react until she found herself in my embrace, my shaft still lodged inside, her answer cut short with a searing kiss on her lips, destroying her answer prematurely.</p><p>Not that she had any concerns about that, if her legs around my waist were any indicator, getting tighter as our tongues battled, her body moving up and down repeatedly in the process, her presence tight around my shaft. </p><p>However, it didn’t take long for her to stiffen in shock once more, because I used the perfect opportunity to slip a finger into her tight entrance once more, already cleaned and lubricated thanks to a quick spell. </p><p>Magic was such a beautiful tool, both in terms of bedroom utility, and throwing deadly meteors to the heads of my enemies. </p><p>Titania, however, didn’t seem to be appreciating that utility at the same level. She gasped in shock as my finger slipped inside, even deeper — though, noticeably, having no effect on the way her body moved up and down to maximize the impact of our position. She tried to pull back, though it took a while for her to escape my domineering kiss. “Caesar!” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Yes, honey, that’s my name, don’t wear it out,” I said mockingly before leaning forward, capturing them in another kiss. While silencing her, I took a couple of steps toward the wall, until she was locked between my body and the wall, cutting her escape route completely. There, I pulled back, but my hips moved with a vengeance, invading her core with pleasure. “You were saying?” </p><p>Under the rush of pleasure, and being squeezed, her words failed Titania for a moment. She just looked at me blankly, trying to overcome the rush of pleasure. It took several seconds for her to utter her first word, and my merciless slamming didn’t make it any easier. “I was saying-” she started, only to fall short with a shocked gasp. </p><p>The reason, the sudden betrayal from my fingers, two more joining the first, invading her tight hole to assist pumping. Her eyes widened in shock as she gasped, but this time, it wasn’t just pain that made her lose her words, but also pleasure. Already closing to the edge, the invasion worked wonders to help her topple over the edge. </p><p>“I decided to treat my favorite brunette to some fun,” I said, then pouted comically. “Am I wrong?” </p><p>“You - maybe,” she managed to stammer, her recent climax working wonders to soften her stance even more. I smirked cutely, to a level its artificial nature was obvious. Titania just rolled her eyes, giggling for a fleeting moment. </p><p>Yet another facet of the intimidating head librarian, I thought with a smirk. </p><p>However, since she was already in the mood for the next step, I saw no reason to waste any more time. I pulled out and twirled her. After her latest climax, she was barely able to stand up with the help of the wall, facing it as well. My fingers, trailing down to caress her wetness, hardly helped her to stand straighter. </p><p>She started shivering furiously under my fingers, and my lips, caressing her neck, hardly helped her to control her shivers. I pressed my chest against her back, listening to the furious thumping of her heart with my body. “Someone feels enthusiastic,” I murmured even as my fingers slipped into her wetness. </p><p>She let out a frustrated growl at my mocking, but her body relaxed under my touch, her ass pushing out in an effort to devour my finger deeper. Her frustrated growl was quick to turn into a moan, even when my other hand landed on her ass hard in a spank. </p><p>However, her response was to freeze, because she felt my shaft pressing against her puckered hole, startling her with the suddenness of my invasion. I stood still, letting her process what was about to happen. </p><p>Invading her tightness was an amazing feeling, tempting me to push with a sudden aggressiveness, knowing she would adapt to my presence in a few seconds. But I managed to hold myself back. I wanted her to take more action. “Why don’t you show me your determination, sweetie?” I whispered into her ear even as I stayed buried lightly in her tight hole, my fingers caressing her core. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she managed to stammer between her moans. </p><p>“Well, after your abject resistance, I’m afraid of hurting you, so it’s for the best if you take the lead,” I whispered, which earned a furious glare from her. Because as I said so, my body was still pinning her against the wall, imprisoning deliciously. </p><p>“Really?” she murmured in abject annoyance, but that annoyance hardly affected her actions. Her head turned back, catching my lips in a heated kiss. Her actions were heated, still carrying a tinge of resentment, powering the kiss even more. Her tongue slipped in, dancing with an aggressive passion. </p><p>I enjoyed the assault of her tongue, appreciating the contrast from her usual passive attitude in the bedroom — and many other fun locations we had some fun. The rest of her body didn’t take long to join the dance of pleasure. Her hips started it, moving up and down with a delicious subtleness. </p><p>At first, I assumed it was just a reflexive reaction, because she stopped instantly when that motion brought her hips back a bit, pushing my shaft an inch into her precious tightness. Despite her desperate pull, however, the motion repeated itself soon after, leaning back after a few rocking movements. </p><p>She pulled back once more, but this time, the delay was a breath longer. </p><p>After the same dance repeated a few times, her push getting slightly deeper, and her delay getting slightly longer, I realized that I had made a mistake. I thought I could have easily teased her, but I hadn’t factored in one very important detail. She had already climaxed several times, which went a long way to blunt the edge of torture she was feeling, while mine continued to build up. </p><p>Of course, I could have just stopped the game and pushed forward, but that would mean accepting the defeat, even if only implicitly. Even worse, the way Titania’s eyes shone as she pulled back from the kiss for a breather suggested she was very much aware of that particular detail. </p><p>“Oh, it’s on,” I murmured. Unlike Titania’s expectations, however, my response wasn’t to slam my hips forward and invade her bowels. No, I put my finger on her spine, laced with just enough mana to enhance the sensation of touch, dragging down gently, triggering her sensitive spots on the way down. </p><p>“No fair,” she murmured even as a helpless moan forced itself out, but with her body imprisoned, she didn’t have many ways of retaliating. I had no doubt that, if it was earlier in our relationship, she would have stubbornly tried to resist until the pleasure reached a furious degree. </p><p>Now, however, it took seconds for her to fold under the renewed teasing, abandoning her trick the moment it had been discovered. Her hips pushed back almost immediately. </p><p>I could have pulled myself back and foiled her plan, twisting the game, but she deserved some mercy for her quick surrender. Not to mention, my shaft was throbbing anticipation. I let her tight hole devour my shaft while she let out her moans. </p><p>Her lips found mine in another kiss, but the real surprise came with the movement of her hips, pushing herself back much faster than I had been anticipating, her tightness enveloping me. It was a small miracle that I didn’t explode at that moment, especially with her pain-filled moans straining against my lips. </p><p>But the pain she was feeling didn’t delay her ever-deepening pushes, soon swallowing my full length into her tightness. At that moment, I decided that she had earned her reward. </p><p>I pushed forward, meeting her push with a sudden aggressiveness. The resulting cry was beautiful and explosive, filling the room, enough to distract Cornelia and Helga from their embrace and look at us. I sent a smirk to their way before turning my attention back to the raven-haired beauty whose moans were echoing in the room, each push stretching her more. </p><p>It would be rude to ignore such enthusiasm, I decided, moving faster and faster, the sound of our flesh hitting exploding loud enough to suppress her voice. Each push was an amazing experience, enjoying her tightness. And when my pleasure finally reached its peak, exploding inside her, she was already trembling with her own climax, and the explosion only added another layer. </p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated.

    "content": "<p>Sarah’s only answer to my monumental question was a hesitant nod, her boisterous personality drowned by fear and excitement in equal measures. She was deliciously beautiful as her naked body shivered repeatedly, the growing wetness between her legs little to do with the earlier swimming session.</p><p>“As you wish, beautiful,” I said as I pushed my hips forward gently, penetrating her wetness. Her eyes flew open wide and her mouth formed a surprised gasp, followed by a deep breath pull. Her legs stayed motionless, but they were still wide enough to allow unfettered access for me as I slowly pushed forward. </p><p>And slowly pushed forward, I did, giving her time to get used to unfamiliar presence while I enjoyed the warmth of her clamping flesh, making it a difficult challenge to push forward. Her moans rose unbidden, but even through them, I could hear the gasp of shock Carrie had let out, neither Sarah’s voice nor the door on the way enough to suppress it completely. </p><p>Luckily, Sarah was too distracted by the new world she found herself in to properly process her other sensory inputs. After the initial shock, her eyes were firmly shut as she tried to process the overwhelming sensation of the invasion. “Tell me if it hurts too much,” I said as I put my weight behind the push, forcibly widening her wetness even further. </p><p>I only intended to tease her slowly, giving her a gentle first time, but she decided to ruin that plan almost immediately. “Harder,” she gasped between her shallow breaths. </p><p>“Are you sure, beautiful?” I said, even as I pumped my hips forward for a short distance, giving her a taste of rougher treatment. </p><p>She gasped in pain, but that didn’t change her answer. “Yes, I’m sure. Fuck me harder,” she gasped. </p><p>Impressive, I thought even as I slipped my hands under her tight hips, raising them for a better angle. She responded by sliding forward, impaling herself deeper into my hardness. That was all the confirmation I needed to let my instincts take over. I moved my hips forward, lubricating more and more of my cock with her wetness with each push, annexing more and more of her untouched fertile land. </p><p>And it felt like heaven. </p><p>I was still going to control myself, but her hips decided to take a bigger role in our little game. She moved back and forth, following my rhythm, while gasps accompanied her beautiful dance with each repeat. Soon, a sharp and steady slapping sound filled the room. </p><p>“Faster, faster,” she whispered, and combined with the nature of her moans and the dance of her hips, it worked wonders to loosen my already-frazzled self-control even further. The extended naughty game we played wreaked enough havoc in my body that even the time with Carrie hadn’t been enough to take the edge completely, and the pool adventure, with the presence of our secret voyeur, hardly helped the situation. </p><p>My hips rebelled, meeting the rhythm of her hips the most aggressive way possible, clapping of our bodies getting loud enough to suppress her passionate cries. Her body rocked harder and harder as my cock slid in and out of her with all the mercy of a jackhammer. </p><p>“Do you want me to fuck you even harder, you slut?” I asked loudly, realizing that, despite the slight hesitation in the middle, her harsh personality worked wonders in her sexual preferences. </p><p>“Yes, fuck me, hard,” she gasped. </p><p>“As you wish, but a question first?” I said with a sudden inspiration, slowing the beat of my hips significantly as I asked that. </p><p>“What!” she gasped, her frustration clear in her tone. I chuckled, amused by the sudden flip my sexy nerdy friends were showing the moment we overcome a certain point of intimacy. Really, all those times, I was unnecessarily bothering with all those fancy cheerleaders and ignoring the true treasure under my nose, untapped and untouched. </p><p>“If I checked your computer, what percentage of your porn stash would be BDSM?” I asked. She didn’t answer, not that she need to. The sudden widening of her eyes, along with her silent gasp, told me all I needed to hear. “Good answer,” I said with a chuckle as I pulled out of her, only to flip her over the bed. </p><p>Then, before she could even push the question, I grabbed her hips and forced them up, before one hand landed on the back of her head, making sure her face would stay buried in the pillow, my other hand reaching for the nearest item that could be used as an impromptu rope, a pillow cover. </p><p>“Do you like this, slut?” I asked even as I tied her hands behind her body, earning a shocked moan of pleasure in response. That was all the invitation I needed before slipping inside her once more, my cock sliding in and out mercilessly. One of my hands stayed over her head, pinning her in place, while the other landed on her hips, controlling her pace. </p><p>But not before turning toward the closed door, and making a gesture of invitation. </p><p>I picked up speed until the sound of slapping dominated the room, more than enough to suppress the sound of a door opening silently. On the other side of the door, our sexy voyeur revealed herself, her face contorted in a beautiful mixture of pleasure, guilt, jealously, and desire… </p><p>In other words, a masterpiece. </p><p>I sent a naughty grin to her before turning my attention to her best friend with an attitude, continuing my merciless slamming, Sarah’s sudden tenseness after being bound enough to drive me crazy. I slammed inside her, again, again, and again… </p><p>My pacing skipped a beat when I felt a sudden pressure on my back. A familiar pressure, and very much welcome, coming from the familiar shape of two globes, perfect enough to be called worthy of a goddess. When her soft gasp reached my ear, followed by her hot tongue trailing my neck, I was lost in pleasure. “Fuck her harder,” Carrie whispered, aroused and angry at the same time. </p><p>Her arousal was nothing surprising. Anger, on the other hand, was rather interesting. Apparently, despite her impressive permissiveness, a part of her still resented her best friend for trying to steal her man. I could have pointed out that I was not her man, but just her friend — with considerable benefits — and she allowed things to come to this point for her own gratification. </p><p>But I wasn’t an idiot, so I didn’t say that. Instead, my hand rose, only to land on Sarah’s ass explosively, the sound echoing against the walls. And it wasn’t just Sarah that let out a sound. Carrie gasped as well, tinged with arousal. Luckily, it was much less loud than Sarah’s cry, going unnoticed under the rush of pleasure. </p><p>Carrie’s face was reddened in shock at her own response, avoiding my sharp gaze as I looked at her. Interestingly, that did little to slow her fingers, busily widening her slit, stroking her entrance and caressing her knob. She clearly wanted more, the shake of her hips no less than Sarah. “Later,” I whispered to her, though the way she leaned against my body, her amazing breasts brushing against my arm, went a long way to break through my willpower. </p><p>I turned my attention to Sarah, pushing my hips even faster, the furious pounding joining the regular spanks I was delivering. With her arms properly tied behind her and her face buried, she just moaned obediently, each slap pushing her tightness to a spectacular level. </p><p>She raised her hips with great effort, moving back and impaling herself on my cock, meeting my furious pumping gleefully, the angle providing me better access to her depths as I did my best to stretch her wetness, determined to make her first time a spectacularly memorable affair. Her relentless tightness, resisting against my furious pumping, suggested that I was traveling in the right direction for that particular achievement. </p><p> When my hand settled on her ass, Sarah’s ability to contain her moans was completely gone, even the pillow not enough to suppress her voice. Her muffled moans mixed into the slapping sound, her body buried on the bed, tightening around my shaft. </p><p>Carrie watched from the side, wide-eyed as her best friend received the treatment of a lifetime from me, her fingers long disappeared inside her. Her perky breasts continued to rub against my body, her hands wandering over my chest, caressing my muscles. </p><p>I couldn’t help the desire to pull my hand away from Sarah’s ass and grab Carrie’s breasts, squeezing hard, enjoying the sensation while punishing her, making her attempts to maintain silence much more difficult. Pity my other hand needed to stay on Sarah’s head, preventing her from looking up. </p><p>The combination of feelings, around my fingers and around my shaft, soon proved too much. I barely managed to pull back, exploding all over Sarah’s tight ass, who was busy trembling as she tried to overcome her own explosive climax, but the weight of the first time proved too much. When I managed to untie her, she was already half-lost in the dreamland. </p><p>“Were you satisfied with my services, sweetie?” I asked, only to receive a lazy, dazed moan as she buried her face on the pillow, her ability to resist the loss of unconsciousness drained completely. </p><p>I let out a chuckle as I grabbed Carrie’s arm and dragged her out of the room to reward her for her spectacular success… </p><p>Befriending my nerdy girls was the best decision I had ever made…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Almost always, my search for supernatural clues started from a singular location. A small, rundown bar with no nameplate outside, known only to a select clientele. </p><p>Monica’s Bar. </p><p>I didn’t go there when I was stressed, or wanted to relax after a hard day of work. Not because it was expensive, as it was not, or because it was rundown. It was certainly run down, but not enough to be a dealbreaker for me. I had certainly visited worse places to get a cheap glass of scotch. </p><p>I didn’t go there unless I had an important case to solve, because of the ‘select clientele’ I had referred earlier. Because under the circumstances, select didn’t mean elite, rich, or snobbish. </p><p>It meant danger. </p><p>Earth was a low-magic dimension, but low magic did not mean no magic. While the creatures of ethereal weren’t strong enough to provide an existential threat, that didn’t make them any less weaker on a personal basis. Vampires and their sneaky ways, werewolves and their unchecked anger, even the occasional demon who decided to set up a little business in a little corner, every single one of them more than happy to silence anyone that might break their little quaint lives. </p><p>And as a council mage — even an exiled one — I was the cocked siege weapon that threatened their comfort, and more than once tried to solve it directly. They didn’t survive the attempt, of course, but that was hardly a reason to poke my nose to their lives repeatedly until one of them got successful. </p><p>The other reason for my carefulness was Monica, the owner of the bar. Monica was not her real name, though I had no idea what her true name was. She was a witch, and witches were famously protective of their names. I knew her name wasn’t Monica, because she came to America as a part of a Nordic expedition. </p><p>The first expedition, even, back in the eleventh century, almost a thousand years ago. </p><p>She was a scary witch, though, it was the only reason I visited her bar. Because as much as she intimidated me, she scared her other clientele even worse. Unlike me, she wasn’t bound by a bunch of council-enforced edicts limiting her actions, and she was famously heavy-handed against anyone that dared to disturb the calm of her bar. </p><p>I took a deep breath before pushing the door open, only to find myself a small, cozy bar, unexpectedly so considering the nature of the owner and the clientele. It was positioned in a dead-end alley, a few steps underground. There were five stools on the bar, each hand-carved from wood, though the number of scratches and the dirt made it impossible to detect its nature. They were spread equally in front of a large bar, its shelves filled with the vilest and disgusting cheap alcohol that was still commercially available. A prudent choice considering most customers ordered by the bottle rather than the glass. </p><p>Above the bar, there was a small window, just enough for a dash of natural light to spill inside without being too hard, again a compromise between different supernatural natures, with their varying sensitivity or need for the natural light. </p><p>Currently, the sunlight spilled through the window, falling sharply on a piano covered with dust, showing it had been a while since it had been long played, and behind that, a few tables hid, covered with dirt, and currently occupied with the people — for a very vague definition of people — that was even dirtier than the chairs they were sitting on. </p><p>Two customers even playing a game that looked like chess to anyone without the magical sight, but the stones moved in their own volition while the magic of the two old men on the opposite sides twirled to each other, their casual game spreading enough magic to make me feel threatened. </p><p>It was a good reminder that the owner wasn’t the only reason no one dared to act inside the limits of the store. There was more than one old monster in this world, staying in the shadows, following their esoteric interests. Of the two old men, I only knew the identity of one of them. Seleucus, one of the four generals of Alexander the Great, decided that perfecting his skills on a complicated magical variant of chess that most of the world couldn’t even comprehend was a better way to spend his time than trying to invade the world. </p><p>Again.  </p><p>“What a nice day, my favorite customer is here,” said the woman behind the bar, looking not a day older than her thirties, tall and blonde, almost statuesque, already filling a glass with vodka sharp enough to water my eyes. It was disgusting, but at least its alcohol ratio was high enough that no bacteria could survive in there. A marked improvement compared to other available drinks. </p><p>“As beautiful as always, Monica,” I said even I grabbed the glass, and drained it in one big sip. Truly, she was a beautiful woman, even without considering she was older than a millennium. She couldn’t be a mainstream model, but only because of her sharp, domineering attitude rather than lacking in beauty or charisma. I had no idea how she maintained her beauty, but I knew for a fact that it wasn’t just a mask or illusion — extensive magical knowledge was handy in catching such tricks. “How are you feeling.” </p><p>“I was feeling a bit down before your visit, Samael, but your visit is all I needed to make me happy.” </p><p>I frowned at her chosen way of referring me. “Come on, Monica, I told you I don’t like people using my middle name.” </p><p>“But it’s such a nice name, much better than Harvey, don’t you think?” she said before chuckling. “And, if you don’t want me to use it, you shouldn’t have made a bet with me, trying to learn mine.” </p><p>“Yeah, that wasn’t my smartest move,” I growled in mock outrage. Truly, trying to outplay a millennium-old witch with a cheesy bet was not my finest moment. </p><p>The arrogance of the youth. </p><p> I sat on the closest stool, ignoring the dirt, once again amused by the contrast between the rest of the bar, and behind the bar. Monica might let the bar accumulate dirt since her clientele didn’t care much about that, but the same didn’t apply to anywhere she personally touched. I could even feel the small layer of magic between her and the rest of the bar, destroying any dust particles that dared to touch her. </p><p>Not the most economical usage of magical power, but who was I to come between a woman and her vanity. </p><p>“So, what brought you here this time, Samael,” said Monica, once again using my unwelcome middle name, the one that was given to me by my godfather. It wasn’t that I hated him, but oftentimes, the connection was more trouble than it was worth. </p><p>“Couldn’t it be that I missed your beautiful face,” I said seriously, earning amused laughter in return.  </p><p>\"Always a gentleman, Samael,” she said with a smirk. “But unfortunately, I didn’t miss your tendency to ask difficult questions with each visit. Spill it out so that I can enjoy your flirting properly.” </p><p>“As you wish, Monica,” I said, giving her a nod. “Have you heard of the accident in Hotel Glory?”  I said. </p><p>Monica’s smile trembled slightly, which made me stiffen immediately. Monica was a master of keeping her expression even under the most shocking circumstances. I had seen her smile slip less than the number of fingers in one of my hands, and each event could be classified as catastrophic without any exaggeration. Not a good sign about my investigation. </p><p>Not at all. </p><p>“I will act like you didn’t ask that question, Harvey,”  she said with a sharp tone. Her deliberate switch of my name underlined the danger. </p><p>“Not an acquaintance, I hope,” I asked, only to receive a frown. </p><p>“You’re smart enough to know that I don’t deal with that sort, Samael,” she said, just a touch of coldness infecting her tone. “It’s for your safety.” </p><p>I sighed. It wasn’t that I was underestimating the weight of her warning. For a woman of her caution, those words carried a lot of weight. “Unfortunately, my sweet lady, that’s not really an option. There are some old fogies searching for an excuse to send me to a permanent timeout to the domain of Loki’s daughter,” I said. She said nothing. I decided to do something I loathed to do. “I’ll owe you a favor if you give me a hint,” I said. </p><p>It wasn’t that I loathed Monica. On the contrary, I was very fond of her, but that didn’t close my eyes to her nature. She was like a majestic tigress, beautiful and elegant, but only an idiot would present an arm to her. </p><p>Though, I guess I had a tendency to be one, especially when a sexy woman was involved. </p><p>“Are you sure, Samael?” she asked. Of course, I didn’t miss the nature of her concern for weakness. She might be fond of me, but that wouldn’t prevent her from leveraging that favor to the limit. </p><p>Favors were a dangerous business, especially when someone like Monica was involved. </p><p>“Unfortunately, my fair lady,” I said with a sigh. “I’m on a timer, a tight one.” </p><p>“As you wish,” Monica said. “You’ll want to check the Gate, then.” </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured, which earned a sympathetic nod from Monica despite her aversion to swearing. The Gate was bad news. </p><p>Seriously bad news… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Meeting with Emma at the library, at this late hour, an hour before the dawn, where it was guaranteed to be completely empty, was not something I could just write it off as a coincidence. The time was too special to be anything but a deliberate choice. </p><p>Someone else might have assumed that, since she used the main entrance, leaving a record of her credentials, rather than using the secret entrance that she could also access was enough to make it an innocent night visit rather than something underhanded. </p><p>That was a nice assumption. For example, if I were in her place and assumed my presence was suspicious, not only I would have used the secret entrance, but I also used several wards to make sure my presence was never registered by the security measures in place. </p><p>Like I had done at the moment. </p><p>However, I was too much of a suspicious bastard to assume Emma had the same cautious approach to cloak-and-dagger activities, or cautious enough to understand the full implications. She was too easy to play politically. If it was just me that played her politically, I wouldn’t be harsh against her, considering the ease I managed to break even the highest echelons of the Empire through my expertly-crafted ploys. </p><p>But no, Emma wasn’t just played by me, but also by Fernhand, easily tricked into using a dangerous mental trick that would have easily killed both of us if I was as helpless as I looked. Not to mention the Queen, using Emma’s spectacular magical abilities to achieve her aims before politically discarding her, something Emma noticed only weeks after that happened. </p><p>She might be an excellent mage, but her naked ambition combined with her political naivety destined her to be a political tool, and nothing else. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I wasn’t tempted to bend her against one of those dusty shelves that held some of the most precious historical scripts of the Empire and notify her about my presence amorously. Luckily, however, I had just shared a spectacular encounter with Sapphire, stretching from the throne room to treasury, making it much easier to suppress that desire. </p><p>Instead, I used the Blade of Shadows to wrap myself with the shadows of the shelves, getting close enough to Emma to see what she was doing. As I stood above her, just a couple of feet away, her delicious perfume filled my nose, tempting me to ignore my conviction about watching her. </p><p>However, I noticed that she had a large list in hand, with many book names followed with detailed instructions. A little delayed gratification was nothing compared to understanding what she was doing — especially since she already had a reputation for doing dangerous stuff without realizing it. </p><p>Interestingly, her target wasn’t the private section of the royal family like I assumed, nor she targeted the section that held the most important, and most dangerous magical books. No, instead, she started walking around the library, pulling some random frayed book from the bottom of a random shelf, browsing quickly until she found what she had been searching for, taking a rapid note on the notebook she carried, before moving onto the next step. </p><p>At the first glance, it looked innocent, a mage studying to design yet another spell, taking notes. Funnily enough, if it wasn’t for the particular hour she chose to visit the library, along with the panicked glances she was repeatedly throwing toward the entrance — unaware of the shadow that was watching her, ruining her attempts to stay concealed. I got even nearer, trying to read her notes, only to fail for one important reason. </p><p>Her notes were encrypted. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I saw the encrypted notes of a mage. It was a preferred method of many spellcasters to keep their secrets hidden. Though, oftentimes, they had overestimated the protection their encryption provided for their notes, leaving their notes accessible, making them easily stolen. </p><p>Unfortunately, breaking a code was a time-consuming exercise, making it impossible to decipher it immediately, or without the assistance of a lot of paper and some esoteric spells helping me to calculate. </p><p>So, I turned to the next best option, trying to understand what she was trying to discover from the books she was aiming for. </p><p>That turned out to be another bust. She was simply browsing the content too quickly for me to process, even with my speed reading. After all, as a mage, Emma wasn’t a slouch when it came to reading, and, more importantly, unlike me, she knew exactly what she was searching for. </p><p>So, I tried to put together a theme from the books she was targeting, but even that turned out to be a more difficult task than I had been expecting. The topics spread across a huge variety, from runes to enchanting, with a generous dash of curses and wards. </p><p>The only thing that was missing, interestingly, was elementalism, her exact expertise. However I wasn’t sure whether it was not needed because of the nature of the topic she was searching for, or it wasn’t needed because she had already collected the needed information previously while building her own spell knowledge. </p><p>Other than that, I was struggling to find a connecting thread between the books. Some were advanced books, focusing on spells complicated enough to overwhelm a lesser mage through their presence, while others were elementary books, only fit to be handled by children. Some focused on revolutionary theories that changed the magical landscape, and the others were about disproved magical theories that were on the library only due to their historical context… </p><p>Soon, however, I noticed another very important detail. Every single book she pulled was old, ancient level old. I missed that fact, because some of the books looked new from the outside, because they were actually so old that it was not the original manuscript, but a copy created to preserve the information. The others were so old that the only thing that was preventing them from turning into dust by a touch of Emma’s fingers was the protective enchantments. </p><p>I watched Emma’s research with a frown until she reached the end of the list, and prepared to leave, still unable to decipher what she was trying to find. </p><p>I had another strategic choice to make… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I walked behind Pico, two bodyguards on my flanks to prevent an ambush, getting tenser with each passing step. It seemed that they were also very much aware of the risks they were facing. I would have been worried as well…</p><p>… if it wasn’t for my hidden magical skills. </p><p>I was more than confident to take down any ambush they might arrange near Rome, most likely without revealing my magic overtly in the process. Just because I had received an immense power up during my adventures didn’t mean that I had forgotten my time in the Halls of Saturn, often flipping the situation with a hidden curse, or a concealed rune. </p><p>As we walked, I drew several runes on the hilt of the sword, enhancing its sharpness several times temporarily without giving any outward sign. That rune would also ruin the sword, but that was hardly a concern. I expected the journey to pass silently, before one of the guards suddenly spoke. </p><p>“Why are we suddenly changing our path? Weren’t we supposed to take the market road?” </p><p>“Change of plans,” Pico simply said as he looked at the crowded road that stretched in front of us that was moving suspiciously slowly. He took a sudden turn and moved toward the small forest on the side of the road. </p><p>“Just because of some congestion?” asked the guard dismissively. “It’s probably one of the grain carts breaking down, it wouldn’t slow us down.” </p><p>“Not if they are waiting there to ambush us,” Pico said without even bothering to turn, but the guard slowed down. </p><p>“Really, do you think they’ll ambush us in the middle of a public road,” said the guard, whose attitude clearly marked him as a new hire.</p><p>“Yes, they would,” said the other guard without even waiting for a second. </p><p>“And they are so lucky that a cart broke down at the perfect time?” he added, proving that not only he was new, he wasn’t particularly sharp. The morning crisis must have been even worse than Pico’s words suggested if they sent such a horrible guard to the critical task of protecting their star performer. </p><p>“Not if they are the ones that broke it in the first place,” the other guard answered with a sigh. Pico didn’t even bother to answer. </p><p>The guard decided to further prove his stupidity. “Isn’t going through the forest more dangerous, then?” he asked, digging in further. </p><p>This time, it was Pico that answered. “Not if they don’t know we’re going through there, you moron,” he growled in anger, the flashing anger on his face turned it into an intimidating statement. “Now, move or I’ll fire you. Waiting only makes it easier for them to catch our track.” </p><p>Under the trainer’s sharp glare, the guard lacked the willpower to directly resist, and started walking. Already tense walk started to suffer under the tension. </p><p>“A beautiful morning,” I said to Pico as I took a step forward, starting to walk next to him. </p><p>“It’ll be, if we can manage to keep all of your limbs attached to your body,” Pico answered. </p><p>“Limbs? I would have assumed they would go for the head?” </p><p>“Not if they can help it,” Pico answered, though his attention was still firmly on our surroundings. He was too experienced for small talk negatively affecting his observation. The young guard, however, clearly didn’t appreciate the difference in attitude, especially since I was a slave and he was a free man, which technically suggested that he was supposed to be superior. </p><p>Of course, while I was technically a slave at the moment — as long as it was convenient for me — the value I represented was much more than a low-rank guard could imagine, creating the difference in attitude. </p><p>Well, life wasn’t fair for anyone. He just needed to suck it up. I ignored his fuming attitude, and instead squinted up to the trees, their beautiful leaves filtering the sunlight that desperately tried to penetrate through the thick canopy. </p><p>For a moment, I let myself believe that Pico’s immediate response had saved us from suffering through an ambush. </p><p>Then, my danger senses started tingling. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one, as I looked at Pico, noticing his tenseness. “Too silent,” he whispered, just audible enough to be heard by me, not wanting to alert the guards after the earlier discussion, clearly wanting to avoid another argument. </p><p>He was right. Suddenly, the forest lost its sound, be it birds or insects. And considering we could easily hear them despite our presence, it implied nothing good about the ambush. Our earlier trick was clearly useless. </p><p>Without saying anything, Pico changed direction, moving deeper into the forest. It was a mistake, I felt, because while it gave us a chance to avoid the ambush, it also pulled us farther and farther away from people. And while being in public didn’t mean we were safe, it still significantly limited their approach. </p><p>Combined with the speed they found our trace, the earlier commotion on the road earned a new meaning. It was clearly designed in such a way deliberately, making us avoid the road, using the old trainer’s caution to their benefit. After all, it wasn’t surprising them after arranging such a complicated ambush. </p><p>I was impressed with all the effort they were putting into the ambush trying to take me out. </p><p>A minute later, Pico changed direction again, this time without a reason. The young guard spoke. “Where are we going-” he started, only to receive a slap on the back of his head from the older guard, who was much more aware of the risks. </p><p>“We’re trying to avoid the ambush, of course, moron. Shut up and follow,” he said. </p><p>That, combined with another angry glare from Pico, seemed to silence his annoying voice, at least for the moment. </p><p>However, his silence was barely a bump on the difficult road. Soon, Pico </p><p>three times, showing he was amazing in terms of instincts and tactics, but, unfortunately for him, he was playing an unfair game. Five minutes into our escape, Pico changed direction two more times, carefully covering our tracks in the process. He even pulled a small bottle of oil, and spilled it on the floor, creating a disgusting smell, to prevent our ambushers from using dogs to pick up our trail. </p><p>It was a smart, cautious strategy. Too bad that it was destined to fail, because I could feel some kind of tracking magic settling over us, making Pico’s attempts useless. It was simply an unfair battle. </p><p>Another ten minutes, and the group didn’t need to rely on Pico’s mysterious sixth sense anymore. We didn’t need it, because our attackers were close enough to be heard. “It doesn’t seem that we’ll be able to escape,” I said even as I drew my sword, mostly to make a point. “Why don’t we pick a defensible spot so that we could defend ourselves properly. I’m sure they can’t just siege us for hours.” </p><p>“Good idea,” Pico said as he looked around, pointing at a small, rocky entrance of a cave. He pointed and I nodded. The dark cave gave me so many opportunities to cast a spell. </p><p>It wasn’t empty, of course. I could feel the presence of a wild bear inside, ready to kill any intruder, but a subtle spell was enough to make its sleep much heavier. I didn’t kill it, because its presence might come useful in creating some chaos. </p><p>I walked in immediately after Pico, but before we could enter the cave, a huge mass burst into the forest. It was a large lion with a man riding on it. Normally, it would have been impossible to ride anything in such a thick forest canopy without breaking their leg — something Pico was clearly betting on, but that didn’t apply to a huge lion. </p><p>The creature had the appearance of a normal lion, though almost four times tall, rivaling a young elephant. It was an intimidating sight even without the magic radiating from its beautiful golden fur, bright enough to reveal its supernatural origins.  </p><p>“A Nemean lion,” Pico gasped in shock while the guards froze in shock. His shock was understandable, as the presence of Nemean lion confirmed that Bestiaries school joined Gallic school in their determination to snuff out Dacian school completely. It was something I had been suspecting since I heard what happened in the stables, but a squad of magical animals was quite a bit more than I had been expecting. </p><p>Pico’s gaze moved up, toward the gallant man riding the lion. “Sir Antony,” he gasped. “Is there anything I can do to help you?” he said.</p><p>However, before he could even answer, the young guard burst in. “Hell no, I’m not defending you assholes against a monster,” he said before he took a step forward. “Hey, we’re not paid enough to defend those, can we just leave,” he said as he unlatched his sword belt. The man on top of the lion said nothing, just gesturing him to move. The young guard looked at his partner, silently gesturing. </p><p>The old guard looked at Pico, his regret clear. “I’m sorry,” he simply said as he let his sword fall on the ground as well. </p><p>“Thank you for your mercy, sir,” the young guard said and started to walk. Pico was frozen with shock, not about the betrayal — which was inevitable under the circumstances — but the quickness of it. </p><p>I wasn’t entirely surprised, but nor did I act on to prevent it despite being aware of one important detail that made their attempt a foolhardy move. They had made their choice.  </p><p>They tried to walk away, but just as they were about to pass next to the lion, the creature swiped its paw twice, far faster than a creature of that size had any right to move, and a second later, two guards fell on the floor, in pieces. </p><p>An inglorious end for two idiotic traitors, unable to notice that the enemy had no intention of leaving any evidence of his involvement... </p><p>Pity, I thought. If only they could have held onto their courage for a few seconds, we might have cooperated to take down the rider, reducing the threat we were facing significantly. But after their immediate defection, it was hardly possible to organize a coordinated assault even if I had bothered to convince them. </p><p>I just needed to find a better strategy… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching the development of a beautiful chain of orgasm, starting with a voluptuous blonde and ending with a fiery redhead, temptation given form, was impossible to resist. </p><p>Luckily, there was no reason for me to actually do so. I was only delaying to watch the group dynamic between the girls — while enjoying the spectacular show developing in the process — and what I saw gave me hope that, even if I had to leave for a reason — reasons relating to the mysterious organization trying to save the world from the divine and dominate the world at the same time, mysterious angelic headmistress and her even more mysterious aims, or surprisingly sneaky lich Zokras that managed to escape with his unlife. </p><p>But with that concern laid to rest, there was nothing preventing me to walk to Marianne, positioning behind her shaking ass. Unlike Titania, she was very much aware of the sneaking presence behind her, but her only response was to raise her ass a bit more, presenting her puckered hole for me. </p><p>“Such a surprising request,” I chuckled as I dragged my finger along her tight entrance, casting the spell to prepare her entrance, only to earn a giggle that was suppressed by the endless moans of the other girls. When I pressed my shaft against her lubricated entrance, throbbing with anticipation after the lengthy show, her beautiful ass rose even further, allowing me to perfect angle to push inside. </p><p>And push inside, I did, sharply and mercilessly, only to earn a moan of strained joy as my invasion helped her to suppress her anal fixation. She didn’t try to hide her reaction the slightest, as, by that point, we had nothing left to hide from one another. Everything was out in the open. </p><p>Literally. </p><p>I started pumping, slowly, but deeply, while my gaze bounced between Marianne’s bountiful ass that was making my shaft disappear, and the panorama view of naked, busty females doing their best to bring each other pleasure, lost in their own little world. I decided to alert them to my presence, and my hand landed on Marianne’s ass in a loud spank, echoing in the room, enough to stop everyone for a fleeting second, making them notice my presence. </p><p>They continued their own acts of pleasure, of course, but their gaze stayed on the show I was providing. Since I had been enjoying their show for a long while, I decided that they deserved a proper, amazing show as well. </p><p>I reached and grabbed Marianne’s beautiful blonde hair, pulling back hard enough for her to gasp in pain, her spectacular breasts jiggling with the sudden movement. She had to put her hands on the floor to balance himself. It left Titania’s beautiful folds unattended, but she didn’t seem to care as she twisted her neck to get a better view of the show, replacing her tongue on Helga’s entrance with her fingers. </p><p>Marianne opened her mouth, trying to say something, but that was quick to die when my hand landed on her ass once more, leaving a faint pink mark in the creation process of another cracking sound. However, the jolt of pain only made her push her ass back, increasing the speed of collusion between our bodies. </p><p>At that moment, I wished that I had a third hand to grab her swaying breasts, squeezing them until my fingers left their marks to match her ass, but with one around her hair, the other busy spanking her ass, it was impossible. </p><p>Cornelia came to my help at that moment, unbidden. She left her comfortable seat — and allowing Helga to watch the show without obstruction in the process — and knelt next to Marianne, her hands landing on her breasts, filled to the brim with the presence of Marianne’s bosom as they sank into their heavenly softness. </p><p>Her expression of ecstasy was understandable. Marianne’s tits were simply magical.  </p><p>Marianne’s moans gained another layer of beauty as Cornelia’s fingers dug into her flesh, while I continued to drill her backdoor mercilessly. Her back arched beautifully as she angled herself to give me better access to her depths, tightening around me to milk me. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I murmured. And she truly was, her body shining with an inner aura as she got nearer to a climax. It hadn’t been long since we started, but she wasn’t too far away from a climax in the first place, with Cornelia’s tongue treatment followed by the joy of dominating Titania with her fingers. </p><p>And the pleasure I provided could not be easily ignored. </p><p>I spanked her ass, again, hard, earning another beautiful moan in the process. This time, it was enough to make Titania stop playing with Helga, giving her full attention to the show. </p><p>Helga went a step further and stood up, closing the distance in a couple of smoldering, erotic steps that managed to jiggle all of her assets simultaneously. She stood next to me while my shaft disappeared completely into Marianne’s tight hole, grabbed my head, and buried my face into her beautiful bosom. </p><p>My tongue jumped out immediately, assisting my lips to capture and torture her nipple, making her moans melt into Marianne’s. She just moaned, showing no desire to hide her arousal at this point. She just closed her eyes, and accepted the invasion of pleasure while my tongue reoriented itself to the contrast between the softness of her breasts and the hardness of her nipples. </p><p> Meanwhile, Titania decided to join the new situation in an indirect way. She climbed on the bed, opened her legs wide, and her fingers disappeared into her wet folds, giving me an amazing solo show to complete the set. Her other hand landed on her breasts, kneading them with an aggressiveness that overwhelmed Cornelia’s. Her eyes stayed locked on the amazing show we were providing, however. </p><p>My hand landed on Marianne’s ass again, but this time, gently caressing the curves of her ass, glowing red with my repeated slaps, rather than spanking her once more. The sudden contrast was more than enough to trigger the climax she was courting. Her ass tightened to a spectacular degree, which pushed me to climax as well. </p><p>I decided to give her another reward along with my seed filling her bowels, helping her gain another level in the process. </p><p>[-3965 Mana]</p><p>The combined pleasure of climaxing and leveling up was enough to sap her arms’ ability to keep her upright. Luckily for her, I was quick to cast a levitation spell, floating her to the bed. She collapsed, her eyes fluttering as she battled the overwhelming desire to collapse unconscious. </p><p>At this moment, I had a difficult choice to make. Which girl to assist next. Helga, who was still trying to suffocate me with her beautiful tits. Cornelia, who was getting in the mood after assisting me in assaulting Marianne. </p><p>Or Titania, who was still playing with herself, watching from a distance, I added in my mind. The decision made, I dashed toward the raven-haired beauty. I put my arms around her waist, and a few quick steps later, she found herself smashed against the wall, pinned in place with my body pressing hard against hers.</p><p>“What-” she tried to say, shocked by the sudden change of pace, but her lips were already silenced by mine, muffling the following moan as I slipped inside her wet tightness. She clamped around, her hips responding automatically. </p><p>“Someone missed me, after our long break,” I said mockingly, considering it hadn’t even been a day since our last time together. She tried to give me a frustrated look at my teasing, but she soon learned that it was a difficult expression to achieve with my shaft repeatedly invading her beautiful core. </p><p>“Asshole,” she murmured a while later, though her intended insult wasn’t as effective with her legs wrapping around my waist tightly and her voice tinged with pleasure. </p><p>“We can do that as well if that’s what you want,” I said mockingly as I pulled out, pressing my shaft against her puckered hole, only for her eyes to widen in panic. “Just joking,” I said as I delved back into her wetness mercilessly, earning a beautiful cry in the process. </p><p>“I’ll make you pay,” she gasped, but once again, unable to gather even a playful amount of anger, drowned in moans of pleasure. </p><p>I chuckled as I continued to pump inside her, invading her whole being with pleasure once more. It was a pity that the Divine spark was depleted, preventing me from earning another level, though that hardly impacted the pleasure I was gaining from her beautiful tightness. </p><p>A glance behind showed that Cornelia and Helga decided not to waste any time waiting for me, and melted into a beautiful hug, exploring each other’s bodies intensely, showing just how far their acrimonious enmity had developed into a carnal friendship. </p><p>I turned my attention back to Titania, my hands landing on her hips before I cut loose, ramming repeatedly until her moans filled the room. Her legs, shaking and trembling, signaling an incoming orgasm, tightened around my waist further and further, imprisoning me in place. </p><p>Not that I had any intention of escaping, I thought even as I erupted inside. I was not strong enough to help her level up further — at least, not yet — but that didn’t prevent me from helping her recover the mana she had exhausted trying to defend the town against Zokras. </p><p>[-1318 Mana]</p><p>“Yes!” she moaned, my mana-laced seed working as a stimulant, making her legs tighten around me once more and her hips danced. </p><p>Luckily, with my supernatural constitution was more than ready to fight against her second wind. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 2931  / 7750        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 18/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Helga’s sudden betrayal added an unexpected twist to the game, enough for Marianne to stall her aggressive treatment of her redheaded friend and share a smirk with Helga, reflecting camaraderie. A deserved one, as between them, it was clear that they were the meeker duo. </p><p>It was a testament to their incredible development since our first time. </p><p>I just sat lazily as Helga pulled out of my lap and walked to Titania, who was watching her like a cute deer facing a sudden fireball. Her shock was clear, so much that, if it wasn’t for the arousal that was rapidly rising underneath, I would have intervened to stop her. </p><p>“Impress me,” I whispered to Helga, a simple spell ensuring she was the only one that heard the whisper. The slight skip of her step was the only indicator she had registered my comment as she continued toward Titania, the head librarian, the scariest mage of Silver Spires. </p><p>Though, naked and shivering in arousal, she was having trouble radiating the field of intimidation she was famous for. </p><p>Helga stood in front of her, took a deep breath. “Don’t move,” she whispered, filling me with anticipation as she leaned forward… </p><p>Only to grab the ice cube that had been our focus for the last several minutes. My eyes widened as I felt Helga’s magic wrapping around the cube, increasing the intensity of the cold, just enough to feel uncomfortable even with their supernatural resistance. </p><p>Titania gasped beautifully when Helga brought the cube around her nipple, tracing the lines of her rosy nipple. Unfortunately, I didn’t enjoy the sight as much as I should have been, because it came with an annoying warning. </p><p>[+317 Experience]</p><p>[Warning! Divine Spark is depleted. Connect with more Divine Sparks to continue supporting the System of ———]</p><p>It was frustrating, because I managed to get only get one level in the process, rather underwhelming compared to my expectations. It wasn’t all bad, as I also received a few critical Achievements and progressed Titania’s companion progress further, and almost completed a second level. Even if the Achievements and the Companion Process took less power than I assumed, a sliver of Divine Spark was enough to give me two levels. </p><p>Rather useful, considering the headmistress arranged approximately a week of sessions. </p><p>More importantly, the beautiful sight of Helga bending over Titania, her beautiful ass on display, went a long way to take the sting out of the unwelcome warning, suggesting the depletion of my energy, once again suspiciously close to another level up, like it was trying to tempt me to hurry up. </p><p>It was not impossible for it to be just a coincidence, of course, but after learning the history of the System and the abnormality of my own variant, a little paranoia might actually help me immensely. </p><p>Then, Helga brought the ice cube over Titania’s nipple, earning another gasp, pulling my attention to the present violently. Helga was making a beautiful spectacle of herself even as she forced Titania to moan sexily, deliberately positioning so that I could see the way her beautiful ass shook repeatedly. She achieved the impossible, and somehow made my arousal enhance even further. </p><p>And that was before she leaned forward, pressing her lips over Titania’s neck, kissing, licking, and sucking. Combined with the other show Marianne was providing, it was the proof of my patience that I managed to sit and watch rather than jump to join. </p><p>But that would be rude, ruining the heartfelt effort of my sexy blonde friends. I just sat, stroking my shaft gently while Titania’s free moans mixed into Cornelia’s muffled ones. </p><p>Whether it was the game, or her arousal, but Titania accepted Helga’s overreach passively, without the slightest disagreement, even when Helga’s kisses climbed up slowly, first to the edge of her chin, leaving small, hesitant touches, then to her lips… </p><p>Her hands picked a different direction. The hand that was holding the ice cube stayed around her breasts, teasing her skin with the direct touch of the ice cube, no doubt leaving swathes of cold on her otherwise burning skin. Her other hand traveled down, moving between Titania’s legs, invading her core, defenseless after the forfeits of our little game. </p><p>As Helga’s fingers disappeared into Titania, bringing the pleasure she was feeling to the next level, started to moan helplessly. It was soft, gentle, but above all else, deliciously aggressive. And it wasn’t just her moans that turned aggressive. Her lips started to devour Helga’s with a shocking passion, surprising Helga in the process. </p><p>Though, Helga didn’t seem to be too concerned about the horny, desperate kiss she was receiving, immediately responding in kind. Lost in a fugue of pleasure, Helga tongue-wrestled the domineering head librarian, all the while bouncing up and down, her assets shaking amazingly, tempting me to join them.</p><p>I managed to resist the temptation, preferring to watch their show to completion, but it was a difficult call, especially when Titania finally ignored Helga’s order for her to stay still, only to grab her bountiful tits, her small hands overflowing with their presence even as she frantically kneaded them. </p><p>A glistening appreciation started to appear between Helga’s legs, her wetness getting even more intense. </p><p>Soon, they changed position. Titania directed Helga to lay on the bed, next to Cornelia, while she knelt beside her. I felt the anticipation as she pulled the ice cube between Helga’s fingers, dragging it over Helga’s stomach, earning a beautiful gasp in the process. </p><p>It was a scene of intense sensuality, especially when the ice cube started to move down, teasing Helga’s sensitive inner thighs, much to her aroused chagrin. </p><p>Still, her eyes closed under the rush of pleasure, and her legs widened invitingly. </p><p>Titania had been quite shy when it came to the matters of the flesh, but it was magical just how much one could change under a crash course on eroticism delivered by me. After all, it wasn’t even the first girl-on-girl action Titania had lived through, and after pushing through the shock of losing, she was quick to adapt. </p><p>She leaned down further and pressed her lips to Helga’s quivering core, her tongue already out to tease her knob. Meanwhile, her fingers still clenched around the ice cube, using it to deliver the occasional caresses of teasing to jolt Helga in shock. </p><p>The combination worked excellently, and soon, Helga was moaning deliciously, getting particularly intense whenever the cube touched one of her deliciously sensitive nipples. </p><p>However, Titania’s domineering position didn’t last long. Lost in her task, she didn’t notice Marianne leaving her enjoyable seat. She slowly rose from her comfortable source of joy, her pale breasts swinging beautifully as she sauntered across the short divide between her earlier seat and Titania, her posture filling me with anticipation. She was like a beautiful song, echoing endlessly. </p><p>She sent me an alluring glare, adding another temptation for me to abandon my observer spot and join the main event. Somehow, I managed to suppress that, licking my lips to suppress the desire even as she bent over behind Titania. </p><p>Titania didn’t notice the movement behind her, too focused on her task. Well, not until a single finger slipped inside her, at least. It occurred gently, yet smoothly, her wetness already reached a crazy degree, reducing the resistance to zero, but that didn’t prevent Titania from moaning in shocked pleasure. </p><p>Titania looked back, only to meet with Marianne’s mocking grin. “You looked like you needed help,” she said with a delicious shrug that made her huge breasts jiggle invitingly, but that detail was missed by Titania when Marianne quickly added a second and third finger to her initial invasion, pushing Titania’s arousal to the next level. “Don’t let me keep you from your task,” she added even as she moved closer, grabbing Titania’s beautiful raven hair, pushing it between Helga’s legs. </p><p>I was seriously liking this new aggressive Marianne. </p><p>“Good work,” Helga managed to say before Titania’s tongue started working on her entrance, pushing her cries to a new level. However, her passionate dance didn’t prevent Titania’s hips from gyrating around Marianne’s aggressive fingers. </p><p>It was a beautiful sight even before Cornelia managed to catch her breath and join the beautiful dance, sitting on Helga’s face. Helga’s tongue jumped out immediately, replicating the service she was receiving from Titania, creating the most beautiful chain I had ever seen…</p><p>My heart was pumping viciously as I drank the delicious view, struggling to stay in my place. I did my best to resist the temptation of the siren’s call. Not permanently, of course, but just a while, giving them a chance to properly deliver their show. Watching them as they put a wholehearted show for me was the least I could do to pay for their great effort. </p><p>My hand clenched around my shaft, moving up and down lazily, hoping to provide some relief from the arousal the show provided. Which got considerably harder as Marianne leaned over Titania, pressing her beautiful tits to her back even as her fingers lashed in aggressively. </p><p> And her ass, her bountiful, inviting ass, shook with every pump of her fingers, inviting me to be a part of that beautiful chain, turning resistance into an overwhelming challenge. </p><p>Maybe resistance was overrated. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 493210 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 5932  / 7750        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 18/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I leaned back, the warmth of the bubbling water contrasting nicely with the chilly evening breeze, my attempts to relax failed rather spectacularly. It wasn’t my fault. The scene of Tiffany playing with Umi like a particularly playful lioness playing with her prey was invigorating, and waiting hardly helped to my mood. </p><p>Luckily, the rooftop had an amazing view of the sea and the city. </p><p>About twenty minutes after I got into the hot tub, however, I finally heard the door open, marking the entrance of my guests. I had lived a fast life, with a lot of memorable activities, but the sight of Umi and Tiffany walking toward me, one shy enough to be on the edge of the panic, the other smug, both intensely aroused, was good enough to gain a position in the hall of fame of my memories. </p><p>Especially when Tiffany tugged Umi’s towel off, revealing the sight of her amazing body, wearing a very skimpy bikini, one that might as well not exist. It was a beautiful black set, barely more than a bunch of strings, contrasting greatly with the sensual paleness of her skin. The fact that the bikini belonged to Tiffany who was even curvier than Umi, making the bikini hang loosely made her even sexier. She was like a younger sister stealing her older sister’s clothing to look mature. </p><p>Perfect to complete her aura of innocence. </p><p>As they continued to close in — though Umi blushed harder with each step — Tiffany let her towel slide down as well, revealing a white matching bikini. However, despite the color, there was nothing innocent about the way she looked, her each step an ode to arousal. </p><p>I wanted to catch Umi’s eyes, but she was already on the edge, looking at the slightest excuse to escape. So, rather than commenting on their beauty, I just nodded before turning my gaze back to the view, no matter how much I wanted to tease my innocent Asian beauty. </p><p>True to her personality, Umi tried to sit on the farthest part of the hot tub, which was actually enough to be considered distant under the circumstances, with a tub large enough to easily host a dozen people. I didn’t need to do anything, though. Tiffany interfered, hugging Umi’s waist even as she directed her next to me, whispering something into her ear in the process. </p><p>Whatever she whispered had clearly worked as soon, as Umi slid next to my right, and Tiffany slid to my left. Umi still tried to lean back, and while in contrast, Tiffany leaned against my arm, her beautiful breasts pressing against my arm. </p><p>Even without looking, I could feel Umi’s mind going blank, not only overwhelmed by her almost-nakedness and our closeness, but what happened back in Tiffany’s room. </p><p>She was like a helpless leaf, being dragged along a gently flowing river. </p><p>“I hope we didn’t keep you waiting for long?” Tiffany whispered in an exaggerated innocent tone. </p><p>“A bit,” I said. “What were you girls doing alone for that long?” I asked innocently, looking at Umi as I did so. </p><p>Her blush intensified immediately, her guilt apparent, so much that even without a real-time feed of the events, I could have roughly guessed what had happened. </p><p>She was really innocent. </p><p>“Nothing much, just preparation,” Tiffany said, pulling Umi from the obligation, giving her a chance to acclimate. </p><p>I let the answer satisfy me rather than pushing for more. The final phase of our little game had just started. We were alone in a private location, one that successfully masqueraded as a public spot to keep her from panicking. Still, rather than escalating the situation immediately, I asked an inane question to Tiffany, and she answered, consuming the next couple of minutes with small talk. Umi didn’t join other than nodding. She even tried to slide away, but I killed that attempt by grabbing her wrist gently, pulling her close. </p><p>She just obeyed.</p><p>Tiffany broke through the pointless small talk first. “So, boss, do you like our bikinis,” she asked.</p><p>“I don’t know,” I answered. “You slipped into the water too quickly, and the bubbles prevents me from seeing it. Why don’t you stand up and show me properly.” </p><p>Tiffany didn’t waste a second before standing up, her beautiful body even more beautiful covered with water drops, glistening, and the steam of the hot tub adding a beautiful aura to her beauty. She posed a few times, each stretching a different aspect of her deficient bikini, tempting me to ignore the aim of the evening and just pull her to my lap. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I said before turning to Umi. “Why don’t you give us a show as well, honey?” </p><p>Umi was distracted by the show Tiffany was providing even more than I was. “R-right now?” </p><p> “As long as you feel comfortable with it, sweetie,” I said magnanimously, aware that Tiffany wouldn’t let it be the case. </p><p>It worked as I expected. “Maybe-” she stammered, only for it to be interrupted as Tiffany leaned forward — giving an excellent cleavage in the process as her bosom struggled against her top — and grabbed Umi’s arm, pulling her up her feet enthusiastically. </p><p>She stood up, but with her arms around her chest to hide her cleavage, and her side view to limit the view, she represented a completely different view than Tiffany. “Come on, sweetie,” Tiffany whispered, this time loud enough to be heard even through the bubbling. “Show him just how good the bikini I had picked.” </p><p>Umi followed her suggestion, her arms falling to her side. She might be feeling self-conscious, but her body clearly disagreed with it. Her nipples peeked through the fabric of the bikini — not that it took a lot to push through the thin fabric — and her out-of-control breathing that enhanced her cleavage each time just enhanced the impact. </p><p>“I’m sorry to say Umi looks even better than you,” I said to Tiffany, shaking my head playfully. </p><p>“No!” she gasped, equally playfully, though Umi was too distracted to catch the tone, and actually panicked. </p><p>“I’m not-” she tried to say, only to be prevented by a finger by Tiffany. </p><p>“No, sweetie, the jury has spoken. But I can’t suffer such indignity,” she said. While Umi tried to explain herself, Tiffany’s arms reached her back, and with a pull, freed her breasts from the dominance of her top. </p><p>“How’s it now?” she asked with enthusiasm as she bounced on her feet, which made her perky breasts dance beautifully repeatedly, making my mouth water in the process. </p><p>“Much better. It’s a miracle that you managed to stuff those beauties in your bikini,” I said. </p><p>“It’s nothing, you should see Umi’s,” she said, and before Umi could even react, she grabbed the string, and pulled her top as well. Umi tried to grab to prevent it, which, unfortunately, resulted in a predictable accident. The delicate top just snapped, while Umi stumbled backward very dangerously. </p><p>As a true gentleman, I jumped up to my feet and did my duty, and grabbed Umi’s waist before she could experience painful collusion. With my arms around her waist, my chest pressing against her back, she was spared from a painful hit to the edge. </p><p>Her mind drowned with adrenaline, it took a couple of seconds for her to realize the significance of the hug from behind, especially in the light of her lack of a top, giving me an excellent view of her breasts thanks to our height difference. </p><p>“Y-you can let me go, I’m balanced,” she whispered, but made no attempt trying to pull out of my arms, lacking the initiative to do so. She was overwhelmed by the fact that I was hugging her naked body, so much that she missed my current nakedness even as my shaft rubbed against her back. </p><p>I never liked to wear swimsuits in a hot tub. </p><p>“Are you sure?” I said, but kept my arms around her waist, moving slightly, curious whether she would notice the nature of the thing that was pressing against her back. </p><p>She didn’t, too busy raising her hands to cover her breasts, though her small hands weren’t very successful on that. Still, even not completely successful, it had a useful effect, it allowed me to suppress my desire to suck her beautiful nipples. “Please,” murmured. </p><p>“As you wish, sweetie,” I said even as I let her go and sat back, hiding my erection under the bubbly water. Umi tried to sit down with both hands covering her breasts, which proved to be a mistake. The hot tub wasn’t the most stable footing, and without her arms, once slipped, she was once again about to fall down. </p><p>This time, I didn’t bother standing up, instead just grabbed her and pulled her to my lap to prevent her from falling. </p><p>“T-thanks,” she stammered as she tried to slide away from my lap, but this time, my arm stayed around her waist. “I s-should go back to my seat.” </p><p>“You better stay here,” I whispered into her ear, which was more than enough for her nerves to short circuit. “I have a feeling that you’ll injure yourself if I let you go.” </p><p>“But-” she started, shuffling, only to freeze again. This time, it wasn’t my words or Tiffany’s finger this time. No, this time, it was simply her awareness, finally realizing what was poking her from behind for a while, and the very distinct lack of coverage of that poking appendage. </p><p>Umi pulled one of her hands away from her breasts, trying to use only one arm to cover her breasts — which was as unsuccessful as one might expect, creating a beautiful scene when combined with the bubbling surface and the steam — while other dipped under the water, caressing my waist, trying to validate her fear, that I had no swimsuit. </p><p>“You,” she gasped. She tried to turn me to say that, but froze immediately as the movement rubbed her beautiful ass against my shaft. </p><p>“Ssh,” I whispered into her ear. “Let’s keep that a secret from Tiffany. I don’t want to feel self-conscious.” </p><p>It was nonsense, of course, as I had been standing just seconds ago, which meant Tiffany had already seen the lack of underwear, not to mention I was the one that chose to dip without underwear. </p><p>But Umi was too confused to think properly. The realization of my nakedness and our closeness, mixed with the shock from her naked state and her adrenaline from her dangerous fall, was enough to send her into the arms of confusion. The other stuff, like Tiffany’s teasing earlier and her first experience with a female, earlier just made it an inevitability rather than a likely outcome. </p><p>My gaze met with Tiffany, who was smiling victoriously as she leaned back — which displayed her beautiful breasts perfectly. She didn’t say anything, but the message was clear. </p><p>She had done her job. </p><p>Now, it was my turn.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I walked away from the treasury, there was a renewed excitement in my steps, which was only partially about dominating the Queen in her throne room and treasury, no matter how exciting it had been. </p><p>For the first time in a long while, I felt truly safe. </p><p>I was confident in my abilities, both martial and magic, but that didn’t change the fact that until that moment, I was woefully under-prepared for any real challenge, safe only until discovery. But the three items in my possession, the Tether of the Underworld, the Blade of Shadows, and the Shield of Ether, expanded my options greatly in case I met a true danger. </p><p>I was as close to invincible as I had been for a long while, even more than the time I was on the throne. Having the throne had a lot of advantages. It came with an amazing castle, many loyal — for a given value of loyalty — servants, and an untold number of weapons, magic books, and other miscellaneous things that could be used to protect me. </p><p>But it came with a big disadvantage. A lack of mobility, meaning when, unexpectedly, the Empire decided to ally with the dark families, they had ample time to prepare before hitting. And unfortunately, no static defense, no matter how expertly prepared, was enough to push back a masterful assault. </p><p>Of course, possession of three items — even if each was strong enough to earn their place in legends — didn’t mean that I could defend myself against the army that took down my castle. But unlike that time, I had nothing that was tying down me there, and I could escape easily, especially since no force could easily use an army to flood the Palace. Not the dark forces, and not even the Empire unless Sapphire wanted nobles to panic, thinking she was committing to a military coup to forcefully alter the balance. </p><p>So, the only thing that could really take me down was a dedicated elite task force, assaulting me under a combined assault of overwhelming magic and surgical melee attacks. The shield was perfect to remove the danger of the offensive magic, able to absorb almost all offensive magic, while the blade gave me the opportunity to employ my favorite melee combat style, hit and run. </p><p>With the tether preventing me from falling into any kind of ward-based ambush, I was safer than the time I was the dark lord. </p><p>Or at least, I would have been, I thought with a frown as I focused on the earlier discovery. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the mysterious third party that somehow interfered with the wards of the throne room. </p><p>So, rather than going back to my cell for a well-deserved rest, I decided to check the collected wisdom of the Empire. Maybe I could find some kind of clue about the roots, because I was coming up quite short. </p><p>Palace library, especially the restricted section, wasn’t the biggest or best library of the empire, not even close. There were several bigger, more famous libraries, such as the great library of mage guild, the alchemist’s information repository, or even the famous public library of the capital. </p><p>Unfortunately, breaking through them was not exactly easy. </p><p>That was not to say that Palace Library protections were inferior to them, of course. The content might be lacking, but the same definitely didn’t apply to defenses. On the contrary, the palace library was supposed to be protected even more strictly than the rest of them — with the important exception of the library of the mage guild — but luckily, my cell and the secret tunnels that were leading to them was conveniently behind those dangerous protections, making my entry a trivial achievement. </p><p>I would have loved to access the library of the mage guild, of course, but I had no intention of dealing with the recluse archmages that led the guild, not even with the Shield in my possession. </p><p>Just as I expected, by using the secret tunnels, breaking into the library took only seconds, and I found myself the depths of the restricted section, where the scary wards prevented anyone without the express permission of the royal family from entering. </p><p>I started walking around the shelves, unafraid of being noticed thanks to the over-the-top security, making an inventory of the books available. </p><p>My first target was the magic books, some of the most precious books that were possessed by the royal family, which now included several precious tomes from my own hoard, making me nostalgic. I focused on books on runes, wards, and other core abilities, creating a small pile before preparing to put my most underrated ability to use. </p><p>Speed reading. </p><p>It was one of the bigger misconceptions about being a dark lord, or any kind of noble: the number of documents one needed to process every day to be successful. Of course, that didn’t mean that all nobles had the ability. No, whether in the Empire or belonging to Dark Families, most employed scribes and secretaries to handle the data properly, only focusing on the high-level picture.  </p><p>I believed myself to be an exception to that. </p><p>However, most nobles were born to their lofty positions, unaware of how many little small tricks could be applied to an aggregate report without lying once, resulting in them getting manipulated little ways. Mostly, it was about money, a couple of silver lost here, a gold coin diverted there, but sometimes, it was more important things. </p><p>A report that was conveniently lost in the non-urgent pile, a report from the border whose recommendations softened appropriately to protect their noble patrons… The chips they left on the otherwise pristine structure of a demesne were simple, almost impossible to notice, but enough of them, and it would collapse under its weight. </p><p>Devil was always buried in the detail, just like an assassin's dagger buried in the back of their target. And usually, just as deadly… </p><p>I forget the number of spies I identified just by secretly reading their aggregated reports and comparing them with the information they had access to. Unfortunately, it was tough, time-intensive work, even with the spells to enhance my perception. Of course, I hardly removed these spies, as a discovered spy might be one of the most useful tools in the world, allowing me to manipulate the information flow however I wished. </p><p>Skimming ability had been an integral part of my career as a dark lord. </p><p>And just like then, the skimming ability was proving to be very useful at the moment as well. With my eyes dancing on the endless records of the dynastic magical records, wards, and runes, strengthening my already impressive magical knowledge further. </p><p>Unfortunately, after four hours of aggressive reading, I failed to find anything related to my real target, the mysterious wards. </p><p>With a sigh, I turned my attention to a dusty section that held the memoirs and personal notes of the Emperors and great heroes, some of them even belonging to the man who first forged and used the Shield of Ether that was weighing on my back. </p><p>Maybe history would help where the magic failed, I thought as I lost myself in a world of military, political tricks, magical victories, all filled with exaggerated details to put the reigning king into a better perspective, it was time-consuming to find the specific clues I had been hoping for, even with speed reading. </p><p>After browsing the few recent ones — and failing to find anything useful — I changed my approach once again, and started working on the recordings of the oldest kings, the kind that went considerably more than a thousand-year in the past. </p><p>Reading them was a true chore, as while the language was technically the same, the great time gap meant significant language drift, slowing my reading speed significantly for me to even have a semi-consistent picture of the information on there.  </p><p>It was not a waste, however, as the old records had some interesting implications. In particular, a period was known as the age of seven kings. That period, despite its fancy name, was quite infamous, because, despite its lofty name, it covered a period of three years. Going through seven kings in three years, no matter the metric, was not a sign of great success. It was a period lost in history, before the Dark Families were even a thing, therefore something I had little information about. I had just assumed that it was classical cloak and dagger stuff. </p><p>The diaries, however, disagreed with the conclusion, at least to a point. Their recording was still mostly about their internal political tricks, but more than one diary mentioned a growing threat at the north, though mostly in passing. </p><p>I might have still ignored those, if it wasn’t for a couple of ripped pages. Not just edited out or ignored, but pages ripped out carelessly rather than editing the whole sections, which was a very interesting choice considering the historical value of those diaries. </p><p>Even more, interestingly, I also found a few references to mysterious helpers with some impressive magical capabilities, but unfortunately, the wording about them was very vague, but a deliberate kind of vague, like they were afraid of mentioning those names. </p><p>However, before I could go deeper into my research, I noticed a movement in the library, only to see a familiar redhead… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I would have loved to go back and start working on Atia, whose house was the most likely candidate for having the precious books Caesar had collected during his conquests. Unfortunately, doing so without raising any suspicion was much harder. </p><p>In the end, I needed to bet on the fact that our night together was memorable enough that they would reach the gladiator school again for my presence. </p><p>Luckily, I was confident enough in my sexual abilities to make such a bet. </p><p>So, instead of going back to the bath to wake Atia up and earning her ire, I stayed in the library, focusing on some of the more practically applicable spells, particularly the way the estate wards had been set up. </p><p>After some search, I found a book that held a reasonably complete breakdown of the wards of the estate, and I did my best to memorize them. It didn’t hold the method of taking control of the wards, but that didn’t make the records useless. Knowing the exact nature of the wards that surrounded the estate, and how their nature was twisted to conceal their true structure, would help immensely if one day I decided to sneak inside directly. </p><p>Of course, it was just enough to turn the task to very hard instead of suicidal, because the library record was just about the static aspects of the defense. The estate had many other defenses, patrolling mage guards, slave soldiers, and many other wards on the surface that weren’t important enough to be included in the current recording. </p><p>Also, examining the way those ancient wards were embedded into the spiritual nature of the mountain was an interesting academic read. Pity I didn’t have the time to take my time, unraveling its mysteries, in particular the connection between the runes and the natural magic flow of the area surrounding the estate. </p><p>However, I didn’t have too much time to waste. As the first rays of dawn started to spill inside the estate, I had already left the library and took the same road back, going back to the library. I slid between sleeping naked figures of  Atia and Olivia, chuckling as they instinctively hugged me, sandwiching me in between. </p><p>Pity that a repeat was not on the table. I closed my eyes, and started to snore softly to fake sleep before dispelling the subtle sleeping spell I had placed on them to keep them sleeping. </p><p>Soon, Olivia started stirring. Soon, she ripped herself out of my arms with a panicked expression that I didn’t need to see to imagine. Her shock was to be expected, not because she had sex with a slave — which was an acceptable hobby for a noblewoman as long as she had the sense to keep it reasonably concealed from the men in her life — but because she allowed a slave to thoroughly dominate her. </p><p>Luckily, her movements woken up Atia as well. “Did we just-” Atia gasped in shock as she pulled back even more hurriedly. </p><p>Atia’s shock was enough to suppress any explosive reaction Olivia might have, as she positioned herself superior to her friend when it came to matters of lust. “Yes, sweetie, you’re not a virgin anymore,” Olivia said mockingly. </p><p>“But with a slave!” Atia gasped as she shuffled to her feet, tempting me to look to examine her beautiful body’s dance. But I kept my eyes closed, not wanting to alert Olivia just in case. </p><p>“Come on, honey, just a slave, think of him as a toy,” Olivia said dismissively. “It’s not like he really matters. What matters is your pleasure.” However, despite her words, I could sense the tenseness in Olivia’s tone, suggesting that after some sleep, she didn’t like the level of liberties I had taken toward the end of the night. </p><p>Fortunately, she was doing her best to look confident to defend her reputation for her friend. </p><p>“If you say so,” Atia murmured, missing Olivia’s tenseness in her distracted state. I was curious about how the discussion would continue, but they walked away as they spoke, leaving me alone in the bath… </p><p>An hour later, a servant came, bringing my clothes along before leading me out from one of the servant entrances, a significant difference considering the exalted position I held earlier. </p><p>I just chuckled at the contrast. </p><p>However, my good mood did only last until I met with Pico at the entrance. This time, he only had two bodyguards with him, a great contrast to eight bodyguards that accompanied us the night before to prevent an ambush. </p><p>With his hands around the blade, squeezing hard enough to turn his fingers pure white, something was clearly wrong. “No invitation for breakfast?” he said, trying to sound light, but his tenseness revealed that it was not just a male joke after a night of pleasure. He was subtly asking me whether I had managed to earn enough pull to stay in the estate for the rest of the day, while the school handled whatever challenge they were facing that prevented them from sending a full team. </p><p>The answer to his question was positive. After the night I had, if I pushed a bit, I could have arranged to stay through Atia even if Olivia was reluctant, though that would have made it very hard for me to apply the other parts of my plan. </p><p>I was just a gladiator with significant martial skill and nothing else rather than a sorcerer with great experience, I would be willing to sacrifice a future advantage to defend myself. However, arranging a ‘mysterious’ mage helping us to save us from an ambush was the superior option, so I shook my head. </p><p>To his credit as a warrior, Piko just nodded in acceptance as he turned and started to walk with deceptively soft steps, ready to lash against any threat. And, the moment we were half a mile away from the estate, he gestured one of the bodyguards, who passed a sword to me. “Be ready for anything,” he said. </p><p>“Always,” I answered as I held the sword, displaying my readiness to him. “So, is there a reason to expect trouble, or this is just general caution.” </p><p>“Ludus Magnus called for an emergency meeting today, just a few minutes after some of the creatures in our stables went crazy and wounding half of our bodyguards,” he explained. </p><p>“And you don’t believe it’s just an innocent coincidence, how suspicious,” I said, sarcasm dripping from my tone. Piko let out a dark, sharp laughter, but said nothing. </p><p>His tenseness was understandable, and not just because of horrible timing. Ludus Gallicus was the main rival of the Dacian School, and that was dangerous enough. But with Ludus Magnus, the clear superiority of the four great schools, calling the meeting, it suggested that they either had a pull enough to make them call a meeting, or at least they had an ally in a high place, informing them about the meeting at the same time. </p><p>And, to make things even more interesting, the School of Bestiaries was another suspicious point. According to what I know, they were supposed to be happy with their neutral position, their niche unchallenged. But considering the trick they pulled against me in the arena included one of their beasts, and the earlier altercation in the stable also fell under their purview… It might easily be a coincidence, of course, but with my childhood, I never trusted coincidences. </p><p>Especially the ones with impeccable timing. </p>",

    "content": "<p>With her anger properly stoked, Titania didn’t even waste a second before launching another attack, though this time, she managed to keep her strength contained enough not to make it shatter. Unfortunately for her, deflecting it was still within my abilities, even with my attention split between many interesting activities that were going on in the room. </p><p>Despite her amusement at Titania’s loss of control, Cornelia was quick to join the assault, even poking Marianne to remind her about her task, though her wandering eyes suggested that Marianne’s distraction was working on her as much as it did on me. Though, Marianne looked a bit too distracted for Cornelia to be successful, she still made an effort. </p><p>A telekinetic field flared around to prevent their attacks from succeeding before I turned my attention back to Helga. My fingers dug through her hair, giving a tug hard enough to be slightly painful, much to Helga’s moaning appreciation. Her torso started to move up and down with a renewed fervor, her lips working overtime. </p><p>Before I turned my attention fully to Helga, I delivered a few counter attacks, until both Cornelia and Titania lost all their remaining clothing, using their aggressive focus excellently. </p><p>“Aggression does not work without a smidgen of defense to prevent deadly counter-attacks,” I said with an elegant manner, one that would have been fitting to a classroom, though Helga’s enthusiastic moans as she rubbed her beautiful naked body against my shaft turned that statement into teasing rather than a serious comment.</p><p>“I’ll show you aggression,” Titania growled before she cast another spell, this time letting her spell touch Helga directly. Helga suddenly rose from her knees, no doubt following a prearranged strategy, though, if her sudden enthusiasm was any indicator, it was clearly not something she was having any problem with. </p><p>As Helga stood in front of me, I sent one last glance to the other three before turning my full focus on them. Titania was preparing for a renewed assault, while Cornelia was poking Marianne again, trying to bring her attention back to the game, but not attaining success at the moment. </p><p>Then, my full attention turned to Helga as she slid on my lap, her wetness rubbing against my erection. Her back arched, presenting her tits deliciously for my attention as she pushed her chest out at me.</p><p>Since I was a gentleman, I didn’t leave them unattended, grabbing them aggressively, their presence heavy yet soft in my palms as my fingers teased her nipples. Her moans rose, far too genuine to be a part of their little plan to score a hit. </p><p>Titania continued to attack, but since Cornelia and Marianne were yet to join, I kept my attention on Helga. I leaned forward and put my lips on her neck, where one of her most sensitive spots lay, and started kissing and nibbling, the pleasure hitting her aggressively, particularly effective after a day filled with danger and adrenaline. Her hips started to move even more aggressively. It was yet to slip inside, but each moan echoed beautifully regardless. </p><p>I wanted to tease her a bit more before moving to the next step, but her urgent moans quickly built up to a degree that was quite arduous for me to bear. So, I let my hands slide down from her bountiful breasts to her thick hips, raising her up, only to slam her down mercilessly to my erection, her delicious puffy lips wrapped around my shaft desperately, enveloping me with her wetness. </p><p>“Harder,” she gasped, showing that she had no problem with my aggressive intrusion. I tightened my grip around her hips to raise her up, only to slam her down even harder, the sound echoing in the room beautifully. For that moment, I ignored the defenses, focusing on the way I was invading Helga’s beautiful core, her tits rubbing against my chest with each push while her face buried into my neck, desperately trying to add a modicum of suppression to her moans, yet failing spectacularly. </p><p>Though, as I invaded her beautiful body, the attacks I received lessened. I started ignoring my defenses. It was likely a ploy to defeat me, of course, but at some point, it was impossible to keep my focus up. </p><p>Also, fulfilling a sexy request from four beautiful naked ladies was hardly the worst chore one could imagine. </p><p>\"Mmm!\" Helga moaned as she grabbed my hair painfully, losing her muscle control as the pleasure invaded her body. I tightened my grip around her glorious ass in response, squeezing until her moans got even louder. A minute passed just like that. </p><p>Such a magical sensation.</p><p>Only when Helga’s back arched once again while orgasm hit, I focused back again the game when the ice cube had a sudden trajectory change. It was surprising that they weren’t able to score a hit during my distracted state despite their alliance, I thought even as I prepared to defend… </p><p>Only to realize it was completely unnecessary, because I wasn’t the target of the ice cube, Cornelia was. </p><p>And Marianne was responsible. </p><p>She was quite merciless, delivering a few hits in quick succession before Cornelia could even realize the sudden shift. The poor girl was still trying to convince Marianne to join back the game. The cube landed on Cornelia’s body in quick succession, not only obligating her to remove all of her clothing, but also forcing Cornelia to follow her orders. </p><p>“Betrayal,” Cornelia gasped in shock, though it was more playful kind, which showed her character development more than anything. Before she got involved in my tender mercies, even playful aggression like that would have been enough to trigger her dangerously. </p><p>“Lie down,” Marianne ordered as she finally stood up. Cornelia followed her request, only for Marianne to sit on her face. “It’s time to work,” she ordered. </p><p>Poor Cornelia. She succeeded in her mission to pull Marianne away from her masturbation, just not the way she had been expecting. </p><p>As Cornelia’s tongue started massaging her from under, Marianne was still having some fun on her own, her fingers dancing around her beautiful nipples. </p><p>I put my hands around Helga’s waist, dipping her back so that I had an excellent view of the show of Marianne and Cornelia while simultaneously ramming Helga furiously. Meanwhile, poor Titania just stood there, lost, trying to process the sudden destruction of their plan. Her shock was understandable, as she was by far the least experienced one when it came to having fun. </p><p>Marianne started to moan, begging for my attention. I flicked my gaze in her direction, enjoying the decision immensely. One of her hands was still on her breasts, teasing their perfect surface while Cornelia’s tongue labored aggressively to tease her. However, her other hand was slowly sliding down Cornelia’s stomach, teasing and playing, but steadily moving toward its target. </p><p>Soon, they were touching Cornelia’s wet heat. </p><p>Cornelia moaned under the touch. It was no doubt not the first time Marianne was touching her like that — as I had been a party to more than one myself in the near past — but it was the first time Marianne was dominating Cornelia so aggressively in the process. </p><p>And Cornelia’s obvious enjoyment once again suggested that her earlier demeanor as an aggressive dominatrix was not a facet of her true personality, but her way of dealing with the desperate pressure of her life. Ironically, the stronger she got, the more mellow and submissive she was getting. </p><p>Marianne certainly looked happy with the change of pace as her fingers curled inside Cornelia, provoking a long, stuttering gasp. </p><p>Unreal.</p><p>Admittedly, the show was distracting me successfully, but neither Titania — who was supposed to attack me with the cube — nor Helga — who was simultaneously enjoying the show as she bent herself back with my assistance — who was being repeatedly rammed inside. </p><p>My monotonous yet aggressive pumping didn’t seem to be a problem for Helga, as her thighs soon tightened as she started trembling, her panting frantic. “Oh, yes,” she gasped, cumming explosively, drenching my lap. I rewarded her with a generous dash of mana, helping her to gain another level, the euphoria of power mixing into pleasure. </p><p>[-4291 Mana]</p><p>I put my hands on Helga’s back, caressing her spine gently to make her tremble even more beautifully while I deflected another attack from Titania, who was still focusing on the game, trying to get a victory, even though it was a bit too late to make a point. </p><p>Though, defining her level of focus as intense would be misleading, as her gaze was equally split between Marianne, who was fingering Cornelia mercilessly even as she forced her to lick, Helga who was desperately trembling on my lap, and the flight of the ice cube. </p><p> Cornelia was trying to stave off orgasm as Marianne added another finger into her snatch, forcing her to let out a muffled moan, while Marianne pushed deeper and deeper. Her tongue picked up speed to match the attack she was receiving, and soon, Marianne’s free moans joined her muffled ones, her tits trembling beautifully.</p><p>\"See anything you like?\" Marianne suddenly asked as she squeezed her breasts with her free hands, catching Titania’s gaze.</p><p>Titania’s flinch of shame was simply too perfect to miss. I prepared to deliver a hit, but before I could do so, the ice cube flew toward her, delivering a couple of hits. </p><p>Titania turned toward us, only for Helga to give a smug look at her shocked face. Titania’s shock was understandable, as even I was shocked at her initiative. </p><p>Our game was starting to get even more interesting than I was expecting.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 492893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 2913  / 7750        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 18/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Three matching frustrated expressions told me that they were very unhappy about their failure to score a hit despite the amazing distraction Marianne had provided. They shared a glance, then shared a nod of alliance. </p><p>“Give us a moment,” Titania said, and they pulled at the other side of the room, whispering. Even Marianne joined them, though her legs were still trembling as she walked toward the other end of the room, her earlier seductive walk nowhere to be seen — not that it damaged her sexiness in any way. </p><p>They even set up a noise-blocking ward to keep their discussion hidden, something I was more than happy about it. Their sudden cooperation exceeded my expectations in a very positive way, so I let them break the rules of our little game, turning their implicit cooperation into an actual alliance. </p><p>I didn’t even break through their silencing ward to listen to their discussion. </p><p>Though, I watched them, enjoying the great show. In their various states of undress — Helga in her panties, Marianne naked, and the other two to their corset and panties — their heated discussion was a delicious show, their bodies stretching and shaking excellently whenever they shook their arms to make a point. </p><p>I licked my lips, enjoying the amazing sight despite the silence. About a minute later, they dispelled the ward, and walked back to their seats, Helga helping Marianne to walk without stumbling. “Are you ready?” I asked.</p><p>“Bring it on,” Cornelia growled, her competitive spirit renewed through the discussion, her passion as fiery as her preferred magic. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, sending a probing attack to her. </p><p>She bounced that immediately, but, to my surprise, it hit Helga, too smoothly not to be intentional. Maybe their friendship wasn’t as solid as I assumed, I thought even as I looked at Helga, expecting to find frustration or anger. </p><p>I was surprised by her calm acceptance, so much that I barely managed to deflect when Helga immediately followed by an attack of her own, targeting my chest. </p><p>“Nice trick,” I murmured, impressed by their ingenuity. It was smart for them to lean on my preconception about their rocky relationship, providing me just enough information to reinforce my expectations before going for the kill. “Too bad that it didn’t work. Do you have any other tricks, or should we just call it a game?”</p><p>“Of course not, we’re just starting,” Helga said even as she dropped her panties, revealing her beautiful body completely. However, rather than taking her seat, she let Cornelia attack her once more, scoring another hit, meaning she was temporarily out, waiting for an order. </p><p>“Go and entertain Caesar,” Cornelia ordered before I could even think of an order. I quirked my eyebrow at her, but she just smirked. “The rules say the one that makes the hit gives the order,” Cornelia said, while Helga started walking toward me. </p><p>Her walk was different than Marianne's, moving with a determined intent rather than an extended, leisure walk. No less sexy, of course, but sexy in a different way. One that was more aggressive, the kind that I hardly saw her applying. </p><p>The friendship with Cornelia was helping her more than I expected, it seemed. </p><p>The room fell into rapt silence, broken only by the whisper of her naked footsteps. The girls stopped attacking for a moment, letting me focus on Helga’s beauty. They were doing that to weaken my vigilance, of course, but it was a deal I was more than happy to take. </p><p>And I wasn’t the only one that was enjoying it, their gaze following Helga’s hips as they closed in the distance. I could have easily scored another point, but why ruin the enjoyment of the moment. </p><p>Then, Helga stood in front of me, her bosom flushed with desire, her breathing pushing it in a delicious manner, her wetness growing rapidly between her legs. </p><p>Winning the game was means for an end in any case. </p><p>“Enjoying the show?” she gasped as she leaned forward, her tits pressing against my shoulder, her hands immediately finding my balls, gently massaging. Her body was positioned perfectly to limit my field of view, so I started checking my surroundings with mana, expecting an immediate attack. </p><p>Surprisingly, there was no attack yet. </p><p>\"Why so tense?\" Helga whispered, pausing mid-sentence to bring her fingers along my shaft while licking my neck, perfectly following Cornelia’s order to be a distraction for me.</p><p>Admittedly, she was filling that role excellently. </p><p>When she moved, I could see Marianne across the room, her fingers already between her legs, her heavy breasts swaying with the rhythm of her fingers. I would have assumed that it was the after-effects of our latest fun adventure, but the positioning of her body disproved that. The angle of her body was arranged perfectly to maximize the impact of her show. </p><p>Her moans were still genuine, though. </p><p>“Isn’t your task to make me relax?” I answered Helga as I leaned back, ready for the service. If she was going to distract me from the victory, I had no intention of doing her job for her. She had to work properly for it. </p><p>To her credit, she didn’t show even the slightest hesitation before leaning forward, capturing my lips in a searing kiss, her breasts crushing against my chest, her tongue doing wonders. I let her have unrestricted access, enjoying passively. And I used the opportunity to transfer some more mana to her, helping her to take a generous distance to the next level. </p><p>[-3192 Mana]</p><p>Her hands were all over me, caressing every inch of my back, arms, and shoulders, enflaming my desire further. Her fingers settled around my stomach before she pulled away from the kiss, but that hardly meant she stopped, or even took a break. Instead, she stood up straighter, and I found myself unable to breathe, when she pulled my head to her breasts. </p><p>Well, there were limits to my determination to stay passive. When her pink nipple slipped into my mouth, I bit it gently, just enough pressure to trigger a delicious moan. </p><p>Cornelia picked that moment to attack me, a timing that was almost succeeded as it approached from the right. I was about to deflect away, but I could already feel two other magic builds, one at the right, the other at the left, ready to counterattack. </p><p>So, I threw it toward the ceiling, away from those. Helga pulled back, her pleasure marred with the frustration of failure. </p><p>“Good attempt, both in terms of timing and tactics,” I said as I leaned to the side and caught Titania’s eyes. Then, I turned to Helga. “It might have even worked if I had been properly distracted,” I added with a chuckle even as I patted her ass, earning a frustrated moan. </p><p>“As you wish,” Helga growled, accepting the challenge as she started her assault once more. This time, she started by kissing my collarbone, then started moving down slowly but steadily, each kiss timed perfectly with my breathing. </p><p>As she kissed, the rest of the team wasn’t idle, however. They were attacking repeatedly with the cube, but it was a repetitive, one-dimensional assault, clearly trying to put me into a false sense of security. </p><p>Admittedly, under the circumstances, it wasn’t a bad strategy, especially as Helga’s kisses moved lower and lower, her soft body generously rubbing against mine, her perky breasts leaving the memories of their touch all over my skin. </p><p>When she finally settled to her place, she took a slightly different position than I was expecting. Her lips were still wrapped around my shaft, of course, but I wasn’t expecting her to wrap her breasts around the base, subjecting me to double-pronged assault. Meanwhile, Titania used the opportunity to launch another attack, and when I bounced it away, Cornelia took control of the attack, but even Helga’s beautiful breasts weren’t enough for me to taste the defeat. </p><p>“Good attempt,” I murmured as Helga’s twin peaks injected warmth to my shaft while she covered the crown with her generous saliva, her moans of approval entirely honest, a statement that worked for both of them. \"A little more creativity, and you might even be successful.”</p><p>Titania didn’t appreciate the subtle sting of my words, and reacted in a furious assault. If it was a part of a proper battle, I would have been scared. Unfortunately for her, her furious assault immediately shattered the ice cube. “Damn it!” she gasped in anger. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, less haste, more speed,” I said mockingly even as I flared my magic. “Let me help you on that,” I added, ripping her corset off her body with telekinesis, leaving her naked. I watched her corset ripped into pieces, revealing her modest yet beautiful curves as her raven hair moved freely. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>“Hey, that’s not a part of the rules,” Titania murmured in frustration. </p><p>“Sorry, sweetie, I couldn't help myself,\" I said even as I flared my magic, caressing her breast telekinetically while creating the ice cube, earning another furious hiss. Cornelia stalled for a moment, clearly enjoying the way I was teasing Titania. Helga was far too focused on the delicious combination of blowjob and titjob she was delivering. </p><p>And Marianne was just playing with herself behind the two, her calculated attempt to provide a distraction quickly turning into a source of joy enough to make her forget completely… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 492893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 5742  / 7750        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "title": "Fun with Nerdy Girls 18",
    "content": "<p>As I pushed Sarah against the edge of the pool, my shaft sliding between her thighs, my hands dancing on her chest, I had only one question in mind. </p><p>How far I could push her which girl would be the one to surrender. The sexy brunette I was currently molesting, or the curvy blonde that was watching us from the concealed window, her body moving more and more. </p><p>Luckily,  I had the option to reach the problem as a nerd, using the scientific experimentation method Carrie had thought me. My hypothesis was Sarah would fold first. I just needed to test that against the real-world condition to validate — and maybe repeat a few times to make sure my result was statistically significant. </p><p>Who said studying was a waste of time. </p><p>I didn’t wait until Sarah could settle into her new position before leaning forward and whispering into her ear. “Tell me something interesting about yourself.” As my chest pressed against hers, I could feel an out-of-control heartbeat against my chest. </p><p>“I…” she started, her voice trembling with unmet desire. “I can hold my breath for almost three minutes,” she said after a while. </p><p>“How interesting, do you want to prove it,” I murmured, enjoying the way her eyes widened as I put my hands on her shoulders, like I was about to push her into the pool, only to relax when, rather than pushing down, I brought her out of the water, letting her sit on the edge. </p><p>“Thanks, I didn’t want to be dunked…” she started, only to stop after I climbed, my shaft inches away from her lips. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I have a better idea to test it. Open wide,” I said, testing her arousal and her resolve at the same time. The sudden aggressiveness might have closed the night early, but the expression I read on her lovely brown eyes told me that it was an acceptable risk.  </p><p>She was still sitting on her tight ass as I pushed my hips forward. When it pressed against her mouth, her eyes flashed with what might have been classified as rebellion mixed with fear as she processed the length of my shaft from such a close vantage point. </p><p>Luckily, I knew the perfect lever to push. “If you think you can’t handle as much as Carrie, we can stop,” I said, keeping my tone calm, like I was actually trying to empathize, with a hint of pity. </p><p>And just like I expected, pity worked much better than a more aggressive goading attempt. She said nothing, but her lips parted, her body sliding forward, allowing her to take me in without straining her neck. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I put my hands on her head, signaling that I had no intention of giving her control. But rather than pushing forward, even more, I let her go with her own pace at first. </p><p>Her eyelids shut as she hummed what was likely appreciation as she pushed herself forward. Her attempt was stuttered and mechanic, clearly showing her lack of experience, but that didn’t prevent her from pushing aggressively until the crown pressed against her throat. </p><p>She was truly brave. </p><p>Since her eyes were conveniently closed, I looked up, trying to catch Carrie’s eyes, only to find her face pressed against the window like she was afraid of missing even one frame of our show, her shoulders still swaying suggestively. Good, I thought as I realized a naked blowjob didn’t touch her limits. </p><p>I turned my gaze down, just as Sarah pulled out my spit-covered shaft for a moment, taking a breath before repeating the same flow, clumsy yet enthusiastic. I watched in fascination as her lips opened to the limit as she filled her mouth completely, yet continued to push forward even as my shaft pressed against her throat. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said, surprised that she was trying to actually deep-throat without any further goading. </p><p>“How else I could prove you my lung capacity?” she said after pulling out, a smug smile on her face, clearly satisfied with her actions. I nodded back with a smirk, not saying anything about her well-deserved smug expression, even though I was more interested in the limits of her throat than her lungs. </p><p>I waited as she repeatedly tried to devour my shaft completely, only for her gags and wheezes to block her from early success, though, I wasn’t shocked by her rapid acceptance after pushing through a certain level of intimacy, not when I had already experienced almost the same thing with Carrie at the beginning of our ‘tutoring’ arrangement. </p><p>The resolve in her eyes, on the other hand, was rather more surprising. Her competitiveness was turning out to be much more useful than I could ever expect. I could feel my arousal getting more intense as Sarah did her best to swallow more of my length, coating more and more of my shaft with her spit, leaving me doubtful whether I would need to help her to achieve her objective, or whether she would be able to achieve in her own. </p><p>Time passed, and the second probability started to look much more probable. And when she grabbed my thighs to pull herself deeper into my shaft, I let my hands slide down from her head. My thumb caressed the edge of her breasts, a gentle move that contrasted greatly with the sloppy blowjob I was receiving, and working even better for it. </p><p>She trembled as my palms opened, cupping her breasts, her nipples pressing against my palms as enjoyed the firmness of her breasts. Her size might not be matching Carrie’s miraculous measurements, but that didn’t mean groping her was nothing less than absolute delight.  </p><p>A moan escaped her mouth despite the great barrier she was trying to suffocate herself with, one that almost set me off to push her down, and brought our sexy dance to the next step. Pity, she chose that exact moment to grab my thighs even tighter pushed herself forward, achieving the impossible by devouring the entirety of my shaft. </p><p>I grunted helplessly as she pushed despite her gags, proving that she hadn’t undersold her ability to keep her breath. I paid her by playing with her erect nipples, adding helpless rumbling of silent moans to her gags, assisted by a supporting cast of moans, grunts, and other beautiful sounds. </p><p>When she finally pulled back, almost three minutes later, I was dangerously close to climaxing. “I told you so, I can hold my breath for very long,” she managed to say despite breathing desperately. </p><p>“I’m impressed,” I said even as I grabbed her waist, and before she could even react, lifted her up. Her weight was nothing against my strength, perfected through endless training as I twirled her until she was upside down, her lips still inches away from my cock, but this time, her nether lips were just inches away from my tongue as well. “It’s time for your reward,” I said. </p><p>Before she could process the situation, my tongue was already caressing her wetness. Though, considering the speed she repeated her earlier task, it was clear that she had no problem with the new situation.</p><p>I started walking inside, enjoying the way her body was pressing against mine. However, before I entered, I looked up once more, meeting Carrie’s shocked gaze, who had been watching the rapid developments with an ever-growing shock. But since she seemed to be happy with being an observer, I continued walking forward, even as my tongue started caressing Sarah’s entrance aggressively, pushing her farther into the land of pleasure. </p><p>We entered inside, accompanied by her repeated gags as she deep-throating me successfully despite the challenging angle, showing just amazing her mouth was, a treatment that continued even as I started climbing the stairs, directly to my bedroom. </p><p>The couch was nice, but not as wide as my bed, which made a much wider playbook of positions available. </p><p>“Give me a minute,” sweetie,” I said after we arrived at my bedroom, only to drop her onto my bed. She didn’t waste any time staring at my glistening cock, or try to understand the significance of the room she was in, too aroused to do anything but latch onto my shaft, sucking enthusiastically. </p><p>Luckily, she was too distracted to notice a blonde figure appearing at the doorway, looking inside with shocked eyes. I met with Carrie’s eyes, mouthing her to be careful, even as I enjoyed the amazing sight of her naked body, her arousal dripping down her leg. </p><p>Carrie followed my request, and pulled the door close — unfortunately choosing to stay outside in the process. That didn’t mean she went away, of course, as normally, a little ray of light would shine from the keyhole. Not having that meant that she was there, still watching us. </p><p>With that, I decided to make it a proper show rather than cumming inside Sarah’s mouth. I pulled out at the last moment, spraying Sarah’s face with my gunk, much to her shocked gasp, as if the sudden drops broke through her shocking aura. I continued to spray her, spraying over her chest and her stomach as well before finally coming to a stop. </p><p>At that point, neither stopping, nor forcibly pulling Carrie into the situation felt particularly tempting. No, I decided. I would let Carrie or Sarah take the final step triggering a threesome — though that didn’t mean I wouldn’t prod and tease them in that direction. The idea of having one of them watching while I worked on the other, each unaware of their observer during their turn, was too erotic to be terminated early. </p><p>So, instead of opening the door and pulling Carrie inside to trigger a surefire threesome, I parted Sarah’s legs, positioning myself in between. “So, we tested the breathing capacity of your lungs. Do you want to check just how loud of a cry they can create as well?” I asked even as I pressed the crown of my half-erect shaft against her entrance, informing her what awaited her the next. </p><p>Waiting for her nod to graduate her from her virgin status… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I took note of my uninvited intruder, a set of conflicting emotions aroused in me. </p><p>Have you ever been approached by a woman whose redheaded sexiness only matched by the grim expression on her face, carrying a naked sword, its blade shining with a throbbing light like it was actually enthusiastic to drink my blood — and enchanted enough to cut through any defense I could deploy reflexively, which didn’t help the situation? And if the said woman was dressed in leather armor that deployed her amazing curves the best way possible, pushing the confusion even further. </p><p>Well, ladies and gentlemen. Meet Solia el’Trian, the pride of the council, one of the youngest Custodians in history to ever hold an independent assignment. </p><p>And my parole officer… </p><p>Since her assignment included summarily executing me the moment she had a proper excuse, I suppressed my reflex of throwing a lightning bolt — my preferred way of greeting an uninvited visitor that dared to make a mess out of my private working space as she did — and took a deep breath before speaking. “Such a nice surprise,” I said. “It seems that I once again the honor of hosting great el’Trian the Third, the next lord of the great plane of Trian,” I said, aware just how much she hated being referred like that. And just to drive the dagger even deeper, I didn’t bother hiding the mocking edge at all. </p><p>Just because she was looking for the slightest excuse to change the status of my existence — and had the legal excuse to do so with no consequence the moment I slipped — was no reason to act like a boot licker. </p><p>Sassing was not a capital crime, even for the occasionally nonsensical council accords.  </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she growled as she took a step forward, her fingers already wrapped around her sword, sending a dash of adrenaline through my veins — and as much as I didn’t want to admit, a dash of arousal as well. </p><p>I have a thing for sexy women with an explosive temper. Sue me. </p><p>“Enough for you to take that final step? Because if so, I have an interesting last meal request before my death,” I teased her, even though I tensed, a whisper that would create a flaming inferno around myself already on my lips, because teasing her was actually dangerous. </p><p>I already had a scar to prove it. </p><p>“Still so arrogant,” she spat between her squeezed teeth. “However, if you think your arrogance could distract me from your plot, you’re mistaken.” I was tempted to ask what plot, but as she fell silent, I decided to cross my arms and wait for her to continue. </p><p>The silence was a useful interrogation tool, but only when used well, requiring patience. </p><p>It didn’t take long for Solia to abandon her attempts to weaponize her silence. She wasn’t a Custodian because of her amazing investigative skills. Admittedly, she wasn’t one because of her family’s influence as well, which was what most people assumed upon hearing her name. No, she had the task because she was a genius of magical combat, supporting her prodigious spells with her blade, turning her into a deadly threat against </p><p>However, ironically enough, she was assigned to my case because of her family influence — much to her distaste — as working as my parole officer might have been the safest job a Custodian might receive, especially since I was exiled to a low-magic dimension. </p><p>“I know you’re stealing the life essences of the mortals to stave your hunger,” she stated, her beautiful face turning stiff, the lines appearing at the corners of her mouth. </p><p>I would have teased her about ruining her beautiful face with a frown, if it wasn’t for the ridiculousness of her statement. “What?!” I said, unable to process. “What the hell are you talking about?” </p><p>“Do you think that your ploy is not clear? A sorcerer of your strength, locked to a desolate land with little mana, not allowed to use any magic outside the Accords, and you have no sign of withdrawal. Do you really expect me to believe that?” </p><p>“Your point being,” I said, doing my best to look calm. Her theory had no relation with reality, but if presented well enough, it was not hard for the council to accept. It was why I was trying not to panic, to not to give her any reason to believe her half-baked theory. </p><p>Of course, I could have simply explained to her that I wasn’t affected by the limited magic, because I was born on Earth, but revealing my origin — while it might help to resolve my current issue — would only intensify the issues I was facing. </p><p>For example, it would give the Council an excuse to transfer me to another exile location, one that was too peaceful for me to use the Accords as an excuse for casting magic. </p><p>“You understand my point very well, you bastard,” Solia said with an angry frown. I shrugged, running the risk of angering her, which was very inconvenient, because when she was angry, she made a point of coming sniffing around whenever I cast even a little cantrip, forcing me to write a report about the conditions. And rejecting was not an option, not when she was enthusiastically looking for a sign of guilt, ready to damn me an eternity locked in a cube. </p><p>Or summarily executed. </p><p>Still, angering her was the superior option to giving her something she might take as a sign of guilt. </p><p>I was lucky that they hadn’t assigned one of the fanatics that would lop my head off at the first sign of spell and damn the consequences. Saving the council had its perks, even if it came with an extremely hefty bill of collateral damage.  </p><p>“Yes, Solia,” I said with a tired tone. “I understand your point. Even a mindless goblin would have understood your point. You’re not exactly subtle in your comments. Not that it excuses their silliness. You’re assigned to monitor my spell usage and find evidence, not coming with ridiculous theories.”</p><p>She stuck out her chin at me belligerently as she took a deep breath, her eyes dancing in anger. She was clearly considering the merits of taking action, fueled more with anger than suspicion. I bit my lips even as I cursed my mind, because as she looked at me, ready to lash out, I was getting very aroused. She was beautiful, and the fact that she was actively contemplating murder me just made it even sexier. “A technicality,” she growled. </p><p>Maybe I did have a death wish. </p><p>“A technicality I'm more than happy to use,” I said with a shrug. “After suffering under those technicalities the moment I fell under the purview of the council, it’s a nice chance for them to be on my side. So, unless you want to convene a meeting of the Council, there’s nothing else I can say. I’m sure that they would drop everything they were doing for the precious heir of the el’Trian family, using the opportunity to fawn over your father.” </p><p>She growled in anger, not appreciating the reminder about her grand status. She even grabbed the hilt of her sword, the symbol of her authority as a Custodian, squeezing for a moment before muttering. \"No. It isn't worth it.\" With that, she turned and walked toward the door, magic already gathering around her freely, almost like a tornado. </p><p>My attention was on the way her hips were dancing as she walked away, unable to be hidden completely by her amazing outfit. When she stood in front of the door, her magic flowing, the door started to transform into a bright gate for her to teleport. </p><p>There was nothing special about my door other than being a solid steel exterior with several locks. But the magic was not about the words and formulas, or just power. It was also about the state of mind, and the way it was imprinted on the rest of the world. She was strong enough to cast a gate into the Aether between dimensions from anywhere she wanted unless the place was intentionally warded, but casting it on a doorway, something that was linked with passage both by her, and both by the rest of the world, making the spell several times easier to cast.  </p><p>Before she stepped through, however, she looked at me one last time. “You’re an arrogant little fool, Harvey,\" she growled. “And you can be sure that I’ll catch you on the act one day.” </p><p>\"Whatever helps you sleep at night, sweetheart,\" I told her, enjoying her tenseness, knowing that even with her remit, she couldn’t attack me for just a nickname. </p><p>She growled one last time before stepping through the gateway, and the glow disappeared after she passed, leaving me annoyed and aroused at the same time. </p><p>With a shake of my head and a blink, I tried to dispel those feelings as my thoughts shifted gear, trying to focus on the scene of murder I had observed. Her assumption about the murderer was not accurate, but in the long run, it mattered significantly little. </p><p>I couldn’t trust her to keep her sword down if other murders happened the same way. </p><p>It was time for some detective work, starting with checking my sources. </p><p>My supernatural sources… </p>",
