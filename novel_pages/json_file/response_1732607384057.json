    "content": "<p>As Sapphire rubbed her beautiful body against mine, my hands caressing her supple skin, it was not hard to come to a decision about the next step. Watching her dance erotically at her own pace was beautiful, but taking her hard against the pile of gold was even better. </p><p>Especially since I still have a lot of work to do by searching the responsible parties for the construction of that mysterious ward. The last thing I want to do was to deal with a third party during my second rise of power — a rise that was clearly going to focus on the Empire of the Light more than the lands of darkness at this points thanks to the rather ‘harmonious’ relationship I had achieved with the royal family. </p><p>Still, I waited until Sapphire turned to face me once more, her hands dancing between her waist and her breasts, her nipples standing out in arousal, her breath panting. Then, she bent forward, her bare breasts swinging freely in front of me as she placed a gentle kiss on my cheek. </p><p>One that enflamed my arousal to a new level. </p><p>I put my hands on her waist, forcibly pulling her to my lap, pinning her against my naked shaft, which didn’t phase her even a second. Her hips started to rock back and forth, marking the side of my shaft with her wetness. I was initially intending to grab her waist to make her hips move, but since she handled that part herself, I pressed my palms against her generous breasts, squeezing aggressively. </p><p>“Ah!” she gasped, making a sound of pain and pleasure as my fingers dug into her flesh aggressively. </p><p>Her hands moved over mine, and at first, I expected her to try to pull my hands away, which was why I was surprised when she started to help me knead them instead, increasing the pressure even further, along with the intensity of her voice. I  pinched her nipples, amazed by the way her back arched as she started to tremble with the telltale signs of a climax. </p><p>As she experienced her climax, her hips rocked desperately, trying to enhance her pleasure to the next level, giving me free rein over her body. </p><p>However, I didn’t exert that control immediately. “Look at you, so-called queen, whoring yourself out just to make sure you can hang on the throne,” I whispered. Normally, I wouldn’t have dared to tease her pride directly, afraid of her reaction even with everything we had done, but not only my position was unassailable by the sudden appearance of a third party targeting her throne, but also her climax pushed her into a rare position where her submissiveness reached an unbelievable position. </p><p>No, mocking her lack of power, even as I brought my fingers to her crotch, slipping inside mercilessly, was the best way to tease her. </p><p>Before she could answer, I twisted our positions, so that she was on her back, laying on the pile of gold — softened by magic — her body arching as my fingers invaded her trembling entrance. The pleasure was so thick that she was unable to answer. </p><p>“Weak whore,” I repeated as my fingers disappeared into her crotch, and she only trembled helplessly her position stationary. She left that unanswered, choosing to moan repeatedly instead.  </p><p>Even as my fingers dominated her, I couldn’t help but feel amazed at the beautiful sight of her body, her face flushes, her golden hair beautiful enough to be mistaken for a treasure among the pile of gold. The fact that she was still wearing her crown made the moment even better.</p><p>When I positioned myself between her legs, my hands on her bare hips, caressing her skin, she barely reacted, her focus on the way my fingers were caressing her core. When I pulled them out, however, she reacted. “No,” she gasped desperately, as I had just sentenced her to death. </p><p>“Don’t worry, Your Imperial Majesty, your loyal subject is going to replace them with a satisfactory substitute,” I said mockingly, once again using her title, making her flinch as she was reminded of her grand identity. Though, her heavy, desperate breathing, making her bosom rise and fall, signaled that she was much more interested in the replacement than the mocking teasing. </p><p>At this point, I could have bargained for every single treasure in the room, and I would receive without a complaint. Pity that doing so would be cutting a treasure tree. Her obedience implied much more things than a quick payday. </p><p>Just to test her arousal, I put my hand on her slit once more, only for her hips to move desperately as she tried to ride herself into another orgasm even with my motionless hand. With a chuckle, I pulled, and she tried to replace it with her own hand. </p><p>That, I had no intention of allowing. I grabbed her wrists, much to her shock. “Please, Your Imperial Majesty. As a loyal subject, I would be ashamed if I would let you take care of your own needs. It’s my honor to serve you.” Even as I talked, I pressed my shaft against her entrance. </p><p>She moaned deliciously even as she tried to throw herself forward, trying to take me in, only for me to pull back, leaving her hanging. “Please, Your Majesty, patience is a royal virtue,” I chuckled, highlighting my words with a slap on her breasts, hard enough that the sound exploded in the room, while they jiggled beautifully. </p><p>“Please,” she begged again, which earned another slap, though it didn’t seem to discourage her. </p><p>After repeating it half a dozen times, each slap making her moan harder, I decided to relent. “Well, as a royal subject, it’s my honor to fulfill your orders, even if your orders include me treating you like a two-silver backyard whore,” I said even as I grabbed and flipped. </p><p>I wanted to play her for a bit more, but there were some things in life even a Dark Lord famous for his patience couldn’t resist. The sight of a beautiful Queen begging for my cock while being roughly bent over a pile of gold in her own treasury turned out to be one of them. </p><p> I pressed my shaft against her entrance once more, and before I could push forward, her ass raised forward, her stomach moving lower, and she took my shaft inside her, her wetness enthusiastic enough to devour it completely. </p><p>Her hips continued to move, but as a gentleman and a loyal subject, it would be remiss of me to work a royal person to do all the work herself. So, I pushed forward, fast and merciless, forcing her to widen to accommodate my presence. Her mindless moans suggested that she was not exactly unhappy about my actions, so I got even faster, her hips rising to meet my slap each time. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel fascinated by her warmth and tightness, never getting stale no matter how many times I enjoyed her, and her furious enthusiasm even as I dominated and humiliated her made it even better. </p><p>Just to add insult to injury, I reached and pulled her crown free, only to put it over her ass, balancing it with magic, one last mockery to her position as the Queen. </p><p>“No,” she gasped as I pulled her crown, but her protest fell flat considering her hips didn’t agree with her complaint, continuing to meet my pushes furiously. </p><p>Grasping her hips, I increased my strength another level, the sound of fleshy slaps echoing from the walls of the treasury — while simultaneously underlining the emptiness of it — losing myself in the sensation of dominating her. </p><p>As our little dance continued, she got wetter and wetter, her tightness increasing even further when I started slapping her hips with a fury equal to my pumping hips, suppressing her whimpers beautifully. </p><p>I was planning to continue that little fun torture for a long while, but, as our little dance continued, she achieved the impossible, her entrance tightening even further, turning her delicious entrance into a corner from heaven. My conviction to keep her teasing for a long while started to melt like an ice cube trying to pass through a wall of flame, and her lustful moans hardly helped me to resist. </p><p>Her back arched, raising her breasts, which was dangling back and forth, vibrating and swaying in tandem, beautiful enough to make a believer out of a heretic. Lost in the flood of carnal pleasure, I surrendered to the joy and abandoned my plans to tease her until she collapsed, exploding her inside, filling her core with my seed. </p><p>In a happy coincidence, however, that triggered her final climax for the evening, leaving her laying listlessly on top of the treasure, while she murmured helplessly in a desperate attempt to stave off her climax, but failing spectacularly. </p><p>I pulled out only when my shaft started throbbing, and when I pulled, a nice stream was dripping down, evidencing my victory. At that moment, she was truly mine, which, looked objectively, was a bigger achievement than anything I had completed during my painful and gritty ascension to the top of the Dark Lands. </p><p>Truly, fate was a fickle mistress.  </p><p>Laying next to her to catch a nice sleep was tempting. Unfortunately, I had a great deal of things to do tonight to start searching for the clues about the mysterious third party that was playing with the Empire. </p><p>The ward itself was interesting enough, and I had no doubt that, if someone had intervened with the Empire like that, they intervened with it in many other ways as well. </p><p>I just needed to find them… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Both libraries and the act of reading were famously classified as boring, something that many of my fellow students had agreed on even when the books in question were magical. </p><p>My raging heartbeat disagreed with their conclusion. Every time I reached for a new book, my heartbeat spiked wildly. And my fear didn’t just come from the risk of getting caught, even though that was enough to make me fear. After all, I was a slave and a spy at the same time, searching through some of the most precious books of a Patrician house, a crime that was not only worthy of execution, but worthy of a slow, drawn-out one. </p><p>But the problem wasn’t just the danger of being caught. No, the real problem came from the nature of the books I was trying to read. Unlike the library in the lost city, which hadn’t been maintained for five centuries, the books in the library were in perfect condition. </p><p>Unfortunately, their perfect condition included being charged with magic, both for the protection of their content and as a learning aid for the complicated concepts. Some books were even protected by unique wards to prevent access, even when they were hidden in the part of the library where only a few members of the family were allowed in the first place. </p><p>I had no doubt that each of those books was worth the whole fortunes of a lesser family. Unfortunately, my limited time combined with the challenge of breaking through every single ward separately meant that even checking their content was not the best way to go. </p><p>Luckily, some of the books had their names written on their spine, allowing me to shortlist my targets rather than opening them randomly and hoping for the best. </p><p>“Let’s check you now,” I said even as I turned my attention to the external sources of magic. In particular, the Dragon’s Heart. After all, recklessly consuming one of those was at the source of my issues, along with my catastrophic ascension that was literally opposite of everything that was supposed to happen, resisting the elemental nature of Earth and embracing the side of the sky. </p><p>After a desperate search, it took me almost two hours to find a section about Dragon’s Heart, in the depths of an old magical compendium, itself clearly older than the Roman Republic, because, on its first page, there was a note written by Tullus Hostilius Rex, who was one of the old kings of the Rome, long before a rebellion threw the reign of the kings and established the Republic. </p><p>His reign was eleven centuries ago, and the book was potentially even older. </p><p>Still, for a magic book, being old was hardly a problem. On the contrary, being protected with such care meant that the information it contained was likely very precious. It hurt me to ignore all the other interesting nuggets hidden in the book, spells, historical actions, and other events, but the conditions didn’t allow it. </p><p>I started deciphering the section of Dragon’s Heart carefully — deciphering, because it was old enough to be filled with unfamiliar words and structures, forcing me to read carefully. </p><p>[Dragon’s Heart is one of the most mysterious magical ingredients that has been discovered, carrying a source of near-infinite magical power as long as it was cared for carefully and allowed to regenerate. While it was named as Dragon’s Heart, there’s still a big debate about its name, some scholars claiming that the nature of the Dragon’s Heart was the proof for the Existence of the Dragons before the great deluge, the others believing that the name itself comes from the legends due to its nature. </p><p>While some unproven tales marks the first known source as the Great King of Uruk, the first proven historical usage can be traced to Great Egyptian Dynasties before the Great Collapse, used to raise invincible chariot armies that were responsible for destroying the armies of the Set and other Earth God, allowing human dominion to expand into the wilderness.  </p><p>Also, it’s theorized that the power of their chariot legions raised by the Dragon Hearts allowed the Great Kingdom of Egypt to resist the mysterious armies of darkness that managed to destroy the great city-states of Mesopotamia as well as the great kingdom Hittite and the trading empire of Mycenaean kingdoms, proving its great potential. Unfortunately, many great priests of Horus and Ra had fallen in the battle, causing Egypt’s techniques of using Dragon’s Heart to fragment. Though, even in their nature, it is enough to ensure the continuation of Egypt despite their endless battle against the armies of Set. </p><p>Unfortunately, despite its immense potential, Dragon’s Heart is one of the most fragile sources of magic, any attempt to break through its surface resulting in a deadly response from the Gaia, resulting in not only a violent discharge of lightning-natured energy, but also a corresponding response from the natural mana, causing in violent storms and flame explosions. For example…]</p><p>I had skipped the experimentations for a moment, focusing on the rest of the text, to identify possible other sources of information. </p><p>[The city of Troy is another known location for Dragon’s Heart. While their expertise hadn’t reached Egypt’s peak, they were known to use Dragon Hearts in their possession in a unique way, empowering the nature of their piercing weapons. However, the extent and the potential of that practice are lost with the destruction of Troy and the death of many Greek heroes in the process. However, some experts believe that both the famous spear of Hector which empowered him enough to fight against great Achilles, and the infamous bow of Paris who ultimately ended caused Achilles’ death were empowered by a unique application of Dragon’s Heart, elevating the magical potential of the weapons to an unbelievable level.]</p><p>There were several more legends, referring to many other locations, from Britannia to distant plains of Persia, some even mentioning the mysterious land of silk and horses. Unfortunately, deciphering the rest would have taken more time than I had. </p><p>I pulled back, taking a deep breath. Despite the relative shortness of the section, translating the section took almost all the time I could afford, afraid of missing a detail or mistranslating a critical section. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to go into detail about each experiment, but considering their ultimately unsuccessful results, they weren’t that critical. However, before closing the book, I noticed one very important note. </p><p>The note was clearly added later on, clearly indicated by not only the ink selection and the different writing style, but also the word selection and grammar structure. </p><p>And it was much more interesting implications than some distant historical experiment. </p><p>[After the disastrous results in the experiment in Pompeii resulting in the loss of the city and great damage to the population, experimenting with Dragon’s Heart in the borders of the Republic is strictly forbidden, as per the orders of the Temple of Jupiter.]</p><p>Interesting, I murmured, both in terms of the disastrous results, and the organization responsible for forbidding it. I was already suspecting some link with Temple of Jupiter thanks to the notes of Julius Caesar, one of the rare few that was freed from the arduous obligation of being a priest of Jupiter, and the fact that they were responsible for the law rather than the senate was just another evidence. </p><p>Pity, it wasn’t exactly a simple place to sneak in, even compared to the estate of a Patrician. Other references were also interesting, particularly Egypt, as it was known that Julius Caesar had spent almost two years in Egypt in the midst of a very dangerous civil war, even though that trip almost caused him to lose the war. Of course, his stay was forced by the siege of the Egyptian forces, but that didn’t make it any less suspicious. </p><p>For once, despite having twelve legions at that point, he only took half a legion with him for the trip, traveling only with his most loyal, most veteran legion. Considering the famous loyalty of the rest of his legions, the decision was rather curious. </p><p>The other suspicious point was the response of the Egyptian forces. Even with a civil war going on, opposing Caesar, arguably one of the three greatest generals of history along with Alexander the Great and Hannibal. There had to be a reason for them to take such a risk, and secrets of Dragon’s Heart — arguably the strongest trump card of Egypt Kingdom since its inception if the assumptions in the book were accurate — seemed to be a valid reason for them to rage on. </p><p>The problem, it pointed in two different directions. One was Egypt, its distance considerable enough to make a casual journey impossible, and House Julia, whose secret city I had already scoured in detail. After all, that city was hardly the best place for Julius Caesar to hide his most important knowledge. Most of the more advanced books were transferred by his heir, short-lived Augustus Caesar, who had fallen in the hands of House Junia’s heir, Brutus. </p><p>Of course, Caesar was famously assassinated in Rome, when he was at the height of his power. At this point, his own estate was the much better destination to hide any sensitive information he managed to extract in his infamous Egypt trip. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured after I finished the rest of the text, unable to find anything else that would help me. Of course, it wasn’t as bad as it could have been, as the information I had gathered didn’t leave me without a destination. </p><p>There was still hope in the library of the Patrician house, whose heiress I had just fucked into the unconsciousness before moving on to her best friend… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Defending against the combined assault of four competent mages was hard. </p><p>Defending against the combined assault of four competent mages, when the objective was to handle the floating ice cube gently enough to prevent it from shattering, was considerably harder. </p><p>Defending against the combined assault of four competent mages, when the objective was to handle the floating ice cube gently enough to prevent it from shattering, when said four mages were the incarnation of sexiness in the various states of undressing, providing an incredible distraction as I tried to go gather my mana, was possibly the hardest challenge I had ever faced. </p><p>And something really important was at stake. Every time I let that ice cube touch my skin, I had to follow one of their orders, a scary proposition, especially with four girls facing each other as well, each wanting to prove themselves to others in the twisted relationship they were dragged by me. </p><p>Still, it was a challenge I was more than happy to face. </p><p>It wasn’t shocking that Cornelia took the lead of attacking, her fiery personality perfect for charging. It was easy to deflect her reckless attack, but before it could move forward even an inch, it was deflected back by Helga, ready for my reaction. </p><p>Meanwhile, Titania gave a push from the side, making it even harder to deflect, while Marianne stayed on the back, ready to provide a last line of defense if needed. </p><p>The formation was not a bad idea, allowing everyone to use their skills the way they were most comfortable, but also put Marianne, who was the least skilled one in terms of manipulating mana, to a defensive position, easy to be protected. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, their impromptu formation was less solid than they might have expected. </p><p>I could have scored a point through brute force — as the creator of the ice cube, I could assess its breaking point much more effectively — but while that would earn me a delicious naked show, it would only highlight my superior skills, not their limited tactical competency. </p><p>Considering the dangers we were facing, injecting a small lesson into our sexy times was not exactly a bad thing. So, I let their counter-attack come very close to success, waiting to feel the radiating cold of the ice cube before deflecting it away. </p><p>Emboldened by their near-victory, they pushed even harder. Helga put her whole focus on helping Cornelia, but when I deflected it toward Titania, she was perfectly ready to deflect it, even if it came much faster this time. </p><p>Too bad for Marianne that it moved toward her. To her credit, Marianne was ready to defend herself. Unfortunately, at that speed, her attempts shattered the ice cube once more. </p><p>“Too bad, sweetheart,” I said with a wide smirk, very enthusiastic about the next part. Yes, I had seen Marianne naked before, but it was one of the things that never got stale. She was always beautiful, and the way her breasts jiggled as she unbuttoned her corset added a lot to her attractiveness. </p><p>“You girls need to work harder on your strategies, factoring everyone in properly,” I said with a smug smile, perfectly designed to trigger their anger. It was good advice, of course, but a patronizing delivery was enough to taint the goodwill of even the best advice. </p><p>And while they were busy trying to suppress their anger, I delivered a sneak attack, once again targeting Marianne. “Don’t bother sitting down, sweetie,” I said, gesturing for her to drop her panties as well. “And that’s why you need to be more careful about sneak attacks no matter the circumstances. High hit points could help you to survive an ambush from a weaker attacker, but every advantage is important on the path to survival,” I added. </p><p>As I said that, I let my gaze stay on Titania. After all, our first proper meeting had been born from those circumstances, where she recklessly pushed forward to recover a book, only to fall into a deadly trap of the necromancers. </p><p>Titania was unable to refute that point, which hardly helped her anger, especially since she was still relatively new to suppressing the touch of her emotions. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, her anger gave me the exact opportunity I needed to send an attack through the area she was supposed to defend. She was an excellent mage, enough to defend herself even distracted. But it was different when I wasn’t targeting her. </p><p>I sent a curved attack around her, and before she could react, and before Helga could realize my ploy, the cube already touched Marianne’s milky skin despite her nakedness. </p><p>“It’s time for play,” I said with a grin even as I let my gaze dance over all four girls, their expressions flickering between different emotions. I first looked at Marianne, who had to follow one of my orders after being eliminated first. </p><p>I curled my finger, calling her close, amused by her frustrated puff as she stood up. Her frustration didn’t come from needing to follow my next order, as our relationship had well past that point. No, the way her gaze danced on the other three girls suggested that she was concerned that she was the first one that was ‘defeated’ in our little magic game. </p><p>Before our relationship taught her about taking initiative, she might have just slunk down and accepted the defeat, but after some memorable times, she was much more expressive. </p><p>More importantly, she had the weapons to strike back from a very unexpected angle. </p><p>When she started walking toward me, following my order, her steps were slow, almost crawling. However, it wasn’t hesitancy that was slowing her steps. If that had been the case, her hips wouldn’t have displayed a sensual dance with every step, hardening my already impressive erection to a new level. </p><p>It was already an amazing show that deserved a great deal of my attention, but I made sure to keep my gaze on the way her hips were dancing like I was hypnotized, playing for the audience, earning a few jealous glances in return. </p><p>Cornelia didn’t surprise me by acting in anger, sending the cube toward me, hoping to use my distraction to score a point, for it would have been no doubt a humiliating forfeit. </p><p>I bounced off the cube with a simple wave of my hand toward the other side of the room, not even bothering to counter-attack, which made their jealousy even thicker. For the moment, their own sexiness, like Cornelia’s toned, sexy legs, or Helga’s her own beautiful tits dangling freely was forgotten, dazed by Marianne’s dance. </p><p>Halfway in, she bent forward, which enhanced the sight of her beautiful breasts — full and firm, big and juicy, topped with amazing pink nipples. </p><p>In other words, a total masterpiece. </p><p>I made a show of letting out an impressed sigh, which invited another ice cube attack, this time from Titania. I once again deflected that, quite easily as the girls were too distracted and frustrated to properly cooperate. Though none of them appreciated the effortless way I was dismissing their attacks. </p><p>When Marianne’s slow walk finished, standing in front of me proudly, her hands running over my chest and arms. “What’s my order?” she asked in a beautiful, throaty tone. </p><p>“Well, I’m feeling rather uncomfortable,” I said, my gaze dipping down to my crotch to show what I was talking about. Marianne lowered herself without asking the question, but far too slow to be classified as immediate. Though, considering she spent that time peppering my chest with gentle kisses, I was willing to forgive her dalliance. </p><p>“Should we pause the game?” Helga asked, excited and frustrated. </p><p>“No need,” I said, not bothering to hide my gasp as Marianne’s hot lips touched my shaft. “You clearly need all the advantage you could afford,” I added smugly, once again fueling their jealousy and competitiveness at the same time. </p><p>However, as they did so, I was already using our connection to transfer my mana to Marianne, not to recover her mana but to help her level up. I was still undecided between prioritizing her companion process and my own leveling —challenged by the restricted nature of the Divine Spark I stole from the headmistress — but increasing her level was an obvious target. </p><p>[-1239 Mana]</p><p>Marianne murmured in appreciation as the mana flooded into her body, showing her happiness by going deeper along the length, swallowing it greatly. Despite the great struggle it created for her little delicate mouth, she stuffed my whole length into her mouth, a considerable part slipping into her throat. </p><p>“Such a nice bet,” I said mockingly even as I looked other three girls, all alternating between frustration and jealousy while they tried to attack me with the ice cube, trying to leverage my distraction. Admittedly, Marianne’s lips combined with the challenge of converting my mana into experience points for her was considerable. If they cooperated properly at that point, they could have scored a point… </p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t the only one distracted by the sight of Marianne’s joyful fulfillment of the bet. </p><p>A gasp went through the room as Marianne grabbed my thighs before moving her head back and forth aggressively, helped by my fingers passing through her golden hair. </p><p>The gasp came from Titania, whose recent memories of a threesome with Marianne awakened by the sight, which caused her to be just distracted enough to receive another hit from the ice cube, getting rid of her skirt as well, making her the last person to be limited to her underwear or less. </p><p>I could have leveraged the opportunity to bounce the attack to Helga to achieve another hit, but teasing them indirectly while giving them a great show in the process was much more attractive. So, for the next minute, I focused on defense while Marianne’s enthusiastic moans got louder and louder despite the obstruction on the way.</p><p>I even helped her by bringing my foot between her legs, gently caressing her wetness while she shivered. </p><p>That lasted until Marianne, already on the edge thanks to the excitement of the situation, climaxed hard. She shivered and moaned helplessly, but I kept my hands on her head, still using her throat for a masturbation aid while she slackened under the rush of pleasure.  </p><p>Then a surprising thing popped into my field of vision. </p><p>[Achievement: Sensational Show. Hold the attention of an invested crowd through careful measurement of activities. +2000 Experience, +5 Charisma]</p><p>It had been a while since I had received a proper achievement, not that it was not wanted. Especially charisma, which impacted the maximum potency of the offensive spells greatly. </p><p>Good, I thought even as I let Marianne go, and she collapsed on the floor, breathing hard. “Marianne doesn’t seem to be ready to join back immediately,” I said even as I called the ice cube, letting it float around my finger threateningly. “Shall we continue?”</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 492393 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 6932  / 7750        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Cornelia was first to speak, which didn’t surprise me the slightest. “What kind of game?” </p><p>“Nothing intense or exhausting,” I said even as I conjured a piece of ice. “We just push the rock toward each other using arcana mana, and if the ice touches someone, or if someone breaks it, they lose the round.” Essentially, it was a modified mana control exercise, too little power, and the ice touches you, too much power, and the ice would crumble. </p><p>It was a tricky play due to the competitive nature, but simple enough that everyone would have more or less equal playing field in terms of ability. Tactics was a different issue, of course. “And what happens when we lose a point?” Cornelia asked. </p><p>“Good point, we need to find something for point loss to make it more fun,” I said with an exaggerated focus like I had no idea, my overacting enough to earn four matching smiles from the audience. “How about losing a piece of clothing?” </p><p>“Such an unexpected forfeit,” Helga said in a deadpan voice, while a giggle escaped into the room, surprisingly from Titania. </p><p>“What about you?” Cornelia said, pointing at my naked state. “It doesn’t look like you have a lot of clothing to lose.” </p><p>“That’s simple. For every loss, I would follow one order from the one that’s responsible for my loss.” That put a different shine on their eyes, though Marianne and Helga were less enthusiastic compared to Cornelia and Titania, who were less used to the submissive role in our weird little coven. </p><p>“Excellent,” Cornelia murmured while Titania looked enthusiastic. </p><p>“Okay, some more ground rules to make it more fun before we start, then,” I said. “No spells other than arcana energy pushing and pulling, and no direct casting on others, but blocking and interfering with the other’s pushes are allowed.” The rules earned a bunch of nods.</p><p>“Let’s start, then,” I said with a smirk, even as I flicked the ice toward the Cornelia the moment she nodded, scoring an early score. </p><p>“That’s cheating,” she gasped, her red hair flying as she shook her head in shock, though her gasp was buried in the matching giggles of the other three girls, even Titania. </p><p>“Really, he said we were starting, and you nodded. How’s that cheating,” Helga asked, her smirk still wide. The fact that Cornelia sighed in defeat rather than flaring in anger proved just how much their friendship had grown during the struggle. Before that, a mocking comment from a commoner would have sent Cornelia into a fit of fury, rather than earning a friendly surrender. </p><p>With a sigh, she stood up from her seat, removing her robe quickly, revealing a blouse and a skirt underneath. Not the sexiest, but considering they changed whatever they were able to find after a long battle, it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. </p><p>Not to mention, the beautify of the tight body underneath went a long way to display even the inferior clothing the best way possible, not extreme like a warrior, but just soft enough to leave no doubt about her exclusive magic focus, her terrific ass still visible through her ill-fitting skirt. </p><p>She threw her robe to the side, but before her ass made contact with her chair, the ice cube was already flying toward me, a victorious smirk on her lips. </p><p>Too bad for her that I was ready for the ploy, and gave a counter push. Not directly, trying to push back to her, instead of deflecting it, and it hit Marianne instead. “Good luck next time,” I said to Cornelia even as Marianne frowned, but the speed she jumped to her feet, and the erotic slowness of her removal, suggested that she was not really unhappy about suffering the crossfire. </p><p>I whistled at the show. Marianne had one advantage over Cornelia, that the city she was holding was still upright, meaning her personal items were safe and sound. And current blouse she was wearing was clearly there for a special occasion — and likely acquired after the amazing threesome, to make sure the next adventure was sufficiently fun. </p><p>I assumed she bought that later on, because it was not one of those expensive silk ones. Instead, it was a simple linen one, though simple didn’t mean ugly. After all, it was Marianne we were talking about, a slightly low cut that would have been looked modest on anyone else was enough to turn her looks into an erotic masterpiece, with an attractive cleavage. </p><p>So much, that I decided to double down. Before Marianne could ever sit down, I flared my mana, and the ice cube slipped down her top, into her cleavage, earning a shocked gasp. “Caesar!” she gasped. </p><p>“What? You need to be careful about the ambushes,” I said while Helga chuckled on the side. </p><p>Marianne frowned playfully, but that didn’t stop her hips from starting to dance as she grabbed her skirt. Unfortunately, rather than pushing it, she flicked her feet, removing one of her shoes. </p><p>“Stingy,” I said in mock disappointment, while Marianne flared her mana, and it hit Helga. “Hey!” she gasped as she flicked it back to Marianne, but she was ready to defend that. </p><p>And just like that, their supposed alliance shattered, and they started throwing at each other. The rest of us leaned back, enjoying two blonde sexy beauties attacking each other with a small ice cube. They managed to hit each other a couple of times, and accidentally shattered the cube a couple of times as well. </p><p>Their spontaneous battle lasted for a minute, and when their heated battle came to a lull, both parties had already paid a significant cost. Both parties had lost every single accessory they had on, no shoes, no socks, no other stuff. Helga was reduced to her corset at the top, though she still had her skirt. Marianne lacked that as well, limited to her panties and corset, both struggling to contain her assets. </p><p>And I wasn’t the only one that was examining her cleavage in fascination, though the girls’ gazes were split between arousal and jealousy. </p><p>I had a feeling that they were going to ignore Marianne for a while. </p><p>It was not to say the other girls weren’t as beautiful as Marianne, but the sight of her only in a corset, her assets struggling desperately against the prison for freedom, was rather striking. </p><p>Enough to make the other three rather jealous. </p><p>Cornelia didn’t surprise me, and attacked Helga, freeing her from the domineering confines of her skirt after three aggressive attempts, but costing her her robe and shoes in the process as she notoriously didn’t care about the defense. </p><p>Almost like she didn’t care about revealing her naked body! How wondrous. </p><p>However, Titania stood on the side with a slight frown. With her power and achievements, she clearly stood apart from the other girls, which was normally an advantage for her, but during the current playful state, it was enough for her to feel left out, with a slight frown on her face. </p><p>I decided to help her. However, just throwing a piece of ice toward her wouldn’t solve the issue, reducing the game between me and Titania. No, I wanted her to mix properly with the girls. </p><p>So, I waited until Helga counter-attacked Cornelia once again, who was already freed from all of her accessories, relying on her skirt and blouse to cover her body. Helga was aiming to remove one of those as well, which Cornelia didn’t seem very concerned about. </p><p>However, a subtle touch of my mana, sneaky enough to avoid the limited attention of the girls, was enough to strengthen Cornelia’s half-hearted defense, not only bouncing the ice cube successfully, but also managing to hit Titania. For the others, of course. As the one whose spell was interfered, Cornelia noticed my intervention despite the subtleness of my touch. </p><p>Cornelia’s gaze found mine before the cube even touched Titania. I nodded. It was a subtle message, but Cornelia was smart enough to understand that I wanted Titania to be included in their erotic game. </p><p>After all, it was hard to have a proper orgy if one of the participants was fully clothed. </p><p>Titania reacted just as I hoped. “You dare,” she gasped, but her gasp was just too cute to be intimidating as the ice cube touched her skin. She flicked the ice cube back to Cornelia, which easily scored a hit.</p><p>“Don’t forget to get rid of an item of clothing first,” I said to Titania, giving Cornelia and Helga enough time to share a nod without Titania noticing. Cornelia removed her blouse in the process as well, but when the game started once more, Helga and Cornelia suddenly targeted Titania together. </p><p>Titania tried to defend, but her attempts were a bit too zealous, shattering the ice in the process by applying too much pressure. </p><p>“You need to be more careful, sweetie,” I said mockingly to Titania, earning the target of the ire she generated through her failure. It might be a simple game, but Titania was famously perfectionist when it came to magic, and even a trivial loss was enough to frustrate her. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, by trying to attack me, she left herself vulnerable to a counter-attack. I deflected the cube in the middle, Helga and Cornelia immediately using the opportunity to score another hit on Titania, depriving her of another piece of coverage, bringing her closer to nakedness. </p><p>“Good luck for the next time,” I said to Titania, but stayed fully defensive while the battle turned into Cornelia and Helga against Titania, with Marianne watching from the side smugly, happy with their jealous glances at her amazing cleavage. </p><p>Titania tried to attack me a couple of times, but after failing twice with dangerous cost, she temporarily abandoned that, focusing on Cornelia and Helga. </p><p>It was a heated battle, beautiful not only in terms of magical achievement, but also in terms of the results of their beautiful battle. When they finally came to stop, even the most dressed, Titania, only had a skirt in addition to their corset and panties. Helga even lost another piece despite her defensive strategy, leaving her only in her panties, her beautiful breasts perkily standing out. Cornelia and Marianne still had their panties and corset. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>I even gained some experience from Titania’s conservative stripping, as she was the only one with the level to do so. </p><p>“Maybe we should have a different target,” one of them suddenly murmured, pointing at me. Interestingly, it was the last one I would have expected. </p><p>Marianne. </p><p>“It was always the quiet ones,” I chuckled with an excited smirk even as I barely deflected the ice cube sent by the four of them. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 490393 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 7595  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was tempted to just push back Nancy, enjoying the perks of permanent access to a perky, lively redhead who embodied every cheese cliches about her hair color. </p><p>But that would have made me miss an excellent opportunity to discipline her, where I have a perfect reason — her disrespect to Penny despite her helping existence — perfect leverage — pulling back from the pro-bono event I promised — and not to mention the mood — one that she put herself in after watching my morning fun with Penny. </p><p>The fact that Penny was watching, making it an excellent two-for-the-price-of-one kind of lesson was just icing on the cake. </p><p>I had to be an idiot to miss such a beautiful opportunity to teach her a lesson. </p><p> “Are you ready to apologize properly?” I said even as I let my gaze dance over her body, enjoying the way she trembled. </p><p>“Properly?” she said, the question enough to inflame her anger for a moment. “What do you mean, properly?” </p><p>“You decided to use pain to teach cute little Penny a lesson,” I said, which made her face alight in alarm. I was quick to explain. “And while I’m not asshole enough to make you pay back with pain, a little discomfort is not out of question.” </p><p>“You can’t expect me to” she started, only to be silenced when I raised my hand sharply. </p><p>“I’m not expecting anything from you. I’m giving you a choice to maintain our willingness to waste a full day helping you. It’s your choice to pick.” </p><p>“But… You can’t cancel now.” </p><p>“Well, you should have thought that before torturing poor Penny,” I said even as I crossed my arms, hovering above her domineeringly. “It’s time for a choice.” </p><p>“Please,” she gasped. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie,” I said even as I put my hand on her shoulder. “You just need to show how sorry you are, and we can continue. I’m even going to let you pick the method yourself, as long as it’s properly convincing.” </p><p>While Nancy tried to come to a decision, I stretched, using the opportunity to look at Penny without either of them noticing, only to see Penny watching the proceedings with a shocked expression, though with an undertone of satisfaction. </p><p>“What do I need to do,\" Nancy asked after twenty seconds. </p><p>“You’re a smart girl, honey,” I said as I smiled at her deviously. “I’m sure you can figure it out.” Just to help her more, I took a step forward, which brought my bulge very close to her beautiful face. </p><p>She didn’t answer, but she was smart enough to understand the implications. A resigned expression on her face, her hand reached to my belt, and after a slight fumbling of her trembling fingers, she freed my shaft. </p><p>“Good choice,” I said even as her fingers hovered around my shaft, her lips nearing to deliver a little kiss to the head. “Now, prove to me just how sorry you are.” She looked at me questioningly, the angle making the sight considerably more erotic, especially with the helpless anger that was shining in her eyes. </p><p>\"I-I-um-I...\" Nancy stammered for a moment as she considered her commitment, but ultimately, it didn’t take long for her to commit to a decision that was already made. She leaned forward, her tight lips wrapping around my girth. </p><p>\"Good girl,\" I purred in satisfaction, the earlier authoritative tone replaced by satisfaction. I even patted her head, which earned another flare of anger. </p><p>However, that didn’t prevent her from continuing her self-assigned strategy of earning forgiveness. After all, it was hardly the first time she was exploring my shaft. She trembled as she moved forward, while I let my fingers slip down, caressing her cheek, condescending yet effective. </p><p>Patience was a virtue, but knowing and applying were two different subjects. I fought with my desire to grab her beautiful hair, pushing my shaft deep into her mouth until it invaded her beautiful throat completely rather than waiting for her slow, hesitant technique to bring me anywhere near completion. </p><p>It would no doubt work with her confusion, but it wouldn’t give the sense of achievement of her obedient surrender. No, I wanted my disobedient model to act in her own volition to show proper obedience. </p><p>After a minute, she pulled back, her eyes closed as she took a deep breath, before opening her eyes and looking up, with a hopeful look in her eyes. However, meeting with my steely expression, she just shuffled in her seat.</p><p>“What, that’s all you could manage?” I asked with a dismissive tone. </p><p>Teasing her had the exact information I was hoping for. Her anger flared, easily suppressing her concerns. Her lips parted as she leaned forward, capturing the crown with a renewed determination. </p><p>A comfortable warmth wrapped around my girth as a guttural sound of satisfaction escaped my mouth. It might be a power play, but I had no problems encouraging her with the signs of her impressive success. </p><p>Especially since Penny was still watching me from outside with a shocked expression. A little competition was only fair, after all. </p><p>I groaned in pleasure repeatedly as her head bobbed around my shaft, going deeper inch by inch. It was yet to reach an impressive level, but her steady development was very impressive. As my moans got stronger, her eyes opened once more, trying to catch my expression, her gaze enhancing my joy even more. </p><p>“You’re doing well enough,” I said. “You don’t need to push yourself too much if that’s all you can handle.” </p><p>I smirked when I felt her hands land on my thighs, her grip tight. The ease I could use her belligerent mood for my benefit was shockingly easy, to a point that would have been boring if the result was anything other than a sexy redhead trying to swallow the entirety of my shaft. </p><p>She ignored my growing amusement as she tightened her grip further before pulling herself even deeper, finally pushing into her throat. After a few gags, she pulled back, but before I could fear whether she changed her mind, her tongue was out, giving a soft lick across my length. Then, she restarted her bobbing.   </p><p>It was good, delicious even, but unfortunately, when she managed to reach the two-thirds mark, her progress stalled. She was still bobbing back and forth, but with no attempt to swallow more. “Come on, sweetheart, you were doing so well, swallow the rest,” I teased. </p><p>At my words, she tried to go even deeper. Unfortunately, her repeated attempts failed to bring any reasonable success, so I decided to help her. </p><p>I made a show of sighing loudly even as I grabbed her head. “It seems that you still need some help. You’re lucky that I’m a helpful person,” I said, though she didn’t grasp until my next words. “Try not to faint.” </p><p>Her eyes widened as she processed my message, but it was too late to react. Not only my hands were there to prevent her escape, but also I was already pulling her deeper. She gagged as my shaft invaded her throat, slightly harder than I would have done under different circumstances. </p><p>But considering I was also putting a show for Penny, who was watching the proceedings with a passionate expression, I decided to apply a harder touch. </p><p>As I pushed her head, a warm tightness wrapped my shaft, good enough to deserve the word ‘heavenly’ for its description. I forced her deeper still, ignoring her ineffectual pushes in protest, her gagging as she tried to resist was music to my ears. </p><p>Then, I turned toward Penny, who was still watching from the window. This time, however, I didn’t bother hiding my gaze, turning directly. Her eyes widened, but before she could escape, I gestured with my finger, calling her to enter the room. </p><p>The innocent expression of shock as she realized she had been caught was simply marvelous, her blush rising immediately to contrast with her beautiful hair, but contrasting greatly with her brave warrior costume. </p><p>However, her shyness didn’t prevent her from following my order when I repeated the gesture with one hand, the other still around Nancy’s head as I pulled her tight, invading her throat repeatedly. </p><p>Nancy’s gagging suppressed the whisper that occurred as Penny silently opened the door, walking closer hesitantly. I eased the pressure a bit only when Penny stood in front of her, and when Nancy opened her eyes, her eyes widened, their expression of shock matching beautifully. </p><p>“What the hell-” Nancy started as I pulled out my shaft, only to shut up when I exploded on her face, covering it with a generous dose of my seed. </p><p>“You need to apologize to Penny directly, so I called her, of course,” I said mockingly, enjoying the expression of shock as she found herself humiliated with a stained face. </p><p>“You can’t expect me to-” Nancy started, starting like a whisper, but getting louder with each word. I interrupted her by pressing my hand to her lips. </p><p>“Be careful, you don’t want to pull an audience in your current state,” I warned, and she was silenced. “And, of course, I expect you to apologize, unless you want us to turn back and abort your precious event. Penny deserved that much.” </p><p>“She doesn’t have to-” Penny started, but a glance was enough to silence her. </p><p>“No, sweetie, you want to be a model, you can’t be one unless you learn how to defend yourself socially. It’s a cutthroat business,” I explained. </p><p>“But…” Nancy started, but under the weight of her career and my stern gaze, her argument faded. “I’m sorry, Penny, for lashing out.” </p><p>“Thanks,” Penny murmured. </p><p>“Barely enough,” I commented with a chuckle. “You’re lucky that Penny is a good girl.” </p><p>Nancy stood with a sigh, wanting to extract herself from the defeat, but before she could go, I grabbed her wrist. “No need to hurry up,” I said with a smirk. “Since we’re here, why don’t we have a practice shoot first, to make sure you girls can work together…” </p>",

    "title": "Arcane Detective 3",
    "content": "<p>As I walked into the room, the smell of rotten meat and the other things grew thicker, so much that I wasn’t surprised to find two rotten bodies behind the doorway, the kind of rot that would only happen in a week or two. With the presence of two rotting bodies, it was easy to ignore the gaudy red and gold decorations of the room. </p><p>Though saying that they looked better than a pair of smelling corpses was hardly a compliment.</p><p> I took a step forward, passing next to dark, rich leather-covered chairs, and my feet sank into the thick, rust-colored shag of a carpet that wouldn’t be remiss in an Italian porn movie that was shot in the seventies, an impression that was further enhanced by the velvet velour curtains, thick enough to cut the sunlight completely. </p><p>“You’re here again, you conman,” growled another familiar figure as I stepped inside, only to meet with a blonde woman, with glasses huge enough to cover half of her face. </p><p>“You wound me by calling me with that ugly name, professor,” I said with a teasing tone as I looked at her, only to receive a scathing look back. Her name was Christiana Dewart. She wasn’t actually a professor, but one of the junior crime scene analysts. Her true ability was higher than her rank, but just like Detective Joanna, her rise had been limited both by her gender and her looks, and the connotation between being blonde and stupidity didn’t help. It was the reason for her huge ugly glasses despite having a near-perfect vision, trying to add some gravitas to her persona, though, why she hadn’t tried to die her hair to different color was another question. </p><p>“If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck…” she growled. </p><p>“How interesting,” I answered with a big smile. “But if you’re going to attack a magician, first you need to reveal their tricks. How about it, were you able to prove that the latest locked-room murder was done by someone sneaking through the air ducks like you claimed it was the case,” I said. </p><p>Rather than answering, she just growled helplessly, but her lack of words was better than any kind of answer. </p><p>“Stop flirting,” Detective Joanna cut off as she looked down at the bodies. I chuckled, while Maria exclaimed in anger to Joanna, who ignored her gaze. “I need to know how the hell two bodies could stay here undiscovered for almost two weeks.”</p><p>It was a good question, so I let my magic stretch and cover the surface of the bodies. As I tapped into my magic, my tenseness disappeared further. </p><p>For a spellcaster, regardless of the tradition they had been trained, the level of strength they displayed, or the environment, not using their magic for an extended period was, without an exception, uncomfortable, though those factors would affect the speed of the build-up, and the ultimate intensity of the effect. </p><p>And I was a sorcerer, which came from the old hermetic tradition, desiring to control the universe as much as possible, no matter the mana required. Which meant that any sorcerer, focused on developing their magical reserves and recovery to the limit. Meaning, even the weakest sorcerer would start feeling the effects of magical withdrawal quite a bit. </p><p>And since I belonged to upper echelons even among the sorcerers, the sensation was even thicker for me, and the scarce magic field of the Earth hardly helped. If I hadn’t been born on Earth — something most of the council was unaware of thanks to my master — that scarcity would have made things even worse. </p><p>Exile would have been truly a horrible punishment if I hadn’t the initiative to fight against low-level supernatural threats — and I was sure that those blue-blooded idiots in the council who never even put their clothes without the help of a servant never considered I would use the ancient charter to break their punishment.</p><p>It wasn’t surprising that they missed that. It was well out of their way of thinking. I had no doubt that some of them would prefer killing themselves out of pride instead of ‘shaming’ themselves by serving the natives of a distant dimension. </p><p>I had a much more utilitarian approach to supposed exalted position sorcerers were supposed to hold, and wasn’t afraid of a bit of hard word. </p><p>Admittedly, having two feisty police babes helping me in my investigation was a nice perk. </p><p>The spell I was casting was neither difficult nor required a lot of focus, allowing me to get an easy result. “Are you ready to answer?” Joanna asked, her brunette hair flowing wildly as she swung her head angrily. “How the hell these corpses stayed there two weeks without being noticed.” </p><p>“Simple,” I answered with a smirk that no doubt drove Christiana angry as she assumed I had been making light of the challenge she was facing. My answer didn’t do anything to reduce her annoyance. “They weren’t here two weeks ago.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” Joanna burst before Christiana could even suppress her professional annoyance and retort. “You’re telling me that the killer went all the trouble of sneaking two bodies into a random hotel room for some reason, avoiding all the cameras and eye-witnesses in the process.” </p><p>“No, that’s not what I’m saying, not that it’s as impossible as you think. They weren’t dead two weeks ago. They had been killed just hours ago.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” Christiana said, echoing Joanna’s earlier words. “They are clearly in the late stages of decomposition. How could you even claim such nonsense with a straight face!” she said, her tone getting colder and colder with anger. She turned to her friend. “I don’t know why you’re even bothering to deal with this charlatan. We should just send him away and -” she continued, her anger getting more and more intense. </p><p>“Hold your horses, sweetie,” I cut in. The diminutive nickname in the professional environment hardly helped her to suppress her anger. Seeing she took a deep breath, about to explode, I continued quickly. “How about a bet, if I lose, I’ll never come to another crime scene you’re handling?”</p><p>“What kind of bet?” she said with clear interest, no doubt her anger making her forget the previous cases I helped them to resolve. </p><p>“Simple, you can work on the bodies as much as for the rest of the day. And if you can enough evidence other than their decomposed state to convince Joanna to file an official report about their time of death, it’ll be my loss.” </p><p>“And what if you win?” she asked, even in anger, smart enough to realize the difficulty of the task. Due to her shaky position, Joanna was notoriously careful in making any written conclusion, rightfully aware that her enemies in the station would use any major mistake to marginalize her to a paper-pusher role.</p><p>“Not much, just a date where you’re obligated to stick around until the end, and actually try to be nice.” </p><p>“If you think-” Christiana tried to say, only to be cut off by Joanna. </p><p>“Enough, either accept or decline, but you need to start working. This is not a primary school.” </p><p>Christiana did the smart thing and stopped speaking. But being silenced by her friend stifled her mood even more. Which worked to my benefit, because before starting to work on the bodies, she gave me a stiff nod, showing that she had accepted our bet. </p><p>Which meant that there was nothing to do until they believed my conclusion about the time of death. I didn’t blame them for their reluctance. After all, I just stood there for a few seconds, and came to a wild conclusion. Joanna would have kicked me out there if it wasn’t for my previous successes. </p><p>Being a detective was hard enough without adding people who claimed to have mysterious powers, but only trying to use their credentials as a consultant to rob gullible housewives of their divorce settlements — an opinion that more than one police officer shared with me without prompting, disturbing me with their annoying nasal voice. </p><p>Just like that, I left the hotel — quite happy to get away from the disgustingly gaudy decorations — and started walking back to my office. Unfortunately, leaving the scene of the crime didn’t mean that I could leave the crime itself as well. I hadn’t bothered to talk with the Detective, as it would have broken through her already stretched suspension of disbelief, but the victims had been killed directly by magic. </p><p>And to make it even more fun, not only the magic that had been used was the kind that would send chills to any sane spell caster. It wasn’t the worst of the worst, but considering the limitless nature of the magic for evil, the dark nature of the murders was still unsettling. </p><p>Especially since whoever killed them went through the trouble of draining their life energy completely. Even though it was a disgusting act, enough to distort the nature of the caster for eternity, many did so, because it was enjoyed as a delicacy by many creatures, though none of those creatures belonged to the cuddly category. </p><p>Vampires, for example, were by far the most innocent ones in that category, which was enough to explain the nature of the list. </p><p>I decided to be more proactive in resolving the issue, before the idiot who decided to dabble with the dark magic did something stupid and contacted one of the more dangerous species on the list, some of them enough to invade Earth in less than twenty-four hours. </p><p>I didn’t want my homeland to be ruined. </p><p>But my plans of immediately starting on it were aborted when I returned to my office, only to realize I wasn’t alone… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The doors of the treasury opened only after a complicated and lengthy process by Sapphire, to a point that even with the Tether, I couldn’t have broken through without raising an alarm. </p><p>It was not about the skill, but about time and contingencies. It was simply not a job for one person. Layers and layers of defense, each thicker than the last, with all the subtleness and elegance of a drunk cow. Even examining them was not exactly enjoyable. </p><p>Luckily, Sapphire’s current state of dress — or more accurately, a very distinct lack of any — made it a worthwhile show despite the boring design of the defenses. It took almost ten minutes for the great doors of the private royal entrance to be opened, and the Queen walked forward. I followed, expecting to be met with a great pile of gold, jewels, and magical items, several times more than what I managed to gather during my brief career as a Dark Lord… </p><p>… only to met with a desolate room. </p><p>It wasn’t completely empty, of course. In particular, the walls had many magical items, each enough to drove people crazy with jealousy, representing history. Each artifact was enough to change the world if carried by an appropriate wielder, enough to shake the world. Finding an appropriate wielder one could trust, however, was much more difficult. </p><p>Still, artifacts, I expected. What I didn’t expect was the desolate state of the treasury when it came to gold and other valuable items. It wasn’t completely empty, but considering the size of the Empire, it might as well have been. It was barely a tenth of the treasury I had as a Dark Lord, and I had never been particularly focused on making money.  </p><p>“Wow,” I said with a whistle. “Not exactly what I expected. No wonder you didn’t try to buy my services with gold.” </p><p>“It’s just a temporary problem with taxation,” she answered, which I didn’t believe even a second. An empire of that size and reputation should have enough reserves to handle an extended battle, which couldn’t be depleted through a temporary dip in taxation. </p><p>It couldn’t even be depleted through Sapphire’s whole rule, even if she was completely incompetent. And as much as it was easy to estimate her due to our current relationship, Sapphire was not incompetent enough to miss the significance of such a depleted treasury. </p><p>“For how long the treasury had been empty?” I asked, curious. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she answered, which was all the answer I needed. It meant that it was empty the moment she took the crown and became the ruling Queen. </p><p>No wonder she couldn’t handle the rebellion easily. A monarch without money was like a warrior without his dominant arm, not exactly helpless but not far from that state either. </p><p>“What happened to all the money you guys got from my latest client,” I asked, indirectly asking about my own treasury. Some of the items I could see on the walls, but a majority was absent, and so were some of the more distinct gems in my hoard. </p><p>“Our share is already spent,” Sapphire admitted even as she walked toward the center of the treasury, where marble statues were displaying the artifacts from the past heroes, the Shield being one of them. “Not that we received a lot in the first place from the gold. Convincing the dark families to work against him was not cheap.” </p><p>And she clearly didn’t want it to be known just how desperately the Empire was needing gold, which would have been even deadlier than the absence. Trying to push a big bargain, trying to get a bigger share of the gold rather than monopolizing the library and some of the special would have made not only the dark families, but also internal factions of the Empire suspicious, something she could hardly afford in her already shaky position.  </p><p>If I wasn’t her only hope against a completely unknown threat, I doubted that she would actually trust me enough to reveal the current state, and even then, it was only because her mind was still blurry from being dominated repeatedly on her own throne, the center of her power. </p><p>While I was considering the implications of a depleted treasury, she removed the wards that were keeping the Shield of Ether and removed it. When she stood in front of me, I knelt. I didn’t need to do anything particular to make a mockery of the traditional knighting ceremony where the noble hero received the gift from the Queen before going for an impossible adventure, her nakedness, combined with the red marks remained from my aggressive domination did that perfectly. </p><p>“Just as promised,” Sapphire said with a sigh as she passed me the shield, not even bothering to comment on my clowning. After everything I had done to defile the pride of the Empire, the last step was nothing. “Is that all you need before you start your research?” </p><p>I swung the shield a couple of times, trying to get used to its presence even as I let my mana slip through it, trying to take control, only to be rebuffed immediately. It didn’t surprise me. The other two artifacts came from the previous Dark Lords, which meant that I had a good idea about their working principles, not to mention I had the appropriate techniques. </p><p>The Shield of Ether was completely different, even more so than I expected, but that didn’t discourage me. It wouldn’t be the first impossible item I tamed for my usage. </p><p>“Just one more thing,” I said even as I looked at the nearest pile of gold — after all, while I mentioned the Empire being poor, it was by the standards of a huge empire. There was still enough gold to tempt someone, or more importantly, make a bed for some transitionary fun. </p><p>Sapphire misunderstood the point of my gaze. “Out of the question!” she said sharply, her Queenly persona awakening immediately. “We already have a deal. Anything more is impossible.” </p><p>I chuckled even as I took a step forward, my hand slipping between her legs for a soft caress. “Don’t worry, my Queen, I’m not interested in your gold. I’m only interested in your body.” </p><p>That answer, combined with my touch, was enough to steal her breath, enough for me to cast a spell to cushion the impact and push her over the pile. </p><p>Without magic, gold made an extremely uncomfortable bed. </p><p>Sapphire’s expression was glorious once again. She was pissed at me, but that didn’t stop her body from betraying her immediately, her legs parting open automatically. </p><p>She remained stuck into her confusing rush of emotions as I crouched between her legs, squeezing her inner thighs aggressive enough to leave lingering fingerprints, even as another flare of magic pulled my pants down. “I didn’t actually realize just how much you needed the gold,” I said even as I pushed my erection forward, pressing against her entrance. “I might be inclined to share the location of one of the backup treasuries of our mutual friend with you,” I offered. </p><p>“You - you would,” she stuttered, gasping midway as I rubbed against her entrance, but didn’t slide inside her. </p><p>“As long as I’m in a good mood, of course,” I said, even as I pulled back. “It has been a while I enjoyed a dance from you,” I added even as I suddenly changed position, sitting on the pile of gold as well. “Why don’t you give me a show, and I might even tip very generously if you can satisfy me.”</p><p>The shift in expression was beautiful. It wasn’t the first time she would use her body as a bargaining material, but somehow, making the same deal in exchange for gold, even piles of it, somehow made her even more like a streetwalker. And if her stormy expression was any indicator, she was well aware of the distinction as well. </p><p>But that didn’t prevent her from standing up, her body swaying to imaginary music immediately. She was getting more and more obedient, much to my happiness. </p><p>The imaginary music she picked was slow, her hips swaying beautifully. Her hands ran up her hips, moved to her stomach as they continued to their climb. Her body continued to sway during the climb, but soon, the journey of her hands took a break around her breasts, squeezing them beautifully, accompanied by a deep moan. </p><p>I licked my lips, enjoying the carnal feeling of her dance. She was an amazing dancer, which was something I knew from her show back at the club. However, the nature of her current dance was very different than the show she had conducted back at the club, where she had always radiated a sense of etherealness.</p><p>The only thing she radiated right now was a slutty need, intense enough to drive me crazy if I didn’t know how to isolate the effects of her tantric magic mixing into her every move as she tried to addict me to her pleasure, unaware it was working reverse. </p><p>Soon, she leaned back, arching her body until her breasts were pointing at the ceiling, while her pelvis was presented blatantly in front of me, tempting me to let out a cheer to release my arousal. </p><p>But that was just a start. Soon, she turned her back to me, her fingers danced over her inner thighs, displaying her curvy ass perfectly — not that her glorious hips needed such assistance. She crouched down, her hips shaking in a melodic beat, her nakedness revealing her wetness completely even as her ass rubbed against my thigh, going back and forth on my lap. </p><p>The plan was to let her dance while lazily sitting on a pile of gold, enjoying the erotic service, but having such a flawless beauty rubbing against me relentlessly, my hands rebelled in short order, and landed on her waist before starting to glide up her body. </p><p>As her hands moved to her chest, mine was not too far away. Her hands landed on the center, hiding her nipples, while my fingers danced on the edges, arousing her even more, as evidenced by her beautiful moans. The way her bare breasts swayed with her movements despite two pairs of hands trying to contain them just added to the beauty. </p><p>Then, she stood up and turned toward me, her fingers around her nipples, twisting and squeezing, her face telling a tale of arousal and surrender. Her latest attempt to use Tantric magic had broken through another layer of self-control. </p><p>She was mine for the rest of the night, utterly and completely. </p><p>All I needed to decide was what to do next… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The first step of my amazingly daring heist into the estate of a Patrician house was rather inglorious, to find something to wear, since I was suffering from a noticeable lack of clothing after the latest adventure, after changing rooms several times. I could have walked back to the main courtyard where I had removed my clothes, which was the easiest solution. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was not the best solution. My clothes had been chosen carefully by the school, designed to make my figure as eye-catching as possible to enhance my celebrity factor, while making sure that I was more like an object of desire and admiration rather than an actual threat. </p><p>In other words, it might be easier to sneak around naked rather than wearing that flashy costume, made almost entirely of glistening leather and metal. </p><p>Luckily, while the perimeter of the estate was surrounded by a number of deadly wards that would cut even a Sorcerer into shreds in seconds, the same level of security didn’t apply to the inner courtyard, which was exclusively for noble guests. </p><p>So, I triggered my magic, wrapping my body with a combination of air and water, creating a simmering field distorting the light, giving me something close to invisibility as long as I stuck close to the shadows, and still subtle to avoid the attention of any mage as long as they hadn’t been actively searching for an infiltrator.</p><p>Still, that didn’t mean that I had no need for any clothes. I was tempted to go back and steal the clothes of one of the sleeping nobles, but I didn’t do so, afraid that there might be some servants that’s taking care of them now that their mistress was not there anymore. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the first Roman party that every single participant collapsed in the exhaustion from an alcohol-fueled orgy. </p><p>Luckily, the clothes of a noble weren’t the best clothing for infiltration as well. A noble guest in a place they weren’t supposed to be seen would raise almost as much commotion as a gladiator in the library. No, I needed something that would help me fade. </p><p>Unlike the rest of the house, which was silent at this dark hour of the night, the servants’ quarter was filled with lights and action as they prepared for the next day, washing, cooking, and many other activities. </p><p>Two slaves carrying a huge bag filled with clothes opened the door, too focused on their exhaustion to notice the slight shimmer as I slipped inside the washing room, which gave me a significant number of options to pick clothes, from the almost nonexistent clothing of pleasure slaves to expensive linen and silk-blend has worn by the select slaves that was responsible for the financial and management estate matters, their position much higher than a free citizen without a noble heritage. </p><p>I slipped behind the shadow of the door, waiting for the maids to drop the bag and leave the laundry room. Only after they slammed the door, I started my search. After some examination, however, I managed to find a large gray robe perfect for my needs. </p><p>I donned the robe, and after a few simple illusions to reinforce the spell, the intimidating gladiator was gone, replaced by a weak library assistant that almost melted against the background. “That’s a familiar feeling,” I murmured even as I left the room and started walking toward the library. </p><p>Back in the school, as a little bastard noble, the worst sin I could do was to get people’s attention, so, I perfected an attitude that would make people not notice me. Fast steps, lowered head, slightly slouched shoulders… It was trickier than one might think, because it was a weak pose, and unless a certain balance was achieved, it actually made people notice a little weak prey rather than avoiding their attention. </p><p>However, the perfection of the pose meant I was indistinguishable from the background as I arrived at the library. </p><p>Entering through the main door was easy. I looked like an assistant hoping to finish some work before the library got busier even someone had noticed me. Luckily, no one did, allowing me to cut through the stacks of basic books magic scrolls, and arrive at a second entrance. </p><p>“It’s going to be challenging,” I murmured even as I examined the complicated nature of the ward dancing on the surface of the door, mainly Earth and Air to avoid destroying the books even if the defenses were triggered. Even then, the spells were geared more like an alarm rather than an actual weapon, optimized to catch infiltrators rather than defend against invaders. </p><p>That was the task of the outer wards. </p><p>Cutting through the wards was by no means a simple task. If I hadn’t studied in the wartime library of Julius Caesar in the lost city for months with the express interest of breaking into the traditional Roman wards, it would have been impossible without it. </p><p>Even with that, I trusted to do so because of my extraordinary lightning ability, which was perfect through cutting any defensive magic. No one defended against that, because it was impossible to use lightning without creating a huge commotion. </p><p>Well, near-impossible to anyone but a Sorcerer with a unique penchant for lightning spells.</p><p>“Let’s start,” I murmured even as I raised my finger into the air, drawing a rune. It was a small, weak one, one that would be ignored by anyone if it was a simple arcane rune. Even if it had been a regular elemental rune, even as a famously explosive one like fire, at most, it would have been received an appreciative nod, tricky, but ultimately could be mastered by a determined mage, just like a determined warrior learning to ride an angry stallion. </p><p>In comparison, powering the same rune with lightning was trying to ride a bloodthirsty tiger. One moment of inattentiveness, one slip, and the lightning would have run amok. Or, it would have had been, if it had been cast by anyone else. </p><p>Under my finger, another rune soon appeared, joining the first, then a third, and a fourth… Soon, it created a reinforcing circle, and the lightning started to flow with an increasing speed, the destructiveness of the lightning contained thanks to the movement even as I pushed more and more mana to its structure. </p><p>It was the adaptation of a trick it had been recorded in the library of the lost city, discovered in a dusty corner. In its original state, it was an interesting trick, but with limited application due to its design. The same runic structure was designed based on featureless arcane energy, using the rotation to cut little pieces into the ward, and rotation to suck and contain the excess magical energy before it could trigger the detection aspects of the ward. </p><p>However, since it was using arcane energy meant that the excess energy could only be contained at the core, the limited capacity easily overflowing. Which meant, while the structure worked perfectly to unravel weak wards, the kind forwards guard bases and scouts might use when an army was on the move, allowing the army to ambush them by ignoring the ward. </p><p>Permanent wards were too strong to penetrate through the method, their power too strong, their flow too dynamic, for their flow to be contained. My modifications meant that the lightning structure was not storing the power removed from the target ward, but clashing against it, its lightning nature burning the various elements taken out from the ward, while its electric cage prevented the resulting from being detected by the ward. </p><p>Of course, while the trick was a viable one, slowly drilling into the structure of the ward, it was far from simple. When there was finally an opening I could slip inside, I was already sweating in exhaustion. It was much harder than killing the chimera back in the arena without using magic. </p><p>Still, no matter how exhausting it was, I was finally inside the private library of a patrician family, which was the whole point of my dangerous travel to Rome, disguises, fake identities… Luckily, all was not in vain. </p><p>I looked around, enjoying the sight. It wasn’t the biggest library I had seen, not even close. The room itself was wide, but the shelves stood apart from each other, and no shelf was truly filled. There were only around four hundred books. Their looks were equally unimpressive. Rather than having a uniform look, they looked wildly different. Some were clothbound, while others were leatherbound with gilded spines. Some had metal engravings on their covers, shining brand new, while others were tied by strings, barely held together under their own weight. Some even had wooden covers in different stages of dissolution. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my magical sensitivity, I might have mistaken the library gathered by a nouveau-rich merchant trying to impress his peers, only to forget to assign a servant for maintenance. Every single tome locked in the room was radiating magic, stronger than anything I had felt from a book. Even compared to the lost library, it was overwhelming, because the library was not maintained for almost five centuries, meaning many had lost their magical nature — along with the secrets that might have been locked behind their magic. </p><p>My eyes gobbled up the titles, even as I cursed the fact that I had hours rather than days to browse the riches hidden in the room. </p><p>It was time to work…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>I hid myself being a veil of illusion once again as I followed Cornelia and Helga into the inner keep, amused by the gaping mouths of the defenders as they looked at Helga and Cornelia in shock, trying to understand how two students could make such a difference — unaware that so-called lich was just a decoy, and even then, it was only destroyed due to my efforts. </p><p>I was more than happy to let the girls take the credit, of course. The stronger they were assumed, the less suspicious their eventual growth would become. </p><p>Most of the shocked gazes turned toward Helga, of course. Cornelia, with her explosive growth and reputation for an even more explosive temper, wasn’t too much of a shock. Well, at least compared to Helga, who had been infamous for her chosen magical expertise, her lack of combat ability, and her commoner status. </p><p>As they walked through the gate, Helga’s name had been whispered again and again until it turned to a soft buzz, but no one dared to walk toward her. How could they, when they created such an intimidating visage moments earlier. Cornelia just threw a dismissive glance toward the discussion, too used to such treatment even before her latest power-up. </p><p>Helga’s walk turned stiff with shock despite her attempts to appear nonchalant, too unfamiliar with the spotlight to feel comfortable about it. Though, her observers were too distracted to care about such things, lost in their elation about the sudden end of what they thought to be a desperate last stand. </p><p>As we got nearer toward where Titania and the other teachers responsible for the defense efforts were, however, the direction of the gaze started to split, half of it gazing toward Marianne, who had just revealed an equally shocking power by delivering an overwhelming assault toward the attacking lich, revealing that she was much more than a healer. </p><p>As Cornelia walked closer to Titania, the rest of the teachers looked at their three students with shock, unable to believe their display of power, outclassing the threat they could output even if they had been working together. Some of them looked anxious to question them, but when Titania took a step forward, they stayed silent, aware of the hierarchy between them. </p><p>“Good work,” Titania simply said as she looked at Helga, aware of her connection with me thanks to our earlier discussions about the school defenses, before turning back to other teachers and continued discussing the next steps of action. However, as she returned to circle, she made sure to leave enough place for two people to join, wordlessly elevating their position from students to leadership. </p><p>With her silent acceptance about their place, the rest of the teachers were unable to say anything. After all, among them, only Titania had direct access to the mysterious Headmistress, meaning her decisions couldn’t be questioned by the other teachers. </p><p>Not to mention, by apparently saving them from almost certain death, it was hard to argue that it was not an unearned victory. </p><p>With a chuckle, I disappeared toward deeper into the city, leaving Cornelia and Helga to deal with the fallout of their sudden power reveal on their own. After everything that happened, they deserved to have my trust about handling such a situation without me being ready to intervene, especially with Titania there as insurance. </p><p>I went deeper into the city, finally ready to cure myself of the annoying wounds I had received in the process of punching through the reality while teleporting, which continued to annoy me even after curing the surface layer of the wound I had received. Combined with the remnants of the decaying energy of the necrotic bolts I had faced against, it was truly a bother. </p><p>With that, I once again went to Titania’s room, easily passing through the wards, most of it already established by me in the first place. </p><p>With a sigh, I quickly prepared myself a bath and jumped in, even as I filled the water with healing energies. A rather extravagant spending of mana all things considered, but with Zokras’ attack failing spectacularly, I didn’t expect the Eternals to attack. With everything I could detect about their strength, if they had any intention of actually doing so, they could have easily done without Zokras, or could have supported his attack with more than just a few tricks about monster hordes or a few assassins — though, admittedly, quite high-leveled ones. </p><p>[-649 Mana]</p><p>As the healing energies slowly infused into my body, I dozed off in the bath, waking up only when the healing energies starting to deplete, only to refill it again, repeatedly until I was once again back to my perfect condition, then I started napping.</p><p>Only the opening of the door awakened me from my nap. From the darkness of the room, it was clear that it was already evening. I sighed as I stepped out of the tub, using a simple spell to dry off completely. Meanwhile, I could hear the footsteps of four people walking inside, each familiar in their own way. Cornelia’s sharp yet elegant steps were reminiscent of a dagger, Helga’s soft, almost hesitant walk, Marianne’s soft and elegant stride, and Titania’s steady steps are confident enough to lift the weight of the heavens. </p><p>The fun was about to start, I thought with a big smile even as I opened the door, not bothering to put anything. At this point, I had nothing to hide from any single one of them, nor I wanted to hide any single relationship from another.</p><p>I wanted my magical girls to know each other.  </p><p>Properly.</p><p>As I walked inside, naked, four identical shocked gazes turned toward me, immediately destroying the ethereal and confident aura they had been wearing outside, their blush climbing upward as their gazes bounced between each other. The shyness remained in their gazes, but a competitive expression was added to it. </p><p>“I hope everything is in order with the rest of the faculty,” I said even as I walked toward the nearest chair, acting like my nakedness was nothing out of ordinary. </p><p>“As expected,” Titania said with a shrug, her attitude showing that during the tribulation we had just faced, it was definitely not one of her priorities, her abilities to intimidate the rest of the teachers a given even without her political strength in the school. </p><p>“We have just become professors,” Helga interjected, unable to prevent a hint of disbelief from infecting her tone, unable to believe the small miracle that had just happened. Her reaction was understandable, as while her power had risen significantly in a short period to allow her not only to match but surpass most of the faculty, before the latest battle, she had no opportunity to compare her strength with the other members of the faculty before the battle, and during the battle, she had more important priorities than trying to understand her own proper place in school’s power structure. </p><p>Well, with the crisis resolved, she had all the time she needed to understand the proper pecking order, and her own superior place in it. </p><p>“All of you?” I asked as I looked at Marianne and Cornelia. </p><p>Marianne just nodded, agreeing with it. Cornelia, on the other hand, shook her head. “It’s only an honorary position for me, I still need to go back to take my place as the head of the family,” she said, her anger apparent even discounting the ball of fire that appeared in her palm almost immediately the moment she spoke. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” I said, letting my smirk take a vicious edge. “We need to go have a talk with your uncle about how to handle the transfer of power,” I added, reminding her that I was ready to assist her in solving that particular problem. It shouldn’t take more than a day even under the best of circumstances with my current abilities.</p><p>I didn’t really care about the additional power Cornelia would receive in the process. At some point, her position as the head of a noble family, even one of the stronger ones, lost its importance between the necromancers, angels, and mysterious organizations determined to fight against the gods. </p><p>With everything, the power and the assets of a noble family were nothing. I was helping simply because Cornelia wanted it, and at this point, it was easy enough for me to ensure to keep one of my girls happy. </p><p>I turned to Marianne. “Any thoughts about your own position?” I asked. </p><p>“Not really,” she whispered back in her cute shy tone. It seemed that even after having a threesome with Titania wasn’t enough to break through her regular shyness, even when she was putting on an extremely amazing show once the fun properly started. “Being a professor in Silver Spires is a better role than leading my family,” she added. </p><p>“It certainly is,” I said, not bothering to highlight one important fact. It was not actually better for a regular professor, but Marianne suddenly found herself as a part of the most influential political clique with a lot of battle merit, which changed the equation completely. </p><p>Moreover, for anything except undead, her combat capabilities were utterly lacking, and as a healer, the stronger the combatants around her, the safer she was. At least Cornelia could defend herself against most of the threats — at least enough for me to arrive if I could find a better way to use the Teleportation perk, without nearly killing myself in the process. </p><p>I pondered about whether to tell the ultimate fate of Zokras, escaping successfully while paying a great cost in the process, but ultimately, I decided against it for two reasons. First, after making such a big show about his own fake death, I didn’t expect Zokras to act, as we weren’t his only enemy, not after disappointing the organization as well. </p><p>Second, I still didn’t want to reveal the full extent of my abilities when it came to soul manipulation, and if I revealed it here, there was a high chance it would find its way back to the headmistress. Titania’s loyalties were still on that side, at least for now. </p><p>I had asked a few more questions about the role Marianne and Helga would take in the operations of the school, while they answered. </p><p>Then, there was a lull in conversation as the girls shuffled their seats, their gaze dancing worriedly between the different surfaces. The room was large, but not enough to comfortably house five people, not when girls tried to stay distant from each other, each feeling self-conscious with the implied promise of our situation, which was enhanced by my naked state. </p><p>It was time to stop with the trivial stuff, and focus on the important things. “So, girls,” I said with a wide smirk as I leaned back, displaying my shaft for them. “How about we play  a little game, to relax after such an exhausting battle?” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 489893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 7595  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was worried about the fate of Titania, but not as much as daring to replicate my earlier teleportation feat. I had barely survived when my heath was full, and I wasn’t ready to risk it again, especially without at least two complete Companion Node to guide me. </p><p>Luckily, I had made sure that Titania had her full mana, not to mention Marianne next to her, a hidden weapon ready to be unleashed against the weaker undead. I might have been still worried if Zokras had his death knights with him, but the last of them lost in the ambush, I wasn’t too worried for them. </p><p>I still moved the maximum speed my air elemental allowed me to travel, covering the distance in less than twenty minutes — short enough for Titania to resist an attack from an overwhelming force as long as she was being careful, long enough for me to recover my mana completely, and even heal myself and let the girls recover their mana completely. </p><p>[HP: 2945  / 6324]\t</p><p>[Mana: 7231  / 7595]</p><p>I wasn’t at my best of condition, but rather than delaying a bit more to heal fully, I would have preferred to arrive at the destination earlier, just in case. </p><p>“Are you sure that they have another ambush planned?” Cornelia asked worriedly as she looked at the horizon, feeling desperate. “It’s so hard to believe that they still have more forces after that attack,” she added, shivering. </p><p>“Unfortunately, building a huge army is not a difficult task for necromancers, nor it’s too hard to raise lower-level necromancers,” I answered with a sigh, which truly was the case. Unlimited availability of defenseless small towns and the huge number of monster corpses meant that they would never run out of material, and the long lives of the liches meant that they had the freedom to plan for decades and centuries while the other planned for days and months. “The only surefire way of dealing them is destroying the leadership, which is harder than it looks. The moment we destroy it, the lich’s essence would escape away, to construct another body.”  </p><p>“Can’t we just trap the essence?” Helga asked. </p><p>“It’s definitely possible for weaker ones, but Zokras is certainly not one of those. I’m confident in destroying his physical shell, but catching his essence is much more difficult. I have no doubt that he has many plans to secure his essence. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have dared to attack himself,” I said. At this point, I had no doubt about Zokras’ plan, because I could feel the corruption of death energy spreading from the city, getting stronger as we got nearer. </p><p>Luckily, I could feel Titania’s light magic flaring against the oppressive darkness, clearly weaker, but still resisting Zokras’ oppression. Moreover, as we got closer, I started to feel Marianne’s presence stronger the closer we got. If she was yet to join, the battle couldn’t have reached a dangerous level yet. </p><p>“What if you have been prepared against him, and manage to ambush him?” Cornelia joined the discussion. </p><p>I was interested in the ease Cornelia rejoined the discussion, and the lack of reaction from Helga. It seemed that after the dangerous adventure they had lived through, they managed to overcome their enmity. </p><p>“That’s a pretty different deal. If I had some preparation time, and if I could estimate his path accurately enough… But that’s a difficult thing to do. I don’t expect him to be gullible.” </p><p>Before the girls could answer, the town finally rolled into our field of view. A pair of simultaneous gasps reached my ears, which was a justified response to the abhorrent sight in front of us. </p><p>The town was covered by dark clouds. Not just the sky, but also the walls, rolling repeatedly like a typhoon, threatening to break through the glowing walls, each second eroding the inner walls. The outer walls of the city had already fallen, along with most of the civilian buildings. Only the inner keep survived, and even that was alive because of Titania’s light magic, infusing into the walls to resist the overwhelming dark magic, threatening to devour every living person and raise them as undead. </p><p>Still, even from a distance, I could notice there were scarcely few corpses in the city under the effects of the spell, showing that both the soldiers and citizens managed to retreat safely — though I had no doubt that Zokras let it be successful, as it was better for him that Titania exhausted herself defending the citizens rather than trying to escape his attack. </p><p>“What if we distract him,” Cornelia offered, looking angry at the sight, no doubt remembering her recent defeat. </p><p>I said nothing, just turned to look at Helga. “It might work,” Helga commented. “We might not have your explosive power, but as long as we burn our mana aggressively while attacking from the air. And if the defenders join the attack as well, you will have some time to set up a defense.” </p><p>“Might work,” I said even as I looked to the city, the view getting clearer as the distance slowly dwindled. “I doubt I could completely destroy his essence, but wounding it enough to permanently damage his power shouldn’t be too much of a problem. But it’s going to be risky for you girls to distract him, even for a minute. Zokras is definitely not to be underestimated. Are you sure you want to take such a risk?” </p><p>“We can’t avoid danger,” Cornelia commented. “It’s war.” Helga said nothing, but her nod conveyed agreement. </p><p>I didn’t try to dissuade them, as, despite everything else, I shouldn’t ignore the fact that after the latest improvements, they were strong, not just in Silver Spires, but also in the wider standards of the Empire. Also, letting Zokras get away would put them in more danger if he decided to take revenge. </p><p>I waited until we were close enough to the city before casting a message spell to Marianne, asking her to coordinate with Titania and attack with their full power the moment we started our battle. An invisibility spell later, I jumped down the elemental, stepping onto the outer walls of the city, already starting to build a comprehensive ward. </p><p>I might not take Zokras down completely, but after everything, I had no intention of letting him go without my pound of flesh. And the best way to do so — due to an absence of actual flesh — was damaging his abilities permanently, meaning I needed to attack his soul space. </p><p>“Let’s try it like this,” I murmured as I conjured an earthen spear and started to etch it with runes. This time, however, I wasn’t relying on my Undead Bane spell. I wasn’t even using my biomancy or light magic, because while their deadliness against the undead was not in doubt, they were not exactly stealthy spells, especially against a master necromancer. And the number of times I had used these two types of spells only made sure that Zokras would be ready to their presence, ready to retreat. </p><p>And the only chance of doing something before he could destroy his own physical form and retreat — perks of being a lich — for me to ambush him with something stealthy. </p><p>Something new. </p><p>So, I decided to be exotic, and started to cover the spear with runes that would replicate my Tantric mana transfer trick, but in a much wilder, and much more destructive manner. Physical damage might be easy to shrug off, but damaging the center of his power would have been much better. </p><p>[-1832 Mana]</p><p>However, as I continued to work on enchanting the improvised throwing spear, I moved deeper into the city, paying careful attention to the diving elemental, carrying Cornelia and Helga, casting a huge inferno as they did so, trying to envelop Zokras. </p><p>Unfortunately, a swipe of his hand was enough to create a dark shield to protect Zokras, though when Helga followed the attack with a rain of arcana arrows, trying attack from multiple directions. Another wave of his hand expanded the shield, only for the arcana spells to drill through the shield with a surprising ease thanks to her spell structure, showing the advantages of her academic capabilities. Through the breaks she had created, Cornelia’s flames flowed in, aiming Zokras. </p><p>It was a clever strategy. Too bad that they lacked the power to make it successful. Zokras waved his hand once again, this time creating a wave of dark energy going back, swallowing everything in its path, be it his own shield or Cornelia’s flames, forcing the girls to pull up to avoid, turning them into free target practice, especially with a good chunk of their mana already spent in their first assault.  </p><p>If Zokras attacked them again, I would have been forced to abandon my plan and forced to intervene. Luckily, light magic and life energy came from the town in the form of two deadly waves, threatening to drown Zokras, forcing him to shield against it. </p><p>A complicated shield went up, one that was uniquely designed to deal with my Undead Bane, too complicated to be cast instantly. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one that could innovate in a hurry to adapt to new conditions. It was a perfect design, more than ready to completely neutralize my Undead Bane. If I had tried to kill him with a deadly overwhelming spell, it wouldn’t have ended well. </p><p>Luckily, Marianne’s usage of life energy, combined with Titania’s light magic, was enough to trick him about the root of my assault. </p><p>Too bad that all his preparation was wasted because of a perception mistake, allowing me to throw my spear from my hidden spot. I wasn’t exactly a ranged expert, but hitting an immobile target from a few hundred feet was hardly a challenge with someone with my physical capabilities. </p><p>It was a pity Zokras was looking the other way as the spear buried itself to his back, because I would have loved to see whether its dead face would be enough to show an expression of surprise as my mana flooded his body through the connection. </p><p>[-3112 Mana]</p><p>Though, as the spear made the connection, and I forced my mana to invade his soul, trying to find his soul space to destroy, he wasn’t the only one that was feeling surprised. He had no soul space, something that would have been completely shocking if it wasn’t for the discovery of the morning with the headmistress. </p><p>Luckily, even without a way to directly destroying a soul space, having a flood of mana invading one’s soul was hardly a healthy activity. I forced the mana to explode from inside. Still, with Zokras’ skill, I had no doubt that he could have defended himself from that. </p><p>But he failed to do so, utterly. I was ready to assume that it was because he was distracted that he was that easy to take down, but unfortunately, that didn’t seem to be the case. Just as its soul started to burn, I realized one very important thing, a connection with a distant entity running through the Aether dimension, far too thick to be his phylactery.</p><p>He was a fucking decoy….</p><p>The connection recreated as the soul sliver that was controlling its current body exploded, creating a perfect death scenario for Zokras the Eternal. Just like that, the question that was confusing me about his unnecessarily desperate assault was revealed. He was trying to hide his identity. </p><p>To make things much more fun, with the power shown by a mere decoy, I was absolutely sure that it wasn’t me or the headmistress that drove him to this desperate show. </p><p>No, I had a horrible sinking feeling that it was about convincing his allies about his death, allies that threw our three thirty-plus level combatants just for a trick. Allies that, if headmistress’ tales were even half-accurate, was busy waging a war against the full-fledged divine beings…</p><p>Allies that was inevitably my enemy considering we were competing for the same precious Divine Sparks…  </p><p>But that was a problem for another day. Today, I had an amazing celebration to distract me from the weight of future problems… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 489893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 2945  / 6324\tMana: 2131  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn’t sure what to expect from the video call, as while Umi had turned more obedient than even my generous expectations, her shock did most of the work, assisted by our public location. I expected her to act differently against Tiffany only. </p><p>The shaky video camera of Tiffany’s phone showed that they were still in the corridor, so Umi was still silent. The angle of the phone, combined with her silence, meant that I had to wait until they arrived at their room for me to see her reaction. </p><p>I started walking to my own room to change.</p><p>Umi only spoke after Tiffany stepped into the room. “I… What was that?” she managed to stutter, her tone trembling as she looked down, which surprised me. I expected her to lash out, not whisper obediently. And while she was trying to answer, Tiffany managed to put her phone in an obscure corner to give me a nice show without being detected. </p><p>“We were putting up a show, of course. It’s a tough job, keeping the boss happy,” Tiffany answered, much sharper than the situation demanded. “What, did you think that you can sit on the corner like a wallflower, benefit from my humiliation without contributing anything?” </p><p>Umi looked stricken as her gaze jumped up. “Oh, no! I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. I was just … surprised.” </p><p>I had to admit, Tiffany pulled a good trick there, one that worked excellently in office affairs as well as it worked in other, more fun, activities. By blaming Umi for trying to benefit from her efforts, she changed the narrative completely, and Umi was simply too weak to resist that.  </p><p>“I’m sorry as well,” Tiffany answered, her anger reduced a modest amount. “I know that it’s not right for me to blame you like that, but it’s … tough, trying to help my husband.”</p><p>“I understand, it’s difficult,” Umi answered. “Can’t we stop?” she asked. </p><p>“We can if you want your husband to be stuck in a dead-end job, wasting his years of hard work during studying while the others climb above their heads,” Tiffany explained as she reiterated their earlier conversation, which was hitting much harder after the latest adventure. “A little girl-on-girl action is nothing.” </p><p>“Isn’t it?” </p><p>“Of course not. A friendly touch or two, or a kiss between girls doesn’t count as cheating. Ask your fiancee if you want, and see how he will answer,” Tiffany said, clearly confident that Umi could never gather the courage to do so. Umi just nodded hesitantly. Tiffany pounced. “Don’t tell me you haven’t ever kissed a girl for practicing?” </p><p>“N-no,” Umi managed to whisper. </p><p>\"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry,\" Tiffany said. “But I thought all girls did that. Did you at least thought about it?\"</p><p>“Not really, no.” </p><p>“Hmm,” Tiffany murmured even as she put her hand on her chin. At this point, I had arrived at my room — my private one, not the one I shared with Jennifer — and rather than changing my clothes, I sat on my bed, continuing to watch the show. “It’s not good, maybe we should practice a bit, to provide a nice show at the hot tub.” </p><p>“A show!” Umi exclaimed. </p><p>“Of course. That’s the best way to distract him without going too far. Of course, if you prefer to work on him directly, that’s your choice,” Tiffany said, her earlier promises about protecting her from my greedy paws conveniently ignored since Umi lacked the confidence to remind Tiffany about them. </p><p>While Umi was lost in thought at the sudden reversal, Tiffany closed in the distance, pushing a few strands of hair away from her cute face and twirled them with her finger. \"You're a very pretty girl,\" she whispered.</p><p>The unexpected touch, combined with the compliment, unbalanced Umi enough to prevent her from reacting as Tiffany leaned forward, and captured her beautiful lips in a lingering kiss. </p><p>I watched in enjoyment as Tiffany grabbed Umi’s waist gently, preventing her from escaping back with a soft step. Umi needed to pull back aggressively to extract herself from the situation, something that needed more determination than she had been displaying. She stayed in Tiffany’s arms as the kiss deepened, fingers dancing over the delicate lines of her chin, while a set of pearly teeth nibbled at her lower lip, exploration turning into sensual as Tiffany led her toward the bed. </p><p>When Tiffany pulled back, Umi looked around in shock, missing the short travel they had conducted during the kiss. However, she didn’t have time to comment on it, not when Tiffany’s hand found its way to her shoulder, starting to caress down her arm before taking a jump and slipping underneath her blouse, caressing the naked skin of her stomach, slowly revealing her beautiful pale flesh. </p><p>“Maybe we should-” Umi managed to stammer, but only when Tiffany’s hands continued to travel up, not giving the slightest intention of slowing down. Her courage was in vain, though, because Tiffany sealed her lips with another kiss. Umi only managed to speak again when Tiffany’s fingertips were brushing the underside of her breasts — her bra absent since the dinner — not because she was able to gather enough courage, but because Tiffany’s kisses had moved down to her neck and shoulders. </p><p>“Maybe we should stop?” Umi offered. </p><p>Tiffany’s response was decisive. Rather than following her suggestion, she grabbed her top and pulled up, revealing Umi’s surprisingly large breasts that looked even more amazing in her thin frame. </p><p>Umi tried to grab her blouse to stop herself, but she was too late. Tiffany’s grasp was tight. “What are you doing!” </p><p>“I’m undressing you, of course. We still need to find you a fitting swimsuit before going for the hot tube.” Umi lacked the experience to handle Tiffany’s shameless reply, even when Tiffany pushed down her shoulder, making her lay down before dragging her blouse off. </p><p>Too far gone to resist, Umi raised her arms as Tiffany dragged her blouse up, leaving her top completely naked. She did try to resist when Tiffany showed no intention of keeping herself limited to that by touching the button of her jeans and started to pull down, but that was also aborted when Tiffany, without a warning, captured her nipple between her lips — using her teeth to the best effect if Umi’s slightly pained gasp was any indicator. </p><p>It was a pity that the phone camera was rather limited. I would have loved to see that scene from a better angle. </p><p>It took a few seconds for Tiffany to pull down Umi’s jeans. Too smooth to be her first time doing so, I thought even as I appreciated the striking sight of her red hair spilling over Umi’s beautiful breasts, who only had her panties to protect her modesty. To her benefit, the panties were quite substantial — and very unsexy. Unfortunately for her, Tiffany didn’t lose a second before putting her knee between her thighs, rubbing against her entrance, which, combined with her lips, triggered a loud moan from Umi. </p><p>“Much better,” Tiffany said as she rose, her knee still placed strategically as she quickly rid of her top and her bra, and I licked my lips in the process, enjoying the contrast. Their skin color was not too different, but Tiffany was taller, and much curvier, the combination of their naked breasts looked amazing. </p><p>After that, she lowered herself over Umi once again, enjoying the feeling of her lips once more, this time, her tongue much more active. Umi trembled underneath as Tiffany’s hips danced, her eyes closed as she tried to process the confusing rush of feelings, the weight of the moment getting heavier and heavier.  </p><p>Soon, warning signs appeared in Umi’s otherwise passive posture. I expected Tiffany to miss those and continue to push forward, which would have been ruined the whole thing. Umi was already nearing her limit, and pushing through that before giving her a chance to adapt had the potential to ruin everything. </p><p>Then, Tiffany surprised me by grabbing Umi’s hand and dragging her off the bed. “Let’s find you a nice bikini,” she said as she grabbed her hand and dragged her toward the wardrobe, their amazing breasts bouncing every step, especially Umi’s as she tried to balance herself after the shock. </p><p>Tiffany dug through the wardrobe for a while, dragging an impressive number of swimsuits considering the shortness of the event, much to Umi’s shock, an evening-defining emotion for her. The fact that Tiffany took a large step forward, enough for their breasts to brush against each other as she passed the bikini — more of a collection of strings — helped little to contain her shock. </p><p>“Why don’t you try this one?” Tiffany said, enjoying Umi’s shock as much as I did.  </p><p>“A-are you sure?” Umi asked, somehow still feeling surprised at Tiffany’s sluttiness even after being dragged to her bed to be molested. “Isn’t it a bit too revealing?” </p><p>“Honey,” Tiffany chuckled even as she bent down, and pulled her panties down, only to earn a shocked gasp from Umi. Pity that the camera was looking at her flank, preventing me from seeing anything important. </p><p>Not that it bothered me much, not with what was about to come. </p><p>Umi said nothing at Tiffany’s overreach, just hurriedly started to put the swimsuit on to cover her nakedness. Tiffany smirked at her once last time before she turned her back and started walking toward the camera, her breasts dancing with every step of her excessively erotic walk, though Umi was too distracted by the bikini in her hand to pay attention to that. </p><p>She grabbed her phone, giving me an amazing sight of her body. “See you at the tub,” she whispered with a wink before turning off the camera, leaving me with a very urgent erection…</p>",

    "title": "Arcane Detective 2",
    "content": "<p>I was acquainted with the Detective enough to recognize that with the anger she was displaying, there had to be at least a couple bodies involved with the case —one was given considering she was a detective in homicide, just low enough in the totem pole to receive the worst cases, often impossible to solve due to inconsistent clues. </p><p>At least, impossible for anyone without a decent knowledge of the supernatural, because the weirder the case was, the more likely was the connection with the supernatural. Of course, there was a chance that the body with no blood was killed by a serial killer with a very specific fetish, or it might be killed by a vampire, the latter being far likelier, even in a magic-poor dimension like the Earth. </p><p>Detective Joanna wasn’t the only one I was making a connection in the city of my exile, as the murder was hardly the only way the supernatural interacted with the world, but unfortunately, getting that distinction was much more different in other crimes, such as disappearances, property damage, inconsistent stories about ghosts and alien kidnappings… </p><p>Just as I was about to take a step toward the kitchen to grab an apple to snack on the way, my phone buzzed. ‘Are you on the way?’ </p><p>‘Just grabbing a snack,’ I answered. </p><p>‘Don’t…’ came the response. </p><p>It must be worse than usual if she was trying to warn me against eating. I decided to follow her recommendation, even though I doubted it would really affect me after the classes back in the academy.</p><p>Constructing a flesh golem was not a task for faint hearts or delicate stomachs. </p><p> I turned off the lights, went out the door, and locked behind me, frowning even as I tried to remember whether I had replaced the keys after taking ownership of the office. </p><p>My new landlord didn’t seem the kind that respected personal boundaries, and as much as I tried not to leave anything sensitive out in the open, mistakes happened. </p><p>With a frown, I put my hand on the lock, and casting the weakest cantrip I could squeeze possible, not wanting to alert any Custodian that might have decided to drop by as I modified both the keyhole and the key. It was a risk, of course, but no observation meant no crime. </p><p>Of course, just because the mana expenditure was limited didn’t mean the spell itself was simple. Modifying a key and the lock simultaneously without distorting it, without using any kind of focus of a rune was an expertise that was ahead of many council members, let alone the average mage. “What a waste,” I murmured. </p><p>After all, there was a reason that the council treated me as an active political threat to handle rather than an annoyance, with Custodians buzzing around like flies. </p><p>I started walking down the stairs, ignoring the elevator. I didn’t like them, the idea of being locked behind steel walls where an even half-decent opponent could easily ambush me with little to no preparation. Not when I could easily count a dozen creatures that could teleport through the shadows with more ease they showed while breathing. </p><p>Being able to run was an underrated skill for mages, at least the ones that had to live without the protection of a dynastic magical family filled with disposable guards to throw against any kind of danger… </p><p>In terms of being dangerous traps, the stairs weren’t exactly a healthy choice either — too easy to be boxed in by two attackers from opposite directions, preventing a retreat. Hence the reason for my insistence on having an office on the third floor. Too high to access from the ground level casually, but not too high that a last-minute jump through the window would kill me. </p><p>It wasn’t paranoia when there were about half a dozen factions in the council as well as about two dozen different magical races across multiple dimensions were trying to get you with annoying persistence, reflected in both the regularity and the intensity of their assault. </p><p>When I finally arrived at the street, I noticed that the traffic was rather heavy today, so I decided to walk to the crime scene. If I tried to drive my old, unreliable car to Hotel Glory, I would certainly be late, something I certainly didn’t want to happen when Detective Joanna was already in a terrible mood. </p><p>For a pretty little thing, she certainly packed a painful punch. </p><p>Ten minutes later, I was at the destination. The entrance of the hotel held nothing surprising. Yet another second-class hotel who thought a fancy design was enough to replace quality service and actual class, the bright yellow of the cordon tape mixing with the gaudy gold decorations of the hotel. </p><p>“Where are you going,” one of the patrol officers darted toward me as I walked forward, ready to tackle me off the crime scene. Admittedly, with my shabby clothing, I didn’t look like someone that belonged to a crime scene unless I was the one being arrested. </p><p>I didn’t bother to answer, knowing that my words would be dismissed by any unfamiliar — and many familiar — officer, instead reached to my inner pocket to pull a document that qualified as a freelance detective. The officer read that with a nasty expression. “If you think this means I have to allow a two-bit —” he started, but I interrupted him. </p><p>“Detective Joanna is waiting for me, you might want to check with her first,” I said to him, amused by the way he suddenly blanched at the mention of the name, his macho act melting quicker than an ice cream hit by a fireball. “By the way, what did you said your name was, officer?” </p><p>I wasn’t surprised by a lack of answer, or the speed he raised the cordon, inviting me inside. I had a feeling that, if I didn’t go in immediately, he would have dragged me by my arm. </p><p>I passed through the empty hallways to arrive at a room on the second floor, only to find a surprisingly delicate hand pressing at my chest. A bit farther ahead, there was a cute face that wouldn’t be amiss on the cover of a fashion magazine if it wasn’t for the fury that was shining in her baby-blue eyes that would have intimidated a serial killer, unimpacted by the fact that her low vantage point, her head barely reaching to my shoulders even with the raised shoes she was wearing. </p><p>Detective Joanna. A bundle of fury and justice wrapped in a cute brunette package, the bane of both the police and the criminals at the same time. </p><p>“You’re late,” she growled. </p><p>However, despite her anger, I just smirked widely. “Sorry about that, Detective, but unless you can triple my consulting fees or send a police car to pick me up, that’s the best I can do with my crappy car,” I said, much to the shock of some of the other uniformed officers, unable to believe me tempting Joanna’s anger.</p><p>When Joanna just grumbled before turning rather than trying to bite my head off, however, their shock intensified even further. </p><p>As if Joanna could afford to turn down my help when they were trying to sink her reputation by assigning her the impossible cases, thanks to all the enemies she had made through her explosive temper. </p><p>It was hard to believe the speed she might make enemies despite her beautiful eyes, round and beautiful face that was worthy of a sexy model seeking her big break, and a cute nose and lush lips that would be perfectly at home on the face of a movie star. smooth, with the kind of cute nose you'd expect on a star. Not to mention her amazing body, peeking through even her serious pantsuits, deliberately picked to be a size too big in a vain attempt to hide the curves underneath. She always dressed seriously, because, underneath her serious expression and tough clothes, there was a body fit for a cheerful cheerleader that would earn accolades during a half-time show in any professional sport. </p><p>Hardly the thing to display for an ambitious Detective that was trying to make herself a career in an old-fashioned police station. </p><p>Even with her amazing physical qualities, however, the thing that defined her was her anger, fiery and explosive. I actually had to test her blood to make sure she didn’t have any demon blood in her family, particularly with wrath demons. She really embodied their infamous reputation. </p><p>I followed her, trying to resist the temptation to take a bigger step and going in front of her, something that teased her temper fiercely, not that her hair-trigger needed a lot of pressure to go off. Though opening a door for her, or god forbid, treating her like an actual pretty woman in front of her junior officers was much worse. </p><p>Admittedly, considering she had to fight and claw and play dirty with some of the most macho and prejudiced men the planet had ever seen just to be taken half-serious as a homicide detective, her anger wasn’t undeserved. </p><p>Just ill-advised. </p><p>Still, her valid reasons weren’t enough for me from teasing her despite the obvious risks. Nor was her tenseness was enough, even as it stretched as tight as a misaligned piano wire. She kept it off her face, but there was something about the stiffness of her back, an unusual sharpness in her aura, that made me aware of it. Though, even that wasn’t the source of my reluctance. </p><p>No, that honor went to the sharp smell that finally reached to my nose, a mixture of rotten meat and decay, all tainted with a thick magical signature that was even darker than the mortal connotations of those smells. </p><p>Those smells never signified something positive as far as magic was concerned. </p><p>It seemed that I needed to work hard… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Sapphire gave me a few more details about the disappearances before moving to the next topic. I let her do so after asking an appropriate, not wanting to raise any suspicion about my undue interest. Yes, it was suspicious, but ultimately, not really related to the issue of the wards. </p><p>And since I had set up my alias as a mercenary partner of the dark lord, showing undue interest in the event that led to my deposing was not a smart move. </p><p>Instead, I let her stand up, my cum still dripping down her leg, before speaking. “That seems more than enough to give me an initial direction to start,” I said, not bothering to ask for a written document. </p><p>“It’s good enough to start,” I said, happy to receive a distilled intelligence report of the major happenings in the Empire, allowing me to have a much better sense of what was going on, especially when comparing it with the report I managed to acquire from Fernhand. There were several consistencies between the reports, of course, as not only two women were getting their information from opposing intelligence officers, but also they had their own priorities of manipulating me through the information they were providing. </p><p>Luckily, getting information from both of them gave me a significant body of reliable information about the political situation to work with, I just needed to cross-check the rest of it to validate, to prevent myself from making a dangerous mistake. </p><p>Sapphire looked exhausted as she stood up, which was understandable. Giving a detailed intelligence report to a dubious ally was mentally exhausting enough with all the decisions that needed to be made, and being fucked anally during the whole process could hardly make it any easier. “That’s enough for you to start your investigations, I hope,” she said even as she fixed her crown, the only piece accessory she was wearing on her naked body. </p><p>“Yeah, it gives me several directions to check,” I said even as I put my hand on her waist, caressing lazily while still sitting on her throne, as it belonged to me. Admittedly, I had a lot of experience in showing domination on a throne, though mostly, I wore imposing black armor rather than linen pants. “We just need to go pick the shield, and everything will be golden.” </p><p>“Right now?” she said, but even as she asked the question, she leaned down to pick her dress that was sprawled on the floor, only to flinch back when I cast a spell to burn everything, leaving her only with her cloak. “You’re pushing your luck,” she growled as she turned to face me, but this time, I was happy to note that her arousal was much stronger than her anger. “You can’t expect me to walk naked in my own palace.” </p><p>I smirked as I grabbed her waist, wrapping tight. “Well, I’m sure that it would help the personnel morale immensely,” I said, pausing for a moment before continuing. “But no, I don’t expect you to walk around the corridors. But don’t tell me that there are no secret tunnels between here and the treasury.” </p><p>“Even if there is, do you think I would reveal them to you?” </p><p>“Of course not,” I said even as I put my hand on her breast, caressing gently, highlighting her physically revealing state, reminding her of the irony of her statement. “You’re a mighty queen, I could hardly expect you to reveal anything.” She looked at me, still annoyed at my latest action, not because of the nature of the action — I had done much more outrageous things to her — but my consistent insistence to push the boundaries further and further. “If you want to trust the royal mages to check the secret passages to make sure there’s no ward waiting to trap you…” I lingered. </p><p>I didn’t mention the failure of said mages in detecting the dangerous ward that was playing with the loyalties of her subjects. I didn’t need to, not at this point, where was forced to give in even more to our lopsided business relationship just moments ago due to said failure. </p><p>I was pretty sure that her disappointment was still vivid enough to need no reminders. </p><p>“Do you think the enemy has discovered the secret passages?” she asked, though, from her tone, I could sense it was a rhetorical question, mostly trying to get some time to make a decision. </p><p>“Well, not exactly impossible,” I still answered. “It’s certainly easier than setting an undetectable ward in the throne room. But if you don’t feel comfortable showing me the secret passages despite trusting me with finding your mysterious enemies…” </p><p>Ultimately, it didn’t take long for her to make a decision,  and her emotional entanglement and her political desperation — not to mention the weight of her previous decision to rely on me extensively — left no doubt about the nature of that decision. “Let’s go,” she whispered in a defeated tone before she turned and started walking toward a corner of the room, her hips dancing beautifully despite her emotional distress. </p><p>She definitely deserved her reputation as the most amazing dancer at the Empire. </p><p>I followed her as she walked toward a particular corner of the wall that was concealed by some large vases and other expensive artwork, each precious enough to meet all expenses of a small town for a year if sold, before reaching in front of the wall, and unlocking the entrance through a simple spell, much less secure than the other entrances to the tunnels. </p><p>It was understandable, as if there was a need to use those tunnels for any king or queen, then clearly, time was the essence. </p><p>I stepped into the tunnel after her, my attention still on the way her naked ass danced with each step even as I gathered my mana to activate the tether, using it as a detection sonar to make sure there was no trap left in by our mysterious enemy. </p><p>A deadly trap was not likely. If the nature of the ward they had set up was any indicator of their strategy, they were clearly pushing for a long game, and killing someone that stepped into the secret passage was a good way of revealing their hand sooner than they desired. Unfortunately, direct harm was only a small portion of effects that could be delivered through a well-crafted ward, making it a necessity to keep me aware despite the dance of her hips. </p><p>And that proved to be a correct idea soon enough. “Stop,” I suddenly called to her when I noticed a ward a few steps ahead. </p><p>She froze immediately while I let my mana flow freely, leveraging the fine control given to me by the Tether to analyze the ward quickly. “Is it dangerous?” she asked as my mana started to get thicker. </p><p>“Not directly, no,” I answered, which was easy to tell immediately. The ward lacked the strength necessary to turn it into a weapon. I went deeper into the structure, only to meet with a complicated spiderweb structure, reaching toward several different locations to gather information. </p><p>Due to the unfamiliar nature of the construction, I had no idea how it was actually storing the information it was gathering. I failed to find any outward sign of a connection with another magical object or directly with its caster, but unfortunately, the foreign nature of the construction principles meant that I might be missing it. Luckily, its external information-gathering aspects were much simpler to analyze, allowing me to cast a spell to prevent it from being detected. </p><p>“It’s ward to record people using the secret tunnels,” I explained to Sapphire even as I gestured her to walk again. </p><p>“They discovered the tunnels, but using them just to spy on me,” she said, further unsettled by the ease the mysterious enemy was displaying by accessing some of the most secret locations in her Empire. “Are you sure it’s just that?” </p><p>“That’s the only active effect, but I can’t guarantee there are no other functions ready to be unleashed by its owner or someone with the key,” I corrected her. “Secret tunnels already have many convenient spells and traps installed it, if the ward could somehow steal their control, it could easily prevent you from using it in an emergency.” </p><p>“Can’t you remove it?” she asked as she turned to face me, once again displaying her amazing tits, her nipples furiously erect thanks to the combined assault of her arousal and the cold. </p><p>“I can, for a price,” I said with a wide smirk, earning a frustrated growl before continuing. “But I don’t recommend it for the moment. I need to study for a long time to make sure I could remove it without triggering any traps that might have been integrated as a fail-safe.” </p><p>“And doing so would alert them that we have noticed their presence,” Sapphire completed, easily realizing my train of thought despite her unsettled mind. </p><p>I smiled, confirming her conclusion before gesturing her to start walking once more, following her from a perfect distance, enough to enjoy the show properly, but not enough to let her fall into a trap before I could intervene, just in case my earlier fiddling had triggered some kind of failsafe. </p><p>Luckily, it turned out not to be the case, and soon, we were standing at the secret entrance of the treasury, Sapphire unlocking a number of complicated wards, which included a number of secret passwords, blood wards, and a plethora of other complicated tricks. </p><p>… while I enjoyed the beautiful way her body was dancing, my mind was already on the next steps… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Olivia was already watching my glistening body with a shocked expression, and leaning forward while my arms prevented her from extracting herself from the positing only enhanced the domineering weight I was displaying. </p><p>In her eyes, I could see that, for the first time tonight, she had realized that I was more than another slave, wild and strong, capable enough to destroy her before she could let out a spell. And with no servants to rely on, even if she tried to call for help, that wouldn’t have helped her. </p><p>Watching as I dominated her friend — who belonged to arguably the strongest Patrician family in Rome — only drove that message deeper into her subconsciousness. </p><p>Against me, she was completely helpless. </p><p>However, that realization only made her nipples push harder against her dress. Her breathing got faster, her eyes widened, but rather than leaning against her wall which would display her desire to escape, she took a small step forward, almost automatic, her gaze locked to my face. </p><p>“You’re different than I expected,” she said, unable to hide a hint of fear infecting her tone, but that was nothing compared to the thickness of arousal that was dominating her tone. </p><p>“In what way, my dear mistress?” I said with a thick mocking tone even as I leaned forward to let my breath fall on her neck, making her tremble. “Is my barbarian ways are getting a bit overbearing for your delicate civilized senses.” </p><p>“I could cut your tongue for insolence,” she answered, trembling as she said so. </p><p>“It’s your right, mistress, but wouldn’t it be a waste,” I said. </p><p>“Waste, how-” she started, only to be interrupted by an aggressive kiss where my tongue played the main role, displaying the usefulness of said appendage directly. She moaned as her body was locked between the wall and my body, shivering helplessly as I ravaged her mouth. </p><p>“So, do you still want to cut my tongue, mistress,” I said mockingly even as I caressed her lively red hair.</p><p>She didn’t answer immediately, trying to control her breathing, the remainder of her composure shattered completely under the domination of my lips. She raised her head, her lips bruised through the aggressive kiss, forming a pout as she breathed rapidly, trying to fight against the heat that was filling her body. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, breathing was hardly the solution for that heat. I had the solution, and much to her misfortune, I had no intention of giving her the solution immediately. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she growled once she managed to tame her breathing to a degree, her hands on my chest, her nails trying to bite into my chest, though unlike what she might have expected, the pain was negligible. “I can easily execute you.” </p><p>I smirked, knowing it wouldn’t have been that easy to do so. Yes, she was the heiress of an important family, and could easily kill a junior noble with little to no social backlash, but ironically, my identity as a gladiator protected me more. After today’s showing, I was a rising commodity, meaning if she wanted to kill me, she would owe a lot of money to the gladiator school, and paying it would be a matter of reputation for her family. </p><p>The irony was not lost on me. </p><p>Still, it was just an absentminded though, because even as she made that threat, she pressed her body against me as if she was trying to memorize the lines of my body through sensation. “It’s your right, mistress,” I said as I put my hands on her waist. </p><p>“Have mercy, mistress,” I said even as I tugged her dress, which came off easily thanks to its softness, displaying a delicious view in the process. She didn’t even react to my daring move, as after watching a number of her noble peers being fucked into oblivion, she was already burning with desire, and our latest kiss hardly helped. </p><p>“Maybe, but you need to work hard to earn that forgiveness,” she said, trying to sound haughty and impervious, but unable to hide the neediness in her tone in the process, making her less like a noble existence that was supposed to belong to the highest echelons of Roman Republic, and more like a horny peasant daughter hoping for a muscular farmer to tend to her needs. </p><p>I was tempted to tease her for hours until I could make her admit that to herself, begging for me for hours for the mercy of an orgasm…</p><p>Too bad that I had an actual mission for coming to her house, a mission that was critical for my continuing existence. I needed to exhaust her as soon as possible before starting sneaking around, hopefully getting into the library for the research I needed.</p><p>With that in mind, rather than wasting my time with another extended foreplay session, I let my hands-free on her body, molesting her breasts roughly, twiddling her nipples harsh enough to make her gasp in pain, laced with pleasure.  She opened her mouth, ready to argue against the roughness of the treatment, but that barely survived for a moment under the assault of my lips.</p><p>Soon, that attitude was abandoned like a broken toy as she started squirming helplessly under the effects of my concentrated assault. Her moans rose, muffled against my lips, the strength of her wiggling intensifying. </p><p>One of my hands stayed focused on her breasts, just large enough to fill my palms, with firmness to die for, while my other hand moved down her stomach, having a brief pause there, before moving down to her naked core, her wetness covering my fingers. </p><p>When a finger slipped inside her, soon joined by another, her helpless squirming reached another level. </p><p>I pulled back from the kiss, only to lean down and capture her right nipple between my teeth, biting hard enough to leave a soft mark, making her moan passionately. My tongue soon joined the fray, my lips working overtime, pushing her more and more. </p><p>“I order -” she started, only for a moan to explode before she could properly finish her sentence. “I order you to stop teasing me and properly…” she started, only for her voice to fade away as she realized the nature of her order, the realization enough to awaken a momentary shame even under the circumstances. </p><p>I used her momentary lull to pull my body back, only to grab her shoulders and make her turn before pushing her against the wall once more, this time chest first. “Properly, what, my mistress?” I whispered into her ear mockingly. “Properly fuck you like a back-alley whore until you fell unconscious, just like I had done all other noble ladies that was lucky enough to be your guest tonight.” </p><p>She said nothing in response, her lips frozen under my scandalous, daring words, but that didn’t prevent her from pushing her ass out invitingly. </p><p>As much as I wanted to tease her until she pushed through her noble sensibilities to beg for a slave to fuck her, I was strapped for time. So, I decided to be an obedient slave and fuck her until she was unconscious. </p><p>It was the nice thing to do, I thought with a predatory smile. She noticed it from the corner of her eyes, realizing that what I had in mind might not completely overlap with her preferred method, but it was too late. I pushed forward mercilessly, invading her wetness. </p><p>Her lips stayed open, the argument she had been planning to make melting into a cry loud enough to shatter glass. I was lucky that the servants had long been sent away to prevent gossips about the nature of the orgy that was going on. </p><p>Which was good, as I pushed my hips forward, her moans intensified further and further, adding a delicious nature to our joy. Her eyes stayed closed, her skin flushing more and more with each pump as her body was bathed in a rush of pleasure that couldn’t be simply copied. </p><p>“What do you think, mistress?” I asked mockingly even as the sound of flesh colliding filled the room, echoing against the marble walls of the bath. “Am I fucking you furiously enough, or should I fuck you even harder?” I asked, but she only managed to moan in response. </p><p>Even when I started slapping her ass to highlight it. </p><p>To her credit, she tried to answer, and if the nature of the anger flashing in her eyes was any indicator, it was going to be a spectacular response. Too bad that whenever my cock fully slid inside her, disappearing into her depths while forcefully stretching her, yet another moan exploded, preventing her from voicing her righteous fury.</p><p>My hands landed on her waist, using my hold for additional leverage to fuck her even more roughly, and despite all her fury, her hips rose in response, giving me a better angle to invade her depth, rocking enthusiastically. “So, mistress,” I whispered into her ear before letting my lips trail down for a fleeting moment and lick her neck. “Are you happy with the performance of this lowly slave?” </p><p>I let my lips rest on the nook of her neck while waiting for a response that wasn’t likely to come, softly kissing and licking in great contrast to my furious fucking, breaking through her resistance even faster. Her cries got louder and louder, turning into a delicious bundle of joy. </p><p>Under such a thick assault, combined with the extended arousal she had been suffering since the beginning of the evening thanks to the show I had been providing, and the service from Cera’s persistent tongue, it wasn’t shocking that Olivia was getting overwhelmed under the weight of the developing orgasm, moaning dazedly as she tried to maintain her consciousness. </p><p>And when I exploded inside her, triggering her climax at the same time, it dealt the final blow that caused her to lose her battle against the exhaustion. Under the rush of pleasure, her eyelids started to flutter, getting heavier and heavier. </p><p>“You need to work on your endurance, mistress,” I said mockingly even as I grabbed her to a bridal hold and dragged her next to Atia, who was still sleeping comfortably. Without even waking up, her arms wrapped around Olivia, pulling her to her chest, her blonde hair mixing with Olivia’s lively red…</p><p>The resulting sight was tempting me to wake Atia up, allowing me to enjoy a proper threesome with two heiresses, which was not a luxury many men could claim to. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had other priorities, so I cast a sleeping spell on Olivia as well, before casting another spell over the bathhouse, to alert me in case anyone tried to enter. I was hoping that no servant would dare to check their mistress before the sunrise, which would give me almost five hours to find the library penetrate its wards, and hopefully find some books to serve my search… </p><p>Then, I passed through the doorway, with the full intention of robbing the library a Patrician Estate… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Taking the Queen from behind as she stretched on her own throne was quite a pleasure, and not only for me if her failed attempts to suppress her moans were any indicator. “Do you want me to go and pick the Shield,” she managed to ask between the moans, her body rocking with a continuous earthquake. </p><p>“A good idea, but not at the moment,” I said, which earned a questioning look. “Being hosted by the Queen herself in her own throne room, how can I give up such a unique experience halfway,” I added even as I pulled out and grabbed her waist, lifting her up to her feet. </p><p>Unprepared, she almost fell down if it wasn’t for the short duration of her new position, only keeping her up enough to slide under her and sit on her throne. Then, I grabbed her waist, forced her to turn, and pulled her on my lap facing me. “Much better,” I murmured as the tightness of her back entrance clamped around once more. </p><p>However, the sudden flash of anger in her eyes, turning their blues into icy diamonds was much more interesting. Even with everything, she clearly didn’t appreciate me occupying her throne. Though, considering everything she had done so far was to continue occupying the throne, it clearly triggered a sensitive spot in her. </p><p>“I’m trying to get a better feel of the ward. I’m trying to see whether the identity of the occupant makes a difference,” I said, not particularly bothering to make it believable. I just needed an excuse to force her to think for a second, to prevent her from acting in anger. </p><p>With my growing power over her, that was all that needed. </p><p>As I expected, her anger about me using her throne symbolically wasn’t as important as the actual threats to her throne. Rather than pumping furiously, I put my hand to the inside of her upper thigh, slowly stroking her bare skin back and forth gently, contrasting the sensation at her backside greatly. Soon, she started moaning once again despite not starting to move.</p><p>I wasn’t an idiot, of course. Even with the side effects of her spells, it would cost me a lot to make her ‘forgive’ me for that transgression, recklessly pushing the borders even in the absurd situation we were in, though it was hard to read that on her demeanor. On the surface, she looked completely convinced. </p><p>Her eyes were closed as if she was trying to hide her shame and her anger at the same time, doing her best to keep quiet even as my shaft danced in her bowels again. Soon, she freed me from the obligation of making her ass move, instead of allowing me to focus on more important topics, such as letting my finger travel upward, caressing her core gently, drawing lazy circles to contrast with her rough anal treatment. </p><p>After learning about the unique traits of her body, it wasn’t surprising that it barely took a few minutes for her to part widely, allowing me even smoother access to her soft core. Her concealed anger didn’t prevent her from enjoying the travel of my fingers wholeheartedly. </p><p>However, compared to a delicious moan the moment my other hand landed on the small of her back, caressing the small of her back gently, her earlier reaction was nothing. Compared to everything else that was going on, it was a fairly innocent touch, but I had targeted a particularly sensitive spot there, and along with everything else, she was shuddering aggressively. </p><p>“Good Queen,” I said mockingly, once again fueling her anger, but this time, chose to suppress her reaction in a more direct way. I grabbed both of her hands before she could react, gathering them on her back, one hand enough to pin both of her wrists. Meanwhile, I sealed her lips with a kiss, while my free hand landed on her breasts, squeezing mercilessly. </p><p>It was an amazing sight, enough to make me conjure a magical mirror to the right of me enjoy the sights. And what a view it was. The naked figure of the Queen was repeatedly jumping up and down on my lap while her arms pinned behind her tight enough to hurt. Moreover, forcing her shoulders back had the added benefit of pushing her chest out, enhancing her already spectacular tits even further. </p><p>Meanwhile, even as I enjoyed the benefits of her body, the mind-manipulating ward was trying to worm itself through my mental defenses, only to fail spectacularly. However, its nature had been completely different, confirming my conjecture about it targeting whoever was sitting on the throne rather than being customized for Sapphire. It was interesting, because such a thing was actually harder than just making an exception for Sapphire directly. </p><p>And since they had gone to such a lengthy effort, it wasn’t hard to guess that their only aim wasn’t to take down Sapphire. They obviously had a long-term plan in mind. </p><p>The challenge was finding their vector of attack before it was too late. And to do that, I needed more information. </p><p>“So, my dear Queen, do you have any interesting information that might help me focus on the right direction. Feel free to be comprehensive. Sudden diplomatic incidents, nobles acting out for no reason, mysterious disappearances in  the capital, anything?” I asked, clearly pushing her to discuss the silent forts of the North. </p><p>I didn’t think they had any relationship with the wards at the throne room, but there was no harm in making the Queen think so. After all, the events at the North initiated a chain of events that ended with my imprisonment, so I was curious about the exact reason. And while Sapphire had explained some of the details to Aria, unaware that I was listening, I couldn’t exactly rely on the accuracy of that information, not with her lack of trust due to Aria’s naivety. Facing such an immediate threat, I was hoping that she would be more honest. </p><p>“It’s c-complicated,” she managed to murmur between her moans, as even as I asked the question, I hadn’t slowed down her treatment the slightest, making it difficult for her to concentrate on her answer. But she didn’t ask me to stop, at this point well aware that I would have turned down such a request. </p><p>“I love complicated stories,” I answered with a hungry smirk. “Feel free to share as much detail as you want, we have all night.” </p><p>Her expression, helpless yet aroused, was beautiful. “The first issue is the faction in the palace trying to take me down, led by that whore Fernhand,” she growled. </p><p>“I know them, of course, they are hardly hidden, but unless we can find a mysterious mastermind playing them to distract you, I don’t think they are the responsible party,” I said, easily ignoring Sapphire’s attempts to make me focus on her immediate enemies again despite removing them from the list of priority suspects, no doubt hoping to use me as a distraction for her immediate political games.  </p><p>Admittedly, she had selected an excellent time to pull such a trick. With her curvy hips dancing furiously, I was tempted to agree with her through sheer pleasure. However, ultimately, I managed to stay focused on the main direction. </p><p>She had talked several more issues, all happening in the capital, for a relatively long while, which I had to listen attentively without mentioning the silent forts at the North not to arouse her suspicion. Even worse, I had to ask several detailed questions, even for the topics I wasn’t interested in, because only that way I could ask questions without raising suspicion once she mentioned the North.  </p><p>The process would have been extremely annoying if I hadn’t been amusing myself with playing her amazing tits at the same time. </p><p>“… then there are some worrying things happening in the border forts,” she finally said. Finally, I thought, though I tried to keep my expression smooth to prevent her from realizing the sharp rise in my interest. “We’re having some communication difficulties with some of the garrisons.” </p><p>“Garrisons. Communication difficulties? As in multiple forts?” I asked, pushing her to elaborate despite her obvious reluctance to share it. </p><p>“Yeah, five of them for the moment,” she said, unable to prevent a tone of worry from appearing in her explanation. It was understandable, because earlier today, while she was explaining it to Aria, that number was lower. So, unless she chose to lie to Aria pointlessly to reduce the number of affected forts by one, another communication was lost in the last twenty-four hours. </p><p>“What happened exactly?” I asked. </p><p>“Not sure,” she said. “None of them was able to send a message before they were silenced, and any patrol the other forts had sent disappeared before they could report anything suspicious. And the latest disappearances failed to send a message before silence, even though the alarm was already raised.” </p><p>It was definitely a worrying trend. Not because border forts were significant locations. Despite their relatively loftier names, they were small locations, built to hold the small passages that littered through the domineering mountain range that drew the border between the wild tundra filled with monsters and the empire. Those garrisons mainly relied on their thick walls and limited size of the passages they needed to guard to be successful, rarely housing more than a hundred soldiers. </p><p>Taking them down wasn’t impossible. Ambushing them wasn’t exactly impossible either. However, doing so during an emergency state quick enough to prevent the garrison from sending a message back was much harder. </p><p>Maybe a trip to the North was in order, I thought even as I exploded into her plump ass, triggering her climax.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Can you handle directing the elemental and maintaining an illusion of me at the same time convincingly while maintaining the distance?” I asked Helga. “It’s better if Cornelia focuses fully on defending in case the necromancers get too close,” I asked Helga. When she nodded, I transferred the control of the elemental to her. </p><p>“Now, drive through the ambush,” I said, pointing toward the small forest the bone dragons trying to direct toward without being too visible, then turned to Cornelia. “Cast a huge fireball, but don’t waste your mana. I just need the bright light and some smoke. I’ll do the rest.” </p><p>Before the undead hidden in the forest could lash out, the air elemental dipped low and the fireball exploded, followed by a light spell from me, creating a convenient corridor for the girls to escape. </p><p>I used biomancy to hide my life signature even as I created an illusion of myself, and when Helga took the responsibility of maintaining it, I jumped off to the ground. </p><p>[-63 Mana]</p><p>Another flare of mana allowed me to control the ground before I could touch it, turning it into a quicksand, no different than water. Before the smoke cloud of Cornelia’s spell had disappeared, I had already disappeared underground. Once I moved several feet down, I let out a relaxed sigh, aware that I was safe momentarily. </p><p>I started moving in reverse, glad for my connection with the girls allowed me to feel their status in great detail from the current distance once I properly focused on that. </p><p>Luckily, the girls were capable enough to drag the necromancers farther and farther without risking themselves, giving me a leisure opportunity to slowly move back underground, passing the necromancers and death knights and finding myself in the middle of the fodder army. </p><p>Meanwhile, my mana recovered significantly, and I even managed to heal myself significantly. All the while, the undead army was willing to play our game, because from their perspective, defending against their attack while maintaining an air elemental was a desperate last stand that had given the victory to them.</p><p>Ten minutes passed just like that… </p><p>[HP: 3141  / 6324]\t</p><p>[Mana: 5412  / 7595]</p><p>Not only I had recovered, but also their army had stretched further and further helplessly as they chased me. I let both the necromancers and death knights get away as much as possible, because under the circumstances, targeting the fodder army was the better idea. </p><p>I cast the first spell, another undead bane, focused on maximizing the area effect rather than direct damage, perfect in decimating hundreds of zombies at once. </p><p>[-128 Mana]</p><p>Light magic was making it very cost-efficient to get rid of weaker zombies. No wonder their first move was trying to get rid of Titania. </p><p>I repeated the spell twice as I ran toward the death knights and the necromancers, acting like I was trying to intimidate them once again. If I had done that the first time, they might have retreated, but after getting bluffed twice by the same tactic, they believed that it was just another trick from my end. </p><p>The army started to disperse, trying to avoid my area attacks, while the death knights and the necromancers changed their direction sharply, trying to catch up with me, or at least, forcing me to retreat and protect their army. </p><p>Pity that more than half of the army had been already decimated before they could get into range, but the rest were dispersed. More importantly, their approach took more than two minutes, more than enough for me to actually set up a field of explosive runes underground and charge them. </p><p>[-1421 Mana] </p><p>Trying to face a high-level mage with just an army was truly a suicidal affair, especially with the force multiplier of my ridiculous regeneration. “Come on, boys, let's finish this little game,” I shouted gleefully, no different than a barbarian warrior, mostly just to confuse them. </p><p>Unlike the army, the death knights and the necromancers approached me in a modified diamond formation. Death knights were on the tip, necromancers stayed behind, fully focused to counter my spells to give enough time for their invincible warriors — or what was supposed to be invincible warriors — to close the distance and prevent me from casting. Some necromancers spread to the wings, ready to lash out with death bolts to provide cover fire. Overall, it was a simple yet effective strategy.  </p><p>Too bad that I was much better at setting ambushes. Once again I cast an undead bane, focused on the range, forcing the necromancers to counter it. They did so, and the spell melted before it could reach the death knights. However, as they did so, they committed their focus to the threats from the sky.</p><p>[-613 Mana] </p><p>Then, the runes exploded. </p><p>Most of the necromancers evaporated in an instant, undead bane burning through their existence as efficiently as death bolts damaged living creatures. Some tried to defend themselves, but without collaborating with the others, they lacked the power to actually succeed thanks to their low level and weak stats — to be fair, compared to me, not many people could brag about their stats. </p><p>Realizing that they were once again played for the fool, the death knights tried to retreat. Unfortunately for them, while they were strong enough to resist the explosives — though not without further damage — their bone dragon mounts weren’t as lucky, turning into dust under the explosions. </p><p>And without their mounts, they had no chance of escaping. Don’t get me wrong, I would have loved them to actually try it, because picking them after demolishing the rest of the necromancers would have been much easier. Death knights might be strong opponents, but ultimately, they were designed to be the perfect swords and shields for an even stronger spellcaster, or at worst, to work as an overwhelming assassin from the shadows. </p><p>Facing me in an open field while their supporting necromancers struggled to stay alive — or maintain their unlife state — wielding a combination of light and life magic that cut through their spell resistance like a hot knife through butter, they were out of their depth. </p><p>If they weren’t horrific constructs of unlife that probably spilled enough blood to fill a lake, I would have pitied them. </p><p>Instead, I raised my hand, and threw three consecutive undead bane, area effect spells centered on the death knights. Some of the necromancers managed to show an impressive ability and actually managed to dispel my first spell, but they were helpless against the second and the third, exploding among them. </p><p>Nor they managed to counter the sudden rain of light arrows, reaping them helplessly, burning their undead energy, and evaporating them completely. </p><p>And just like that, two death knights lost all their coverage. </p><p>I expected them to escape, trying to make contact with their master. Or, at least, launch one desperate defense to take me down. </p><p>I didn’t expect them to fall into a defensive state, to limit the effects of my spells. If it was done by a living person, I might have assumed that they were doing one last irrational desperate attempt to stay alive, hoping to outlast me, but that didn’t work for death knights. For all their power, they were little more than sentient weapons, working for their master. </p><p>A bad feeling rose in my heart. I had taken too much time dealing with the army. I was expecting Zokras to come back, trying to save his remaining death knights before retreating. After all, he was a centuries-old lich, so I would have expected him to pull back before things had become too bad. </p><p>The desperate attack of disposable armies was understandable. Using the death knights at an ambush was also understandable. It was risky, but it could have allowed him to hit a soft spot, at least weakening the school significantly before retreating. </p><p>Using the death knights on a chase made little sense, and using them just to deplete me made even less. </p><p>Unless he didn’t want me to be anywhere else. </p><p>I decided to take them down as quickly as possible, without wasting any more of my mana. It was not the time to hide something, I decided, as I rushed toward them with full speed, and before they could properly change their formation, I was in front of them, with a glowing sword of light in my hand. </p><p>[-121 Mana]</p><p>The light sword trick might consume a decent amount of mana with every passing second, but it was certainly better than trying to pin them from a distance when they were trying to </p><p>Still, I was extremely glad for deciding to improve Titania’s Companion process during our last time. The light magic had provided me with the distinction between victory and death. </p><p>The death knights realized that their formation against spell damage left them vulnerable for melee attack, but it was already too late. I swung the sword with a speed that surpassed the flaming eyes of the death knight’s ability to follow it. It spun, avoiding a vital blow to its chest, but it cost it an arm. </p><p>In the distance, I could see the squad of necromancers that was trying to pin the air elemental turning back, but it was already too late. The second death knight managed to move forward before launching a hastily coordinated attack. I ducked between them, avoiding their lightning-fast attack that would have decapitated a lesser warrior. </p><p>I swung the sword again, this time costing the second death knight an arm. </p><p>[-93 Mana]</p><p>They tried to counter-attack, but they swung above me as I ducked, missing my head by inches. The sword of light flashed again, this time costing the first one a leg, and as a bonus, its balance. </p><p>With the first one struggling not to topple, and the second one barely able to swing properly with one arm, the battle was almost over. I didn’t even bother finishing them before wrenching the control of the air elemental from Helga and making them move toward me with full speed. </p><p>Then, I conjured a second sword before spinning mercilessly, and half a second later, two death knights collapsed in pieces, the unholy magic that was holding them together. The swords evaporated. </p><p>[-183 Mana]</p><p>It was ironic that their attempt to waste my mana enabled me to take them down much easier. </p><p>Before the elemental could arrive, I used another undead bane, destroying the flying necromancers with a volley of light arrows. </p><p>[-294 Mana]</p><p>“Is everything okay?” Helga asked even as I jumped on the elemental, forcing it full speed toward Titania’s town, hoping that I had misread Zokras’ intentions wrongly. </p><p>Or if not, I would be able to reach there in time… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 489893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 1477  / 6324\tMana: 847  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I wished that the necromancers didn’t wear hooded cloaks, because I would have loved to see their expression of shock as we started to levitate with a great speed. “Be ready to cast a shield, even if it makes you fell unconscious,” I advised the girls, even as I started gathering my remaining mana for the next step of our little adventure. </p><p>I only now tried to use an air-elemental to escape, because it was only through the necromancer’s strategic mistake that it was possible. Most of them committed themselves to defend the remaining two death knights after I easily got rid of the third, unaware that I had depleted my reserves just to have that opportunity. </p><p>It was not something I could replicate, and even if some of them suspected it, I doubt it would help their determination to protect the remaining two death knights. With that, Zokras already lost six death knights that represented years —maybe decades— of work. Naturally, his henchmen tried to protect the remaining two. </p><p>Pity that it gave me the second I needed to work undisturbed to stretch my capabilities to the limit as I created a ward-breaker, slamming it into the wards, depleting my mana back to single digits in the process. </p><p>[-330 Mana]</p><p>Under normal conditions, the mana I had spent was far from enough to destroy a ward comprehensive enough to cover a city, not even close. But I had several advantages. The first was the distraction of their spellcasters as they hurried to protect the death knights. </p><p>The second was the fluid state of the wards. They were initially designed to defend an attack coming from the outside, only to try and forcefully change after my surprise appearance. And, considering barely two minutes passed since my arrival, they were barely halfway done, allowing me to cut through the wards. </p><p>We were barely out of the wards when an impressive number of ranged attacks started following us, from easily ignored arrows of skeletons to death bolts throbbing with necrotic energy. “Try to keep your shields closer to the elemental, I’m going to try to dodge the most,” I said even as I tried my best to avoid their assault. </p><p>Thanks to the mobility of the air elemental, we managed to avoid the majority of the attacks in the first salvo, while the rest peppered against the shields of the girls. But before we could leave the range, the second salvo followed, with even more impressive numbers. </p><p>And this time, things didn’t go as smoothly. Some of the attacks were as easy to dodge as the first —skeleton archers seldom had the intelligence to position their attacks strategically to cut off my path— but for the second salvo, the necromancers relied on a different approach. Their attacks got bigger, and some targeted possible escape routes rather than targeting us directly. </p><p>I could have avoided them as well, of course, but only by significantly extending my escape route. “Try to hold on, it’s going to be rough,” I said to Helga. Cornelia, unfortunately, was on the edge of the collapse after the first salvo. Funnily enough, Helga’s earlier collapse under the assault was working for her benefit. </p><p>I grabbed Cornelia and pulled her behind as I turned to face the salvo, watching as every hit exhausted Helga visibly. When the third death bolt made contact with her shield, it flickered before disappearing, just as Helga collapsed. She would have fallen off the elemental if it wasn’t for my reflexes, pushing her next to Cornelia. </p><p>And I was far too close to collapse than I wanted to count. </p><p>[HP: 1477  / 6324]\t</p><p>[Mana: 83  / 7595        ]</p><p>Despite my dodging attempts, the second salvo continued, forcing me to defend without any mana. A crackling black bolt came nearer and nearer, three others chasing it from a close distance, but moving the elemental would keep us in range for the third salvo, so I had no option but to take it to the chest. Unlike the girls, it wouldn’t kill me. </p><p>Hopefully. </p><p>But when the first one made contact with my chest, it reminded me once again why the necromancers were scary enough to be hunted. </p><p>[-541 HP] </p><p>The damage was certainly significant, and that was with my vitality limiting the damage. I couldn’t survive three others… </p><p>“Idiot,” I suddenly murmured as I raised my hands. I would have slapped myself if it wouldn’t have cost me the precious second I needed to keep all of us alive. </p><p>[-14 Mana]</p><p>I transformed my mana into life energy before letting it coat my hands like a glove, just in time as the second bolt arrived in front of me. Then, I punched the bolt to the side, hopefully not about to receive another jolt of necrotic energy that might as well kill me. </p><p>[-119 HP]</p><p>[-21 Mana]</p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured even as I thickened the mana glove around my hands based on the feedback, just in time to bat the next two bolts, receiving even lesser damage. </p><p>[-61 HP]</p><p>Then, we were out of their range, and flying toward the school. I would have loved to go back to the town Titania was defending, but I wasn’t convinced that the plan to hunt me was anywhere near its completion. But regardless of the time, I still had around fifteen minutes to arrive at the destination. </p><p>Just enough to refill my reserves, ready to meet any nasty surprise they might have hidden. However, before I could relax on my elemental mount, I noticed several bone dragons falling down the sky, ready to chase me down. It wasn’t the domineering flying army I had defeated earlier when they tried to ambush Titania, but a dozen bone dragons, carrying necromancers on their backs was certainly not the easiest opponent to deal with. </p><p>Especially not when their arm was to slow me down before the rest of the army caught up with me. </p><p>The weirdest race of my life had begun as I tried to resist the combined assault of twelve necromancers with close to no mana, my hands moving faster and faster as I slowly get used to the technique, limiting the contact, so that each touch only consumed a few points of mana, and nothing else. Of course, the ease I was parrying their attacks helped greatly by the difference in stats. </p><p>I certainly couldn’t replicate it against Zokras with such ease, for example. </p><p>The next minute passed in relative comfort as I easily batted down their attacks without suffering from any damage, allowing my mana to recover significantly. </p><p>[HP: 1477  / 6324]\t</p><p>[Mana: 683  / 7595]</p><p>So, I cast a detection spell just to be on the safe side, only to notice a lot more enemies than I was expecting. In addition to the bone dragon squad, the whole undead army left the city, charging toward my direction, though with a great distance between each element as they prioritized speed. The presence of the death knights surrounded by necromancers, was at the front, while endless skeleton armies were creating a long line, their maximum speed varying based on their bodily structure. Meanwhile, another, the smaller army was spreading in front of me, ready to cut my path. </p><p>It was the army that was chasing the refugees that managed to avoid their massacre, I noticed, happy that the problem was solved before I bothered to make a move. </p><p>“Impatient idiots,” I murmured even as I changed my plans. The only reason I escaped them was that I couldn’t deal with their cannon fodder and their elite combatants together in my current status. And they were not only giving me time to recover, but also an opportunity to retaliate. </p><p>Who was I to reject such a nice gift? </p><p>The first thing I did was to slow my elemental mount, which looked like I was out of mana, meaning it took me three whole minutes to actually arrive at the first ambush point, giving me around two thousand points of mana. </p><p>[Mana: 2542  / 7595]</p><p>I could have used that mana as an anvil to smash the army, of course, but where was the fun in that. Instead, I leaned forward and caught Cornelia’s lips, helping her recover just enough mana to defend herself in an emergency before repeating the same action for Helga, bringing them back to the land of consciousness. It took three-quarters of my mana, but it was a necessary investment to split the undead army further without. </p><p>[-1793 Mana]</p><p>“We’re alive,” Helga gasped in fascination. </p><p>“You girls did well, defending us against the attack,” I said. “We managed to get away.” </p><p>“We recovered quite a bit,” Cornelia commented, but rather than happiness, I could feel the desire for battle in her tone. She clearly understood that if I managed to get enough mana to help them recover, I had to have an offensive reason, and she was more than happy to join that battle. </p><p>“Are you girls up to play bait in another trap, but this time to flash-fry some undead?” I offered. Their matching grins left no doubt about their response. “Excellent,” I said. “You don’t need to do much, just stay out of the range of these nuisances for about five minutes,” I said, making a sweeping gesture toward the bone dragons that was trying to do their best to catch up, unaware that they were only able to close in the distance because I allowed them, “and after I give the signal, turn back and eviscerate them.” </p><p>“I like that plan,” Cornelia grunted, her eyes burning with a passionate fire as she looked for a way to make someone pay for her earlier defeat, even that was against a superior opponent with an actual army behind. </p><p>Looking at her passionate expression, her red hair wild with the wind, I was sorely tempted to stop the plan for a fun interlude, but after a second thought, I decided against it. </p><p>A fun celebratory fivesome was a better idea anyway. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 489893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 1477  / 6324\tMana: 847  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

I watched as she moved back and forth gracefully, her naked body looking magical under the wrap of the dark waters. </p><p>Then, I threw myself into the water when she was at her most distant, giving her a chance to process my sudden presence. I chose to swim underwater, and when I broke through the surface, I was barely six feet away from her. “Chad?” she gasped questioningly. “What are you doing here?” </p><p>“Well, I wanted to check to see if everything is alright,” I said even as I closed the distance more. </p><p>My sudden appearance must have made her forget her current mode of dress momentarily, because she didn’t move away as I closed in the distance. </p><p>“I’m okay,” she answered. “Shouldn’t you be with Carrie?” </p><p>“She’s taking a little nap,” I answered, then gave her one of my best roguish smiles, the kind that was particularly effective in the relatively dim lighting conditions of the pool. “She still gets tired too quickly, despite all the practice we have,” I said. </p><p>“She’s been busier than I was expecting,” Sarah murmured, unable to prevent jealousy from infecting her tone. </p><p>“What can I say, she’s an enthusiastic student when it came to the kind of benefits friends could provide for each other,” I said even as I closed in the distance further. She took a step back reflexively, which brought her to the shallow part of the pool, the water only coming to her waist. </p><p>While she tried to come up with an answer to that, I let my gaze fall, examining her alabaster skin, shining beautifully under the moonlight, every single part of her beautiful body revealed to my sight. And I admired the opportunity. She might not have the curves of her blonde friend, but both the perkiness and the shape of her bosom were simply incredible. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one distracted by the presence of a naked torso, however. Sarah was equally distracted as she examined my muscles —and something even more interesting around the waist level. “Shouldn’t you back with her, in case she wakes up,” she finally managed to say, too distracted to come up with a proper answer. </p><p>“I’m sure she wouldn’t mind me entertaining one of her best friends,” I said. </p><p>Which, turned out to be the wrong thing to say, because her arms suddenly gathered around her chest. “She’s my best friend, what are we doing?” she gasped in shock, like she just realized the situation we were in. </p><p>“We’re doing nothing we weren’t doing when we were with her,” I reminded her, doing my best to stay calm, knowing that she was looking for an excuse to stay in her current position despite her words. It was just a part of the rationalization. “If she had a problem with that, she wouldn’t have undressed you for a silly bet.” </p><p>“But,” Sarah murmured, but her voice faded quickly, and she made no move to actually pull back. When Sarah looked down to think, I used the brief window of opportunity to look up, seeing Carrie’s figure looking down. Since the lights were turned off, I was only able to see a silhouette of her, but that was enough to confirm that she was still there, watching us. “We can’t do ‘it,” she murmured, the particular focus on the last word leaving no doubt about what she was talking about. </p><p>“As you wish,” I accepted quickly, before coming up with a counteroffer. “How about if we limit ourselves to the things we had done while we were next to her? That should be still in the confines of the game, especially with the way she decided to finish the game,” I said. </p><p>She stood silent, thinking, needing one last push. I decided to continue with a teasing tone, relying on the same playful sense of competition between them that helped to spiral things to their current level. “If you don’t think you can handle even that much, let alone as much as Carrie, though-” I said, only to be cut off. </p><p>“Of course I can handle it,” she answered immediately, her tone blistering. “I just-” she tried to continue, but this time, she was the one that was getting cut off. </p><p>“Perfect, then,” I said even as I took a large step forward, dwindling the distance between us to nothing. Her arms reached to my shoulders reflexively, leaving her chest naked, her nipples rock hard, showing her arousal, though the nighttime swim was certainly not hurting. </p><p>My chest pressed against hers, replicating our position back on the couch as much as possible. Though, there was a great difference. I was a great deal taller than her, meaning my erection was pressing against her stomach, rather noticeably. “This should be okay, right?” I said with a wide smirk as I looked down. </p><p>With her wet hair sticking on her face, she looked even more vulnerable than the first time she realized the true extent of the activity that was going on under the blanket. Her wide-eyed look certainly helped to sell her vulnerability even more. “Y-yeah,” she stammered as she slowly moved back as I pushed forward, until she was locked against the side of the pool. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I grabbed her hand and pulled it to my sides, allowing her to caress my abs. “How about this?” </p><p>“More than fine,” she answered rapidly, before her mind could catch up to what she had said. </p><p>“Excellent,” I repeated, my smirk widening even further as her hand started moving along my sides without prompting, showing the same fascination Carrie had been showing toward my muscles.</p><p>They were really best friends.  </p><p>I would have been happy to let her caress my body for a long while, until her arousal made her forcibly take the next step, but unexpectedly, that strategy was canceled when I noticed Carrie moving restlessly upstairs, clearly getting bored with the show. </p><p>Her sudden visit was the last thing I needed, so I decided to entertain her properly. I grabbed her waist and raised her up, enough to make her sit on the side of the pool, but a strategic step forward prevented her from closing her legs. “So, that should be okay as well,” I said even as I slipped two fingers inside, continuing the job I had started earlier. </p><p>Carrie’s moving figure stilled, suggesting that I was in the right direction. </p><p>“That’s too - much,” Sarah gasped, but the way her back arched and her utter lack of an attempt to push me back suggested that she was having more fun than she might be willing to admit. Carrie stayed in place, though her figure started moving once more, her arms and shoulders rather than her legs this time, conveying her satisfaction with the show. </p><p>Unaware that the show was just beginning. </p><p>Her legs widened as the pleasure hit. Her core was hidden by my fingers, but as her legs widened, I got an even better view of her tight legs and tight ass. They were really her best parts. She just stayed there, enjoying my fingers as I delivered a delicious assault to her. </p><p>Her arousal was getting to an even higher point as the time passed, her moans echoing deliciously against the walls of the house. Lost in pleasure, she didn’t resist even a bit as I pulled her closer, aligning my shaft against her entrance, but rather than pushing in, I started to rub the length against her, her moans intensifying. </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit too much?” she asked, but the delay between my action and her question was more than a minute. She only asked the question after reacting to a point I should pull back, I suddenly realized as I saw her deep arousal. It was just an excuse for her to show her ‘reluctance’ to reduce her guilt toward her friend. </p><p>“Should I stop?” I asked, unable to resist the temptation of teasing her by calling her bluff.</p><p>Her beautiful face froze almost immediately, but then, she stayed silent, seemingly happy with ignoring the existence of the question. My hips stopped their dance, forcing her to speak. “Maybe not,” she muttered shyly. “It’s not too different from when I sat on your lap. Your…thing…was rubbing against me back then as well.” </p><p>“My…thing?” I said mockingly, amused by her failure to refer to my cock even as the said cock continued to rub against her pussy, making her moan. So much for being the brave one among their nerdy group. </p><p>Despite her blush, she said nothing. As I continued rocking my hips, dragging my length repeatedly against her wetness, I decided to give her a reprieve, and didn’t threaten her by stopping unless she used proper names for our anatomical parts. </p><p>With my shaft dancing between her legs, and my fingers teasing her knob relentlessly, her moans evolved from repeated to uninterrupted. She thrust her hips forward, following my rhythm to enhance her pleasure even further. Lost in her pleasure, she didn’t comment the slightest when my free hand found her breasts, caressing the edge and flicking her nipples alternatively. </p><p>Even as my fingers danced at her bosom and her entrance, making her bend her body back even further, showing off her naked body beautifully on the edge of the pool, I couldn’t help but wonder which girl would stop me first. </p><p>Or if they would stop me at all… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I heard someone approach my office door, when I had no appointment. He was not someone I know, he didn't sound right. His footsteps fell more heavily, jauntily, and he whistled. A new guy. Still, I didn’t feel particularly alarmed. He whistled his way to my office door, his steps careless. </p><p>He was either supremely confident in his abilities, or he didn’t have a bad intention. </p><p>Then he laughed, confirming that he didn’t know what to expect. My business sign had evoked that response occasionally, often as much as derision. </p><p>Then he knocked.</p><p>I winced even as I stood up. Meeting new people was not something I particularly enjoyed, especially they were clearly not a client, as evidenced by their reaction to my business sign. </p><p>I got up out of my office chair and opened the door, only to meet with a middle-aged man that strangely resembled an old melon that stayed under the sun far too long. Roughly the same shape, with a nasty sunburn on his balding head. He was still chuckling, which didn’t exactly help his looks. </p><p>He glanced at me for a moment, before hooking a thumb toward the sign. \"You must be joking. This can’t be a real business.\"</p><p>“Unfortunately, it is,” I said. </p><p>“What do you do?” he immediately followed. “Children parties or corporate engagements?” he asked, his tone suggested that if the answer was the latter, he might have acted much kinder. </p><p>“Neither,” I said even as he looked past me, as though he expected to see a cage full of rabbits, but only saw a bunch of old and shabby office furniture. I could already feel his respect toward me disappearing faster than a snowflake in the desert, nor that I particularly cared an old basketball in his middle ages thought about me. </p><p>Seeing nothing, he tried to take a step forward, but I positioned myself at the door, not allowing him to pass forward. “Can I help you before you burst inside like a hoodlum?”</p><p>“I’m the new owner of the apartment. I wanted to check the room, to make sure everything is in order,” he said. </p><p>“Not unless you give me an official notification a week before,” I answered calmly, watching as his face evolved from melon to a tomato as the anger infected his face, suggesting a fragile ego. It wasn’t the first time I dealt with someone with an overinflated sense of ego, fed by their sense of superiority toward an inferior target. </p><p>And most of the time, those were much more dangerous than a balding man a head shorter than me. </p><p>“I don’t appreciate smart asses,” he growled in anger. “Look here you two-bit…” he started, before looking at the business sign at the door. “… Sorcerer. I can kick your failing business out of my building immediately if I wish so,” he growled. </p><p>“No you can’t, not unless you want to spend the next year in the courthouse,” I said even as I grabbed the door, ready to slam the door to his face. I knew his type. Unless I showed him that I had no intention of dealing with his nonsense, he would push continuously. </p><p>I learned my lesson with the Council. </p><p>Before I could slam the door on his face, however, the elevator door opened, revealing a sexy blonde with a fit body, wearing a tank top and a miniskirt. “Dad, what are you doing here? Mom promised that we’re going to buy a car before I leave for college.” </p><p>The man murmured something suspiciously close to whore at the mention of the mother of the bombshell that stepped into the corridor. “Sure, let’s go,” he said before making eye contact with me, in a way he no doubts thought to be threatening when he noticed my appreciative gaze toward his daughter.  </p><p>Pity that I had faced the literal creatures of the Abyss without blinking —metaphorically of course, as most of the creatures had the ability to devour the soul or destroy the body through actual eye contact, making direct eye contact extremely inadvisable. </p><p>“And I’ll keep an eye on you, you two-bit fortune-teller, and if you miss the rent just by a day…” he growled just before leaving. </p><p>\"Typical,\" I muttered, and shut the door.</p><p>Just what I needed in my exile, another busybody who decided to make his life’s mission to annoy me. </p><p>Like I hadn’t had enough of them thanks to the Council. </p><p>                                        ***********************</p><p>Trying to make a living as a full-time Sorcerer-for-hire was a difficult thing, especially without an accredited education certificate. I doubted that a growing technology company that pays its employees in six figures would appreciate a glowing certificate from an interdimensional magical university. </p><p>As a true Sorcerer, making money through magic, even in a low-magic dimension, would have been extremely simple, if it wasn’t for the truly impressive number of Custodians that was observing my every move, hoping to find an excuse to deliver a much more final punishment than just exiling me back to a low-magic dimension. </p><p>Still, a full-time Sorcerer-for-hire was hardly the best way to actually make a living, even with the renaissance in the public awareness of the paranormal thanks to social media. Most of the belief came from lies and hoaxes rather than actual evidence, but was better than nothing. At least, it gave me enough people with supernatural concerns to give me an excuse to cast magic. </p><p>I worked as a Sorcerer-for-hire, because helping people to defend against the supernatural threats was the only way I could cast magic, a responsibility that superseded my terms of the exile, because it was embedded in the charter of the council. </p><p>Every member of the council is responsible for defending the denizens of the dimension they were in against predatory magical threats. </p><p>I grabbed that excuse with both hands, driving the Custodians assigned to my observation crazy, even though most jobs barely netted me enough money to pay the rent and the other necessities. Of course, my lack of money was mostly because of my pride as a practitioner, choosing the information my client about the truth of the matter rather than tricking them with elaborate rituals with enough incense to represent a fire hazard. Even the times there was an actual problem to solve, a hand gesture and a muttered phrase that resembled the bastard child of Arabic, Latin, and Mandarin after it was passed through the blender hardly helped. </p><p>Still, if I was slipping a few personal spells between the ones required to solve the problems of my clients… Well, unless my dear Custodians had any evidence… </p><p>Without a client to keep me busy, I sat on my chair, and pulled my laptop, typing a complicated pattern of symbols rapidly in a program of my own design, creating patterns that would drive a lesser man crazy with a glance. </p><p>Another loophole in my terms of exile. Casting magic was forbidden. Researching magic, less so, driving the concerned council members who had been hoping that my exile would turn me into a nonentity… </p><p>A few minutes into my research, however, my phone rang, distracting me from the complicated and confusing world of magical research. I stared at it in a somewhat surly fashion, like I expected the caller to know I was on the cusp of a breakthrough. “It’s Harvey Reynolds, the Sorcerer,” I said, trying to keep my tone calm. </p><p>After all, I actually needed the money if I wanted to pay the rent on time. “And I don’t do parties, neither corporate nor children’s birthday, no matter the child in question is looking for a rabbit from a hat,” I added, a habit I generated after endless calls I had to explain the disappointed parent who had forgotten to arrange a proper entertainer for their children. </p><p>“Sorry? This is the office of Mr. Reynolds, the Sorcerer, right?” a female voice asked, trembling apologetically, as though she was terribly afraid of insulting me. </p><p>As much as I wanted to be grumpy and tell her that I already answered the question, as an exiled sorcerer who was having trouble paying his bills, I didn’t exactly have the luxury to be grumpy to a potential client. “Yes, this is he. How can I help you today?” </p><p>“Um… I’m… My brother has disappeared. I was hoping that you might help you…” she murmured. </p><p>“Do you have any reason to believe there’s a supernatural aspect to his disappearance?” I asked immediately. As much as I would have loved to help a normal disappearance through my magic —helping people was nice, especially when it comes with a hefty payment— my exiled status didn’t allow me to do that. Unless there was enough circumstantial evidence of the supernatural, I couldn’t use magic. </p><p>Not unless I wanted to give the Custodians the excuse they desperately wanted. </p><p>“Yes, there was some…” she answered after a moment’s pause, only to freeze halfway. “I’m sorry, it’s ridiculous that I even called. It’s not something I could explain on the phone. Sorry for wasting your time,” she said, before the phone went off. </p><p>I sighed. Another potential client, gone before a dozen sentences. Perils of working as a full-time practitioner. But before I could try to call her back, my phone buzzed again, but this time, a familiar number on the phone. </p><p>“How can I help you, detective-” I started, only to be cut off by a sharp tone. </p><p>“Be at the Hotel Glory, in ten minutes!” ordered a sharp female voice before closing it off immediately. </p><p>How interesting, I thought. Detective Joanna was hardly the warmest person in the room, but usually, she was perfunctory enough to ask for my availability before forcing me to join the case. </p><p>Unless there was an emergency, of course…   </p><p>I stood up, put my trench coat on —the only article of clothing that I could wear that somehow made my identity as a Sorcerer convincing without looking like I escaped from a circus in a hurry— grabbed a small briefcase that was filled with several select items I managed to find at Earth —most acquired through a very interesting job for a museum, against a threat with a potential to destroy the western hemisphere if it wasn’t for my timely intervention— and left my office. </p><p>Whatever made Detective Joanna ask me in such a hurry must be an interesting job…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>Mark was getting more and more conflicted as Laura silently slid down, paying his abs inordinate attention for a while before completing her little journey, though her focus was a little weird. He was aware of the fascination the women had toward his abs —and enjoyed it, hence the reason for the endless hours he spent at the gym to sculpt them to perfection— but Laura’s was a bit different. </p><p>Like she was actually forcing herself to pay attention to them before she moved on. </p><p>The reason revealed itself a moment later, when she continued to move down, her beautiful eyes widening as her gaze fell onto his shaft, the object that had been invading her earlier. He barely held back from chuckling, realizing that she had been trying to hide her fascination, somehow still ashamed of it after what they had just done. He forced the chuckle to die before it could leave his lips, not wanting to make her self-conscious. </p><p>Instead, he aligned the pillow so that he could watch as Laura made herself familiar with a rather important part of his anatomy. </p><p>The tense vulnerability on her face as she wrapped her fingers around his girth to test the texture of his shaft would have been cute, if it wasn’t for the fact that her chest was slightly raised, giving him a limited view of her amazing bosom, the one that she always hid behind thick blouses and boring cardigans. Distracted by the amazing view she was creating, he absolutely had no problem giving her the time she needed to wrap her head around the new concept. </p><p>Especially if she was willing to follow that by wrapping her lips around his girth… </p><p>He had to admit that she was lucky to have her first proper experience with such a spectacular example of manhood—even though it felt rather a narcissistic thing to say in the confines of his mind. It was a quality he was aware of in himself, otherwise, he wouldn’t have torturing himself to maintain his body to perfection even as he was starting to push to forty. </p><p>Laura’s expression started to get more and more intense even as her fingers started to move up and down, with a hesitancy that left no doubt about it was the first time she was touching a cock. If it was one of his frequent one-night stands from his lawyer days, it would have annoyed immensely. Those days, sex was a performance, and he demanded excellence from both sides to make it fun. </p><p>Looking back, not too unlike playing tennis with someone. A lot of sweat and fun, but little to none actual emotion other than what a rush of adrenaline could evoke. </p><p>As he watched Laura, however, it was different. Special. How or why, he had no idea. He had spent such a long portion of his lawyer days as an emotional blank that was only occupied with the next case that actually feeling something against some other person was a genuine change of pace. </p><p>But regardless, he decided to ignore the nature of his emotional journey, and focus on the beautiful sight of Laura’s hands slowly gaining confidence, dancing over his shaft, slowly leaning further. His smile widened even further when her tongue darted out to leave a hesitant lick on his length. The cute gasp she let out as her tongue disappeared in her mouth was a thing of beauty, even as she lowered her head down to hide her expression. </p><p>Still, despite her obvious shyness, she decided to push forward, using the same determination that allowed herself to piece her life together after her hopes of getting into an ivy-league college had been demolished. </p><p>She used her tongue and once more, licking around the head of his cock, this time her touch lingering for far longer. She pulled back for a moment, shivering in excitement, but her tongue touched again a few seconds, slowly covering the crown of his shaft with an abundance of saliva. </p><p>Her quick development surprised him, but not as much as her next move, when she suddenly dipped down without a warning and capturing a third of his shaft in her deliciously hot mouth, her presence swirling around. She pulled back, but with her lips clamped tight around my girth —even if it forced her to open her mouth as wide as possible— the move created a delicious rush of pleasure. </p><p>When she pulled out completely rather than repeating the pattern, Mark was ready to feel disappointed, but that faded quickly when her tongue took over, moving along his length. Still, it left its place in surprise as she started delivering a combined assault of her lips and her tongue, much smoother than he would have expected. </p><p>If he wasn’t absolutely sure about her lack of experience, he would have assumed she was one of the lip queens back in high school. But still, the expertise she was displaying, when contrasted with her inexperience… </p><p>When the obvious answer finally appeared in his mind, cutting through pleasure, he failed to suppress a chuckle. Which, naturally, destroyed her fragile confidence, and she immediately rose with a wounded expression, ready to dash away. “Sorry,” he said with a kind smile even as he grabbed her wrist. “I wasn’t laughing at you. I just realized an interesting detail, and it surprised me.” </p><p>“What?” she said even as she raised her arm reflexively to cover her chest, her expression fragile even after the spectacular orgasm. After her reaction to his earlier loss of control when he took her domineeringly —not to mention her confidence in the way she dressed as she visited him— he had underestimated just how fragile she might be despite everything. </p><p>And apparently, being laughed at was one of her triggers, to a point of risking all the progress they had made. </p><p>“Nothing,” he said calmly, using the same tone he had used years earlier when he went riding lessons, where a trainer had used against a panicking mare. “I just realized something rather interesting. You have studied before coming here, right?” he asked. </p><p>“Studying?” she murmured dazedly, only understanding what he was talking about when his gaze dipped down to his crotch. The fear of being mocked that was about to make her escape disappeared, leaving its place to a much cuter version of shyness. “M-maybe,” she stuttered, reluctant to admit but unable to lie. </p><p>“It’s not something to be ashamed about,” he said even as he reached to caress her cheek, before turning that touch into a much more solid one on the back of her head, applying the slightest pressure to lower her head. She immediately followed his wordless direction, once again taking her place between his legs, her hands pressing against the bed. </p><p>In her shyness, she was even more willing to follow his directions. </p><p>But, rather than focusing on the implications of her sudden obedience, he decided to focus on the amazing blowjob she started to provide. Her head started to bob up and down, both quicker and deeper as he maintained his grip, giving her the occasional directions. </p><p>He didn’t keep his hand on her head for long, nor that he needed to. She proved herself as an excellent student once more by swallowing more than half of his girth even without his assistance, bobbing aggressively. Her moans soon rose, their rumbling making the treatment even better. </p><p>He let his body buried in the bed, letting himself enjoy the amazing treatment he was receiving, something he had deserved after disarming the unexpected bomb of vulnerability, though he had to bite his lips to prevent a cry of pleasure when she suddenly pulled out, only to slide her tongue down his shaft to the bottom and back up, her movements getting smoother and smoother, to a point that betrayed she had spent more than one dedicated evening playing with a toy to train her motor skills. </p><p>Not that he was complaining, on the contrary. After all, a good blowjob had two components, skill and enthusiasm, both had been considerably lacking on the female half of the population when it came to giving good head. The latter was understandable, but the former was usually about their inflated perception of their own abilities. </p><p>It was good to see Laura embracing a systematic approach, the same kind she applied in her studies. </p><p>However, that didn’t change the fact she was turning to be a tease, Mark added a couple of minutes later, when he watched her pull out and lick the sides of his shaft again. Pleasurable, no doubt, but not in a way that would extinguish the desire starting to burn intensely in his heart. </p><p>Still, he suppressed the temptation to grab her head and enjoy the tightness of her throat, willing to enjoy the show she was providing… </p><p>The night was sufficiently long… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“For the all that is holy!” I shouted as I dashed at a speed near my full limits while trying to look heroic —still leaving something in the tank in case the death knights decided to use the opportunity to intervene, whether targeting me or the girls with the hopes of distracting me— and brought down my impressive looking axe to the head of the nearest zombie. </p><p>And I cast an undead bane —which I decided to call the useful mixture of light magic and life energy I generated through the biomancy— as I slammed my axe on the nearest zombie, while the explosion killed several more, clearing out a small opening for me. </p><p>[-9 Mana]</p><p>After that, I started cleaving through the horde of zombies as they barely bothered to attack me, determined to reach the glowing lines of the wards I had created. I responded with another undead bane, forcing the zombies to spread further to avoid the explosions, but ultimately slowing their journey. </p><p>[-8 Mana]</p><p>I did my best to look disappointed in their strategy journey as I cleaved through the zombies, the axe swinging desperately with its momentum, leaving several zombies in its wake with every swing, their limited mobility making them an easy target. </p><p>My desperate defense confirmed the hopelessness of the situation for the necromancers that were responsible for the assault, it seemed, because it didn’t take long for them to add another large group of zombies to the attack, committing further to their strategy. </p><p>From the start of the attack addition of the second group, barely thirty seconds had passed, but for me, every second was gold. As my mana refilled, I started to feel more confident. At least, I felt like I had a fighting chance even if they realized my subterfuge. </p><p>[Mana: 2141  / 7595] </p><p>That didn’t mean that I abandoned my ploy, of course. On the contrary, I decided to commit even further in my desperate defense, feeling comfortable in investing some mana for better returns. I cast a fancy arcana spell on the axe before throwing it on to the army that stood between me and the wounded death knight, and cast another undead bane at the impact point, clearing a large group of undead in the process, and leaving several stronger ones hopelessly wounded. </p><p>[-241 Mana] </p><p>Then, I dashed forward, grabbing the axe halfway, and reducing the glow of the fake runes that covered its surface, but leaving enough glow to convince them that it still had a few charges left. </p><p>For the observers, it looked like I had just spent an expandable ability to force a fight between me and the death knight. Technically, it was a risky move. If the two death knights had pulled out from their hiding place and ambushed me, but I was betting on the fact that Zokras cared more about the death knights than the rest of his army. </p><p>Just as I expected, rather than facing me, the wounded death knight pulled deeper into the army, leaving me to face against an impressive number of stronger undead minions, including skeleton knights, monstrous creatures made from disgusting flesh, and occasional bone dragons swooping from the sky, each destroyed with a swing of my axe —which might not be a good weapon, forty-six points of strength that were behind it, swinging it with a merciless speed, was no joke. </p><p>I didn’t bother channeling the impact of my kills to Cornelia, as currently, my mana was far too precious trying to do something I could easily replicate with my mana later on thanks to my newest level up. </p><p>Just like that, another forty seconds passed as I cut through an impressive number of undead, but not without a cost, mostly in the form of an impressive number of wounds I had collected as I tried to push through the horde with apparent desperation.  </p><p>[-193 Mana]</p><p>[-421 HP]</p><p>[Mana: 2716  / 7595] </p><p>Unfortunately, as beneficial as my ploy was, it was hard to continue indefinitely. Ultimately, necromancers might be evil, selfish, and reprehensible, but that didn’t mean that they were completely idiotic. Even with their attention on my reckless assault toward the death knights, they soon noticed that the distraction of the runes had little effect. </p><p>Luckily, their hesitancy meant that rather than attacking with full force, they decided to send a couple of low-level necromancers to test them from a closer distance —and having a small argument in the process— giving me even more time. Which was welcome, because as I cast another detection spell, I noticed the two death knights finally leaving their hiding spot. </p><p>[-14 Mana]</p><p>One advantage of having a huge army was that it created a convenient hiding spot for any high-level undead that wanted to reach their target without being noticed. Well, against anyone without a conveniently superior detection spell. </p><p>Ambushes were a curious thing. Delivered correctly, they were a strategic miracle, enabling the delivery of extreme destruction, far above the potential the attackers might carry. But paradoxically, once detected, the supposed multiplier turned into a deadly rug around their feet, waiting to be pulled. </p><p>And two death knights, hidden inside a huge horde of zombies to conceal their presence fitted perfectly to the situation. If they had been successful in their sneaking attempt, even if I was under the perfect condition, I doubted I could handle them without significant cost. </p><p>At least, when they had a perfectly disposable army to back them up. </p><p>Unfortunately for Zokras’ precious death knight, the hypothetical was different than the reality. I waited until they were in the middle of the army, both away from any cover that they could use to blunt the damage, and the army around themselves crowded enough to actually prevent them moving efficiently. </p><p>“About time,” I cried in exultation even as I threw the axe once more, this time without bothering to charge the axe. More importantly, I started channeling a devastating, overcharged another undead bane spell, much stronger, but didn’t let go immediately, because the wounded death knight stopped escaping, and stood its ground. </p><p>The army around itself pulled away, bestowing it with a movement range to dodge. From my previous experience with them, I was well aware that death knights were deceptively fast enough to dodge any ranged attempt from my part without obstruction, and it was preparing to dodge.</p><p>I raised my axe, letting the axe shatter as I pointed the remains toward the third one, giving every indication that I was going to aim at him as I used the majority of my mana, once again, at the risk of depleting myself. </p><p>[-1492 Mana]</p><p>But the spell went the opposite direction. </p><p>To their credit, the ambushing death knights reacted the reversal even better than I expected. Rather than trying to push away through the horde of zombies —which was something certainly in their power, but the fraction of a second they would lose in the process made dodging impossible— they got even tighter in a defensive pose, trying to maximize their defense. </p><p>Still, even with the defensive effort, their fate would have been sealed if it wasn’t for the intervention of the other necromancers. They were smart enough to wait in preparation, and my sudden spell forced most of them to shield the death knights from the sudden rush of light energy. Due to the nature of their mana, it wasn’t the most effective way of spending mana, especially in a hurry, but considering the number I was facing, it was still enough for the death knights to get away from my spell relatively unscathed. </p><p>I would have loved to take both of them with one spell, of course, but failing that wasn’t the end of the game for me. Not even close. Ignoring the flare of mana behind as the necromancers tried to form an offensive spell to prevent me from attacking the two death knights as they recovered, I pushed forward toward the third one, alone and wounded, exposed deliberately to enable an ambush that was conveniently disabled. More than happy to educate my enemies against the perils of strategic commitment. The damaged death knight tried to retreat, but with the extensive damage it suffered earlier, it was noticeably slower. </p><p>I caught him before it could disappear into the rest of the army. Its sword whipped fast like the deadly threat it was, streaking toward me, leaving a dark afterimage, but I met it with a glowing sword of light forcing it to solidify. </p><p>[-154 Mana] </p><p>It was an expensive way of creating a weapon, certainly, enough to drain me in less than a minute even if I was fresh. Luckily, I didn’t need a minute. </p><p>I didn’t even need a second. </p><p>After parrying its sword, its momentum reversed uselessly, I plunged the sword of light through its armor, into where its heart had been when it was alive, but now, housed the core of the necrotic array that sustained its unnatural unlife. I forced the sword to explode, finishing the death knight in the process.</p><p>[-219 Mana] </p><p>I would have loved to watch as the death knight disintegrated slowly. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to do so, not when I could feel two other death knights rushing toward me, the damage they received relatively small, both still very much a threat. </p><p>Rather than facing them directly, I cast an earth spell, raising a huge wall between us. </p><p>[-21 Mana]</p><p>It was a pointlessly weak spell, one that could barely resist the assault of a zombie, but after an attack that delivered great damage despite their impeccable defense, they were naturally wary of my tricks. </p><p>I continued to retreat back, creating a dozen earthen walls between, but just as they started breaking through them, I injected the fifth wall with some light magic as well, forcing it to destabilize, making them retreat. Therefore, I managed to safely arrive next to the girls, most of my mana depleted once more, but most importantly, the undead army in total chaos.</p><p>They played their trump card, only to fail spectacularly. </p><p>“That was amazing,” Cornelia gushed with a worshipful expression, impressed by the widespread destruction I committed with almost no visible cost. “Should we help as well,” she offered despite her depleted status.  </p><p>“Nope,” I said even as I grabbed their waists and jumped with them, before spending most of my remaining mana to conjure a faux air elemental, forcing it to move as fast as possible before their spellcasters were too distracted with checking whether my earth constructs were trapped or not, too occupied to dispel it. </p><p>[-1229 Mana]</p><p>“I’m out of bluffs, it’s time to retreat…” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 489893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 1477  / 6324\tMana: 312  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“What exactly happened?” I repeated the question again as I looked at Cornelia, this time with a much stronger tone, even as I put my hand on Helga’s body to send another wave of healing magic, the healing efficiency much stronger thanks to our physical contact. Not enough to actually cure her, of course, but enough to awaken her in a few seconds. </p><p>[-94 Mana]</p><p>Meanwhile, Cornelia managed to gather her wits enough to start speaking, enough to give a stammering report. “It was just another wave of monster attack,” Cornelia started even as she trembled, struggling to stay conscious, too exhausted by the latest spell she cast against the death knight before I managed to intervene. “Then, some of the experimental early-warning wards Helga had prepared triggered, alerting us for the undead assault, so we had a couple of minutes to erect some additional wards to keep them away.” She took a shaky breath. </p><p>“It was the only thing that saved the lives of the citizens. Iomene managed to create an elite force to cut through the undead defense, and most of the students defended the rears. I took command of the rear, with the strongest students supporting us. We knew that it would have been difficult to defend the rear, but…” </p><p>“But we didn’t expect a death knight waiting for us to commit on our strategy before launching,” Helga cut in, awake enough to take the discussion. Cornelia sent her an appreciative nod, and focused on her breathing, trying to stay conscious. </p><p>“Well, at least, there are some advantages,” I said. </p><p>“Like what?” Helga said, confused. Cornelia didn’t say anything, but her expression suggested that Helga was reflecting her emotions as well. </p><p>“Well, at least you girls stopped fighting,” I said with a wide smile. “Our next threesome is going to be so interesting.“</p><p>“Caesar,” they gasped simultaneously. “It’s not the time,” Helga continued even as she slapped my shoulder, but their resigned expression brightened. Not because it was an amazing joke, but the fact that I was confident enough to joke meant that I was confident in getting away safely. </p><p>I wasn’t really confident, but there was no harm in making them believe it. </p><p>“Their strategy doesn’t make sense,” Helga murmured even as she struggled to stand up. “With the forces they committed, they could have taken down every single man in the town much easier. All they needed was to use the death knight against the Iomene’s forces before they could create a breach.” </p><p>“Their strategy makes sense, you just need to know their true objective,”  I said. </p><p>“True objective?” Cornelia interjected, shocked, like she was having trouble understanding the magnitude of the event. “You’re saying that the lives of tens of thousands of people are just bait for their true objective.” </p><p>“Not tens of thousands of people, just two people,” I said even as I pointed at them. </p><p>Helga gasped. “You’re the target.” </p><p>“Right in one,” I said even as I cast a subtle detection spell, expecting to be attacked immediately, wasting some more of my precious mana. Luckily, they didn’t attack immediately, giving me some time to recover. Barely half a minute, something they didn’t even factor in as useful, but my regeneration, even with what the last healing spell consumed, allowed me to more than double my available mana. </p><p>[-21 Mana]</p><p>[Mana: 1086 / 7595]</p><p>“But that doesn’t make sense,” Cornelia stammered. “A whole army, with a death knight,” she uttered even as she looked at me with widening eyes, a sense of worship dancing behind them as she reassessed my strength again, going up even more. </p><p>“Three death knights, actually,” I corrected her even as I used another detection spell, trying to understand their strategy based on the way their movements. </p><p>[-16 Mana]</p><p>The results of the second detection put a wide smile on my face. The hidden death knights still held their position, while the army was slowly shuffling, changing their direction inward, while the wounded one pulled back to join the rest of the army. The more interesting part was the rest of the army, surrounding us completely, which made me smile. </p><p>They were trying to use their cannon fodder first to weaken me before launching their deadly attack, unaware that each second that took to reorganize the hulking hordes of zombies was making it harder for them to succeed in their objective. I also considered healing myself, but ultimately, I decided against it. With the army I was about to face, area effect spells would help me much more than a few extra points of HP. Missing skin was painful, but preferable to death. </p><p> “Three death knights,” Cornelia gasped in shock, well aware how she compared even one of them, spending all of her mana just to delay one for a few seconds. </p><p>“Would I be an evil person if I said I’m glad that the rest of the army is chasing the survivors of the city?” Helga gasped. </p><p>“No, you wouldn’t,” I said. “Unfortunately, however, you’re wrong about their target,” I said. A second later, the last embers of the flames finally died, finally revealing the rest of the city. The buildings in our immediate surroundings had been destroyed as a result of the spell, giving the girls a good view of the rest of the city. </p><p>Which included a huge army of low-level zombies, closing in like a dark wave, slowly but steadily. </p><p>“Maybe I can distract them for a moment,” Cornelia offered with a resigned tone. To her credit, her tone wasn’t filled with fear, making me respect her even more. She might be an annoying noble heiress in the safety of the school, but she was a true battle mage facing an unbeatable enemy. </p><p>Well, what looked like an unbeatable enemy. </p><p>“No need,” I said to Cornelia even as I raised my hand, to see whether I could bluff another undead army in the same day. Pity that I lacked the overwhelming force option, but that didn’t mean that I was completely out of option, especially since a previous trap of mine had managed to get rid of five death knights in the process. </p><p>“Is this all the army you can gather to face me, Zokras,” I shouted smugly, enhancing my voice magically even as I simultaneously cast a variant of the earth element, forcing lines and lines of complicated runes to appear from the ground, shining brightly? “Last time, we were in your base, and you lost five death knights in the process. Are you brave enough to face me mine?” </p><p>[-54 Mana]</p><p>It was pure bluff, of course. The complicated runes that appeared were just shining brightly, representing many dangerous explosions, but they lacked the proper investment of mana to actually work as advertised. They were just pretty lights. </p><p>Helga looked at me weirdly, realizing that it was just a bluff, but smart enough actually not to say anything. Cornelia examined them with a shocked expression, failing to understand it was just a trick due to her own overspecialized magical knowledge. </p><p>Their response gave me an accurate gauge of the response of the undead army. Cornelia was lacking in terms of wards when compared to Helga, but only because Helga was overspecialized in theory in a way few actually was, and could catch the inconsistencies between runes at a glance. </p><p>On the side of the undead, I doubted anyone other than Zokras could replicate her expertise. Meaning, if they called my bluff and sent the whole army, Zokras was there, directing the assault. If they believed it, he was not. </p><p>Then, a small group of zombies —well, small in terms of an endless undead army, easily in high hundreds— pulled away from the main group, but rather than targeting us, spread around, clearly aiming to erase the runes, forcing the trap to discharge early. “No!” I gasped in an exaggerated shock, stretching my acting abilities to the limit, like a staggering assault was the worst thing that could happen. </p><p>“Stay back, and defend each other, do nothing else,” I said the girls with a message, then dashed forward. </p><p>[-2 Mana] </p><p>Even as I rushed forward, I cast another spell, pulling large pieces of metal from around myself, fashioning myself a huge axe, larger than myself, glowing furiously. Though, rather than forcing it in the air, I pulled it from the ground, making it more mysterious. </p><p>[-85 Mana]</p><p>It wasn’t a good weapon, both in terms of size, and in terms of the magic I invested in stabilizing its structure, but its huge surface was filled with glowing runes that radiated life energy. Despite its uselessness, from a distance, it looked amazing. “Come and taste the edge of the Undead Bane,” I shouted showily as I dashed. </p><p>The more I could delay them through my physical capabilities, the better… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 489893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 1898  / 6324\tMana: 1629  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The hesitation that covered Umi’s face as Tiffany leaned over her body to press her lips against her elegant neck was beautiful, like a little sparrow caught in a trap. Umi trembled, her emotions not helped when Tiffany leaned against her side, her arm pressing against Umi’s bosom — her lack of a bra making the feeling much more intense, her nipples hardening almost instantly. </p><p>“M-maybe-” Umi stuttered hesitantly, realizing that things were going to a place she wasn’t prepared for, if the current situation was the start of it. My redheaded partner, however, was too sly to allow her to air her concerns, pressing her finger on her lips playfully to silence her while leaned to whisper a few things. </p><p>Her voice was too low for me to hear, but Umi’s growing blush left no doubt about the direction of her words. Quite effective as well, as Umi’s reluctant attempts to stop her weakened considerably, giving Tiffany a level of access that would certainly prove to be a mistake.</p><p>Or from a different, more hedonistic — and less moralistic — perspective, it might prove very beneficial.  </p><p>\"Excellent,\" I declared exuberantly as I watched Tiffany’s hands slip under her top, caressing her belly while also giving a generous glimpse of her smooth skin. </p><p>Tiffany chuckled at my exclamation, while Umi reacted by blushing even further, barely held back by another whisper from Tiffany. Something about the scene made me wish to laugh before leaning forward to join. Pity that doing so would have sent Umi running. </p><p>Umi’s demure reluctance — fitting for her Asian heritage, I was ready to admit at the risk of sound stereotypical — contrasted greatly with Tiffany’s fiery enthusiasm — another common trope that fitted to a T — creating an amazing show for me to enjoy, to a point I was starting to suspect how much of Tiffany working to get her promised reward, and how much she was actually enjoying it. </p><p>I didn’t bother questioning her about the exact reason since I wasn’t an idiot, just leaning back to enjoy the show. Only an idiot would anger such a beauty in the middle of providing a show. </p><p>As I watched, Tiffany’s fingers moved higher and higher, revealing more of Umi’s skin as she journeyed. Then, her second hand joined her little game and grabbed Umi’s top, filling me a temptation to cheer for her. Umi’s back arched reflexively like she was trying to escape, but the velvety walls of our booth prevented her escape. </p><p>I was so tempted to cheer like I was watching a particularly popular strip show, or ask Tiffany to pull Umi’s top, revealing her delicious bosom to my sight. Unfortunately, while the restaurant was fairly permissive about what was going on in private booths, there were limits, and stripping definitely violated them. </p><p>Luckily, Tiffany saw the problem and shifted her hips as she leaned forward, her skirt pulled up, revealing her delicious ass, covered only by a deficient thong. When she added a delicious sway on them as she lifted up, relying on the table to hide the sight from any waitress that might decide to drop by, it was enough for me to enjoy the show for a while without making an aggressive move to ruin the moment. </p><p>When Tiffany finally pulled back from peppering Umi’s neck with kisses, both women were breathing hard, Umi with shock, Tiffany with arousal. Then, Umi realized the state of her top, bunched upward enough to reveal a thin line under her boobs, turning her already sexy state into downright erotic. </p><p>She tried to pull that back, of course, but Tiffany was quick to grab her wrist to prevent her from fixing her top, whispering to dissuade her from her action. </p><p>Umi listened to Tiffany’s tempting whispers, and doing so, missed another interesting fact, that Tiffany shifted her seat so that she was sitting on the opposite side. I slid closer, conveniently sandwiching Umi between us. </p><p>Only when Tiffany settled on her new seat, Umi realized her new seating arrangement. She sent a panicked glare to my side, particularly toward my hand, panickedly checking whether I had any intention of replacing the area Tiffany’s hands departed recently. When noticing I had no intention of doing it, she relaxed slightly, and soon, her attention was stolen once again by Tiffany’s wandering lips, this time tracing down her chin. </p><p>“So, any plans after the marriage, maybe a fancy honeymoon,” I asked while Tiffany’s kisses started to trail even upward toward her ear, making it very hard for her to focus. </p><p>“N-not really,” she managed to stammer. “The money is a bit tight… So unless the quarterly bonus covers it, it doesn’t seem likely,” she added even as she started shuffling under Tiffany’s touch, this time with an even more heated touch. </p><p>If it was Tiffany that uttered that sentence, I would be sure that she was fishing for some more money for her household — which was much easier to do in a company that was trying to get rid of me — but Umi was too innocent to do so, especially with Tiffany’s tongue strategically teasing her earlobe, distracting her the most delicious way possible. </p><p>“Really, I didn’t know our salaries were that low.” </p><p>“They are not!” Umi responded rapidly, taking my gentle ribbing as genuine displeasure. “It’s just that we have student debts and a mortgage, not leaving a lot of money to spend.” </p><p>“It’s good to be financially savvy,” I said, trying to suppress my instincts not to pounce her helpless state. She had just revealed the horrible state of her financials despite the fact that I was fairly transparent about my intention — not to mention, she came there intentionally with her fiancee’s insistence to get a bigger bonus. I could have easily used her admission to pressure her for more ‘favors’ until she was a bundle of guilt and shame. </p><p>Paradoxically, her gullible innocence was the thing that prevented me from doing so. I had no problem using such weapons against Natalie, but against Umi, they were just overkill. I just chuckled before deflecting the amazing opportunity she had provided me, despite Tiffany’s shocked glance as I let it slide away. </p><p>“It’s a pity,” Tiffany said as she pulled back, but her finger still dancing at the edge of Umi’s breasts, pushing her top higher and higher. It was still acceptable for an evening dress cleavage, but it was rapidly nearing that limit. “A fancy wedding and a fancy honeymoon is something every wife deserves,” she said. “If only there was a way for you to get that bonus,” Tiffany said before leaning down to lick her earlobe once more, but this time, whispering more. </p><p>I couldn’t hear what Tiffany was saying, but I didn’t need to hear to know what she was talking about to guess its contents, not when her hands started to move even more aggressively, pushing Umi’s tanktop high enough until her nipple prevented it from going further. </p><p>Tiffany let her hands slide down at that point, but her lips got even more aggressive, clamping on Umi’s, stealing an aggressive kiss. Watching a demure Asian beauty with an amazing underboob cleavage getting dominated by a feisty redhead was enough to turn up my hardness into a level of torture. </p><p>Still, I watched as Tiffany’s skilled fingers traveled down across Umi’s stomach, teasing her cute belly button before moving up moments later to cup the underside of her breasts once more. Umi trembled, her unsupported tits bouncing beautifully. Her eyes danced in panic, looking at everywhere but me, especially when Tiffany’s hands started to travel down once more. </p><p>Her fingers arrived at Umi’s jeans and flipped the button open. Umi flinched — which only made her generous bosom dance even more — while trying to stop Tiffany. But her attempts to stop her rang hollow because she failed to pull back from the kiss, too shocked with the sudden escalation to do anything but obey, even when Tiffany’s fingers disappeared into her jeans. </p><p>I couldn’t help but let out an excited gasp as Tiffany’s fingers started to dance in the confines of Umi’s jeans, making her sway and gasp. My surprise only grew as unlike what I expected, her fingers stayed in that dangerous destination, dancing continuously while she still kept their lips connected. </p><p>Umi’s body started to undulate helplessly under Tiffany’s control, captured by her charm, her ability to make good — or even decent — decisions disappeared under Tiffany’s enthusiastic tongue. When she broke the kiss, only to clamp on her neck, Umi’s mouth opened in shock, ready to let out a loud moan. </p><p>I reacted quickly, pressing my hand over her lips. “Careful, beautiful. We don’t want to be kicked out,” I reminded her. She managed to suppress her voice, but as our eyes connected, it only increased her panicked arousal more, finally remembering that not only we were in a public space, but I was also watching from the side, two facts that had been forgotten thanks to Tiffany’s skillful fingers. </p><p>Umi said nothing, just biting her lips to contain her voice while looking down Tiffany, helplessly confused under her assault. </p><p>Another delicious minute passed, and I was starting to consider whether I had to actually stop her before the escalation reached a point that would get us kicked out of the restaurant even with their fairly permissive approach to that kind of fun activities when Tiffany pulled back without a warning. Umi just leaned back, trying to catch her breath, her beautiful dark eyes wide in shock. She was just trying to understand how things had escalated to that point that quickly… </p><p>Before she could do that, however, Tiffany grabbed her wrist and dragged her out. “It’s time for a soak. See you at the hot tub,”  Tiffany said as she dragged Umi away, who was too focused on fixing her shirt before stepping into the proper hotel area to resist Tiffany’s one-sided decision. </p><p>I just chuckled before calling the waitress and paying the bill — with a rather generous tip that was more than the bill itself. Considering the potential of the restaurant, I decided that keeping the staff happy with my presence might allow them to turn the other side into a similar situation. After all, we were going to spend quite a bit more time here. </p><p>I stopped by the reception to arrange a private hot tub and some refreshments before going to my room to change. When I arrived at a large, spacious section that was surrounded by walls at three sides but with an amazing view of the city, with a bubbling tub in the center, I slipped in, ready to wait for the girls. </p><p>Then, my phone rang once again, once again from Tiffany.  </p><p>But this time, a video call…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Coming to a decision about the mind-control was actually challenging. After coming to a conclusion that Sapphire wasn’t responsible for it, I was ready to leave it for a later date and focus on having fun with Sapphire, but the fact that it was targeting Sapphire as well for an unknown purpose, however, changed things. </p><p>I needed to discuss that with her, even at the expense of revealing a few cards, one being the proper usage of the Tether of the Underworld, the item that I had just haggled successfully. </p><p>Fortunately, I knew exactly how to keep her focused on the proper part, I thought even as I pulled back, leaving her trembling helplessly on her throne after the latest orgasm given by my aggressive tongue. </p><p>Before she could gather herself, I hovered above her once more, this time replacing my tongue with my shaft. “Are you ready to get properly fucked on your throne, Your Imperial Highness?” I said, even as I grabbed her breasts, squeezing hard. </p><p>“I need a minute-” she started, only for my lips to close around hers, silencing her with another kiss. Her hips rose automatically, giving me an excellent angle to slip inside. I used the opportunity, impaling aggressively, enough that her singular moan echoed in the room despite my lips desperately trying to silence her. </p><p>Then, the sound of flesh colliding joined the music as I impaled her mercilessly, my body weight pinning her underneath. It wasn’t a particularly inspired position, I might say, boring even, but sometimes, the moment was perfect enough spicing it further. </p><p>And a busty blonde Queen, being rammed repeatedly on her throne with my body pressed over hers, while her wrists still tied helplessly, certainly qualified. </p><p>As she built up toward another orgasm, my fingers squeezing her tits, it was the worst time to discuss something serious. Especially when she was too distracted even to use her Tantric abilities trying to convert me. Naturally, I chose that moment to actually mention the serious problem we were facing. </p><p>“Thank you for the Tether, by the way,” I said even as I rose a bit, lifting the pressure from her body, though I continued to slam into her, building up the pleasure to a new level. “It’s a very helpful item in my line of business, allowing me to decipher all kinds of wards. A true treasure.” </p><p>“I -” she started, only to fade into a moan as I sank even deeper into her, her tits dancing erotically with each push. “I’m glad,” she managed to complete. “Maybe you’re willing to discuss the Eternal Core.” </p><p>“Maybe,” I said. “But not before I make a demonstration of the tether,” I said even as I flared my magic, connecting to hers through the convenient connection of the tether. “It’s perfect for finding hidden wards, for example. Watch carefully,” I said as I carefully empowered the mind-controlling ward. </p><p>At first glance, it seemed like a horrible idea to reinforce a hostile ward, but dealing with the mind was a delicate thing. Tripling its power only made it weaker, making it much easier to detect its mental touch. Not to mention, it also contrasted its structure against the rest of the ward scheme, showing just how intricately it was woven into the rest of the wards, impossible to construct in just a day or two. </p><p>Or in a few minutes, making it impossible for her to suspect me. </p><p>“How can it be!” Sapphire gasped as she turned what remained from her attention to the wards, realizing the mental manipulation she had been suffering, her anger no less than mine. </p><p>Such beautiful anger was not to be wasted, I decided even as I pulled out while simultaneously casting a cleaning and lubrication spell on her puckered hole before pressing my shaft against her tightness, invading aggressively enough to add a dash of pain to her furious gasp. </p><p>“Well, Your Imperial Highness,” I said even as I pulled the tether just to remind her of the current situation even as I invaded her beautiful booty aggressively, enjoying the tightness as I slid even deeper. “It’s your throne room, you should be the one to understand what’s going on,” I said. </p><p>“Interesting ward, though,” I said even as I examined it, unable to prevent a frown from appearing on my face despite the spectacular pleasure I was experiencing. As I enhanced its power, the structure of the ward became much easier to analyze, but that only brought in more questions. </p><p>“How so?” she managed to ask even as I continued to invade her ass, stretching her for my pleasure. </p><p>“First of all, the construction of the ward was almost nothing I had seen before, and not just in terms of application,” I explained. “Even the most common basics of the ward are almost completely unfamiliar. The style of it reminds me of some of the ancient wards, but it’s just that, a limited familiarity. Let alone finding the caster, I have no idea which region they came from.” </p><p>“That whore Fernhand! She has to be the one responsible!” Sapphire stated, anger flaring on her face to mix into her pleasure, making her even sexier in the process. </p><p>“Impossible,” I said. “If she had ward masters in that capability, she would have taken your throne and sold you to a third-rate brothel already,” I answered, a reminder she clearly didn’t appreciate. But a slap on her plump bottom was enough to cut any argument she might have about that statement. “You’ll understand when I talk about its effects.” </p><p>“What are those,” she asked, but despite all her attempts to be serious, her body started to rebel under the rush of pleasure. Her back arched, displaying her beautiful tits to my hungry glare.   </p><p>“It’s pretty interesting. The first part is relatively straightforward, subtly reinforcing loyalty toward the throne for anyone that stands in front of the throne,” I said. She looked confused at first. I continued. “Toward the throne, whomever that might occupy the throne at that moment…”</p><p>Her eyes widened as she understood the implications of what I was talking about, though it might be about my shaft, going even deeper into her ass. I continued explaining. “There’s also the part that trying to make you lose your fascination for being the Queen, but it’s clearly not affecting you like it was supposed to. Your defenses must be amazing.” </p><p>“T-thanks,” she said, which would have been touching if it wasn’t for everything else that was going on. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t her defenses that were keeping the effects away. No, it was her tantric magic, or more accurately, the side effects of her magic, accidentally purging the effects by enflaming her desires, which included the desire for power. </p><p>It was amazing news. Not because I particularly cared just how much Sapphire was willing to defend her throne — it was her problem — but it was evidence that whomever responsible for casting didn’t know about Sapphire’s tantric abilities. </p><p>And that meant their information was limited. Always a convenient thing in a potential enemy. </p><p>“Who could have cast a ward if not the rebels?” Sapphire managed to ask, with rather an impressive difficulty with my shaft invading her ass repeatedly. </p><p>“Well, good question, but unfortunately, that information is not a part of the wide range of products I’m offering,” I answered even as I spanked her ass, enjoying the ripples. I didn’t bother to restrain myself too much as well, adding another layer to her pain. </p><p>“How much would it cost for you to get that information,” she offered. </p><p>“I’m not sure you know what you’re asking for, Your Imperial Majesty,” I said even as I pushed. “We’re talking about an active force that was strong enough to actually sneak into your throne room, set up a ward that went unnoticed for a long time, likely for years, and currently still active. It’s a bit different than selling the assets of a defeated dark lord, as you can imagine. Would you be willing to pay the cost?”</p><p>“What would it cost?” she answered between her moans. </p><p>“I can’t give you a price yet, not before I could identify who is responsible. The stronger they are, the more it would cost. But to a start, I would have a magical item, just as a retainer fee. the Shield of the Ether, for example.” </p><p>“That’s nonsense-” she started, only be interrupted by a moan as I twisted her nipple, forcing another moan. Then, before she could gather her breath, my lips landed over hers, silencing her with another heated kiss as I continued to drill mercilessly. </p><p>Her reaction to my offer was understandable. After all, unlike the previous items I had mentioned, the Shield of Ether was not one of the items that belonged to previous dark lords. Instead, it belonged to one of the most famous heroes in history, used to defend the Empire against dangerous threats. “That’s the deal, sweetheart,” I said as I rammed inside her repeatedly, waiting for her answer. </p><p>If it wasn’t she had already sacrificed too much to earn my cooperation, she would have definitely rejected that. “I accept, but only after you discover their identity,” she countered. </p><p>I pulled out suddenly, leaving her gasping, only to thrust inside her even more aggressively. “No deal, Your Imperial Majesty,” I said, once again using her title mockingly, not that under the circumstances, it could be called extreme. She whimpered. “That’s not how retainer works.” </p><p>“Can’t I offer something else?” she said. “It’ll be a disaster if it disappears. Money, other items. I’m willing to give three items from the vault instead of the Shield.” </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I said with a sudden shift in tone. “I want the shield not just because I want to make a lot of money,” I said. “The construction of the ward makes it clear that our mysterious enemy is really capable of using magic. Having a shield famous for resisting magical attacks even with overwhelming strength is the bare minimum I need to take the risk of spying on them. Or, you can trust your court mages, who failed to detect this for years…” </p><p>She fell silent — discounting the endless moans I continued to ram inside her. “You win,” she uttered a couple of minutes later, her voice tinged with pleasure. </p><p>The endless pleasures of sex were an excellent source of bargaining leverage. Now, all I needed to do was to decide what to do next… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The gasp Atia let out as I grabbed her waist, lifting her easily before throwing her on my shoulder, a move worthy of a barbarian carrying the rich noble he had just kidnapped. Atia’s delicious moan suggested that she wasn’t unaware of that particular connotation, nor she was against it.</p><p>However, the same acceptance didn’t apply to our location. She seemed to be shocked that, rather than ending up in a bedroom, we arrived at the bathroom, a huge room bigger than houses of the lower class nobles, every inch covered with high-quality marble, further enhanced by a generous application of gold, the only metal that wouldn’t corrode under the presence of constant humidity. </p><p>Despite her shock, however, she didn’t complain, because my hands weren’t idle as we walked toward the bathroom, a journey that took considerably long as I intentionally took a couple of wrong turns. My hands rested on her bottom, three of my fingers dancing at her entrance, teasing her while using the extensive range of tricks I had discovered during my mountain retreat, with the help of Lillian and Astrid. </p><p>I was betting that Atia was far inexperienced to be suspicious about the finesse displayed by a barbarian. And considering her endless moans, it seemed to be the case. </p><p>When I finally stepped into the shallow pool of warm water that functioned as the main bath —infused with many enchantments to keep the water clean regardless of the number of people inside— I removed Atia from my shoulder, deposing her on her feet in front of me, inches away. </p><p>The delicious dash of arousal that filled her beautiful blue eyes disappeared a bit when I decided to sit down into the pool rather than continuing to focus on her wet entrance like she had expected to. “Wash me,” I ordered, determined to enhance the sense of submission she was feeling toward me, especially since Olivia wasn’t here to help her if things started to get too absurd. </p><p>It was not an opportunity to miss. </p><p>She stayed silent for a moment, looking down in shock. “W-what?” she stammered. “You want me to wash you? Like a servant?” </p><p>“Are you having trouble hearing?” I countered casually. “Yes, I want you to wash me before I could take you properly like the bitch in the heat you are.” Her fists contorted tightly in anger, though her expression was filled with disbelief. Clearly, no one had ever talked to her like that, certainly not an uppity slave like me. </p><p>Then, I decided to move on to the final move. “Now,” I said, but it was much more than a simple word. It wasn’t magic, but for its effect, it well might be. It was a perfectly calibrated tone that worked wonders reaching a primal part of everyone that heard it, triggering their submissive instincts. </p><p>A naturally shy and hesitant person like Atia didn’t even have a chance, not with her raging arousal and confused mind, away from the safety net of her best friend —who was still distracted by the lips of another woman to realize the unique risk her friend was facing. Before Atia could properly react, she was already on her knees, her hand reaching toward a linen pouch used to clean the skin. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said, this time underlining my word with a caress of her head, the sudden positive reinforcement pushing her confusion even further. She stayed silent as she started dragging the pouch on my chest, her gentle touch sending shivers across my body. She wasn’t exactly cleaning, more using it as another opportunity to caress my muscles, but I wasn’t exactly against that. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I didn’t desire to mirror her actions, but I didn’t want to destroy the authority I had established over her. Instead, I stayed motionless as she slowly cleaned my chest and shoulders, even when she sat on my lap, close enough that her nether lips were rubbing against the side of my shaft with every move, her excitement growing by the second… </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel infected by her excitement. The perkiness of her movements as she danced on my lap, occasional fleeting glances she sent down like she was trying to make sure she wasn’t just dreaming, the way her body throbbed with sexy energy, driven her arousal out-of-control arousal… Even her magic was flowing with a weird alacrity, about to go out of control in excitement. </p><p>And the heavenly view of her body, her supple skin covered with water droplets, didn’t exactly help me stay away, even after the amazing orgy I had experienced, which, despite all its fun, was an inferior experience, because ultimately, it was under Olivia’s control. </p><p>Atia’s family background, with all the danger it implied, made the moment much tenser, and much more delicious as a result…  </p><p>Luckily, I knew exactly what she desired, and it was time to give her that. Even though, she had no idea what she was about to experience. </p><p>I didn’t bother asking her —she should have rejected my attention rather than rubbing against my shaft if she didn’t want to go forward— before grabbing her hips and lifting her, before skewering her with all the mercilessness that was fit to a gladiator slave. </p><p>Her lips parted open with great contrast to her eyes, firmly shut, and an earth-shattering cry exploded out of her mouth, my aggressive invasion enough to push her on the other side of the cliff, making her tremble in arousal. </p><p>Her explosive climax wasn’t a reason for me to stop, of course. I held her hips tightly and directed her to jump on my lap up and down, aggressively. </p><p>Nor the sudden rush of footsteps was a reason to stop me, even when it was followed by a shocked gasp from Olivia. “By the holy tits of Venus,” she whispered in shock as she looked at the moaning figure of her previously virgin best friend, being rammed repeatedly. </p><p>Admittedly, her shock was surprising. Like there was any other realistic outcome once I carried her friend out of the main party area on my shoulder. Maybe she had overestimated my fear toward the House Junia, or she underestimated my recklessness.  </p><p>Either way, I ignored the presence of the sexy redhead in favor of tightening my grasp further around Atia’s hips, the slapping our flesh filling the room despite the supposed barrier of the water, her blonde hair flailing wildly. </p><p>As I picked up the pace, it took a while for Atia to realize we had a voyeur in the room, but eventually, she did notice her. “Olivia,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Well, that was not a sight I was expecting,” Olivia murmured as her footsteps came closer, making Atia lean back like she wanted to escape from the closeness. “If I knew all that needed for you to change your mind about having fun was to invite a strapping gladiator, I would have done years ago.” </p><p>“It’s not like that,” Atia murmured as she leaned back even further, but considering she made no attempt to actually pull out, the range of her movement was significantly limited. </p><p>Olivia said nothing, just slid next to me to watch Atia’s expression, trying to look confident. Unfortunately for her, I was better at reading body language than she was at concealing it, so her attempts to hide her growing panic failed spectacularly. She was finally realizing that giving full access to a wild gladiator might not be the best idea… </p><p>Luckily for me, after things grew to such a point, she was too proud to actually admit her mistake. She maintained her silence as I continued to ram into her best friend, even making an occasional teasing comment to Atia, pushing her even further. </p><p>I wondered just how I needed to actually make her intervene. Too curious to prevent myself from testing, I slipped a finger into Atia’s tight hole, only for her to mix a pained cry between moans of joy. Atia’s shocked expression faded quickly, but Olivia’s lingered, destroying her attempts to look unaffected. </p><p>“It’s getting a bit much,” she said even as she grabbed my wrist, trying to pull out my finger, somehow, the anal invasion of her best friend, even by a finger, overwhelming her insistence of keeping things under control. Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of actually catering to her flimsy sense of control until things had reached this point. She tried to dislodge my finger, but failed spectacularly. </p><p>“Why don’t we ask your friend?” I countered, before turning to Atia. “Sweetie, tell me whether you want me to continue,” I said even as I pushed my finger deeper, which she reacted with another cry with hints of pain, but also with overwhelming pleasure. </p><p>Atia stayed silent, too shy to actually answer —but certainly not shy enough to shake her hips with gusto as I pushed inside her repeatedly— so I decided to push her a bit more. “I think silence means you’re unhappy with it,” I commented, even as I pulled out my finger. </p><p>“No,” she gasped reflexively. She seemed to be shocked in her own response, a mood that intensified even further as she made eye contact with Olivia. “No,” she gasped, but this time, the reason was her shame. She buried her face to my neck to hide her expression, her hips not missing a beat. </p><p>I slipped a second finger into her tight hole to reward her, even as I turned to Olivia with a smug expression. “She doesn’t seem to mind it as much as you do,” I said mockingly, enjoying her scandalized expression. </p><p>Since Olivia was too shocked to say anything, and Atia was busy hiding her face, I focused on bringing Atia another climax. I slid one hand to the small of her back, pushing her even deeper with each repeat, the other hand busy fingering her tight ass. </p><p>Under the combined assault —not to mention the scandalizing presence of her friend— it didn’t take long for the inexperienced Atia to taste another climax, this time even more explosive. Her moans rose unbidden as she raised her head, the presence of her friend forgotten under the rush overwhelming rush of pleasure. </p><p>As her orgasm subsided, she was already tethering on the edge of unconsciousness, so it was easy for me to add a weak flare of magic to push her toward the other end of the line that separated the awareness from unconsciousness. She collapsed against my chest, her breathing calm. </p><p>I gently grabbed her waist and put her on the edge of the pool, before turning my attention to Olivia, examining the conflicted expression of shock and arousal on her face. </p><p>“It’s finally your turn, mistress,” I said —with a mocking tone on the last word— even as moved in front of her, my muscular arms on both sides of her to prevent any attempt of escaping, my bulky chest creating an overwhelming sight. </p><p>The real fun of the evening was about to begin… </p>",

    "content": "<p>At times like these, I was glad for my intelligence and perception more than anything, allowing me to assess and process the situation with an unmatched speed. I let a thin layer of my mana spread, reinforced by the light elemental, allowing me to detect everything around. </p><p>[-23 Mana]</p><p>As the results of the spell reached me a fraction of a second later, my frown did the impossible and got even deeper. The situation was even direr than I had expected. The death knight wasn’t the only one that was attacking. No, he had two of his buddies hiding in a distance, hidden behind several layers of wards —boy, wasn’t I glad for my enhanced detection capabilities— while an impressive number of undead was currently moving away from the city, chasing a huge group of people. </p><p>Interestingly, however, the stronger undead, bone dragons, enhanced skeleton warriors, and the majority of the necromancers, still stuck around, despite the fact that, if they had followed the escaping horde of civilians, they could have easily destroyed them. And even more interesting, their positioning and their even distribution suggested that they were ready for an attack from outside. </p><p>That answered one question. It was a trap for me. A trap that was designed to take me at my best, with a healthy margin of error. </p><p>It was a good trap, I had to admit. With the frequency I had been using my elemental mount, it wasn’t entirely shocking for them to discover that trick. With that, the plan was clear. Have the girls captured, on the edge of death, forcing me to act immediately. I doubted that they were aware that I would feel the attack on the girls —as even for me, that was a surprise— but with the number of spies, it wasn’t difficult to convey. </p><p>And with most of the necromancers hurriedly setting up a complicated ward to defend the city from the attackers, half-completed, suggested that they expected me to attack from the outside. It was comparable to the trick they had used against Titania. </p><p>Necromancers were not a particularly creative sort. </p><p>Unfortunately, lacking in creativity didn’t mean lacking in deadliness, especially when I was far too close to death than I was supposed to. </p><p>The only thing that worked in my favor was that they were expecting me to arrive from outside, not to be already inside, an advantage I needed to use to my benefit if I had any chance of surviving. </p><p>Luckily, Cornelia’s latest hopeless flame wall gave me the excuse I needed. Just as the death knight pushed through the flaming wall, I cast another spell, this time creating a thick wall of flame behind the death knight, to prevent it from escaping, and to prevent others from peering inside.  </p><p>[-319 Mana]</p><p>Spending a huge chunk of my precious mana to keep a death knight together with me, rather than trying to push him away wasn’t exactly the safest move, but I needed him to be on the same side. Then, just as it could swing its sword to Cornelia, I dashed forward, sliding next to her —and stealing a dagger from her belt as I passed her— before using it to parry the attack of the death knight. My fingers were fast enough to hide that move from both Cornelia, and the opposing death knight.</p><p>I parried the attack successfully, and even my weapon stayed intact, but only because the swing of the death knight was much weaker, confirming my earlier assumption. They were trying to capture the girls alive as bait. </p><p>“Caesar,” gasped Cornelia even as I pushed forward, leveraging the unbalanced swing of the death knight, charging the dagger with the flame energy as I did so, punishing him with a debilitating wound on its right arm, cutting several tendons, and leaving a smoldering wound behind that started to spread to the rest of the body, though it affected its fighting capability only marginally.</p><p>High-level undead wasn’t particularly affected by the condition of their body, as long as the spell that animated them was stable. They weren’t particularly resistant to fire, but not being resistant and being vulnerable were two different deals. If I delivered the same attack with life energy or light energy, I would have probably wounded it significantly, if not outright killed it. </p><p>Pity that I couldn’t use anything but fire magic to enhance the attack.  </p><p>“Take care of Helga,” I said to Cornelia even as I swung the dagger, hoping to deliver another deadly wound before it could react. Unfortunately, it reacted faster than I expected. I still left another wound, but unfortunately, it was weaker than I expected. </p><p>Facing a death knight was a difficult task. I had previously slain five of them together, of course, not to mention that I had done that when I was weaker, but only with exploding an impressive number of magical traps that were initially designed to destroy a large swathe of the undead army. </p><p>Currently, I didn’t even have underwear. </p><p>I swung my dagger again even as the flame forced into its structure, threatening to destroy it completely. The death knight dodged, but surprisingly, rather than attacking me directly, it pulled back, even it put it dangerously close to the wall of flame. </p><p>I realized the reason a second later, barely holding back a burst of laughter. It was scared of the pieces of aether that were still stuck on my skin, evaporating slowly —though not damaging, as, without the dangerous flow, I was able to use just a simple arcana spell to push them away. </p><p>Death knights were excellent warriors, but they were not experts of magic. </p><p>And that fact was underlined further by a tendril of arcana that appeared through it, mixed with necrotic energy, but still carrying the basic structure of a communication spell. Interfering with it without him being aware was almost trivial. It pulled to a defensive stance as it waited for an answer.  </p><p>Pity that giving a fake response was much harder than actually blocking it. Giving it false information would </p><p>[-7 Mana]</p><p>Since each second meant more mana for me, I decided to allow its defensive stance. “So, how does it feel to fight someone in your own size,” I commented lazily even as I swung my dagger once more. He parried, putting my dagger dangerously close to shattering. </p><p>The death knight didn’t answer, lacking the personality to actually enter into a debate. They were sapient and acted independently from their creator, but their personality was completely erased. </p><p>I continued to attack it, but allowed it to dodge. Even as it did so, I started infusing a subtle structure of life energy into the dagger, mixing it with the fire energy, enchanting the dagger in real-time. </p><p>Craft was turning out to be more useful than I expected. </p><p>[-149 Mana]</p><p>It wasn’t a perfect dagger, of course. It would be a miracle if it could reach double-digit hits, but that was more than enough to kill the death knight, as long as I channeled life energy through it generously. </p><p>However, doing so would drain my already limited reserves even further. Moreover, hiding the destruction of a death knight wasn’t the same as blocking a simple message spell. Not only I had to block the flare of necrotic energy freed from keeping it mobile, which required an investment of mana I wasn’t prepared to invest, but also I needed to copy the connection with Zokras to fake it. </p><p>So, I let the death knight stay defensive as I made a few casual attacks, weak enough not to hurt the integrity of my newly-crafted weapon, but strong enough not to make the death knight realize I was the one playing for time. </p><p>I liked that, especially with every second helping me regenerate mana. With three instances of the mana regeneration active, my regeneration was very significant. </p><p>“So, where is your boss,” I said. “I’m really bored to wait for him to appear,” I commented even as I waved my hand, sending a line of healing energy toward Helga, too weak to be noticed through the interference of the flame wall, but enough to stabilize her and wake her up. </p><p>[-45 Mana]</p><p>The girls started talking heatedly behind me, but I focused on the death knights, stretching my subterfuge to the limits to give the impression that I was very comfortable with the current balance of the situation. With all the mana I spent to create the defensive wall and other tricks, my mana was even lower than when I appeared. And since I appeared, barely fifteen seconds had passed. </p><p>[Mana: 1083  / 7595]</p><p>Each second was precious. </p><p>Unfortunately, while the death knights lacked emotions, that didn’t make them stupid. They still had an impressive combat intelligence, and the only reason I was able to fool it into inactivity for about fifteen seconds was my extremely complicated set of abilities, forcing him to think that they were currently suffering through a counter-ambush. </p><p>Unfortunately, that assumption didn’t mean it would stay obediently defensive and wait for me to recover. It soon realized that its magical communication efforts didn’t reach their target, and rushed toward me with a furious assault. </p><p>It was a feint, of course. Despite its skills, I was able to read it, and with some decent effort, I could have prevented it from pulling back. But why should I stop it when he was willing to push through a wall of crackling magical flame to warn his allies, especially when they were probably already getting suspicious. </p><p>The death knight attacked me, forcing me to raise my dagger to parry, though I made sure to react a touch too slow when he suddenly threw himself back into the fire, pushing through despite the damage it would receive. </p><p>Admittedly, the wall of fire looked more impressive compared to its damage, allowing the death knight to retreat through the fire with little damage. </p><p>Or, more accurately, it would have been the case, if I hadn’t chosen that moment to inject some light-natured mana into the flames, letting out a chaotic explosion. </p><p>[-419 Mana]</p><p>The flames turned white, their height rose several times, expanding both inward and outward dangerously. I could still feel the death knight escaping through the fires, though not without significant damage. And more importantly, perfectly primed to deliver some misleading information to the rest of the army. </p><p>The flames expanded both inward and outward as the additional light forced it to consume all the infused mana immediately, forcing me to dash back next to Cornelia and Helga, establishing a strong shield to protect them from the backlash of the flames, but I get signed during the retreat, depleting my already limited HP even further. </p><p>[-281 HP]</p><p>[-243 Mana]</p><p>“So, how are you girls since our last meeting?” I said with an intentional levity, hoping to prevent them from panicking, even as my mind was on how to save myself from the growing undead base around me, my only advantage being the orientation of the defenses, facing outward rather than inward. Considering my mana was almost completely depleted, it wasn’t exactly a huge advantage. </p><p>And I still didn’t know the location of Zokras the Eternal, whether he was hoping to use the trap to kill me, or hoping to take down Titania in my absence…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 489893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 1898  / 6324\tMana: 513  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>I needed to make a decision, and I needed to make it fast, because the panic I could feel from Cornelia and Helga was getting more and more intense with each second. The problem, I didn’t even know whether they were being targeted intentionally to pull me away, or that it was just another part of the undead strategy trying to shatter the towns around Silver Spires, and they were being targeted accidentally. </p><p>Ultimately, however, it didn’t matter much. I could either summon an air elemental and dash away, hoping to arrive in time, but leaving Titania alone and vulnerable, or I would sacrifice the girls. Each option was worse than the other… </p><p>Or do I, I thought, suddenly remembering a particular unique perk I had received, the one I hadn’t dared to experiment with because of the side effects of the Empowerment perk I had observed when trying to enhance Cornelia’s power. </p><p>Teleportation. </p><p>I couldn’t help but touch that perk, testing yet not activating. The presence of Helga and Cornelia intensified, like they were just a step away, but it was a dangerous step. </p><p>What was a touch of danger to face when it came to protecting my lovers? </p><p>That still left one problem, however. The defense of the town with Titania. “Stop acting, and retreat next to Marianne, and be ready to protect yourself,” I ordered Titania immediately as I started putting together a strategy that I hoped would be useful, at least enough to delay them a moment. “There’s an emergency and I’ll be going away in seconds.” </p><p>With a flick of my hand, a pair of wings appeared on my back, the kind that I based on the looks of the headmistress, but made from air, but surrounded by a thick layer of light. Another layer of light appeared above my skin, radiating as bright as the sun. </p><p>[-149 Mana]</p><p>“Enough!” I commanded, the full weight of my charisma behind my words, sufficient even to stagger the actual mindless undead for a moment. </p><p>That moment was all I needed for me to mold enough mana to meld my biomancy-based life energy with light magic, essentially creating the same unique energy I had used to detect the presence of the undead, only different in intensity, the same way candlelight would compare to a roaring forest fire, threatening to devour everything in its path. </p><p>[-4293 Mana]</p><p>I breathed hard even as the spell left my hands as a cone, one targeting the sky, toward the large division of bone dragons, the other aiming down, decimating the hidden undead army underground, trying to reach the town in a surprise attack, both decimated completely, though not without leaving me breathing in exhaustion. Even with my reserves, spending over four thousand mana in one spell was not a simple thing. </p><p>The posturing wasn’t completely useless, however, as I immediately connected the soul pieces that occurred after the destruction, funneling them toward Titania. Each barely gave her a few points of experience at maximum, but with the numbers, the army was displaying, they still helped her to cover a significant distance toward the next level. </p><p>Sometimes, it was easier to catch the opportunities than trying to hunt them. </p><p>“Zokras, I’m getting bored of your pathetic attempts. You’re barely fit to fight against my minions, but I’ll give you more respect more than you deserve and kill you with my own hands!” I shouted, my magically-enhanced voice echoing toward the plains. </p><p>That posturing was not pointless. Even as I shouted, I cast another spell, connecting the light wings and armor I was using to disguise myself so that it continued to glow in the sky even without my presence. </p><p>[-93 Mana] </p><p>“I’ll be leaving now, be careful,” I said to Titania through another magical message, before taking a deep breath and activating my teleport perk… </p><p>[-319 Mana]</p><p>And just like that, the world disappeared completely. </p><p>More accurately, I found myself out of the world, swimming in some kind of endless aether ocean, which was what mana was in its natural state. Or more accurately, the energy that we converted into mana through processing with our soul space. </p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t something that could be described as safe. Not even close. </p><p>[-251 HP]</p><p>The pain radiated as the surface of my skin tried to disintegrate, something that was forcibly arrested with my power, despite my own impressive power trying to push the aether away. I had no doubt that, if I tried to do that ten levels ago, I would have disintegrated in an instant… </p><p>Even now, I barely had seconds with aether flowing wilder than the worst ocean storm, trying to disintegrate my being completely, both in body and in the soul. </p><p>[-217 HP]</p><p>I tried to heal myself reflexively, only for my mana to flew away hopelessly, dragged by the aether flow. With the chaotic flow, it was impossible to properly shape the mana outside my body. </p><p>[-192 Mana] </p><p>[-288 HP]</p><p>Luckily, the teleportation perk was buried safely into my soul space, allowing me to still operate that safely, without the interference of the aether storm. Without that factor, I would have died completely. </p><p>I ignored the pain —which was certainly not a simple achievement with all of my skin trying to disintegrate simultaneously— as I tried to focus on the direction. My stomach started to churn, because the distance wasn’t exactly a linear vector in aether space I found myself in. I could feel the distance getting shorter and longer with each second, and not by small percentages. No, what might be inches away one second might get a thousand miles away the next… </p><p>[-319 HP]</p><p>I did notice one interesting thing, however. The chaotic distance was only happening in a limited area, which was surrounded by a complicated energy shield that was hard even to properly understand. It was pushing back and forth, fluctuating, but I was sure that one touch was enough to earn a deadly backlash from it. </p><p>[-217 HP]</p><p>No matter how fascinating such a structure was, however, I didn’t have time to focus on that. Literally, not when I had less than ten seconds to save myself from the dangerous situation I found myself in. And to do that, I needed to find my way. </p><p>Luckily, even from the chaotic dimension I found myself in, I could feel the Companion nodes of the girls, Cornelia’s and Helga’s nodes particularly bright, both due to their strength and the distress that was radiating from them. </p><p>[-241 HP]</p><p>However, detecting them was one thing, aiming toward them without overshooting was another thing. Even knowing that the distance between in the material world was limited, actually targeting them was difficult. Because, the distance between the different points wasn’t just shuffling in terms of linear distance, but also in terms of angular combination. </p><p>A second passed, my mind filled with formula after formula, trying to make sense of the chaos. </p><p>[-273 HP]</p><p>Then another… </p><p>[-216 HP]</p><p>And another… </p><p>[-230 HP]</p><p>And another… </p><p>Then, either I managed to make a subconscious connection about the formula thanks to my monumental intelligence, or I happened to be extremely lucky, and I managed to get a momentary understanding of the distance between me and the girls. </p><p>I pushed myself toward it hopelessly. I didn’t know whether it would work, or whether I would somehow find myself merged with a wall or something else. But considering my life was literally counted in seconds if I stayed in the aether dimension, it wasn’t a hard choice to make. </p><p>Covering the great distance between me and the girls took less than a blink, but the same didn’t apply to the physical cost of actually traveling through the aether. Even as I was standing still —or at least, what I could describe as standing still, which didn’t have a direct equivalent in the surreal location I was occupying— was sufficiently damaging, and it was even worse when moving —for a warped definition of it— toward the unintentional beacon created by Cornelia and Helga. </p><p>[-1893 HP]</p><p>[-1395 Mana]</p><p>The two notification that popped in my sight wasn’t exactly helping me to feel more confident, but as I pushed through the barrier that separated Aether dimension and the material plane, it was a cost that I paid willingly. </p><p>Even if it left me very drained. </p><p>[HP: 2179  / 6324]\t</p><p>[Mana: 1294 / 7595]</p><p>My status was rather accurate, considering I was completely naked if one discounted the deadly glow of the chaotic energy still trying to worm into what remained from my skin, the touch of the wind enough to trigger agonizing pain on nerves, exposed into the air. The complete loss of my weapons, auxiliary items, and clothes was another problem. </p><p>Still, my status didn’t scare me. After all, I barely needed several minutes to actually put myself together. </p><p>But, then, I managed to get a glimpse of my surroundings. The first thing that caught my attention was the huge fireball that surrounded us, radiating from the familiar figure of Cornelia, her robe in tethers. I looked around to find Helga, only to find her collapsed on the floor, several feet behind me, unconscious and bleeding, not too away from actual death. </p><p>Around us, there were only smoldering ruins, but it wasn’t dangerous. </p><p>Certainly not compared to the familiar figure of the death knight, trying to push through the flames, forcing Cornelia to retreat despite her aggressive casting, forcing her to deplete the last of her mana. Through our connection, I could feel her inches away from collapsing. </p><p>Apparently, I arrived just in time. </p><p>Now, all I needed was to survive a death knight —maybe even more, as I was yet to use detection— with no weapons, a lot of wounds,  and barely a sixth of my mana, while trying to keep two girls, one unconscious, the other inches away from the same state. </p><p>Definitely trivial.</p><p>Right?  </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 489893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 2179  / 6324\tMana: 1342  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>“T-that’s ridiculous,” Sarah stammered, frozen in shock and desire even as I slipped inside her friend, her gaze pointing down, exploring the beautiful sight of Carrie. </p><p>Not that Carrie was in a better condition. The shock in her eyes told that finally, she had realized the ridiculousness of her competitiveness, but when she opened her mouth, the only thing that escaped was an endless procession of moans. </p><p>It didn’t help her to control herself when I put my hand on her belly, rubbing back and forth, each repeat bringing my fingers closer to her breasts, dangling furiously with every repeat. “What - what are you doing?” Sarah managed to stammer. </p><p>“You’re an adult as well, sweetie. I sincerely hope that I don’t need to explain what we’re doing,” I said even my hands completed their climb and landed on Carrie’s breasts. Carrie looked ready to interject, but I didn’t want her speaking. Luckily, after all the times we spent together, I knew exactly how to silence her. I cupped her breasts, my fingers dancing over aggressively, triggering every single sensitive spot I had discovered during our fun times. </p><p>Carrie’s moans turned overwhelming as her body betrayed her. Her legs clamped around my waist reflexively, a habit she had developed through our enjoyable times together, lost in pleasure. </p><p>Sarah didn’t share her expression. “You-you know what I mean,” she stammered as she shuffled uncomfortably. Her tone started to get harsher, but the fact that she was still sitting while Carrie’s head resting on her lap showed her conviction wasn’t particularly strong. </p><p>“I do, but teasing you is fun,” I admitted readily, making her blush. “You’re much cuter when you’re not forcing yourself to look stern.” </p><p>“I’m not-” she stammered before stopping herself, smart enough to realize it was hardly the place to discuss her general attitude, especially with Carrie’s moans running constant interference. “It’s not the point, tell me what is going on!” she said, this time managing to exert her usual stern attitude much more successfully. </p><p>Pity that it was completely useless. </p><p>After all, it wasn’t just about her expression but her general attitude. And, being naked, her friend’s wild blonde hair only thing to cover her core as she lay on her lap, which was not exactly the best position to enable a strong aura. </p><p>“Well, Carrie didn’t appreciate your constant coddling, treating her like a helpless virgin that needs your constant help even to talk to a boy, so she decided to show her abilities more directly.” </p><p>That was enough to make Sarah stricken. She looked down in shock and no small amount of disappointment. Carrie clearly wanted to say something but I silenced her by a strategic push inside her even deeper than my usual pattern, temporarily disabling her mouth with her moans. “So, this is just a sick game…” Sarah murmured, her mind immediately jumping the victim role. </p><p>“Not so fast, sweetheart,” I said even as I flicked her nose, killing her pity party quite effectively. “That was the initial plan, but when you decided to do your best to take her man away, Carrie decided to fight back.” </p><p>Reminding her the aggressive role she had taken at the beginning of the night worked wonders to destroy the platform she was betting to make herself a victim. “But…” she tried to say something, but when I let her speak, it faded. </p><p>“Who was the one who decided to flirt with me in the pool, who decided to use a board game as an excuse to show off?” I asked rapidly, reminding her of the decisions that put her into the condition, all to prove that she was superior to her best friend in terms of seduction?” </p><p>“But…” she repeated, once again fading in shock, enough for her to momentarily ignore the fact that Carrie was between us, redefining the meaning of pleasure. “Still, it’s too much,” she murmured in shock. </p><p>“I see, so you’re drawing the line to getting fingered by someone your best friend has a crush on when the said best friend was still under the blanket, but anything else is too much,” I answered with a wide grin even as she blushed, realizing the ridiculousness of her argument. “Think about it a moment,” I said even as I turned my attention back to Carrie, who was starting to get neglected even with the rather spectacular fucking I was giving her.</p><p>“So, what do you think, Carrie,” I said even as I caressed her satin skin, enjoying the way her heart drummed furiously under my control. “Do you think Sarah is right, that we somehow tricked her into getting into the blanket with us?” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she said, throwing a confused glance at Sarah, who still looked overwhelmed under the combined weight of the naughty situation and the responsibility for the actions that led her here. </p><p>“I need to calm down,” Sarah murmured suddenly as she stood up, though she didn’t neglect to replace her thighs with a pillow, and dashed outside. It was an interesting choice, but when I heard the splash from the pool, I understood her reasoning. “Should we follow her,” Carrie managed to ask, between moans considering I didn’t once slow down my pace. </p><p>Once again, I was so happy with her shyness. Once broken, Carrie had no intention of drawing a new line, more than happy to follow my lead, distracted by the pleasure. </p><p>“No, let’s give her a moment to calm down, she looked like she needed it,” I said, before hitting her with another seductive smirk. “Also, I don’t want to stop, just as you’re nearing another climax. It’s rude to do stop halfway. As a gentleman, I can’t bear such a sin.” </p><p>“Jerk,” she said as she slapped my shoulder, but the way she continued to tighten her legs around my waist told me that she didn’t really have a problem with my smug teasing.</p><p>I loved the way she blushed whenever I teased her, something that was effective even after being impaled repeatedly while resting on the lap of her naked best friend. It made her satin skin glow pinkishly, turning her beauty into an irresistible aura. </p><p>I decided to push that teasing to a completely new level. “So, any idea about what to do with Sarah. Should we let her calm down and act as nothing had happened, or should we go out and seduce her for some proper fun for three?” </p><p>“W-what?” she murmured, staring in confusion, which then turned into a stammering shock the moment she understood what I was suggesting. She opened her mouth, and from her sudden tenseness, I realized the answer was going to be negative. </p><p>Not an answer I wanted to hear, so, I leaned down to capture her lips in a searing kiss, stopping her words excellently, giving her some time to consider before she committed to an answer. And if the way I silenced her pushed her even deeper into the land of pleasure, adding some more votes to the losing side, I wasn’t inclined to admit that. </p><p>And I doubted that Carrie cared too much about the way I used that trick, not when she was busy moaning into my mouth, her hips rocking wildly. </p><p>Normally, at this point, I would have slowed down, caressing and teasing her until she begged for a release, maybe even taking a break to receive a delicious massage from her tits in between while my fingers explored every inch of her soft skin again and again. </p><p>Unfortunately, we had a ticking time bomb in the form of a confused brunette, and I didn’t want to give her too much time, afraid of her reaction once she stayed away too long and got cold feet. Which meant that I needed to be quick, both in terms of making Carrie climax and getting the answer I wanted from her, enabling my ambition to increase the number of my nerdy friends with benefits from one to two. </p><p>Maybe even more, I suddenly thought as I remembered their lively redheaded friend in particular. </p><p>“Any decision yet, Princess,” I asked even as I tapped her legs, making her unwrap them in reflex, something we had developed after a few dangerous close calls. But this time, rather than pulling out directly, I grabbed her legs and parted them wide, using the angle to invade her depths even more aggressively. </p><p>Once again, she was too busy moaning to answer me, but I was happy with the delay, enjoying the opportunity to test the depths of her entrance, her swollen lips wrapping tightly around my girth. </p><p>Since an answer was not forthcoming, I leaned forward, which not only helped me to push even deeper, but also bury my face between her spectacular breasts, enjoying its expanse with aggressive kisses and occasional bites, leveraging her sensitivity to push her to a spectacular climax. </p><p>Her soft hands grabbed my shoulders, pulling me tighter into her bosom even as her body started to clench with the familiar signs of a climax. </p><p>I loved the way she reacted just before the climax hit. She tightened soon after, pushing me dangerously close to a climax of my own as well. Though, after everything that happened under the blanket, it was a miracle that I managed to hold that long. As she let out a loud string of satisfied cries, marketing my prowess to Sarah in the process, I pulled out, spraying her beautiful bosom with my seed. </p><p>“So,” I said, talking with a soft tone even as she was hit by the aftermath of her climax, making it extremely hard for her to disagree with the source of that euphoria. “Should we leave Sarah alone outside, or should we go out and teach her the meaning of pleasure,” I murmured even as I caressed her cheek. </p><p>“I … I don’t know,” she murmured cutely even as her body continued to shake. </p><p>“How about a compromise,” I said with a kind smile, like I was about to do a favor. “Why don’t you just stay here and rest while I go to the pool and have a talk with her. You can watch from the window, and intervene if you feel uncomfortable,” I added, pointing at a small, concealed window with a prime view of the pool, but small enough that it wouldn’t be noticed back from the pool as long as the lights were closed. </p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured noncommittally, which was all the permission I needed. I knew that once she started watching, she would never take radical action to stop what was going on. If she could, things wouldn’t have reached such a point. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured as I kissed her pouty lips for one last time before standing up. “Don’t forget to keep your voice down, we don’t want to startle Sarah,” I said even as I walked toward the pool. Carrie looked confused, too deep in the land of pleasure to understand the significance of my words. </p><p>She would understand soon enough… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Deciding on the next step was significantly more difficult than I had been expecting, especially with the constant tendrils of subtle mind control trying to invade my mind as I stood in front of the throne, triggering my anger significantly. And since I was strongly suspecting that Sapphire was not responsible for the existence of the ward, examining it was a critical thing, if only to know who deserved the dangerous explosion of the fury I was barely holding back. </p><p>Luckily, that didn’t mean I needed to neglect Sapphire in the process. </p><p>Thanks to my newest toy, the Tether of the Underworld. </p><p>For the rest of the night, I chose to neglect the Blade of Shadows —a thin, elegant, pure black blade adorned with black diamonds— letting it hang on my waist after sending a stream of magic through it to make sure it was the genuine article, and not a well-made copy. It took a moment for me to be satisfied with the results, and then I turned my attention to the Tether of the Underworld. </p><p>Even a glance was enough to tell the reason for its relative lack of fame among the great items that had been made famous by the Dark Lords that carried them. Unlike many such items, it was completely unassuming, barely to be distinguished by a thick piece of silk ribbon —though luckily, it was also pure black, giving a bit more gravitas. It was so simple that, for the first part of its reign, the opponents assumed it to be a simple part of its robes, according to the historical records. </p><p>Funnily enough, the name came from the second half, when people started to realize the lich was able to raise an army of zombies alone, far above what was assumed to be handled by a single necromancer, even one that abandoned its own mortality. Therefore, the name of Underworld was linked with the Tether forevermore. Unfortunately, when his rivals finally took him down, they were disappointed to realize that it was just a tool to increase the ease of setting up wards, and lich was using genius-level wards to handle armies of zombies centrally. </p><p>That technique was lost with the death of the lich, and Tether had become a relatively unimportant trophy in the hands of the next Dark Lord —who was a swordsman, therefore failing to understand the true implications of the tether— and after a few battles, it fell in the hands of the Empire, moving from one trophy room to another. </p><p>Shortsighted fools, I murmured even as wrapped the Tether around my left forearm before channeling my magic through its length, enjoying the enhanced clarity of perception. I didn’t aim at the mind control ward immediately, of course. No, I first targeted the defensive wards of the room, much bulkier by their nature, to get used to handling the item. </p><p>I didn’t want to destroy the subtle mind control ward by accident. It was my only clue to the target of my fury… </p><p>Luckily, multitasking wasn’t something outside my skill level. Even as I used my magic repeatedly on the defensive wards of the room to inspect their structure, I turned my real attention to the beautiful specimen of a woman in front of me. With her blonde flowing hair, blue eyes, and soft face, she was just as beautiful. </p><p>But the same couldn’t be said for the impassive dress she was wearing, hiding her beautiful curves in an attempt to enhance her authority. It was not something to be allowed, I thought even as closed the distance between us, standing in front of her as she sat on her throne. </p><p>“Our deal is complete, but how about a little fun before I leave,” I said as she shivered. My hands were already on the neck of her dress before she could get a word edgewise, and pulled hard, ripping it off with all the aggression of a barbarian invader who managed to fight its way to the throne room. </p><p>As her dress turned into scraps, her underwear was revealed. “Someone was prepared,” I said mockingly even as examined her corset and panties, both pure white, but that was the extent of their purity. The corset only had a modest cleavage, but that hardly mattered when it was completely made from lace, with big gaps across its surface to reveal most of her skin to my eyes. Her panties were a little better, barely more than a small piece of cloth connected by a thin string, struggling to contain her plump ass. </p><p>“You’re rather predictable in that aspect,” Sapphire said with a surprising nobility as she raised her head smugly, her tiara still shining on her head. After saying that, she raised her hand, about to remove the tiara from her head. </p><p>Only to be stopped by my fingers wrapping around her wrist. “No, keep it. Tonight, I want to fuck the Queen.”</p><p>Her expression of disagreement suggested that she didn’t agree with that, indicating that she was more comfortable with whoring herself in her dancer identity. Too bad for her that I had no intention of actually allowing that. </p><p>I grabbed her other wrist as well before pinning her arms against the throne, the silver and gold supplementing her own white and golden visage quite a bit. Her expression trembled under my dark arousal, like it was going to be our first time. </p><p>“W-wouldn’t you want me to serve you properly?” she whispered, the stammer in her tone too natural to be an act.  </p><p>“Oh, dear. You’re the Queen. It would be extremely rude to serve me. Let me serve you instead.” However, my tone, dark and domineering, didn’t agree with the meaning of my words. Nor my following action, pushing forward to capture her lips in an invading kiss, silencing her arguments with the strength of my tongue.</p><p>It was a special moment, I thought, taking the Queen of the Empire in the center of the power, on her own throne, still wearing her crown. </p><p>As I annexed her lips, however, she was surprisingly hesitant. Almost shy, to a degree that she never had when we were in the club. As if the crown in her head was forcing her to act much more reservedly. </p><p>It was a wonder what a change of environment could achieve. </p><p>When I finally pulled back, she was gasping for breath desperately, her pretty lips tantalizingly bruised with my aggressive kiss. “Such a lovely sight,” I murmured even as I leaned forward once more, my hands still around her wrists to pin her against her throne, but this time, my target was not her lips. </p><p>No, that honor went to her beautiful neck. I pressed my lips against her soft skin, kissing hard enough to leave a bright mark that would no doubt turn into a spectacular hickey without some healing magic. Her helpless moans, however, suggested that she wasn’t particularly broken up about the roughness of the treatment. </p><p>As I moved lower, her moans intensified further. </p><p>I could have easily destroyed her corset, its lacy texture was far too soft to actually create a barrier, but pulling it down roughly with my teeth, just ripping it enough to reveal one of her delicious nipples was a much better option. Ripped clothing fitted the theme much better nakedness, after all. </p><p>Her moans rose unbidden as my lips clasped around her nipple for a while, but I didn’t stay around there for long, Not when her legs widened reflexively, showing her out-of-control wetness. It was such a pity to neglect that, I decided. </p><p>Serving a woman between her legs as she sat on a throne was supposed to be an extremely subservient act, at least at first glance. That was, unless, you were a Dark Lord with great experience in reversing such situations. </p><p>I started by putting her wrists together in front of her, the Tether flying with a flick of my hand, its flight controlled magically. It wrapped around her forearms, the other part still connected with my wrist, rendering her hands useless while leaving my hands free, and used that freedom to grab her thighs, parting her legs even further. </p><p>However, as much as I enjoyed tying her up, the convenient availability of the Tether wasn’t the only reason I used that to tie her hands. No, I used that, because it gave me a convenient excuse to use my magic to check her connection with the wards undetected. Even if she did, I could use the excuse of trying to get used to a new item. </p><p>Not that she was in the mood of noticing that, not when her full attention was grabbed by the way I ripped off her panties before leaning forward and brushing her entrance with my tongue, giving myself an extended taste of her wetness. She just moaned as my tongue danced around her knob, making her suffer under a rush of pleasure. </p><p>That wasn’t all I did, of course. My tongue moved almost automatically as I teased her, while my mind was focused on channeling my magic stealthily, a task that was made much easier as she got distracted by her enhanced pleasure. She was far too occupied with her own body to notice my magical interference.</p><p>With that, I traced her magic, to understand which wards were under her direct control, even as I put a finger at her entrance, slipping inside even as my tongue danced around her knob mercilessly, invading her body with waves of pleasure. Her moans intensified as I slipped my finger into her wetness, followed quickly by a second one soon after, adding a shocked yelp to her song consisted entirely of moans. </p><p>Her back arched, pushing her beautiful tits up as she buried herself into her throne, her symbol of power irrevocably stained with her submission as she started shaking with pleasure. </p><p>As much as I enjoyed the way she tightened around my fingers, I didn’t want to miss the opportunity. As her control over her own magic loosened further, I increased my observation range… </p><p>Only to freeze when I noticed the connection between her and the mind control ward. I almost lashed out in a painful manner, ready to teach her the cost of daring to manipulate me, but surprised by the connection. </p><p>I would have probably reacted directly if it wasn’t for the Tether of the Underworld, allowing me to analyze the connection between her and the ward, quickly, before my anger reached the point of eruption.</p><p>How interesting, I thought even as I stood up once more, looking at the trembling figure of the Queen on her own throne, her crown deliciously askew. </p><p>The mind control ward was affecting her as well… Something was truly afoot… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Even with my supernatural endurance, it took two hours for me to exhaust the women that were climbing on me like I was a wall while there was a forest fire behind that they were trying to escape, afraid of me falling in exhaustion before it was their turn. </p><p>Luckily for them, I had more than enough endurance to send even the most hesitant ones to the land of happy unconsciousness, their expressions contorted in pleasure, murmuring softly, their bodies covered with the pink marks, reminding them some of the rougher treatments I had leaned for the disobedient ones, much to their pleasure. </p><p>Without a doubt, the barbarian visit to the party was a great success. </p><p>But hat success left one important detail, I thought even as I turned toward the center of the room, where three girls were sitting, a redhead, a blonde, and a brunette. Or more accurately, two girls were sitting, watching the show, while the third one was still on her knees, alternating between their legs. </p><p>Cera was a hard worker, I thought with a big smile. She deserved the social mobility she was so ceaselessly working forward without being exhausted. </p><p>Atia was a more interesting subject. She still looked at me angrily, doing her best to look scandalized with my daring, but even if I hadn’t recognized the signs of arousal dancing in her eyes, it was a hard attitude to sell after watching a full-blown orgy for the last two hours. Being forced by her friend was not a convincing excuse for her continuous presence. Or the fact that her dress was slid enough to reveal her surprisingly large breasts, looking amazing on her thin frame. </p><p>When she fixed her clothing even further as under my gaze stayed focused on her naked tits, hiding them from the view even as she looked at me angrily, like I had committed a sacrilege, and she wasn’t the one that had been watching me while I was fucking her noble peers into the land of unconsciousness. </p><p>Erasing that expression from her face was tempting, but with some reluctance, I turned my gaze to Olivia, who had been watching me with desire-filled eyes, her passion brighter than her red hair. She still stayed in her seat, making no motion to signal her willingness to be a part of the orgy that had just happened, but her eyes disagreed. </p><p>Still, I knew with a certainty that I could move forward, pull Cera from her current place between her legs, and replace her with my shaft, and she would have loved it. And since there was no servant currently in the room —all had been sent away at the beginning of the orgy— after I left her snoozing, I could finally start my search for the library, the whole point of my trip. </p><p>There was one big problem. Her expression. To her credit, she didn’t look at me with disdain —at least, no more than she looked at her own noble peers, she was just naturally smug. No, what annoyed me was the sense of absolute control she was radiating even as she sat there, her dress pooled around her waist to reveal her delicious body, inviting me to take her without a word. </p><p>No, I wanted her to beg for me to take her, forgetting her presence as a daughter of a Patrician house. Luckily, after spending months with Lillian, I perfected the art of making little haughty noble ladies beg to be taken. </p><p>“Satisfied?” I asked with a smug yet gruff tone as I looked at Olivia, not bothering to add any honorific, not even bothering to utter more than one sentence even as I closed in the distance. </p><p>“No, not really,” Olivia answered even as her gaze danced over my naked body even as she pushed Cera away, leaving her legs naked. As far as invitations go, it was a clearly attractive one. Too bad for her that I wanted an even more spectacular one. </p><p>“Too bad, I should work harder, then,” I murmured, but, rather than taking a step to cover the distance between us, I turned my attention toward her sexy blonde friend, who was yet to decide whether to be scandalized or aroused. “Maybe another show,” I added even as I grabbed her dress, ripping it off with one rough pull. </p><p>Atia’s expression was a thing of beauty, a paradoxical mixture of a rabbit cornered by a hungry lion and a sexy dancer aroused by the show she was providing. Three simultaneous gasps rang in the room as I raised the scraps of the dress high, enjoying the sight of Atia’s naked body. Also, it gave Olivia the opportunity to interrupt the show if she wished.  </p><p>But only for a second. </p><p>Then, I let my control slip away once more as I leaned down and grabbed Atia’s fabulous tits, grunting with desire as I squeezed the soft flesh and pulled at her adorable pink nipples, far too roughly to fit her identity as a noble lady. </p><p>She gasped in shock, but surprisingly, she made no move to pull back. “What are you doing, you mongrel!” she gasped, but her body didn’t agree with her words, her back arching perfectly to allow me to grab her breasts. </p><p>“Giving your dear friend another show, of course,” I said mockingly even as I leaned down even more and dropped my mouth to her cleavage, leaving teeth marks on previously pristine breasts, their pale beauty stained with my attention.</p><p>“You’re really daring” Olivia suddenly commented from the side, and I smiled at her smugly, like a barbarian warrior supposed to smile even when facing death, let alone a little naked noble lady’s snarky comments. Unfortunately, it turned out that Olivia had one last surprise, if her sudden smugness was any indicator. “Doing that to the heiress of the house Junia is a daring move. Aren’t you afraid that her father might take offense?” </p><p>I had to admit, Olivia’s surprise was deserving of her smugness. It was a really nasty one that she sprang on me. House Junia was arguably the first family among all the Patrician families, both in terms of history and in terms of achievements. </p><p>A list of achievements that included assassination by Marcus Junius Brutus, of Gaius Julius Caesar, the most preeminent member of now-extinct House Julia, after the defeat of the last member of the family who was also Caesar’s nephew, Gaius Octavius, indirectly gifting me with the amazing lost city I had discovered in the mountains of the Eastern Gallic. </p><p>Small world. </p><p>Of course, the thematic connection with my hidden location wasn’t the reason for Olivia’s smugness. No, that honor went to the fact that the Junia family was arguably the strongest family in Rome. Not only their current head of the family was serving one of the two Consuls —the single strongest political office in Rome, bar none— but also their family had many ex-consuls and ex-preators, therefore filling a significant portion of the Roman senate, which controlled the strongest army in the world. </p><p>It wasn’t inaccurate to say that, when House Junia moved, the world trembled. </p><p>The strategically smart thing would have been to pull back, and maybe even apologize to Atia. But the idea of retreating from the House Junia, after they had completely destroyed House Julia —and weakened their ally House Scipio which I belonged, to a point that they lost their status and escaped into the colonies— didn’t sit right to me. I owed bravery to Julia family after I had used their riches, and I owed my grandfather to make a mark by the Scipio family.</p><p>Well, and if I were to be honest, those thoughts were just additional justifications. Most importantly, I wanted to erase the smug smile on Olivia’s face. It wasn’t the smartest decision, but it was hard to act strategically when hovering above a sexy blonde, whose amazing bosom heaving invitingly under my hands.</p><p>Luckily, my acting abilities were rather impressive after the years I had spent in the school, so I managed to hide my conflict behind an expression of lazy disinterest. “So what? I’m not seeing her family here, do I?” </p><p>That answer turned out to be enough to get a shocked yet aroused glance from all three girls. After all, not every day one challenged the House Junia. </p><p>While they processed their shock, I leaned forward and captured Atia’s lips in a searing kiss, the kind that left her toes curled and her breath out of control. When I pulled back, her blush was spectacular. She tried to stammer, but it died rather quickly, leaving me with an enthusiastic smile on my lips. </p><p>Seeing that she had no intention to stop things, I leaned forward once more, this time pushing my weight on her body enough to feel the twin imprints of her breasts pressing into my chest. My skin shivered with pleasure even as I started kissing her aggressively once more, my tongue invading every single inch of her mouth. </p><p>Meanwhile, my hands joined the fray in a different way. They landed on her hips, squeezing hard to add a layer of sharpness to our kiss, something she appreciated if her muffled moans were any indicator. Seeing that, my hands started to wander around even more aggressively, exploring the wonderfully elegant curves of her body to discover her sensitive spots, giving occasional squeezes hard enough to extract cries. </p><p>She seemed to be rather happy about that part. </p><p>I never stopped the kiss even as I explored her body aggressively. Her lack of experience with the opposite sex was obvious from the speed she melted into my kiss. Soon, her fingers landed on my shoulders, her touch hesitant as she caressed my shoulders, tracing the scars and muscles alike. </p><p>Then, to my left, Cera suddenly moaned. I threw a curious glance, only to see Olivia fingering her aggressively while also squeezing her tits. The more interesting part was her expression, however, carrying more frustration than enjoyment, clearly shocked that her latest gambit failed in such a spectacular manner. Even as I watched, she curled her fingers inside Cera’s slit, provoking a long, shuttering cry.</p><p>Spectacular.</p><p>However, I turned my attention back to Atia after that momentary gaze. It wouldn’t have helped if one of them noticed my wandering attention, not at that moment. I tuned out Olivia’s delicious antics as best I could, my complete focus on kissing and caressing Atia’s hot, delicious body.</p><p>Quickly, I started to get the rewards of that single-minded focus. Atia’s breaths started to get more frantic, her body tenser, signaling an incoming climax. </p><p>I chose that moment to pull back. “So, my noble heiress from that vaunted House Junia, I have something really interesting in mind. Tell me to stop if you don’t want that.” </p><p>Despite her shyness and her unusual conservative attitude, the only thing that she was able to give was an absentminded nod. “Excellent,” I murmured even as I wrapped my hands around her waist, ready to change position. “Let’s play…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>I left the room barely a minute later, the occasion far too important to neglect despite my desire to laze around after such a spectacular occasion of physical exertion. My power might have increased even further with the extra level and the additional divine light tricks, especially against the undead, but the enemy was still strong enough to deserve my full attention. </p><p>The delay we suffered as I teased Titania was already pushing the limits. </p><p>The first thing that got my attention was the chaos that filled the area in the walls. The town was understandably filled with existential fear, enough to overwhelm their courage developed by their rapidly-increasing levels. Understandable, as while the endless waves of monsters hitting the town were nothing more than a natural disaster. </p><p>The undead army that surrounded the town represented a planned action to erase the town. And the undead didn’t get their scary reputation by failing such extermination missions often. Citizens run around in panic, hoping to find a route to escape, fear dominating their minds to understand such implications. It was weird… </p><p>Or not, I corrected my thought even as I extended my senses to feel the thin aura of death covering the city. I subconsciously ignored it for a while, because it was not an active spell, but a natural side effect of being surrounded by an army of necromantic constructs, their death energy radiating naturally. </p><p>After several times I had invaded their base, I barely registered it. But I was forgetting one thing. I was level thirty-one, most of the citizens were barely level five, and which meant the aura of death was much more domineering. </p><p>And the fact that people around Titania didn’t show the same symptoms, her light-natured mana suppressing the effects of the death aura handily in a large circle. I quickly cast a couple of spells to destroy the miasma, radiating from Titania to make it look like she was responsible for casting it. </p><p>The more exhausted they assumed Titania to be, the sooner they would react. </p><p>When I finally stepped the walls, disguised as a common militia, keeping Titania in my field of vision in case of an emergency. However, she wasn’t my only target to protect. I sneaked through the guards, my Subterfuge combined with my Arcana turning me into a ghost on the battlefield. </p><p>It was trivial to sneak into the room that was arranged as a temporary field hospital, piled with medicine and other supplies to help her healing efforts, but empty other than a few civilians wearing white robes, and a familiar curvy blonde with a tense expression. </p><p>I cast a spell to distract the civilians as I sneaked behind Marianne —making sure I could still watch Titania from a window through careful positioning, before hugging her waist. She flinched, but her tenseness was short-lived as  I whispered into her ear. “How are you doing, my sweet bunny?” I whispered. </p><p>“Caesar,” she gasped in a relaxed tone. “You scared me.” </p><p>“Sorry, sweet cheeks,” I added with a chuckle even as I kissed her neck, though still watching Titania as she rained orders to the defense team. “I wanted to surprise you.” </p><p>“Well, you did,” she answered, trying to sound stern, but with my arms around her waist, she had a markedly difficult time maintaining her angry tone with her body melting against mine. Hugging her from behind, once again feeling her generous curves, was certainly a treat. </p><p>“How do you feel about the upcoming battle?”  </p><p>“I … I don’t know,” Marianne murmured even as her gaze danced in the room. “I’ll probably stay here, healing the more dangerous candidates.” </p><p>“I see,” I murmured even as I gently nibbled her ear. “How about joining the battle?” I asked even as I nibbled her ear. “Your new ability would make you shine against the undead?” </p><p>“D-do I have to?” she suddenly stammered, tensing despite the hug. </p><p>“It’s your call,” I countered after kissing her neck to calm her down. I understood where she was coming from. “You don’t have to put yourself forward unless you don’t want to be famous,” I said. “It’s an opportunity for you to show off, but it’ll also bring a lot of responsibility,” I whispered. Ultimately, I didn’t really care about the limited assistance she would provide. I didn’t teach her to have an additional combatant, but to make sure she could defend herself against a surprise assault. </p><p>“I …” she murmured before falling silent for a moment. “I better stay hidden,” she decided even as the explosive flares started to happen outside. “I had watched Cornelia suffer under the expectations of the others, and it certainly didn’t help any. It’s better if I stay hidden.” </p><p>“As you wish, love,” I said even as I tightened my hold around her waist, punctuating that with a kiss. “Just don’t risk yourself trying to keep your abilities concealed. I was tempted to slide inside her to help her power up even more, but two things kept me back. First, empowering her wasn’t the smartest thing I could do under the circumstances,  when I might need my mana for whatever ploy they had in mind. It was similar for the Divine Spark as well. Unlike Titania’s light magic, the temporary skill she would provide me was not critical enough. </p><p>And since she was not a combatant, her achievement wasn’t really critical as well. It could wait a couple of days. </p><p>The second reason, the wounded finally started to flow to the infirmary, meaning she was busy trying to heal everyone efficiently. </p><p>“I’m going outside,” I said to her before leaving. Slipping out without being noticed was trivial, so was climbing the walls to examine the attacking army. </p><p>I scanned the plains that surrounded the city —and the army that blackened the grassy fields that were already drenched in endless monster blood. I examined carefully to notice anything out of order, but even with my perception, I failed to notice anything other than endless low-level zombies and skeletons, and the occasional necromancers to direct them. Using my light detection abilities were out as well, not unless I risked being noticed. </p><p>I was confident in hiding the detection trick from weaker necromancers, but not from the higher level liches. Certainly not from Zokras the Eternal. </p><p>So, I watched as the endless weak monsters crashed against the walls, again and again, my frown deepening. They were wasting too many zombies, too many even to flush out Titania unless they had a very dangerous plan in mind. The more undead got destroyed, the more I started to worry… </p><p>“Honey, start showing your abilities,” I whispered to Titania, using a simple Arcana spell to transfer my voice.</p><p>“Shouldn’t I wait for more, they won’t expect me to actually intervene yet.” </p><p>“I know, but I have a bad feeling. Let’s make them think that you’re trying to intimidate them with your magic. I’m curious how they would react,” I explained. </p><p>It was a credit just how much she started to trust me when she followed my request without any additional question despite the fact that the defense of the town was in line. She started glowing as she raised her hand, and large streaks of light started to rain from the sky, demolishing large swathes of undead whenever her magic touched. </p><p>She was a sight to behold when she wasn’t already impaired by a deadly trap, even when she barely committed a quarter of her mana reserves. </p><p> Her spell had decimated large swathes of the skeleton army, reducing them from a real threat to target practice, achieving something in minutes where the rest of the army might have failed completely. She was a true undead killer. </p><p>Despite the impressive showing, the remaining dregs of the undead army gathering for another attack, proving that they had many other trump cards as I suspected. They simply wanted to extend more of their abilities. </p><p>Titania prepared to wait after that spell, but I sent her another message. “Repeat the same spell, and finish the army,” I suggested. She followed my suggestion, and actually did so. It wasn’t a logical thing that I asked her to, essentially removing a card to force them to act earlier. Now, they just need to reveal their next card a touch earlier to force us to reveal a secret. So, we would either reveal that Titania had more mana than we were trying to convince them, or I had to reveal myself. </p><p>But with the sudden worry gnawing my heart, I decided to trust my instincts. </p><p>It didn’t take long for the next attack to occur, from a direction I wasn’t expecting. Sudden darkness covered the skies. I looked up, only to see a veritable regiment of bone dragons falling from the sky, previously using a cloud to stay concealed. </p><p>Smart, much smarter than I expected them to, coming from the sky rather than the underground, which was their whole defensive structure. </p><p>So, I stretched my mana into the earth, not exactly caring about being caught at this point. My detection magic cut through the wards, only to notice a wild amount of earth mana being used, no doubt to rapidly create a tunnel where they could use to enter the town. </p><p>A pincer attack from both up and down. It was a good plan. The sky ambush to distract the defenders, while the land attack presented the real threat. Combined with the zombie attack outside, it would have been absolutely deadly. Of course, committing that many resources to a single town were absolute madness. </p><p>Unless they were launching their final assault, and throwing all they had desperately. But I had seen their armies, and what was assaulting us was around half of their whole remaining forces. </p><p>With the remaining half of the army, it was impossible to actually take down the Silver Spires before the reinforcements arrived unless the Princess betrayed the school… Certainly not impossible… Maybe it was what my worry was about… </p><p>Or maybe not, I suddenly realized when a sharp flare of panic bloomed in my soul, coming from the soul space. I turned inward, only to realize that sheer panic was coming from my permanent connections. </p><p>Cornelia and Helga!</p><p>“Fuck you, you moldy bag of bones,” I murmured even as I realized the problem. With both Helga and Cornelia defending the town —one an expert of destructive area spells, the other expert on warding, both with impressive stats after my latest assistance, along with a whole town to help them— they were almost impossible to be threatened. </p><p>Unless the rest of the undead army was there, or a dangerously high-level combatant was involved. And considering I could feel their panic from miles away, it was urgent… The kind of urgent that would force me to dump half of my mana to an elemental mount just to be on time. </p><p>But doing so would leave Titania alone for the danger that was coming. I trusted her to handle the pincer attack safely, but I had no idea what they had planned the next.

    "content": "<p>“Such an inconvenient timing,” Titania murmured in frustration even as she grabbed my shoulder and stood up, her legs trembling despite her impressive physical capabilities, which wasn’t negligible despite her magical specialization. </p><p>“Why exactly is inconvenient,” I asked with a teasing grin. “I’m here, and your mana is full, that’s literally the best time for them to attack.” Then, I paused slightly, then my eyes widened in fake shock. “Unless you’re talking about something else!” </p><p>“I- you-” she stammered, her naked body blushing spectacularly. How she could feel self-conscious about desiring more after the rather spectacular moment we shared —not to mention the spectacular threesome that happened just a few days ago— I had no idea, but that didn’t prevent me from teasing her. “You!” she gasped in a surprisingly innocent fit of anger after she noticed the meaning of my ever-growing grin, and slapped my naked shoulder. </p><p>“You want to play rough,” I whispered gutturally even as I grabbed her wrist while standing up, and pushed her toward the nearest wall while locking her lips in a searing kiss. My tongue slipped inside her lips even as my shaft slipped inside her wet entrance, pumping furiously. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>Despite the upcoming battle, she was no less enthusiastic responding to my aggressive touch. With her breasts pressing against my chest and my shaft invading her repeatedly, she was quick to react. “You’re so thick…” she moaned.  “It feels so good.” </p><p>She hooked her legs around my waist to maintain balance as I leaned back slightly before leaning down and sucked on her nipples hard, making her wiggle and squiggle in seconds.  I propped myself by putting my hands on the wall, allowing her torso to move as I pumped, her tits bouncing as I pounded into her.  I wasn’t sweet about it.  </p><p>I didn’t have time to be sweet. </p><p>It turned out that even that level of aggressiveness was not enough to make her shriek hard enough to shatter windows despite the way her slit was tight around me like a vice. Her muffled moans were tempting, but unfortunately, they didn’t have the priority compared to the furious knock on the door. “The army is about to arrive in two minutes!” the warning came with a desperate tone. </p><p>“Pity,” I murmured even as I pulled back, leaving her panting and moaning, leaning against the wall. I caressed her cheek even as I cast a water spell, a bubble of water appearing around our bodies to clean before evaporating. </p><p>[-21 Mana]</p><p>Even with my previous displays of magic, her eyes still widened, because while the spell wasn’t power-intensive, the intensive control I had displayed suggested a lot of things about my power, especially since it was an element I hadn’t used when I was with her, mostly leaning on earth and fire to deal with the undead. </p><p>“You’re evil,” Titania murmured a moment later, her fascination about the display of yet another magical ability unable to match the frustration created by my latest move. </p><p>“It’s good to be tense,” I whispered as I caressed her naked hip while she was busy putting on her underwear. “It’ll help to finish the battle quicker and come back to visit me.” </p><p>She tried to act coy, but a playful step toward her was enough for her to abort that. “I need to leave before they panic and start to desert the walls,” she said, her distaste clear. Her attitude was understandable. Despite her power, she still forced herself to develop new skills constantly, and faced death on a regular basis. Most of the students, however, lacked the same attitude due to their sheltered forced growth, facing no risk, protected by the stronger groups. </p><p>Titania, as someone over level thirty, lacked that luxury. She had to battle for her experience, for every single measly point.</p><p>At least, she did before my appearance. I represented a much more interesting source of power for her as well.  </p><p>Despite its reputation, the number of faculty over level twenty wasn’t all that impressive, and most of them linked to the noble families one way or another, more interested in protecting the students of their own clique rather than improving further even if their level cap hadn’t been reached. </p><p>  I stood behind, examining her beautiful body as she hid it behind layers of clothing, slowly transforming from a sexy yet innocent brunette to the deadly head librarian of Silver Spires, her existence enough the enemies to modify their invasion plans several times just to make sure she was taken out. </p><p>I couldn’t help but be nostalgic as I stared at her, remembering the times where I first discovered my leveling ability, scared to be discovered by her. Just a month ago, I could have never believed I would stand in a superior position, standing in the same room, watching her beautiful body contort as she hurriedly dressed up after a spectacular sharing of joy. </p><p>I leaned against the wall and folded my arms across my chest, enjoying the show. That finally allowed her to realize unlike her, I wasn’t getting dressed frantically. Her gaze met mine. I watched as her cheeks blushed yet again. </p><p>[+300 Experience] </p><p>The woman standing in front of me might have been the scariest mage they would ever see for most people, but for me, she was meant much more. </p><p>“Aren’t you getting ready?” she asked with a small, cute voice. </p><p>“No need,” I said, which made her freeze for a moment. “The same thing with the previous attack,” I said. “Clearly, they are attacking for one of two reasons. They are either betting that I’m still here with you after dealing with the assassins, but wanting to confirm my existence through the attack before attacking somewhere else, or they are assuming I’m not here, and want to take you down while you’re exhausted. Regardless of the case, if I reveal myself, it’ll be of their advantage,” I explained in detail. If there was one thing she lacked, it was thinking strategically, thanks to a combination of her divine-touched status making her act more straightforward, and the impressive power that allowed her to bulldoze most challenges directly. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured. “How exhausted I should act?” she asked. “Maybe I should stumble in exhaustion. </p><p>“Try to look fresh, but don’t use anything too mana intensive,” I corrected. </p><p>“Why, isn’t it better if they see me look exhausted?” </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I corrected her thinking. “If you look too exhausted, it’ll make them suspect there might be something amiss.” </p><p>“But what if they think that we realized their plan and trying to counter it?” she asked. “Then, wouldn’t it be better to look exhausted.”</p><p>I shook my head, smiling in amusement even as Titania buttoned her robe, getting ready to go out. “There’s no need to complicate it. After all, even if there wasn’t a ploy, you would try to look fresh to make the defenders maintain their morale. Sometimes, the best way to deceive the enemies is to do nothing. The more cards we hold in our hand, the stronger our position will be. There’s no harm forcing them to make the first move when we hold all the advantages.”</p><p>“I see,” she murmured, no small amount of distaste in her tone. Still, it was proof of her respect toward my abilities that rather than trying to argue, she just nodded and accepted my recommendation.  </p><p>“Just make sure to keep your eyes open for a sudden ambush from behind,” I said to her before leaning in for one last kiss. I would be next to her, defending her from the shadows, but there was no harm in her being alert. </p><p>After the talk with the headmistress, I was even more vigilant about the mysterious assassins of the Eternals, especially since they didn’t attack Titania immediately. They had two assassins that could deliver a surprise attack, and a mage that, while not as strong as Titania, was strong enough to counter her spells while the other two delivered their attacks. There was no one in the town that could prevent the assassination if they wanted to escape. </p><p>The fact that they didn’t prove that they wanted to kidnap her, and my talk with the headmistress revealed a lot of reasons for such an activity. They might be just trying to get the Divine Spark that gave her her light magic abilities, of course. Or maybe, they just wanted her to use it as evidence to make sure the headmistress had a Divine Spark. </p><p>After all, the headmistress went a long way to hide the Divine Spark behind the wards infused with darkness, and I doubted it was just to prevent the System from devouring it. It would make sense for the Eternals to use Titania to investigate rather than invading the school directly. Even that was an assumption, however. Maybe they were already aware that the headmistress was in possession of the Divine Spark of light, but needed Titania’s node as a sample to develop counter-measures. </p><p>I ignored these thoughts as Titania leaned in for one last kiss. There was no benefit to the spiral of assumptions I was forcing myself to make. In the end, their reason didn’t matter, and not just because of my lack of reliable information. </p><p>Their reason didn’t matter, because I had no intention of letting Titania be captured by a nebulous —and possibly nefarious— organization. </p><p>As she leaned my body to extend the kiss, I felt her body pressing against mine, her beautiful tits firm enough to make their presence known despite the layers of clothing in between. Her bosom may be lacking in size, but it was certainly not inferior to anyone else. </p><p>The desire to rip her robe off was strong. It would leave the defense to the others, which probably fold under the aggressive offense of the undead army without Titania there to stabilize the morale, but was it really important compared to the feeling of caressing her beautiful breasts squeezing her nipples.  </p><p>Pity that it was far too selfish, even for me, so I watched as she left the room, her hips with a sway that she didn’t have just days ago. </p><p>After all, there was always a post-battle celebration. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 489893 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 7595  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I finally left the house after making sure Penny had the costume on perfectly —and wasting a few extra minutes enjoying the opportunity to fix the costume— Nancy was glaring daggers. “You’re late,” she growled, but considering she was glaring daggers at poor Penny rather than me, it wasn’t hard to guess that her annoyance was less about the delay, and more about the activities that spanned the said delay. </p><p>She definitely had the famous explosiveness of the redheads. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” I said, with absolutely no hint of repentance. “It took a while to make sure the costume fitted well,” I said, gesturing at Penny, whose body was on delicious display thanks to the already-deficient design of the armor before I had removed a couple of extra key pieces, creating a masterpiece in the process. </p><p>It wasn’t revealing to a point of being obscene. Just a nice deep cleavage enhanced by the pressure of the armor, and tight pants displaying her assets in the best way possible. A picture of her could easily be used in a public advertisement campaign without bothering the censors, even in the seventies. </p><p>Still, that didn’t change the fact that it would drive the nerds in the convention center crazy. </p><p>“I can see that,” Nancy murmured, deciding to target the costume for her dissatisfaction. “You clearly took liberties with my design.” </p><p>“You shouldn’t give lip about that if you actually want to sell your books,” I countered, not trying to cater to her jealousness. I was experienced enough with casual relationships —if what we have could even be counted that— enough to know that trying to do so would only embolden her further. </p><p>So, after throwing a self-satisfied smile to her way, I opened the passenger-side door for Penny, not bothering to hide the appreciative glance to her ass as she tried to squeeze herself, the thong I made her put peeking sexily.</p><p>After watching Nancy swallow a bunch of angry remarks, not wanting to scare the model whose existence was critical to save all the investment she had made for the marketing of her books. That didn’t prevent her jealous glare, trying to dig the back of her head, of course. </p><p>She was lucky that, after our little session, Penny was far too dazed to notice her hostility. </p><p>The next hour passed calmly, the rumbling of engine mixing with Nancy’s pen dancing on the books as she signed them one by one. Of course, the silence didn’t prevent Penny from throwing shy glances to my side, and me responding with caressing her thigh. </p><p>“We need to take a break, I’m finished with this batch,” she said, her tone still chippy. “Why don’t we stop at the next resting area.” </p><p>“Sure,” I said, and without saying anything. A minute later, we were in a parking area of a gas station, which was mostly empty thanks to the early hour. It was a nice thing, because the few people that were around, both the visitors and the employees, turned to watch Penny as she left the car. </p><p>Not that I blamed her for staring. Penny was beautiful enough to turn heads before putting her into a sexy armor. I was just glad that there weren’t a lot of people, preventing a mob. </p><p>“So, why don’t you girls go and put on your make-up while I handle the books,” I said, when I saw Nancy trying to pull the books from the backseat, and in her innocent attitude, Penny immediately moving to help. As much as watching them struggle with them while trying to keep their costumes in order, maybe even with a camera ready to take a bunch of photos, I decided to be merciful. </p><p>Nancy earned that by limiting her annoyance to her sharp glares, and Penny earned that… Well, Penny earned a lot more than that with her impeccable performance… </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit early for the makeup?” Nancy asked, her tone tense. It was a familiar tone of a girl hoping to create an argument. “Shouldn’t we wait until the convention area?” </p><p>“There’s no harm in multitasking, but if you want to be recognized the moment you leave the car…” I said, reminding Nancy about her decision to keep her identity concealed rather than trying to defend my point of view. Why would I indulge her desire to have a fight when I didn’t really care about the decision one way or another. </p><p>“Right,” Nancy stammered immediately, her determination evaporating in an instant. After one last glare, she took her makeup bag and walked toward a small room that functioned as a resting area, clearly a better location to put on makeup than a public bathroom. </p><p>“Why don’t you follow her as well, sweetheart, so that she can put the correct makeup on the character,” I said to Penny. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean I wasn’t curious what these two might talk about when they were alone, so, I shuffled the books as quick as I could manage even if it made me sweat, then followed them. Nancy was fun, but she had a temper. I wanted to be around in case she blew up too aggressively, breaking Penny’s trembling self-confidence. </p><p>I got nearer, but there was no sound coming from the room, which was a positive thing. Maybe I had underestimated Nancy’s self-control. So, rather than entering the room, I decided to peek through a small window, curious what I would find. </p><p>Penny sat on her seat silently, not making the slightest move while Nancy applied her makeup carefully. However, I instantly realized that I had been giving Nancy a bit too much credit. Yes, she wasn’t shouting, but that didn’t change the tightness of her fingers around the brush, nor her excessively harsh movements, enough to make Penny shuffle in pain. </p><p>However, Penny was just silly and well-intentioned enough to miss the intention behind Nancy’s harsh makeup, squeezing her teeth tight to suppress her reaction, trying to look like she was a good sport. </p><p>That would not do, I decided even as I knocked on the door, but then entered without even waiting for a response. “Damn, Penny, you look beautiful,” I said. Penny blushed as she avoided my gaze shyly, and I used the opportunity to send a warning glare to Nancy. “You seem a bit tense, do you want me to take over the makeup,” I offered. </p><p>“No need, it’s easier for me to handle it alone,” Nancy said, but when I decided to take a seat next to her rather than leaving, she started to be more careful not to hurt Penny. </p><p>She might have a flaring temper, but she certainly lacked the determination and willpower to enforce it directly while I was in the room. Especially when we were the ones that were doing her a favor rather than the opposite. When her makeup was finished, Penny excused herself to visit the powder room, her face covered with a complicated pattern. </p><p>Combined with the silver wig, she was just different enough for people not to recognize her, but not too different that we couldn’t use them for her portfolio. </p><p>“Let’s handle your makeup,” I said the moment the door closed. </p><p>“No need, I can handle it on my own-” Nancy tried to argue, only to stop when I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her onto my lap. </p><p>“I insist,” I said even as I took her makeup bag. One of the first skills for any aspiring photographer was to know how to apply professional-grade makeup, even for the ones working with big-budget studios. Under ideal circumstances, a professional makeup artist would accompany the shoot, of course, but it was interesting just how quickly things could pass a point that could be described as ideal, even in the most professional environments. </p><p>Once again, her willpower proved weaker than her aggression, and she fell silent the moment I pressed the brush on her chin, sliding gently on her skin. I let the silence stretch for a minute. “So, are you going to tell me why were you torturing the model I had called in as a big favor to save your poorly planned business venture, or would you prefer if I take her and go back, leave you stranded in the middle of nowhere with more books than your body weight.” </p><p>The way she stiffened on my lap was simply beautiful. “No, you can’t,” she whispered in terror. </p><p>“Why not?” I said, but I didn’t stop applying makeup. The threat was effective enough without enhancing it like that. “We woke up even before the dawn, just to make sure your work goes without a hitch, but you’re still being ungrateful. Don’t you think you deserve it?” </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she murmured, surrendering immediately, the implications of my justified threat far too much for her to lash out.  </p><p>“It’s good that you apologize, but I don’t appreciate that I had to force you for the apology,” I answered. “Certainly not when we are sacrificing our whole day to help you.” She dipped her head down. I decided to deliver the final blow. “I understand that you’re feeling jealous after watching us back in Penny’s house, but you shouldn’t try to lash out to her.” </p><p>“What! You knew-” she stammered before changing her direction. “I mean, I don’t know what are you talking about!” </p><p>“Of course,” I said with a chuckle. “And the redhead I had seen in the window was completely unrelated to you, or anyone else, right?” </p><p>“Maybe,” she whispered. I was about to give her an answer, when I noticed another presence in the small window I had been using to check the room earlier, recognizing that as a very familiar blonde. </p><p>It was good that Nancy was looking at the floor, because she missed the sudden calculating expression on my face. After all, what better way than making Nancy pay than reversing the earlier situation, I decided. A moment later, my fingers were under her chin, raising her head up, stealing a kiss before she could respond. </p><p>Ready to provide an amazing show to Penny. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As fun as dealing with Fernhand had been, I was aware that the only reason my domination went that smoothly was her perilous position, trying to juggle many noble families as the opposition while manipulating them through her mind magic, leaving her with limited actual magical power and command ability compared to her political weight. </p><p>My actions could have exploded badly spectacularly if the circumstances were any different. </p><p>It was why, rather than paying a visit to Emma like my libido desired, I decided to act more carefully, and actually prepare for the upcoming visit. </p><p>After all, greeting a Queen in her throne room was an important political event...</p><p>I checked back to my cell first, to see whether I had any surprise guest waiting for me, which predictably came empty, and the wards I had established to check any visitor were undisturbed. </p><p>So, I spent the rest of the day carefully examining the throne room, in particular, the possible secret entrances and exits in case the Queen decided to play naughty. That search turned into the discrete establishment of several explosive magics hidden around the kitchens, warehouses, and several other concealed spots, ready to be detonated remotely to create chaos that would allow me to escape unscathed unless Sapphire decided to mobilize a full regiment. </p><p>Luckily, with her tenuous political position, an emergency mobilization targeting the palace was out of the question, not unless she wanted the faction that was opposing her to react violently, assuming it was a ploy targeting them. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time a government cleansed its detractors with the might of the sword. The moral orientation of the government didn’t change that. For the dark faction, it was the business as usual, but even the light faction was quick to find evidence that linking those that was killed to several dangerously nefarious plots like demon summoning, the kind that only the craziest dark lords even dared to touch —often with spectacularly horrible outcomes. </p><p>Even better, Sapphire still had no reason to suspect my identity. For her, I was still one of the allies of a deposed dark lord, trying to make a quick buck while also using the opportunity to enjoy the assets that Sapphire was displaying for a long while in her moonlighting job as an exotic dancer, beautiful enough to drive all nobles crazy. </p><p>As the evening arrived, and our meeting time started to get near, the movement around the throne room started to lessen, and soon, wards around it went on. Servants started to discuss an unscheduled test of magical security system around the core areas… </p><p>Everything was arranged perfectly. </p><p>Of course, I still circled the activated defenses three times, making sure there was nothing out of order. The wards of the throne room were not offensive in nature, but functioning as a shelter, reinforced strongly to ensure no external attack would penetrate them, but they were significantly lacking both in terms of offensive capabilities and in terms of keeping people inside. Understandable considering the strategic objectives. They existed mostly to defend against a surprise attack, but not an extended siege. </p><p>After all, there was little point defending the throne room for months if the enemy had managed to invade the capital to a point of maintaining an extended siege. </p><p>Still, I carefully examined the wards to see if there were any last-minute changes in the wards before passing through a side entrance that had been left deliberately. I wasn’t afraid of Sapphire trying to trap me, not when her thought process was distorted by the side effects of the spells she had tried to use on me, but that didn’t mean stepping inside without properly checking was in any way justified. </p><p>I still waited around the entrance, until it was five minutes after the arranged meeting time. Just a small power play to annoy her while reminding her who held the initiative in our deal despite her theoretical ability to mobilize all resources of the empire. </p><p>Then, I stepped into the throne room, completely empty other than a familiar figure sitting on the throne on a raised platform, the traditional seat of the Emperor, but occupied by Sapphire for the last decade after his unfortunate passing. </p><p>It was interesting to see her in a different set of clothing. She wasn’t wearing the suggestive outfit with the strategic cutouts and transparent areas to effortlessly charm anyone that was lucky enough to see her, nor she was wearing one of the casual dresses —relatively— she wore whenever she visited my cell. </p><p>No, she was dressed in her full regalia. The light blue dress was the most conservative thing I had ever seen her wear, bulky enough to hide even her impressive bosom other than a hint of cleavage on the upper side, just to underline her femininity without highlighting it to a point of undermining her authority. Her hair, gathered in a complicated updo to reinforce that image further. </p><p>And then, there was the elegant tiara on her head, shining softly with an inner light, representing her power as the highest authority in the Empire. </p><p>I was impressed. She went all out dressing in full regalia, sharp enough to understand the full implications of my request about wanting to meet in the throne room. Tonight, I didn’t want to defile Sapphire, the exotic dancer with an overdeveloped ambition. </p><p>Tonight, I wanted to defile the Queen of the biggest empire in the world. It was an amazing rush for any male, and considering her competency in manipulation, she seemed to understand kink perfectly, and was more than ready to sacrifice the dignity of the Empire to satisfy it, just to make sure she got what she wanted. </p><p>“Good evening, my Queen,” I said with an exaggerated tone of respect, even as I bend the knee. “May I approach the throne.” </p><p>“You may,” she answered in a calm tone, the kind she used to order around, but at this point, I was sufficiently familiar with her expression to recognize the annoyance dancing behind the surface. After all, her willingness to use her body didn’t come from a place of subservience, but a desire to continue to maintain her power as the Queen. The fact that I was disrespecting her in her strongest position clearly annoyed her, but at this point, she had invested our partnership far too much to act on that annoyance. </p><p>Especially with her tantric abilities still wreaking havoc on her instincts.</p><p>“Thank you, your Imperial Majesty,” I said, highlighting her power through her title. Then, I started walking forward, copying the pompous yet subservient steps of a courtier, making her even more annoyed as the distance closed, before I bowed in front of her and presented the second map with both hands. “I hope you find that to your liking, your Imperial Majesty,” I said even as I looked up. </p><p>I had to admit, the design of the throne room was spectacular, and not just because it was built from the finest marbles, and decorated with a liberal application of silver, gold, and precious stones to highlight the richness of the Empire. I was impressed because, the placement and the shape of the throne, when combined with the careful decoration of the wall and alignment of the other furniture, generated a subtle sense of inferiority to anyone standing at the feet of the throne. </p><p>However, as I raised my eyes, that subtle sense of awe increased even further even as I examined the beautiful face of the Queen. My mana started to rotate instinctively, and then I noticed that the decoration wasn’t the only thing responsible for that emotion. It was a subtle spell that somehow infected my mind, compounding the sense of awe I felt toward her. </p><p>My instinctual response was to blast her with a combat spell to immobilize her, before punishing her for daring to mess with my mind. </p><p>A response that I barely managed to suppress, and only because the spell was distinctly not a tantric spell, which was her expertise. So, either she managed to arrange an expert on such short notice to lay a ward that would help her only marginally, or the ward always existed. </p><p>I decided to give her the benefit of doubt, forcing myself to suppress my fury. I was lucky that she was busy examining the map, missing the possible anger on my face. Which was lucky, because I didn’t want to explain to her why I could detect such a subtle ward while I missed her tantric attempts. </p><p>Of course, I knew that my fury was rather hypocritical. It wasn’t the first time someone tried to manipulate me magically, or even the first time Sapphire tried to do so. </p><p>The success triggered my fury considerably, reminding me the reason why none of my rivals dared to use such methods to manipulate me, not after the examples the first two had been turned into for the attempt. “I hope everything is in order, Your Imperial Highness,” I murmured, doing my best to keep my tone even as I subtly stretched out my mana, trying to detect the source of the manipulation. </p><p>The results were surprising. I actually failed to find the source of the manipulation! </p><p>On the positive side, it confirmed something. It wasn’t something Sapphire had arranged. I had enough confidence in my abilities to know that no expert could set up in a ward in less than a day that was intricate enough to touch my mind, but still hide the main body of the ward from my gaze. </p><p>“Yes, it’s all satisfactory, you can take your rewards,” she answered, her tone impassive, unaware just how close she had came imprisoned into the same cell I had been living in for the last month due to an emergency. </p><p>I could be a tad unreasonable when angered… </p><p>She didn’t have to point me to the noticeable bundle sitting on a nearby table. She stayed still while I opened the bundle and revealed the two dark artifacts, the Blade of Shadows and the Tether of the Underworld. A magical scan later. It was a much more careful one than the one I initially planned, but I wasn’t above admitting that the success of the ward actually spooked me. </p><p>It took almost a minute to make sure nothing was amiss in them, and five more to ensure they were the genuine article. All the while, Sapphire continued to sit on her throne, silent, waiting for my next action. The tenseness on her face suggested that she assumed my careful examination was a part of my power play rather than genuine concern. </p><p>I didn’t bother disabusing her of that notion, at least not before I decided how to proceed… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Laura lay without moving, fulfilled and relaxed in a way she had never experienced before, she could do nothing but murmur dazedly. Even minutes after the explosion, her body was still shaking, something that his presence inside her had not helped at all. The gentle wrap of his muscular arms stayed wrapped around her, making her feel secure in a way she hadn’t felt since she was a young girl. </p><p>At that moment, there was nothing that could penetrate her bubble of comfort. Not her classes, not her obsessive desire to be the first one, something she had developed as a child hoping to control at least one aspect of her life, not the bitter memories of her family both before and after that fateful event that ended with her being disowned. </p><p>“Is it supposed to be this amazing?” she murmured dazedly, but stiffened even as she asked that, cursing herself for her mistake. </p><p>After that amazing encounter, the last thing she should be doing was to remind him about their relative difference, both in age and in experience. She wasn’t stupid enough to miss the fact that their friendship began not because he saw her as an equal, but he pitied her —something she might have taken as an insult if the moment he had picked hadn’t been the lowest point she had experienced in her short college life. At that point, even pity was more than she needed. </p><p>Though, it took a while for her to realize that. At first, she had thought that Mark was humoring her because he needed her help for the classes. He wouldn’t have been the first pseudo-friend that hung around her to mooch off her academic credentials, something she was more than happy to do to pay back. </p><p>Lost in her own perspective, it took an accident to realize it was just another ploy to make her more comfortable. One day, she had a class canceled at the last minute, and went to the library to join Mark, only to saw him working through a worksheet rapidly, while a similar one took almost half an hour the day before. As much as she liked his kindness, she was also frustrated by the evidence he wasn’t seeing her as a friend, but someone to coddle. </p><p>After that, she made sure to maintain a more equal relationship both in terms of accepting his help, and also offering assistance in a way that he might actually find useful. It hadn’t been particularly successful in the past. Her growing attraction toward him didn’t help the situation in any way. </p><p>She was attracted to him, but that was a given. After all, not only he was a sexy older man, but also he was kind and humorous. She had decided to date that annoying hippie, because she was sure that there was no chance he would find her as a valid target for dating, which was the reason she never made any move, until the accidental statement that escaped her lips while she was lamenting yet another failed relationship. </p><p>The fact that she was lying in Mark’s arms, in his bed, his erection still stuffed inside her, stretching her in a way she had never felt before was nothing less than a miracle. </p><p>Which was why she was angry at herself for that offhand question. The moment they just shared was special, and not just because of the spectacular pleasure she had enjoyed. No, it was the first time she had felt like he had treated her like an equal. Her question was perfectly tailored to remind him about their equality. </p><p>As she felt the comforting wrap of his arms unwrapping and his shaft pull back, she couldn’t help but tense, expecting a speech about how much of a mistake it had been considering their age difference, maybe even a subtle jab about her morals for coming to his place wearing only a sexy set of underwear under her coat. </p><p>Lost in her fears, she obediently accepted his touch on her shoulder with her eyes closed, pushing her away and making her turn to face him at the same time. She didn’t want to see his expression, afraid of the patronizing expression she would find… </p><p>Which was why she felt surprised to feel his body heat against her once more, his hands gently grabbing her waist. “Yes,” he whispered with a gentleness that surprised her. “It was special…”  </p><p>She opened her eyes no matter how much she didn’t want to, afraid of finding a patronizing expression. She doubted that she could have handled that. Still, keeping her eyes closed would only validate that she was a scared little girl, afraid to face the reality. She steeled her heart, and opened her eyes, her mind already preparing and cataloging dozens of responses, to be picked for the correct circumstance… </p><p>Only to see Mark’s face, inches away, carrying an unusually serious expression, the kind that turned her blood into flames and her heart into a tornado. “No,” he whispered with uncharacteristic honesty. “It was amazing for me as well.” </p><p>His words burned through her prepared responses like an out-of-control forest fire, leaving her without an answer. Luckily, there was a way for her to respond without relying on any kind of word. She closed in the distance between them and started kissing him. </p><p>It was a soft, lingering kiss, conveying her sudden relief and her elation far better than any words could convey. She put her hands on his shoulder, gently caressing as their tongue danced gently. She moaned in appreciation as the kiss lingered for minutes, before she finally pulled back. </p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured, hoping that her voice could convey everything she wanted to convey. Her gratitude, her happiness, her desire… “Thank you for being such a good teacher, showing me how the pleasure is supposed to feel like…”</p><p>Then, she started pulling back, feeling bittersweet happiness, sad that it came to an end. But before she could properly extract herself, his hands tightened around her waist, keeping her in place. “Where are you going?” he growled, his throaty tone different than his usual kind yet disinterested tone. It was a primal growl that made her bones tremble, and her skin tingle… </p><p>“H-home,” she stammered, not daring to hope that his question meant what she thought it meant. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie,” he answered, his tone still throaty, but the growl was replaced by a smoother tone, though its effect on her was not lessened in any way. “It was just the lesson introduction. The actual class hadn’t even started yet.” </p><p>Laura gasped, unable to believe what she was hearing. Even in the depths of the pleasure, she was sure that it was going to be a one-time thing, something Mark was doing partly as a favor, partly for novelty value. After all, weren’t men famous for their endless appetite for one-night stands. And Mark certainly didn’t look like one that lacked opportunities in that aspect. </p><p>She had never expected him to ask for a repeat, not unless she actually begged for it. She couldn’t answer. This time, it wasn’t about losing her words, as she had many answers dancing in her mind, begging to be let out, but Mark leaned for another kiss, preventing her words from going out. </p><p>This time, it wasn’t a soft, lingering kiss. No, this time, his tongue invaded her mouth, stealing her breath, so much that she barely paid attention to his hands, once again on her shoulder, but this time, rather than pressing her against the bed, he lay on his back and pulled her on top of him. </p><p>Laura was more than happy with the result. After all, while his bed was comfortable, she definitely preferred to feel his muscles under her. She responded to the kiss enthusiastically while he held her tight, nestling her into his arms. She threw a glance toward the full-body mirror, examining their reflection. With their height difference, their position might even be classified as cute, if she had been wearing anything other than a lacy garter belt, and he was wearing something… </p><p>His presence under her was growing, but she didn’t try to take it inside. She wanted to enjoy the kiss from her new position before moving to that step, because, from her recent experience, she knew that once he was inside her, she would lose the control he so thoughtfully bestowed. She ran her hands over his bare chest, trying to commit the lines of his body into her memory in case they only had that night. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean that she couldn’t have some fun while teasing him at the same time. Her hand slid down until her fingers were caressing his erection, throbbing in excitement, moving up and down repeatedly. Whenever she pulled her hand away, she slid down until she was straddling his midsection, grinding in a way that sent shivers to her body, temping her to abandon her little plan. </p><p>She knew that she wasn’t an expert when it came to teasing a man, but Mark’s enthusiastic moans suggested that she wasn’t as bad as she feared as well. Encouraged, she rubbed her body against his even more enthusiasm, her mind busy on how to follow up. Maybe a blowjob, just like she had practiced on an overly large toy she had purchased together with her sexy clothing —though she was surprised to see that Mark had an even bigger one attached to his body— or maybe a unique massage using her breasts —as she had caught his lingering glances to her bosom more than once during their tentative friendship… </p><p>But as Mark growled in satisfaction underneath her, she was confident that her choice, whatever it might be, would be greeted with great enthusiasm. </p><p>Mark was really a great teacher… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“H-how can you forget to mention that after seeing her identity!” Titania growled, her eyes wide with shock. </p><p>“Calm down, she’s just an angel,” I said with a considerably less amazed tone, which Titania clearly didn’t appreciate if her angry glare was any indicator. Though, it was important to note that her anger certainly wasn’t enough to make her leave my lap despite our nakedness, or stopping the gentle yet beautiful movement of her hips. </p><p>I didn’t find her anger at my dismissal surprising. After all, she had lived under the emotional suppression as a Divine-Touched of the Light for at least a couple of years, maybe more. While that suppressed her emotions, since the headmistress was a being of light, it might even work as an amplifier. And, even without that, the headmistress provided an amazing sight, with her golden armor and her impassive wings.</p><p>My case was different, especially after my first real glance was on her naked body.  </p><p>“She’s an angel!” Titania repeated, even angrier, and I just chuckled, pulling her tighter on my lap. Since it wasn’t a direction I wanted to waste a lot of time, I decided to distract her with a shinier approach. I raised my finger, conjuring a small globe of light. At first glance, it didn’t look too different from a simple arcana trick, but with her own expertise in light magic, it was trivial for Titania to understand its true source.</p><p>“You can already cast it! It’s an amazing achievement considering you received it just hours ago,” she gasped in shock as she raised her finger, touching at the small globe. Light magic, despite its simple look, was extremely destructive. If someone else tried what she was trying, the smallest thing they would receive was a nasty burn, maybe even lose their finger completely if their level wasn’t particularly high. </p><p>With her own spectacular expertise, however, Titania had no such risk. Her smile brightened as her fingertip disappeared into the ball, before I felt her mana flooding, stealing control of the globe from me, changing shapes repeatedly.</p><p>“Show off,” I said with a chuckle, spanking her ass playfully as I said so, making her flinch cutely as she moved forward, a movement that left her entrance perfectly aligned with my shaft. And since I was already trying to distract her from the earlier topic, I didn’t miss the opportunity and plunged into her wetness. </p><p>The moan she let out in response was a thing of beauty. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 70%]</p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>Ideally, considering my interest in understanding the assistance of my newly-acquired sliver of Divine spark, I shouldn’t have been trying to enhance Titania’s companion process, but the immediate benefits of such a thing were more critical than possible drawbacks. The experience burst was always welcome after each stage completion, but now, about to face a legendary lich that earned the nickname of eternal, skill share was a much better benefit. </p><p>Not to mention the stat boost Titania would receive, which would increase her power significantly. Two points increase for every mental stat was certainly nothing to scoff at, both in terms of extra mana it would give her, and the extra potency it would add to her skills. </p><p>“Since you’re willing to show off, why don’t you teach me a few of your skills,” I suggested even as I grabbed her hips, pulling her even deeper. </p><p>“Caesar, not now,” she gasped as the pleasure hit her. </p><p>“Not now, what?” I asked. “The teaching, or the fun?” </p><p>Despite everything, she was far too shy to actually answer such a question instantly. She dipped her head down, her raven hair hiding her blushing face, but the way her hips moved repeatedly was a better answer, so I didn’t force her to speak. Instead, I leaned forward, capturing her lips in a lingering kiss. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 71%]</p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>I let her determine the pace, her head dipped down but her hips picking up speed. That didn’t prevent me from leaning down to petter her neck with kisses, of course, which assisted greatly to destroy her hesitancy. I knew just how naughty she would get once her initial shyness was broken.  </p><p>So, I continued to caress her body steadily as she danced on my lap, her movements getting sharper and sharper while I was once again felt shocked by the potential hidden in her tiny body, enough to destroy the town we were in bare minutes if she chose so. </p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” I whispered into her ear, making her tremble in excitement under the softness of my tone. She looked up, and I captured her lips in a searing kiss that made her moan helplessly, which helped quite a bit for her to get rid of her hesitancy. When I finally pulled back, her expression was firmly on the territory of desire, destroying the hint of shyness. </p><p>“You’re an evil man,” she stated even as she put her hands on my shoulder, her hips moving even more furiously thanks to the additional leverage. I moaned, enjoying the way she clenched tighter around my girth. Happy with the way she was taking control, I had no problem temporarily taking a passive position, especially since, unlike Oeyne, I knew she wouldn’t try to push her newfound opportunity to the limits. </p><p>I wrapped my arm around her waist, pulling her tight to enjoy the feeling of her hard nipples against my chest, my hands occasionally slipping down to cup her deliciously tight lithe hips. She buried her face to my neck. A minute passed, then two, then five, while she steadily closed toward a climax, her hips getting more and more furious. </p><p>Then, she finally tightened around my girth, signaling that she had passed through the finish line. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 73%]</p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>“It’s my turn,” I whispered into her ear even as she trembled in my lap, adding a layer of anticipation to her rush of pleasure. </p><p>Before she could recover, I had already grabbed her and pushed her against the wall, her breasts pressing against the smooth stone. With me skewering her, she was just short enough to barely tiptoe. But if the beautiful moan she let out as I used the advantages of the angle to push even deeper into her was any indicator, she wasn’t particularly caring of her helpless position. </p><p>She closed her eyes to enjoy the merciless assault I launched, her thin frame shaking with joy with every push. Her beautiful lips pursed, leaving me in a dangerous dilemma. Should I lean down and kiss, enjoying their warmth, or stay away, listening to her moans without interruption, getting louder and louder and louder. </p><p>After a torturous decision process, I decided to choose the latter, enjoying the way she clamped around me as I pushed deeper and deeper, her moans cheering for my success. Her silky smoothness enveloped me fully, renewing my decision to steal her completely from the headmistress’ sphere of influence, and not just because she was the only one that could currently allow me to get some mana. </p><p>It was so tempting to steal her away and escape to a mountain, staying in a cave for the next week, away from everything else as I tested just how passionately I could make her moan under my control. Pity that, with everything that was going on, a week of holiday was not something we could afford. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 74%]</p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>She managed to distract me from my thoughts rather effectively. She pressed her hands against the wall for leverage before she started rocking her hips wildly, managing to add her own movement to the pushes despite the limited angle. “Someone is feeling enthusiastic,” I whispered into her ear, a sentence that would have sent her stammering away any other time. But now, in the throes of passion, she just moaned in agreement. </p><p>Happy with her ever-growing enthusiasm, I sank deeper into heaven, the pace of my hips best described as a merciless drilling, her silky wetness more than happy to envelop my presence deeper and deeper. </p><p>\"You’re a masterpiece,” I whispered sincerely even as I grabbed her hips once more, moving even faster. She was far too gone to use her words to answer, but the change of tone in her moans worked just as well. Though this time, the temptation to feel the tremble of her voice on my lips felt more tempting than hearing them, so I closed her mouth with my lips, muffling her moans the best way possible. </p><p>Then, she started to tighten in a final manner, suggesting that she was experiencing another delicious climax. This time, I was sufficiently gone that her extra tightening put every single nerve ending in my body to high alert, signaling an eruption. </p><p>I exploded into her, which matched perfectly for the third stage of the companion process, along with a flood of other notifications. </p><p>[+2000 Experience] </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 75% - Third Stage Completed +15000 Exp]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Relationship not sufficient for the fourth stage]</p><p>I had to admit, while the completion notification of another stage of the Companion Process was always welcome, the same didn’t apply for the following one. Even though, I wasn’t really surprised. Not with the reverence, she was feeling toward the headmistress. </p><p>I didn’t expect to progress into the fourth stage unless I replaced the importance of the headmistress in her mind, becoming the most important person in her life. That was what I learned from Cornelia and Helga. </p><p>Luckily, the notifications I had received were not limited to that. I had also received a nice batch of perk-related notifications. </p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 3. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>[New Perk: Skill Share]</p><p>[Skill Share perk activated. Target Skill: Grandmaster Light Magic. Copied: Duration, 24 hours]</p><p>[Temporary Skill: Master Light Magic (100/100)]</p><p>I was happy to see skill share was working as intended, and even happier to see that just like fire magic, it was actually based on elemental magic, allowing me to start from such a high location. As long as I spent the rest of the day with Titania, being taught how to use the light magic offensively, I could get a qualitative improvement. </p><p>Or at least, that was what I thought until I heard a knock on the door, and a furious shout from the other end. “There’s an incoming undead army!” an unknown voice shouted, destroying my plans of a day filled with leisure learning and leveling up… </p><p>Well, I thought spitefully as I gathered my mana. Teaching the undead army a lesson they couldn’t forget through the light magic wasn’t exactly a terrible alternative. </p><p>And maybe this time, I could teach them to stay away… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 488593 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 7595  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was past midday when I arrived at the town defended by Titania, delayed by destroying a few monster hordes I had came across. Therefore, I wasn’t particularly surprised to find the town surrounded by an impressive number of weaker monsters, assaulting the walls without a break. </p><p>None of these monsters were particularly strong, meaning that after their latest explosive ploy was destroyed, the enemy was relying on the constant attacks to keep the pressure up, hoping to exhaust the defenders, both in terms of endurance and equipment. </p><p>And it seemed to be working. Even with weaker students and citizens showing a much greater combat ability compared to my last visit thanks to their level increase and the stat boosts from the achievements they triggered, the stronger fighters were getting significantly lesser benefit from the continuous assault of the weaker monsters. However, they were still unable to rest because they needed to respond to the breaches, preventing the monsters from cutting a swathe through the weaker defenders. </p><p>Titania was the one that best exemplified that exhaustion, standing on the most visible location on the walls, only using her magic when absolutely necessary, and even then, it was a use soft, the flickering blast of light that lacked her usual domineering vigor. </p><p>I might have even worried if I couldn’t feel her current through our connection, much stronger than her weak blasts might suggest. Good, I thought. She was following my suggestion about faking exhaustion, meaning she was ready for an ambush. </p><p>The same applied to Marianne, who was healing only the deadly cases at the back of the line, keeping most of her mana in reserve. It wasn’t the most efficient way for a healer to work, but after getting proficient with the life energy trick I had taught her, she wasn’t just a healer. She represented a deadly hidden card against an undead assault. </p><p>I was tempted to pull her along to my time with Titania once again, helping her recover her mana while I once again enjoyed their combined attention, but unfortunately, pulling both of them from the siege would affect the defenses negatively. </p><p>After a magical message to Titania, I sneaked into her room, waiting for her to appear. Since she needed to organize the defenses before taking a break, it took a while for her to arrive, and I spent that time using magic to checking the surroundings, both by checking the wards to get any hint of the agents of the Eternals, and using my new detection capabilities to detect undead presence. </p><p>[-482 Mana]</p><p>The security of my lovers was an important thing, especially with such a complicated siege going on. </p><p>When the checks resulted in no outcome, I turned my attention to the wards of the room. Just because I detected no enemy presence didn’t mean that there was no enemy presence, or that they couldn’t pay me another visit. Though, in the interest of multitasking, I started to reconstruct the furniture in the room by adding some magical resistance, both making the room safer and improving my craft skill. With my mana and stats, maximizing an expert-tier skill was trivial. </p><p>[-5981 Mana]</p><p>[+16 Craft]</p><p>It took fifteen minutes for Titania to arrive, a time enough to turn her room into a temporary fortress. Then she arrived, making me abandon those attempts in the interest of more interesting things. </p><p>“Hi-” she started, only to let out a cute little cry when I grabbed her wrist and pulled her on my lap. A cute expression appeared on her face as I leaned, ready to capture her lips, something that would have made people gasp in shock if they had seen her blushing like an innocent young maiden. </p><p>I started kissing her, and she melted under my touch immediately, her domineering attitude nonexistent under my touch. Technically, the aim of the kiss was to transfer mana, but at this point, even for her, it was a poorly constructed excuse for her passion. </p><p>[-319 Mana]</p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>A brief yet heated kiss later, I pulled back, caressing her cheek gently, happy about the kiss as much as I was happy about the experience gain. I had missed the addictive sensation of slowly growing stronger. Even with my suspicions toward the source of my unique system, more power wasn’t something to be discarded. </p><p> “So, how were things?” I asked. </p><p>“Nothing unexpected, just continuous siege,” she answered before launching a summary of the highlights, none of them triggering suspicion. “Anything on your side?” </p><p>“A few,” I answered with a quirked smile even as my hands started to work on her robe, unbuttoning it with a teasing slowness even as I kissed her neck, rather than explaining. </p><p>“Caesar!” she warned petulantly, once again cute enough to irrevocably destroy her scary persona if there was an observer, earning a bright smile from me. “Don’t dawdle.” </p><p>“Oh,” I said even as I unlocked another button before slipping my hand inside, slipping under her blouse to caress her stomach softly, teasing a particularly sensitive spot. “I was under the impression that you enjoyed my dawdling, should I change my approach and make it a more serious meeting.” </p><p>“Caesar…” she repeated, but under the focused attention of my skilled fingers, her earlier teasing tone had long disappeared, replaced by a needy gasp. She said nothing else as my lips on her neck and my fingers under her blouse launched a dedicated assault, and when I made a show of pulling my hand away, she grabbed my wrist, keeping it in place. </p><p>[+300 Experience]</p><p>Even as the main instigator of her transformation, I was finding it hard to believe the things I was getting away with in terms of teasing her, from naughty threesomes to extended foreplays. It was so difficult to believe she was the same person that had scared me witless for so many years. </p><p>It was incredible. </p><p>I chuckled at her silent surrender before starting to explain. “The biggest difference is the arrival of the royal procession. The crown princess arrived with a literal army, either determined to link her fate to our school, or willing to invade.” </p><p>“Yeah, like something like that is possible with the headmistress’s presence,” Titania answered dismissively, utterly convinced with the headmistress’s power. Considering that she had also seen her angelic visage while receiving her own light node, her fascination was understandable. The headmistress displayed an invincible figure, even though I was starting to suspect that it might not exactly reflect reality. It wasn’t that the headmistress was weak, but she was housing the Divine Core inside her body rather than the platform. And considering the lack of ease she was showing in manipulating the divine energy, it significantly reduced her combat capability. </p><p>Unless she was willing to use it as an uncontrollable explosive, destroying both the target and the several miles of the landscape around the target. Not exactly the most useful to defend against a sneak attack unless she wanted to destroy the school along with the princess. </p><p>Still, just because I managed to dupe her about my origins and power didn’t mean that she was actually gullible. If that was the case, she couldn’t have maintained her position for a couple of centuries while a huge spread of enemies targeted her position. Even my trickery was through a unique combination of several outlandish abilities and circumstances, allowing me to escape her cursory examination, while the war prevented her from doing a deeper assessment and possibly alienating the imaginary force behind me. </p><p>Since Titania didn’t seem to know much about the princess, I decided to skip the topic after mentioning that I was helping Oeyne with the spear, giving some details I had discovered, but ultimately underselling it both in terms of the effort it required and the eventual usefulness. I trusted Titania, but not to a point of forgetting she still trusted the headmistress completely. Until I could take the top place without a doubt or turn the headmistress to a trusted ally, revealing every single thing to her was not an option. </p><p>As I explained, I continued to caress her soft skin while slowly stripping her, making it even harder for her to focus on my words. Her robe was first to go, followed by her blouse and corset, allowing me to lean down to capture her nipples, teasing them by alternating kisses and bites. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>This time, she wasn’t bothered by the cessation of my explanation. I slid my hands down to get rid of her long skirt, leaving only her panties to protect her delicious cheeks. I cupped them, and she moaned gently, happy with the treatment she was receiving. </p><p>A moan escaped her mouth as my fingers found the source of her dampness once more, teasing gently. A significant contrast to my lips, which was busy teasing her nipples with a surprising aggressiveness, making her gasp and cry repeatedly, destroying any chance of her asking me to continue with my explanation. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>As I enjoyed treating her, I examined the reaction of the system, in particular, trying to find any hints of weakening that might signal to stop receiving the experience. I wanted to be able to get a good sense of the link between the amount of Divine Spark and the potential experience. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to detect anything. I was starting to suspect that there might not be a link, but even if there was one, it was certainly not happening in my soul space, but at the other end of the mysterious connection that made something like the System possible. </p><p>With that determination, I turned my focus on Titania, ripping off her panties aggressively with a pull, then freed my shaft. But when she tried to impale herself impatiently, I stopped with a smug smile on my lips, just enough to convey without a doubt that I was delaying it intentionally. </p><p>“Do you have any news from the other towns?” I asked. “Any explicit move from the stronger liches?” </p><p>“Nothing yet,” she answered, trying to keep her tone even, trying to counter my assault by feigning a lack of caring, but failing spectacularly. “Still, t-things are getting dangerous,” she stammered, unable to prevent herself from moaning in between words despite the seriousness of the topic. “They are sending more and more monsters to stress the defenses, but they are yet to make a move to capitalize it.” </p><p>“Yeah, the enemy has more cards than we were expecting,” I said. “Only thanks to the new light-magic capabilities that were bestowed by the headmistress that I was able to discover hidden zombie army near the school, positioned for a deadly ambush.”</p><p>Titania froze, displaying a shock that was significantly stronger than a group of undead deserved. After all, that ambush didn’t even get a top-three status, even if we were limiting it to the events we were together. Certainly not when compared to the ambush that almost killed her, or the sudden appearance of the death knights that almost turned our ambush into a grave —or a lack of one, considering the enemy. </p><p>“T-the headmistress bestowed you the power of light!” Titania said, a huge smile blossoming on her face despite her sudden seriousness. “Then, you know her identity as well!” </p><p>“Oh, did I forget to mention that,” I said with a mocking tone, acting like it was deliberate teasing from my end rather than genuinely forgetting to bring it up with everything that was going on… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 31    Experience: 468593 / 496000 </p><p>Strength: 46    Charisma: 58</p><p>Precision: 40    Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40     Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39       Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39      Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6324  / 6324\tMana: 7595  / 7595        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>Expert Craft [75/75]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>The expression of sheer shock on Sarah’s face was spectacular, the impact enhanced further when her fingers stayed wrapped around my shaft as she shuffled on my knees uncomfortably. More interestingly, her fingers continued to stay in place even as her face cycled between several expressions of shock, trying to process the sudden turn of events, but with an eye-catching success, seconds ticking away. </p><p>While her success in keeping her expression concealed wasn’t eye-catching, some other parts of her definitely were. She slid back slightly as if to pull the rest of her body away from my shaft —despite her hand staying around with absolutely no intention of moving— unaware that doing so created a nice distance between our bodies, which gave me a window to peek down her body. The blanket was still wrapped around her shoulders, leaving her body concealed in shadows, all more beautiful in its mystery. </p><p>I said nothing, just dipped my head down to get a lingering view of her body with no effort to hide my attempt, before meeting her eyes with a quirked eyebrow. The blush that resulted was fantastical, almost as beautiful as her first reaction of covering her body. She slid forward again, her chest pressing against mine, her nipples hard, and her legs trapping my shaft in between, her core brushing just enough to signal her growing arousal. </p><p>Naturally, her new position wasn’t a big help to suppress her blush. </p><p>Another big advantage of the situation was the way Carrie collapsed on the side, trying to catch her breath after our latest explosive hug, meaning she wasn’t exactly in the mood of paying close attention to her friend, and the exact nature of her ordeal in my lap. Under different circumstances, I might have felt a touch more concern before making a move on Sarah, as while Carrie and I were explicitly not dating, there was always a chance that she might object me to being with other girls, especially with a friend. </p><p>After Carrie made said friend climb on my lap repeatedly while she was completely naked, she had lost that consideration. </p><p>“You, her,” she whispered into my ear, not wanting Carrie to hear us. Luckily the music video that was playing was loud enough to run interference —not to mention very distracting as it showed a sexy lady giving a muscular man the time of his life while wearing a swimsuit that as well might not exist— leaving Carrie unaware of her friend’s concerns. </p><p>“Yes, I, her,” I whispered back mockingly even as I slipped one hand underneath her, and without a warning, started caressing her wetness. </p><p>Her eyes widened. “What are you doing!” she gasped louder, enough to alert Carrie. </p><p>“Well, the deal was every repeat I slip a hand underneath,” I said cheekily, which earned an absentminded nod from Carrie, unaware of the true significance of what was happening underneath. “So, unless you’re going to retreat and let Carrie win again…” I said. </p><p>Sarah’s fingers around my shaft loosened like she was about to take my offer, which was a completely rational response. However, Carrie reacted just as quickly as I expected, pouncing on the doubtful expression on Sarah’s face, lost in their weird competition. “Yeah, Sarah, are you going to chicken out?” Carrie murmured in a smugness that I would have never imagined coloring her shy lips. The fact that she let the blanket slip down a bit, still high enough to hide her nipples but low enough to create a scandalously deep cleavage in the process made the impact of her words even stronger. </p><p>It seemed that I once again the lengths women could go in a desire to one-up others, especially two nerdy girls who never had to reason to set limits to their behavior, too convinced of their own undesirability —something I was still having trouble to believe as they rubbed their amazing naked bodies against mine. </p><p>“No, I’m not,” Sarah answered, the hesitation in her tone disappeared like a mirage, leaving its place to a renewed determination, the kind that begged me to grab her hips and slam inside her to test the limits of her decisiveness, a desire that I was barely able to keep back. </p><p>Still, there was a limit to my willpower, and I slipped the tip of a finger inside her, enjoying the way her virgin wetness clamped around. Her eyes widened, but made no move to pull back as my finger started to move, teasing her entrance as her expression grew slowly more intense. She didn’t lose much time before her fingers started to move. </p><p>Carrie watched Sarah’s sudden reemergence of confidence, a suspicious glint on her face, realizing that things were developing to a point she wasn’t expecting. Luckily, one of my hands was idle, so I had no problem of slipping that under the blanket as well, slipping inside her wetness. </p><p>She tried to keep her moan hidden, attempting to conceal her reaction. Unfortunately, her attempts to conceal her reaction didn’t work as well as she intended, not when she was already close to the edge after our latest encounter. The way her blanket slipped lower to reveal her heaving chest while she kept her eyes firmly shut, yet not earning even the slightest reaction as her back arched pushed made it even less convincing. </p><p>Not that her failure gave Sarah any new information. After what she had realized about what was going on during Carrie’s turn on my lap, a little direct teasing was nothing. “She’s a bundle of surprises, isn’t she?” I asked</p><p>“She is,” Sarah murmured barely, her attention split between suppressing her own moans and watching the way Carrie’s tits dangled attractively, the sudden increase of desire in her eyes suggested she wasn’t a hundred percent straight. </p><p>Not that I was surprised by that little nugget. Their little game of one-upmanship made much more sense that way, especially toward the latter half. At least, the way she reacted to my fingers left no doubt about her attraction toward me, which was the most important thing in our weird game. </p><p>I just needed to make sure she surrendered to my seduction before I could enjoy the fruits of her confused attraction toward her friend. </p><p> Thankfully, she was positioned perfectly for me to do so. </p><p>I leaned forward, leveraging our closeness by leaving a trail of kisses on her neck, which made her back arch even more intensely than Carrie. The blanket slipped down, pooling around her waist, not only revealing her perky breasts and tight stomach, but also allowing it to slip even lower on Carrie’s side, revealing a hint of where my fingers had been disappearing repeatedly. </p><p>And, unlike the subtle teasing of a finger Sarah was receiving, Carrie was being finger blasted aggressively, two fingers disappearing into her depths repeatedly, every slam dislodging the blanket even more. </p><p>While Sarah enjoyed the show, my lips traveling higher with each kiss. Soon, I was trailing the edge of her chin softly while she lost her ability to keep her moans. Not that it mattered, because Carrie wasn’t too far behind, too lost in the pleasure to care the way the game had devolved into the beginning stages of a much dirtier, yet much more fun, activity. </p><p>Soon, her moans exploded, mixing with Sarah’s tenser moans. That made Sarah’s eyes widen and her moist lips part, realizing that things were soon arriving at the point of no return. The way the desire shone in her eyes suggested that she was dying to let things continue, but her fears were getting stronger. </p><p>I decided to boost her courage in the most interesting way possible. I leaned to capture her lips. I didn’t do it aggressively, nor I did grab her waist, giving her ample time to pull back if that was what she truly desired, but she was unable to resist the desire to feel my touch more intimately. </p><p>Also, her hand around my shaft, steadily caressing up and down, ever slowed down. The kiss was slow, lingering, completely in contrast with the moans Carrie was letting out repeatedly next to us, lost in pleasure as she started to move steadily toward a climax, the sensitivity of her body turning it into sweet torture for her. </p><p>Our kiss lingered on the backdrop of the music Carrie created, with her making absolutely no move to stop. Only when I pulled back, she suddenly realized the position we were in, pulling one arm around her naked breasts. A rather empty gesture, especially when she still kept her other hand around my shaft like it was glued there. “Come on, sweetie. Isn’t it a bit late to be self-conscious about your nakedness, not that you have anything to be self-conscious about? You have an amazing body.”</p><p>The casual compliment brought a deep blush to her face, more intense than the fact she was still being fingered softly by me, or the full nakedness of Carrie after the blanket fell on the floor during our kiss. “It’s too much. I need to dress and go,” she stated. </p><p>“If you prefer so,” I said with a throaty whisper. There was nothing preventing her from standing up, but with gaze dancing between Carrie’s distracted state and her own hand’s rebellion, she made no move to actually pull back. Her arm around her chest was her only attempt to exert her modesty, which, under the circumstances, was worse than useless. It only made her sexier. </p><p>I waited a few seconds to see whether she would follow her request, but seeing that she just waited with her beautifully parted lips, I leaned forward, capturing them in another kiss, this time more intense, almost searing. “I need to go,” she repeated after I pulled for a breather, which was weak even compared to her earlier noncommittal statement.</p><p>It was a weak, trembling statement, more effective as a statement to make me to slip inside her and graduate her into the status of ex-virgin. She said it because it needed to be said, so that later on, she could rationalize the moment in her mind that she was a passive participant. A symbolic gesture of pride if nothing else before she lost herself in the delicious orgy she so clearly wanted.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, I was just bastard enough to make her utter her desires first.  </p><p>“You can always go after resting a bit to catch your breath,” I answered, even as I slipped my fingers deeper into her for a few more quick pumps, which effectively stole her ability to argue back. When I pulled them out and grabbed her waist, her every single hint of hesitancy disappeared, her face invaded by pure desire. She was ready for it... </p><p>Which was why she was surprised when I used the leverage to lift her to leave her sitting on the other end of the coach, her naked body in display perfectly rather than taking the last step. “I shouldn’t push you while you make such a monumental decision,” I said magnanimously. </p><p>It would have been a beautiful gesture if I hadn’t suddenly stood up and pushed Carrie on the couch, laying her on her back, her amazing body fully in the display while I took position between her legs, readily parted. The fact that Carrie’s head was resting on Sarah’s thighs, whose eyes were popped open as she realized what I had in mind while I waited for her to decided. </p><p>“A demonstration might help you make an informed decision,” I said smugly even as I aligned my shaft with Carrie’s entrance, ready to plunge… </p>",
